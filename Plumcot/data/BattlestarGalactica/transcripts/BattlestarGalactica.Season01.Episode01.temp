Apollo And one minute to mark.
Six God has a plan for you, Gaius. He has a plan for everything and everyone. Gaius, are you even listening to me?
Pilot Attention passengers, thirty seconds to mark.
Roslin ...planet, men, women, age. You know what, do this after the jump. Its all right.
Man Yes, Madame President.
Six You have to believe in something.
Baltar I believe in a world I can and do understand. A rational universe, explained through rational means.
Six I love you. Thats not... rational.
Baltar No. No, but... youre not rational. Youre also not really here. Neither am I.
Intercom Madame President, ladies and gentlemen, our thirty three minutes are almost up once again.
Intercom Please prepare for our faster-than-light jump. Thank you.
Roslin Cutting it a little close this time, arent we, Billy?
Billy Pilot says theyve had to reboot the FTL computer again.
Cally Why do the Cylons come every 33 minutes? Why isnt it 34 or 35, or-
Chief Cally.
Cally What?
Chief Shut up.
Gaeta Fifteen seconds.
Dualla Sir, jump 237 underway. Fifty-three ships have jumped. Ten still reporting trouble with their FTL drives, including Colonial One.
Adama Were getting slower.
Tigh Maybe this time...
Gaeta DRADIS contact. Its the Cylons.
Tigh Dammit.
Adama Not this time, maybe the next. Got another idea for the next cycle.
Intercom Ladies and gentlemen, Im afraid the Cylons have appeared again. However, our FTL drive is now working and we will jump momentarily.
Baltar Five days now. There are limits to the human body, the human mind. Tolerances that you cant push beyond. All those are facts. Provable facts. Everyone has their limit.
Apollo All right, you know the drill, people. Scatter formation. Keep them off the civvies and dont stray beyond the recovery line.
Tigh Watch the ammo hoists on the main guns. Youve got a red light right there!
Dualla Weve got a hit on the starboard bow. Away the damage control parties.
Gaeta Base stars launching raiders.
Dualla Colonial One is ready to jump.
Gaeta All civilian ships away, including Colonial One.
Adama Recover fighters. Stand by to jump.
Apollo Combat landings.
Dualla All fighters aboard, sir.
Adama Execute jump.
Gaeta Jump 237 complete.
Dualla All civilian ships present and accounted for, sir.
Tigh Start the clock. And lets start prepping for the next jump.
Gaeta Clock is running. Thirty-three minutes... mark.
Chief Youve got 32 minutes, people.
Six You know youre not safe.
Baltar No, of course not. The Cylons will follow us again, as they have the last two hundred and thirty seven times.
Six Youre right, you know. There are limits. Eventually youll make a mistake.
Baltar And then youll kill us all. Yes. Yes, I know, but... not for another thirty-three minutes.
Adama I want to try something new this time. Divide the fleet into six groups. And then jump- And then jump two more times, and on the fourth jump, we rendezvous at a common set of coordinates.
Tigh Twenty-four jumps to plot. Were breaking our humps calculating one jump every thirty-three minutes.
Adama Get off my jacket.
Tigh Are you eating this?
Adama Not anymore.
Apollo Combat landings expected again to be the order of the day, so... double check your undercarriage before, uh... Look, youve all done this two hundred and thirty seven times. You know what to do. No mistakes, and lets make it to 238. And good luck, and be careful out there.
Pilots Keep us safe. / Remember. / Never forget.
Chief Kay, do me a favor? Tell Captain Apollo he owes me one wing.
Man_offscreen Got it, Chief.
Chief No, Cally, theres three. I know theres three. Can you check it again for me, please?
Cally Yeah.
Chief Could we at least get somebody starting to work? Hey, well sleep when were dead, come on.
Crashdown Boomer. Heard the latest? These Cylons look like us now. Primary fuel?
Boomer Primary fuel, 2893 KRG.
Crashdown A marine told one of the pilots that we marooned some guy back on Ragnar because the XO thought that he was a Cylon.
Boomer You know what? I dont give a frak. Red light in the number four thruster. Go make a visual id, see if its blocked.
Crashdown Right.
Boomer Right.
Chief Little rough on the new ECO, dont you think?
Boomer Hes not my ECO. Hes some refugee from Triton that Ive been saddled with, and I didnt ask you.
Chief Helos gone, Sharon.
Boomer I didnt ask you that either. Sorry.
Guy Colony?
Dualla Sagittaron. How many have you got so-
Guy 5,251 survivors from Sagittaron, last count. We cant transmit photos yet. So if you want, you could leave them here with us, or you can put them on the board outside. Sorry.
Dualla Thanks.
Guy Next? Colony?
Billy Update on the head count, Madame President.
Roslin How did we lose three hundred?
Billy There were some overcounts, a few deaths from wounds, and a few missing during the last attack.
Six Do you want children, Gaius?
Baltar Let me think about that for a minute. No.
Six Procreation is one of Gods commandments.
Baltar Really? Well, Im sure someday, if youre a good Cylon, hell reward you with a lovely little walking toaster of your very own.
Six I want us to have a child, Gaius.
Baltar You cant be serious.
Billy Its Dr. Amarak.
Baltar What was that? Im so sorry for interrupting you while you were speaking... You were just saying?
Billy Uh, I, I was just saying that a Dr. Amarak had requested to speak with the President.
Baltar Dr. Amarak. I see.
Roslin You know him?
Six Have you always been able to multitask like this?
Baltar Yes, yes. I used to work with him at Ministry of Defense.
Billy It says here that, um, hes uncovered important information regarding how the Cylons were able to defeat Colonial defenses.
Six I was always a little worried he was on to us.
Baltar Were you... going to speak to him? Perhaps I should speak to him if youre busy -
Billy Actually, I - I think he wanted to speak directly with the President. Umm. Sounded urgent.
Six Must be very, very important. Maybe something about a certain traitor in the Presidents inner circle?
Roslin Okay, theres not enough time before we jump. I want him onboard first thing during the next cycle. Oh, thank you, doctor.
Six Id say you have a serious problem.
Baltar If I can help -
Roslin Hes a strange one, isnt he?
Billy Cuckoo.
Adama Twelve more cases of nervous exhaustion, that makes sixty-one. Have the doc start pumping them up with stimulants and getting them back on the line. Pilots too. One out of every three, every other cycle.
Tigh Thats gonna come back and bite us in the ass.
Adama Yeah, well, we have too much work and not enough people to do it.
Dualla Fuel report.
Adama I already signed one of these.
Dualla Yes, sir. Sorry, sir. Com traffic to you from the President.
Adama Is this my ten minutes, or this yours?
Tigh Yours. I took ten last time.
Adama Then Ill see you guys in combat.
Dualla I believe it was your ten minutes.
Tigh If the old mans so tired that he cant remember, then its his turn.
Apollo Hey, you, umm, you see the note from the XO?
Starbuck Yeah, I saw it. No way.
Apollo Kara, everyone else-
Starbuck I dont fly with stims. They blunt your reflexes, your reaction time.
Apollo Come on, Kara, give me a break. Just -
Starbuck Why are we arguing about this?
Apollo I have no idea.
Starbuck Neither do I. Youre the CAG - act like one.
Apollo What the hell does that mean?
Starbuck It means that youre still acting like youre everyones best friend. Were not friends; youre the CAG. Be careful out there? Our job isnt to be careful, its to shoot Cylons out of the frakking sky. Good hunting is what you say. And now one of your idiot pilots is acting like a child and refusing to take her pills. So she either says Yes, sir and obeys a direct order, or you smack her in the mouth and you drag her sorry ass down to sick bay, and you make her take those pills.
Apollo Well, Im glad Im not working for you.
Starbuck Youre damn right youre glad.
Apollo So do I have to smack you in the mouth, Lieutenant?
Starbuck No, sir, Ill take my pills. Oh, perfect.
Apollo Carry on.
Starbuck Yes, sir.
Intercom Pilots to ready room, preflight briefing.
Starbuck What?
Gaeta Jump 238 complete.
Tigh Start the clock.
Gaeta 33 minutes... mark.
Dualla All civilian ships present and... Strike my last. One civilian ship missing and unaccounted for, sir.
Tigh Which one?
Dualla The Olympic Carrier. Commercial passenger vessel.
Adama Were they left behind?
Dualla I think I accounted for all civilian ships before we left, sir.
Tigh You think? Did you or didnt you?
Dualla Theyre... theyre not logged in, sir. I think they may have been left behind.
Adama How many people aboard ship?
Dualla One thousand three hundred and forty-five souls, sir.
Tigh Youre telling me we left over 1,300 people to die at the hands of the Cylons?
Gaeta It may not have been her fault, sir. It may have simply been a navigational error and they jumped to the wrong coordinates. Or the Cylons may have destroyed the ship before they jumped -
Tigh Or fifty other things may have happened. The point is, we dont know what the hell *did* happen. Yes, were tired. Yes, theres no relief. Yes, the Cylons keep coming after us, time after time after time. And yes, we are still expected to do our jobs!
Adama We make mistakes, people die. There arent many of us left. Carry on.
Roslin Okay. Next crisis.
Billy Uh, list of calls...
Roslin Yes. But first, wheres the doctor thats supposed to be on board? Whats his name?
Billy Dr. Amarak.
Roslin Yes, Dr. Amarak.
Billy Oh. He was on the Olympic Carrier.
Six God is watching out for you, Gaius.
Baltar The universe is a vast and complex system. Coincidental, serendipitous events are bound to occur; indeed, theyre to be expected. Its part of the pattern, part of the plan.
Six Dr. Amarak posed a threat to you. Now hes gone. Logic says theres a connection.
Baltar A connection, maybe. But not God. There is no God, or gods, singular or plural. There are no large invisible men, or women, in the sky, taking a personal interest in the fortunes of Gaius Baltar.
Six Be careful. That which God gives, He can also take away.
Gaeta Fifteen seconds.
Tigh Maybe this time.
Adama DRADIS.
Gaeta No enemy contacts.
Adama Keep the clock running.
Tigh What dyou think?
Adama I think we wait.
Adama Get me the President.
Roslin Why this time? Was it something that you did?
Adama We had a new plan, but we didnt have time to implement it yet.
Roslin Well, we lost that ship during the last cycle, The Olympic Carrier, did that have something to do with it?
Adama Possibly.
Roslin Are you there?
Adama Yeah, Im here.
Roslin What do we do now, Commander? Ive got people on the verge over here.
Adama Were gonna go to Condition 2. We have to take advantage of this time, let our people get some rest.
Roslin All right. And how long do we, umm, stay at Condition 2?
Adama Until Im satisfied theyre not gonna return. Its a military decision.
Roslin Ye- uh, it is, I know that. Youre right, and I defer to your decision. And Commander? Let your men and women know how grateful I am for the job that they are doing. Please? Thank them for me.
Adama Thank you, Madame President. Thank you. Contact Apollo.
Tigh Attention, set Condition 2 throughout the ship.
Adama -tell him to set up a combat patrol around the fleet. Order his other pilots to land immediately.
Apollo All right, people, you heard the order. Boomer, Starbuck, warm up with me. Well fly the first cap. I want everyone else back on Galactica and in their racks. Three hour rotation.
Starbuck Hey, Apollo, not that Im not honored to be chosen to sit out in my cockpit for the next three hours, but uh-
Apollo But why you?
Starbuck Mmm.
Apollo Take a guess.
Starbuck Cause Im on drugs?
Apollo You got it. This patrol is 100% stimulated.
Crashdown Someone else feel like they have ants crawling behind their frakking eyeballs?
Apollo Hey, how bout you, Boomer? Doc tells me youre holding up better than anybody in the squadron.
Boomer Im tired like everybody else.
Apollo You never seem it.
Starbuck Thats cause shes a Cylon.
Boomer Youre just gonna make me come over there and kick your ass, arent you?
Apollo Okay, okay, lets set up a patrol here, before somebody gets hurt. Follow me.
Starbuck Copy that, Apollo.
Tigh Oh, a couple hours rack time does sound awfully sweet right about now.
Adama You deserve it.
Tigh Truth is, all this has me feeling, well, more alive than I have in years.
Adama You look that way, too. Its good to see you without the cup in your hand.
Tigh Ahh, dont start.
Adama But I know theres a whole lot of people aboard this ship that wish you werent feeling as good as you are.
Tigh Ah, the crew doesnt hate the XO, then hes not doing his job. Besides, gotta make the old man look good.
Adama I always look good.
Tigh Look in a mirror.
Adama Seriously.
Tigh Sir.
Adama Its one thing to push the crew; its another thing to break em.
Gaeta DRADIS contact. Bearing 3-4-8, carrom 1-2-0. One ship. Getting recognition signal. Its the Olympic Carrier, sir.
Tigh Is that confirmed?
Dualla Its confirmed, sir.
Tigh Thank the gods.
Adama Action stations. Put the fleet into Condition 1. I want all Vipers manned and ready, but keep them in the tubes. Mr. Gaeta?
Gaeta Sir?
Adama Restart the clock. 33 minutes.
Tigh I hope youre wrong.
Adama So do I. So do I.
Baltar No, no, no, no, no. Its all wrong. If they were left behind, why didnt the Cylons destroy them? Why are they showing up now?
Six Its Gods punishment for your lack of faith.
Baltar Aww, thats just great, that is. A more logical and useful explanation, please.
Six All right. The Olympic Carriers been infiltrated by Cylon agents. Theyve been tracking the ship all along.
Baltar No. Then that means...
Six Logically, in order for you to survive, the Olympic Carrier should be destroyed.
Boomer Olympic Carrier, Olympic Carrier. This is Raptor 478, call sign Boomer. I have you in visual contact. Please respond on this channel, over.
Pilot Raptor 478, this is the Olympic Carrier. We have you in visual contact. Thank the Lords of Kobol - you dont know how relieved we are to see you.
Boomer Roger that, Olympic Carrier. Can I ask about your whereabouts?
Pilot We had trouble with our FTL drive. Took us almost three hours to fix.
Adama Have Boomer ask him how they escaped the Cylons.
Boomer Olympic Carrier, Boomer. Ive been directed to ask you how you escaped from the Cylons.
Pilot You got me. They were closing in on us when the rest of you were jumping. I thought we were goners and they just broke off. Someone must have been watching out for us.
Boomer Roger that.
Pilot One other thing, Boomer. Ive got a Dr. Amarak on board, he claims he has an urgent matter to discuss with the President. Hes been driving me crazy.
Boomer Olympic Carrier, can you be more specific?
Pilot Im afraid I cant. He says he knows something about a traitor in our midst, and hes unwilling to share more than that.
Baltar Madame President, I strongly recommend that we cut off all wireless communication with that ship right away.
Roslin Why, why?
Baltar Look, forgive me for being rude, but wake up, all right? The only reason the Olympic Carrier is still flying is because the Cylons let them survive. Theyve been tracking that ship all along! Theres probably a Cylon agent aboard right now!
Roslin Calm down! Start over.
Baltar Please, Madame President. Listen to me, I implore you. Cut off radio communication with that ship before they send, via broadcast signal, another computer virus to infect our ship shortly before they blow us all up.
Roslin Commander Adama, are you on the line?
Adama Cut off the speakers, put it through the line. Yes, Madame President, and Im inclined to agree with Dr. Baltar.
Roslin Good, so do I.
Billy Thank the gods youre with us.
Baltar Gods got nothing to do with this.
Dualla Boomer, Galactica. Your orders are to jam all transmissions from the Olympic Carrier. No further voice contact is authorized.
Boomer Roger that, Galactica.
Dualla Boomer, Galactica. Orders are to send the Olympic Carrier the following message by signal light. Message begins: maintain present position, do not, repeat, do not approach the fleet until further notice. Message ends.
Roslin Im getting a bad feeling about where this is headed.
Adama So am I. If the ship poses a threat to us, we have to eliminate that threat.
Starbuck I dont think they got the message, Apollo.
Apollo Yeah, I see it. Boomer, break wireless silence on my authority. Warn them to stop their engines immediately.
Adama I suggest that we evacuate the passengers and destroy the ship.
Roslin That solves the problem if theyre tracking the ship. What if theyre tracking one of the passengers?
Boomer Olympic Carrier, Olympic Carrier, you are ordered to stop your engines immediately. Acknowledge. Apollo, theyre not responding.
Apollo Are you using the same channel?
Boomer Yeah, but suddenly nobodys home.
Apollo Starbuck, fire a burst across their bow.
Starbuck Copy that.
Apollo Boomer. Let Galactica know we have a problem out here.
Dualla Commander. Message from Boomer. The Olympic Carrier is heading directly for us, sir. Theyre refusing all orders to stop.
Boomer Galactica, theyre still not responding and continue to head towards the fleet. Request instructions.
Adama Order the fleet to execute jump 240. Get us between that ship and the fleet.
Gaeta Commander, DRADIS contact. Strike that, multiple DRADIS contacts. Its the Cylons.
Crashdown Cylons, on intercept course. Theyll be in weapons range within... two minutes. Radiological alarm!
Dualla Radiological alarm!
Tigh From where?
Dualla The Olympic Carrier, sir. Theyve got nukes on board.
Adama Madame President. We have to eliminate the Olympic Carrier - immediately.
Roslin There are thirteen hundred people on that ship.
Adama We dont know that. The Cylons may have captured them already.
Baltar Shes not gonna do it. She has to do it!
Six Its not her decision, Gaius.
Baltar No?
Six Its Gods choice. He wants you to repent.
Adama Look, at this point, theres no choice. Its either them or us.
Six Repent of your sins. Accept his true love, and you will be saved.
Baltar I repent. I repent. I... repent.
Roslin Do it.
Boomer We have new orders. We are directed to... destroy the Olympic Carrier, and return to Galactica.
Starbuck Its a civilian ship.
Crashdown Yeah, a civilian ship with nukes. I dont see anybody in there, do you?
Apollo The Cylonsll be here any second. If were gonna do this, then just do it. Starbuck, form up with me. Well make one pass, from the stern.
Starbuck Lee, what if youre wrong? Lee, come on. Lee.
Apollo Okay, fire on my mark.
Starbuck No frakkin way, Lee. Lee! Come on!
Apollo Mark.
Six Are you alive?
Helo Agathon. Karl C. Lieutenant Junior Grade, Colonial Fleet, PK-789-994.
Six I know who you are, Helo. Its all right, Im a friend.
Helo Sharon? What are you doing here? I thought-
Boomer Can you walk?
Helo Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think so. What are you doing here, I thought-
Boomer Lets move, mister.
Apollo Sir.
Adama Son. I gave the order. It was my responsibility.
Apollo I pulled the trigger. Thats mine.
Billy Madame President. Madame President.
Roslin Im sorry, you were saying something.
Billy 24 hours, no Cylons. At least you know it was the right choice.
Roslin The right choice. Im sorry, Billy, I think Id like some time alone, please.
Billy Of course.
Roslin What is it?
Billy Its an update on the head count.
Roslin Subtract how many?
Billy Actually, you can add one. Uh, a baby was born this morning on the Rising Star. A boy.
Roslin A baby.
Billy Yep.
Roslin Thank you.
