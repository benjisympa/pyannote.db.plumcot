cpt_lee_adama And one minute to mark.
number_six God has a plan for you, Gaius. He has a plan for everything and everyone. Gaius, are you even listening to me?
Pilot#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode01 Attention passengers, thirty seconds to mark.
president_laura_roslin ...planet, men, women, age. You know what, do this after the jump. Its all right.
Man#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode01 Yes, Madame President.
number_six You have to believe in something.
dr_gaius_baltar I believe in a world I can and do understand. A rational universe, explained through rational means.
number_six I love you. Thats not... rational.
dr_gaius_baltar No. No, but... youre not rational. Youre also not really here. Neither am I.
Intercom#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode01 Madame President, ladies and gentlemen, our thirty three minutes are almost up once again.
Intercom#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode01 Please prepare for our faster-than-light jump. Thank you.
president_laura_roslin Cutting it a little close this time, arent we, Billy?
billy_keikeya Pilot says theyve had to reboot the FTL computer again.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Why do the Cylons come every 33 minutes? Why isnt it 34 or 35, or-
chief_galen_tyrol Cally.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson What?
chief_galen_tyrol Shut up.
lt_felix_gaeta Fifteen seconds.
officer_anastasia_dualla Sir, jump 237 underway. Fifty-three ships have jumped. Ten still reporting trouble with their FTL drives, including Colonial One.
admiral_william_adama Were getting slower.
colonel_saul_tigh Maybe this time...
lt_felix_gaeta DRADIS contact. Its the Cylons.
colonel_saul_tigh Dammit.
admiral_william_adama Not this time, maybe the next. Got another idea for the next cycle.
Intercom#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode01 Ladies and gentlemen, Im afraid the Cylons have appeared again. However, our FTL drive is now working and we will jump momentarily.
dr_gaius_baltar Five days now. There are limits to the human body, the human mind. Tolerances that you cant push beyond. All those are facts. Provable facts. Everyone has their limit.
cpt_lee_adama All right, you know the drill, people. Scatter formation. Keep them off the civvies and dont stray beyond the recovery line.
colonel_saul_tigh Watch the ammo hoists on the main guns. Youve got a red light right there!
officer_anastasia_dualla Weve got a hit on the starboard bow. Away the damage control parties.
lt_felix_gaeta Base stars launching raiders.
officer_anastasia_dualla Colonial One is ready to jump.
lt_felix_gaeta All civilian ships away, including Colonial One.
admiral_william_adama Recover fighters. Stand by to jump.
cpt_lee_adama Combat landings.
officer_anastasia_dualla All fighters aboard, sir.
admiral_william_adama Execute jump.
lt_felix_gaeta Jump 237 complete.
officer_anastasia_dualla All civilian ships present and accounted for, sir.
colonel_saul_tigh Start the clock. And lets start prepping for the next jump.
lt_felix_gaeta Clock is running. Thirty-three minutes... mark.
chief_galen_tyrol Youve got 32 minutes, people.
number_six You know youre not safe.
dr_gaius_baltar No, of course not. The Cylons will follow us again, as they have the last two hundred and thirty seven times.
number_six Youre right, you know. There are limits. Eventually youll make a mistake.
dr_gaius_baltar And then youll kill us all. Yes. Yes, I know, but... not for another thirty-three minutes.
admiral_william_adama I want to try something new this time. Divide the fleet into six groups. And then jump- And then jump two more times, and on the fourth jump, we rendezvous at a common set of coordinates.
colonel_saul_tigh Twenty-four jumps to plot. Were breaking our humps calculating one jump every thirty-three minutes.
admiral_william_adama Get off my jacket.
colonel_saul_tigh Are you eating this?
admiral_william_adama Not anymore.
cpt_lee_adama Combat landings expected again to be the order of the day, so... double check your undercarriage before, uh... Look, youve all done this two hundred and thirty seven times. You know what to do. No mistakes, and lets make it to 238. And good luck, and be careful out there.
Pilots#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode01 Keep us safe. / Remember. / Never forget.
chief_galen_tyrol Kay, do me a favor? Tell Captain Apollo he owes me one wing.
Man_offscreen#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode01 Got it, Chief.
chief_galen_tyrol No, Cally, theres three. I know theres three. Can you check it again for me, please?
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Yeah.
chief_galen_tyrol Could we at least get somebody starting to work? Hey, well sleep when were dead, come on.
crashdown Boomer. Heard the latest? These Cylons look like us now. Primary fuel?
lt_sharon_valerii Primary fuel, 2893 KRG.
crashdown A marine told one of the pilots that we marooned some guy back on Ragnar because the XO thought that he was a Cylon.
lt_sharon_valerii You know what? I dont give a frak. Red light in the number four thruster. Go make a visual id, see if its blocked.
crashdown Right.
lt_sharon_valerii Right.
chief_galen_tyrol Little rough on the new ECO, dont you think?
lt_sharon_valerii Hes not my ECO. Hes some refugee from Triton that Ive been saddled with, and I didnt ask you.
chief_galen_tyrol Helos gone, Sharon.
lt_sharon_valerii I didnt ask you that either. Sorry.
crewman_specialist_socinus Colony?
officer_anastasia_dualla Sagittaron. How many have you got so-
crewman_specialist_socinus 5,251 survivors from Sagittaron, last count. We cant transmit photos yet. So if you want, you could leave them here with us, or you can put them on the board outside. Sorry.
officer_anastasia_dualla Thanks.
crewman_specialist_socinus Next? Colony?
billy_keikeya Update on the head count, Madame President.
president_laura_roslin How did we lose three hundred?
billy_keikeya There were some overcounts, a few deaths from wounds, and a few missing during the last attack.
number_six Do you want children, Gaius?
dr_gaius_baltar Let me think about that for a minute. No.
number_six Procreation is one of Gods commandments.
dr_gaius_baltar Really? Well, Im sure someday, if youre a good Cylon, hell reward you with a lovely little walking toaster of your very own.
number_six I want us to have a child, Gaius.
dr_gaius_baltar You cant be serious.
billy_keikeya Its Dr. Amarak.
dr_gaius_baltar What was that? Im so sorry for interrupting you while you were speaking... You were just saying?
billy_keikeya Uh, I, I was just saying that a Dr. Amarak had requested to speak with the President.
dr_gaius_baltar Dr. Amarak. I see.
president_laura_roslin You know him?
number_six Have you always been able to multitask like this?
dr_gaius_baltar Yes, yes. I used to work with him at Ministry of Defense.
billy_keikeya It says here that, um, hes uncovered important information regarding how the Cylons were able to defeat Colonial defenses.
number_six I was always a little worried he was on to us.
dr_gaius_baltar Were you... going to speak to him? Perhaps I should speak to him if youre busy -
billy_keikeya Actually, I - I think he wanted to speak directly with the President. Umm. Sounded urgent.
number_six Must be very, very important. Maybe something about a certain traitor in the Presidents inner circle?
president_laura_roslin Okay, theres not enough time before we jump. I want him onboard first thing during the next cycle. Oh, thank you, doctor.
number_six Id say you have a serious problem.
dr_gaius_baltar If I can help -
president_laura_roslin Hes a strange one, isnt he?
billy_keikeya Cuckoo.
admiral_william_adama Twelve more cases of nervous exhaustion, that makes sixty-one. Have the doc start pumping them up with stimulants and getting them back on the line. Pilots too. One out of every three, every other cycle.
colonel_saul_tigh Thats gonna come back and bite us in the ass.
admiral_william_adama Yeah, well, we have too much work and not enough people to do it.
officer_anastasia_dualla Fuel report.
admiral_william_adama I already signed one of these.
officer_anastasia_dualla Yes, sir. Sorry, sir. Com traffic to you from the President.
admiral_william_adama Is this my ten minutes, or this yours?
colonel_saul_tigh Yours. I took ten last time.
admiral_william_adama Then Ill see you guys in combat.
officer_anastasia_dualla I believe it was your ten minutes.
colonel_saul_tigh If the old mans so tired that he cant remember, then its his turn.
cpt_lee_adama Hey, you, umm, you see the note from the XO?
captain_kara_thrace Yeah, I saw it. No way.
cpt_lee_adama Kara, everyone else-
captain_kara_thrace I dont fly with stims. They blunt your reflexes, your reaction time.
cpt_lee_adama Come on, Kara, give me a break. Just -
captain_kara_thrace Why are we arguing about this?
cpt_lee_adama I have no idea.
captain_kara_thrace Neither do I. Youre the CAG - act like one.
cpt_lee_adama What the hell does that mean?
captain_kara_thrace It means that youre still acting like youre everyones best friend. Were not friends; youre the CAG. Be careful out there? Our job isnt to be careful, its to shoot Cylons out of the frakking sky. Good hunting is what you say. And now one of your idiot pilots is acting like a child and refusing to take her pills. So she either says Yes, sir and obeys a direct order, or you smack her in the mouth and you drag her sorry ass down to sick bay, and you make her take those pills.
cpt_lee_adama Well, Im glad Im not working for you.
captain_kara_thrace Youre damn right youre glad.
cpt_lee_adama So do I have to smack you in the mouth, Lieutenant?
captain_kara_thrace No, sir, Ill take my pills. Oh, perfect.
cpt_lee_adama Carry on.
captain_kara_thrace Yes, sir.
Intercom#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode01 Pilots to ready room, preflight briefing.
captain_kara_thrace What?
lt_felix_gaeta Jump 238 complete.
colonel_saul_tigh Start the clock.
lt_felix_gaeta 33 minutes... mark.
officer_anastasia_dualla All civilian ships present and... Strike my last. One civilian ship missing and unaccounted for, sir.
colonel_saul_tigh Which one?
officer_anastasia_dualla The Olympic Carrier. Commercial passenger vessel.
admiral_william_adama Were they left behind?
officer_anastasia_dualla I think I accounted for all civilian ships before we left, sir.
colonel_saul_tigh You think? Did you or didnt you?
officer_anastasia_dualla Theyre... theyre not logged in, sir. I think they may have been left behind.
admiral_william_adama How many people aboard ship?
officer_anastasia_dualla One thousand three hundred and forty-five souls, sir.
colonel_saul_tigh Youre telling me we left over 1,300 people to die at the hands of the Cylons?
lt_felix_gaeta It may not have been her fault, sir. It may have simply been a navigational error and they jumped to the wrong coordinates. Or the Cylons may have destroyed the ship before they jumped -
colonel_saul_tigh Or fifty other things may have happened. The point is, we dont know what the hell *did* happen. Yes, were tired. Yes, theres no relief. Yes, the Cylons keep coming after us, time after time after time. And yes, we are still expected to do our jobs!
admiral_william_adama We make mistakes, people die. There arent many of us left. Carry on.
president_laura_roslin Okay. Next crisis.
billy_keikeya Uh, list of calls...
president_laura_roslin Yes. But first, wheres the doctor thats supposed to be on board? Whats his name?
billy_keikeya Dr. Amarak.
president_laura_roslin Yes, Dr. Amarak.
billy_keikeya Oh. He was on the Olympic Carrier.
number_six God is watching out for you, Gaius.
dr_gaius_baltar The universe is a vast and complex system. Coincidental, serendipitous events are bound to occur; indeed, theyre to be expected. Its part of the pattern, part of the plan.
number_six Dr. Amarak posed a threat to you. Now hes gone. Logic says theres a connection.
dr_gaius_baltar A connection, maybe. But not God. There is no God, or gods, singular or plural. There are no large invisible men, or women, in the sky, taking a personal interest in the fortunes of Gaius Baltar.
number_six Be careful. That which God gives, He can also take away.
lt_felix_gaeta Fifteen seconds.
colonel_saul_tigh Maybe this time.
admiral_william_adama DRADIS.
lt_felix_gaeta No enemy contacts.
admiral_william_adama Keep the clock running.
colonel_saul_tigh What dyou think?
admiral_william_adama I think we wait.
admiral_william_adama Get me the President.
president_laura_roslin Why this time? Was it something that you did?
admiral_william_adama We had a new plan, but we didnt have time to implement it yet.
president_laura_roslin Well, we lost that ship during the last cycle, The Olympic Carrier, did that have something to do with it?
admiral_william_adama Possibly.
president_laura_roslin Are you there?
admiral_william_adama Yeah, Im here.
president_laura_roslin What do we do now, Commander? Ive got people on the verge over here.
admiral_william_adama Were gonna go to Condition 2. We have to take advantage of this time, let our people get some rest.
president_laura_roslin All right. And how long do we, umm, stay at Condition 2?
admiral_william_adama Until Im satisfied theyre not gonna return. Its a military decision.
president_laura_roslin Ye- uh, it is, I know that. Youre right, and I defer to your decision. And Commander? Let your men and women know how grateful I am for the job that they are doing. Please? Thank them for me.
admiral_william_adama Thank you, Madame President. Thank you. Contact Apollo.
colonel_saul_tigh Attention, set Condition 2 throughout the ship.
admiral_william_adama -tell him to set up a combat patrol around the fleet. Order his other pilots to land immediately.
cpt_lee_adama All right, people, you heard the order. Boomer, Starbuck, warm up with me. Well fly the first cap. I want everyone else back on Galactica and in their racks. Three hour rotation.
captain_kara_thrace Hey, Apollo, not that Im not honored to be chosen to sit out in my cockpit for the next three hours, but uh-
cpt_lee_adama But why you?
captain_kara_thrace Mmm.
cpt_lee_adama Take a guess.
captain_kara_thrace Cause Im on drugs?
cpt_lee_adama You got it. This patrol is 100% stimulated.
crashdown Someone else feel like they have ants crawling behind their frakking eyeballs?
cpt_lee_adama Hey, how bout you, Boomer? Doc tells me youre holding up better than anybody in the squadron.
lt_sharon_valerii Im tired like everybody else.
cpt_lee_adama You never seem it.
captain_kara_thrace Thats cause shes a Cylon.
lt_sharon_valerii Youre just gonna make me come over there and kick your ass, arent you?
cpt_lee_adama Okay, okay, lets set up a patrol here, before somebody gets hurt. Follow me.
captain_kara_thrace Copy that, Apollo.
colonel_saul_tigh Oh, a couple hours rack time does sound awfully sweet right about now.
admiral_william_adama You deserve it.
colonel_saul_tigh Truth is, all this has me feeling, well, more alive than I have in years.
admiral_william_adama You look that way, too. Its good to see you without the cup in your hand.
colonel_saul_tigh Ahh, dont start.
admiral_william_adama But I know theres a whole lot of people aboard this ship that wish you werent feeling as good as you are.
colonel_saul_tigh Ah, the crew doesnt hate the XO, then hes not doing his job. Besides, gotta make the old man look good.
admiral_william_adama I always look good.
colonel_saul_tigh Look in a mirror.
admiral_william_adama Seriously.
colonel_saul_tigh Sir.
admiral_william_adama Its one thing to push the crew; its another thing to break em.
lt_felix_gaeta DRADIS contact. Bearing 3-4-8, carrom 1-2-0. One ship. Getting recognition signal. Its the Olympic Carrier, sir.
colonel_saul_tigh Is that confirmed?
officer_anastasia_dualla Its confirmed, sir.
colonel_saul_tigh Thank the gods.
admiral_william_adama Action stations. Put the fleet into Condition 1. I want all Vipers manned and ready, but keep them in the tubes. Mr. Gaeta?
lt_felix_gaeta Sir?
admiral_william_adama Restart the clock. 33 minutes.
colonel_saul_tigh I hope youre wrong.
admiral_william_adama So do I. So do I.
dr_gaius_baltar No, no, no, no, no. Its all wrong. If they were left behind, why didnt the Cylons destroy them? Why are they showing up now?
number_six Its Gods punishment for your lack of faith.
dr_gaius_baltar Aww, thats just great, that is. A more logical and useful explanation, please.
number_six All right. The Olympic Carriers been infiltrated by Cylon agents. Theyve been tracking the ship all along.
dr_gaius_baltar No. Then that means...
number_six Logically, in order for you to survive, the Olympic Carrier should be destroyed.
lt_sharon_valerii Olympic Carrier, Olympic Carrier. This is Raptor 478, call sign Boomer. I have you in visual contact. Please respond on this channel, over.
Pilot#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode01 Raptor 478, this is the Olympic Carrier. We have you in visual contact. Thank the Lords of Kobol - you dont know how relieved we are to see you.
lt_sharon_valerii Roger that, Olympic Carrier. Can I ask about your whereabouts?
Pilot#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode01 We had trouble with our FTL drive. Took us almost three hours to fix.
admiral_william_adama Have Boomer ask him how they escaped the Cylons.
lt_sharon_valerii Olympic Carrier, Boomer. Ive been directed to ask you how you escaped from the Cylons.
Pilot#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode01 You got me. They were closing in on us when the rest of you were jumping. I thought we were goners and they just broke off. Someone must have been watching out for us.
lt_sharon_valerii Roger that.
Pilot#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode01 One other thing, Boomer. Ive got a Dr. Amarak on board, he claims he has an urgent matter to discuss with the President. Hes been driving me crazy.
lt_sharon_valerii Olympic Carrier, can you be more specific?
Pilot#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode01 Im afraid I cant. He says he knows something about a traitor in our midst, and hes unwilling to share more than that.
dr_gaius_baltar Madame President, I strongly recommend that we cut off all wireless communication with that ship right away.
president_laura_roslin Why, why?
dr_gaius_baltar Look, forgive me for being rude, but wake up, all right? The only reason the Olympic Carrier is still flying is because the Cylons let them survive. Theyve been tracking that ship all along! Theres probably a Cylon agent aboard right now!
president_laura_roslin Calm down! Start over.
dr_gaius_baltar Please, Madame President. Listen to me, I implore you. Cut off radio communication with that ship before they send, via broadcast signal, another computer virus to infect our ship shortly before they blow us all up.
president_laura_roslin Commander Adama, are you on the line?
admiral_william_adama Cut off the speakers, put it through the line. Yes, Madame President, and Im inclined to agree with Dr. Baltar.
president_laura_roslin Good, so do I.
billy_keikeya Thank the gods youre with us.
dr_gaius_baltar Gods got nothing to do with this.
officer_anastasia_dualla Boomer, Galactica. Your orders are to jam all transmissions from the Olympic Carrier. No further voice contact is authorized.
lt_sharon_valerii Roger that, Galactica.
officer_anastasia_dualla Boomer, Galactica. Orders are to send the Olympic Carrier the following message by signal light. Message begins: maintain present position, do not, repeat, do not approach the fleet until further notice. Message ends.
president_laura_roslin Im getting a bad feeling about where this is headed.
admiral_william_adama So am I. If the ship poses a threat to us, we have to eliminate that threat.
captain_kara_thrace I dont think they got the message, Apollo.
cpt_lee_adama Yeah, I see it. Boomer, break wireless silence on my authority. Warn them to stop their engines immediately.
admiral_william_adama I suggest that we evacuate the passengers and destroy the ship.
president_laura_roslin That solves the problem if theyre tracking the ship. What if theyre tracking one of the passengers?
lt_sharon_valerii Olympic Carrier, Olympic Carrier, you are ordered to stop your engines immediately. Acknowledge. Apollo, theyre not responding.
cpt_lee_adama Are you using the same channel?
lt_sharon_valerii Yeah, but suddenly nobodys home.
cpt_lee_adama Starbuck, fire a burst across their bow.
captain_kara_thrace Copy that.
cpt_lee_adama Boomer. Let Galactica know we have a problem out here.
officer_anastasia_dualla Commander. Message from Boomer. The Olympic Carrier is heading directly for us, sir. Theyre refusing all orders to stop.
lt_sharon_valerii Galactica, theyre still not responding and continue to head towards the fleet. Request instructions.
admiral_william_adama Order the fleet to execute jump 240. Get us between that ship and the fleet.
lt_felix_gaeta Commander, DRADIS contact. Strike that, multiple DRADIS contacts. Its the Cylons.
crashdown Cylons, on intercept course. Theyll be in weapons range within... two minutes. Radiological alarm!
officer_anastasia_dualla Radiological alarm!
colonel_saul_tigh From where?
officer_anastasia_dualla The Olympic Carrier, sir. Theyve got nukes on board.
admiral_william_adama Madame President. We have to eliminate the Olympic Carrier - immediately.
president_laura_roslin There are thirteen hundred people on that ship.
admiral_william_adama We dont know that. The Cylons may have captured them already.
dr_gaius_baltar Shes not gonna do it. She has to do it!
number_six Its not her decision, Gaius.
dr_gaius_baltar No?
number_six Its Gods choice. He wants you to repent.
admiral_william_adama Look, at this point, theres no choice. Its either them or us.
number_six Repent of your sins. Accept his true love, and you will be saved.
dr_gaius_baltar I repent. I repent. I... repent.
president_laura_roslin Do it.
lt_sharon_valerii We have new orders. We are directed to... destroy the Olympic Carrier, and return to Galactica.
captain_kara_thrace Its a civilian ship.
crashdown Yeah, a civilian ship with nukes. I dont see anybody in there, do you?
cpt_lee_adama The Cylonsll be here any second. If were gonna do this, then just do it. Starbuck, form up with me. Well make one pass, from the stern.
captain_kara_thrace Lee, what if youre wrong? Lee, come on. Lee.
cpt_lee_adama Okay, fire on my mark.
captain_kara_thrace No frakkin way, Lee. Lee! Come on!
cpt_lee_adama Mark.
number_six Are you alive?
captain_karl_agathon Agathon. Karl C. Lieutenant Junior Grade, Colonial Fleet, PK-789-994.
number_six I know who you are, Helo. Its all right, Im a friend.
captain_karl_agathon Sharon? What are you doing here? I thought-
lt_sharon_valerii Can you walk?
captain_karl_agathon Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think so. What are you doing here, I thought-
lt_sharon_valerii Lets move, mister.
cpt_lee_adama Sir.
admiral_william_adama Son. I gave the order. It was my responsibility.
cpt_lee_adama I pulled the trigger. Thats mine.
billy_keikeya Madame President. Madame President.
president_laura_roslin Im sorry, you were saying something.
billy_keikeya 24 hours, no Cylons. At least you know it was the right choice.
president_laura_roslin The right choice. Im sorry, Billy, I think Id like some time alone, please.
billy_keikeya Of course.
president_laura_roslin What is it?
billy_keikeya Its an update on the head count.
president_laura_roslin Subtract how many?
billy_keikeya Actually, you can add one. Uh, a baby was born this morning on the Rising Star. A boy.
president_laura_roslin A baby.
billy_keikeya Yep.
president_laura_roslin Thank you.
