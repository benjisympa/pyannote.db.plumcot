Cally Oh, excuse me, lieutenant?
Boomer Specialist, good evening.
Cally Sir?
Boomer Is something wrong?
Cally No, sir, its just... morning, sir.
Boomer What time is it?
Cally 05:45.
Boomer Oh, my God! Oh, my God, oh, my God... where are the rest of them?
Gaeta Attention, Colonial one will arrive in 30 minutes. Repeat: Colonial one will arrive in 30 minutes.
Tigh Damned, son-of-a-bitch sash... I heard you the first time! one... two... three... four... five... five.
Roslin Do it!
Apollo I cant stop thinking about the Olympic Carrier.
Adama That was three days ago. Its ancient history under these circumstances. Leave the second-guessing to the historians.
Apollo But dont we have a responsibility? I mean, as leaders, dont we have an obligation to question our actions to... I dont know, to make sure the decisions that we make are the right decisions.
Adama We did what we had to do, son. A man takes responsibility for his actions, right or wrong. He accepts the consequences and lives with them. Every day.
Gaeta Colonial one, Galactica. Proceed to Omega docking. Contact C.I.C. when you have hard seal.
Pilot Roger that, Galactica.
Billy Excuse me, Madam President, weve arrived.
Roslin Please dont tell me that we have to go through this every time I step on that ship.
Billy No, maam, but they will always render honors for your arrival, as protocol.
Roslin The military... they do love their protocol.
Billy Well, Im sure that if they knew you didnt like it, theyd be willing to-
Roslin No, no, let Adama sound the trumpets. I think it makes him feel more comfortable. Maybe if he feels comfortable hell be a little easier to deal with.
Billy Thats smart.
Roslin No, its not smart, its politics. I think Im going to get tired of this outfit seeing as I only have three for the rest of my life.
Billy It looks fine.
Roslin Fine?
Billy Uh, it looks... great.
Roslin You dont know anything about women, do you?
Billy Shall we?
Roslin Lets go be presidential.
Roslin I am confident that I speak for the entire fleet when I say Thank you. Without your extraordinary dedication, your tireless effort, your sacrifice, no one of us would be here today. Im proud to serve as your president. Thank you.
Adama Carry on.
Dualla Sir... the Virgon Express is maneuvering alongside. Theyre standing by for unrep.
Adama Thank you very much, D. Officer of the watch, proceed with the unrep.
Gaeta Aye, sir.
Adama If youll step this way...
Roslin Thank you.
Boomer Uh, excuse me, chief, a word with you, please.
Tyrol Yes, sir, just one second. You know what?, just do it. Whats up?
Boomer Got a problem.
Tyrol Well, yes, sir, lieutenant. I believe the navcon modules are ready for inspection.
Dualla Virgon Express, Galactica. We have you in visual contact. Maintain current course and speed.
VE_Pilot Roger that, Galactica. Maintain current course and speed.
Gaeta Power up stabilization gyros 24a through 48c.
Adama Galacticas water recycling system is close to 100% effective. For all intents and purposes, theres not one drop of water thats wasted aboard. We have enough water for several years before replenishing.
Roslin I see.
Adama Many of the ships, like the Virgon Express, were not made for long-term voyages. Theyll have to tank off of us periodically.
Roslin Right.
Tyrol Whatever it is, whatever it is, were gonna take care of it, okay? All right? Now, tell me what happened. Whats going on?
Boomer There are, at this moment, six G-4 detonators missing from the small arms locker on deck 15.
Tigh Commander, were ready to extend the water boom.
Adama Excuse me.
Tigh Hows it going?
Adama Oh, boy... I feel like a...
Adama_&_Tigh Tour guide?
Adama It shows, huh?
Tigh Well, she was a teacher. Probably sees all this as one big educational experience.
Roslin He thinks Im a total idiot, doesnt he?
Apollo What? Uh, no, sir- no.
Roslin Its all right.
Tyrol What are you telling me for? Munitions go missing, you gotta go tell the master-at-arms, right now.
Boomer I know that!
Tyrol Sharon, you cant screw around with stuff like this-
Boomer Im not screwing around, okay? The only reason I didnt tell anybody is because theyre gonna think Im the one who took them!
Billy How are things?
Dualla Things are good.
Billy Good. You look good. I really like your hair.
Dualla My hair?
Billy I dont know anything about women.
Apollo Madam President, if I may? I think you should know that my father... well, this entire ceremony was his idea.
Roslin I know. I think hes enjoying it.
Apollo Well, actually, he hates protocol pomp and all that.
Roslin Really?
Apollo Hes making a gesture, trying to make you feel like the president.
Adama Open valves three and five.
Boomer I took the one detonator from the duffel, replaced it, and then went back to my quarters.
Tyrol Well, ah... you know what?, you know what? Its not your fault. Someones obviously setting you up to take the fall for something, thats what it is. I mean, you wake up somewhere, you dont know how you got there or anything. Youre drugged or manipulated. Or who knows what, something.
Boomer What do we do? Cause if I report whats happened, theyre gonna think Im a Cylon agent.
Tyrol No, theyre not; no, theyre not. No, no, no, why would they think that? Thats crazy.
Boomer People are getting crazy, okay? Youve heard the rumors: Cylons who look like humans, sleeper agents hiding in the fleet.
Gaeta Decompression alarm!
Adama Damage report, Mr. Gaeta.
Gaeta Ruptures in tanks 3, 5, 7, 9...
Tigh Strain on the unrep lines, theyre gonna blow.
Adama Release the lines. Veer away, starboard.
Tigh Every tank on the port side has ruptured. Were venting all our water directly into space.
Tyrol C.I.C., this is D.C. one. Were entering the tank.
Dualla Roger that, D.C. one.
Tyrol Raptor 478, its D.C. one. I have you in my sights.
Boomer Copy that, D.C. one, I have you in sight.
Tyrol Understood.
Boomer Hows it look in there? Can you tell what happened?
Tyrol Lieutenant, dont worry. About my team... I got things under control.
Boomer Copy that, D.C. one. I feel better knowing youre on it. Watch the light, youre off target.
Roslin How much water did we lose?
Gaeta Ten million jps, sir. Almost 60% of total potable water reserves.
Adama Emergency rations. Shut down laundry, showers, anything non-essential, immediately.
Tigh Yes, sir.
Roslin How long will our water supplies last?
Gaeta Well, aboard Galactica, about six days. But, one third of the other ships in the fleet were depending on us for replenishment. If we dont find new supplies, theyll run out of water in two days.
Billy one third, thats 16,000 people.
Roslin Get the names of those ships, tell their captains to go on emergency rations immediately.
Tigh Theres gonna be riots on those ships. Civilians dont like hearing they cant take a bath or wash their clothes or drink more than a thimble a day.
Roslin Thank you for the warning, colonel.
Adama Thatll be all, Mr. Gaeta.
Roslin And one more thing, lieutenant... do you have any theories about what may have caused the accident?
Gaeta There are many theories at this point, madam president.
Roslin Do you have a guess?
Adama I tell my officers not to guess. I prefer to wait until we have fact.
Roslin Indulge me.
Adama Take a guess, Mr. Gaeta.
Gaeta Well, I would have to say the most likely explanation is that the tank was structurally weakened during the Cylon nuclear detonation during the first attack, and that caused it to buckle and rupture. But its too early to say, sir.
Roslin Interesting. Thank you, lieutenant.
Adama Back to the matter at hand. Ive ordered an astronomical survey of nearby star systems for potential water sources- colonel?
Tigh Yes, sir.
Cally Chief, take a look at this.
Tyrol What do you got?
Cally Not sure. It looks like burn marks from an explosive. What do you think?
Tyrol Its, um... tough- tough to tell, its pretty rusted out.
Tigh Optical and x-ray telescopes say there are five systems within our practical jump radius. All five have planetary bodies with the potential for finding water in either a liquid or a frozen state.
Adama Put together a plan for Raptors to scout each star system. I want the first launch at 17:30.
Apollo Yes, sir.
Roslin Colonel, how likely are we to find water on any of these planets?
Tigh Now you want me to guess, I take it?
Adama Colonel...
Tigh Sir... my apologies, Madam President. Difficult day for everyone.
Roslin I understand.
Tigh Most planets are just hunks of rock or balls of gas. The galaxys a pretty barren and desolate place when you get right down to it.
Adama Thank you, colonel.
Roslin The water rationing will make our supply problem worse. Doctor Baltar, please share the results of your study.
Baltar Ive calculated that the rate of consumption regarding basic foodstuffs for the civilian population, this is based on information available to me at the time. The current civilian population of 45,265 will require, at minimum, 82 tons of grain, 85 tons of meat, 119 tons of fruit, 304 tons of vegetables and... 2.5 million jps of water.
Apollo Is that per month?
Baltar Per week.
Helo Well, they found your Raptor.
Caprica_Boomer A few or a lot?
Helo Thats what you get for coming back for me.
Caprica_Boomer Frak!
Helo Yeah.
Caprica_Boomer I was sure they didnt track me coming in.
Helo I know.
Caprica_Boomer I set the jiggers to pulse.
Helo Im sure you did.
Caprica_Boomer I didnt set off any detection grids, any dradis sweeps, pingers...
Helo Never send a pilot to do an E.C.O.s job.
Caprica_Boomer I can do your job.
Helo Well, I guess thats why the toasters are crawling all over our ride outta here. I dont suppose we have a plan B.
Caprica_Boomer Plans B, C, D and E are the same as plan A: get off the planet and get back to the ship, come on.
Helo Wherere we going?
Caprica_Boomer Dont ask questions, just follow your pilot.
Helo Yes, sir.
Tyrol Um, so far weve found five discrete detonation points in the tank and we believe that there may be a sixth. Ive suspected, due to the size of the residual scoring and the burn points, that were dealing with a G-4 type explosive. So I requested a spot-check of all inventory from the master-at-arms, and she indicated to me that there are six detonators missing from a small arms locker in the port flight pod. So, one detonator may still be unaccounted for.
Adama Have the master-at-arms post guards at all small arms lockers, immediately.
Tyrol Its already done, sir. She also has opened an investigation into who may have had access to that locker. However, due to, um, ahem, spotty record-keeping and lax internal security procedures since the attack, she believes that we may never know who took the detonators.
Adama Chief, thank you very much. Everyone except for colonel Tigh, captain Adama and doctor Baltar are now released. Please remember, this briefing is strictly confidential. There is at least one Cylon aboard the Galactica.
Roslin How many people know Cylons look like humans?
Tigh Rumor mills been working overtime. Half the ships talking about it.
Roslin Therell always be rumors and for most people thats all theyll ever be. Im asking how many people actually know.
Tigh The five people in this room, plus three marines.
Roslin Lets keep it that way. once this gets out officially, people will be accusing each other of being Cylons for no reason at all.
Adama I agree. Doctor Baltar, how are we doing on the screenings?
Baltar Screenings?
Roslin Youre supposed to be screening Galactica crew for potential Cylon agents.
#6 Do you remember the first time you lied to a woman? Other than your mother, that is.
Baltar Other than my mother... Sherry Bennett. Fourth grade, on the playground behind the band room. If you show me yours, Ill show you mine. She did. I did... not. You know?, I think I slept with her, actually, many years later, of course.
#6 Of course. Did she turn out to be a beautiful woman?
Baltar As a matter of fact, she did. Very beautiful. But every woman has her beauty, her... feminine charms that are hers and hers alone.
Adama Doctor... doctor?
Baltar Oh, right, the screenings. To tell you the truth, there are significant problems with implementing my Cylon detection method that I used aboard Galactica previously, and basically because Ive run out of natural resources. I need a chemical compound. For example, the precursor test. I need large samples of, um, tetrahydrocycline, which, I dont have to tell you- well, maybe I do have to tell you, but its a highly volatile-
Adama Let me stop you right there. Your intellect, obviously outstrips everyone in this room. But its also obvious by the way that youre talking, in order to make large-scale screenings youre gonna need help. Staff, resources...
Baltar Yes... that is exactly what Im saying. Exactly. Although, um, more staff...
#6 Someone snooping around, watching your every move? Maybe itll be a woman, you could find her secret beauty.
Adama Im going to assign Lieutenant Gaeta to aid you in anything that you might need.
#6 So much for that.
Baltar But, the need for secrecy...
Roslin Clearly, this falls into the absolutely necessary category. Your screening techniques may be critical to our very survival.
#6 Humanitys very survival rests in your hands. Now, if only you had an actual Cylon detector.
Apollo Its a critical mission, Boomer. We already have fights breaking out on some ships over water rations. Theres panic in the air. You dont find water out there and find it soon-
Boomer I understand, captain, well find it.
Apollo Good hunting. Hey, chief.
Tyrol Captain. Lieutenant.
Boomer Chief. I feel like my heads about to explode.
Tyrol Just relax, calm down. Focus on the mission, well take care of everything when you get back.
Boomer What about the investigation?
Tyrol Master-at-arms is running it but dont worry, theres no connection to you. In fact, theres no reason to believe you had anything to do with it at all.
Boomer I didnt.
Tyrol I know.
Boomer I would never do something like that. Never.
Tyrol Sharon, I know.
Boomer Its really important you believe me on this. You do believe me, right?
Tyrol Absolutely. Yes, sir!
Boomer Thank you, chief, carry on.
Adama Please excuse me for keeping you waiting. I was called in the engine room, itll just take a moment.
Roslin Its all right. Some time Id like to borrow a book or two. I only brought one with me on the flight to Galactica.
Adama What book?
Roslin A Murder on Picon. I have a weakness for mysteries.
Adama Ever read Dark Day?
Roslin Edward Prima. I am embarrassed to say its one of those classics Ive never gotten around to reading.
Adama I think youll enjoy it.
Roslin Thank you. It may be a while before I get this back to you.
Adama Its a gift. Never lend books.
Roslin Well, then, thank you for the gift.
Gaeta Im really looking forward to working with you, doctor.
#6 You have a friend!
Baltar As am I, lieutenant.
Gaeta I actually studied genetics in college. In fact, I was planning on going for my graduate degree through the military extension program.
Baltar Wonderful- Is that a card game?
Starbuck And the girl wins again! Another round? Oh, cmon guys, grace under pressure. Theres nothing like losing a little money to take your mind off those 14-hour patrols.
Baltar Mind if I sit in, lieutenant?
Starbuck If youve got the cubits, weve got the chair. Of course, if youve got the anything to drink well take that in lieu of cash.
Baltar Do you know?, I dont have any money. But, um... this jacket must be worth at least 15 cubits. Its made of the finest Caprican cloth, warm in winter, cool in summer, it would look great on you. Anybody else got any civilian clothes theyd be interested in putting on the table? Dont let me keep you.
Roslin Colonel Tigh was right. Rioting broke out on a cruise ship when they reduced water rations. We need to demonstrate an ability to maintain order; we need to do it now.
Adama We dont have the manpower for fleet security.
Roslin You have the only armed, disciplined, force available.
Adama Yeah, but Im not gonna be your policeman.
Roslin Hmm.
Adama Theres a reason we separate military and the police: one fights the enemy of the state, the other serves and protects the people. When the military becomes both, then the enemies of the state tend to become the people.
Roslin I appreciate the complexity of the issue. And I wont let that happen.
Adama Ill send troops to the cruise ship.
Roslin Commander, I wont let that happen.
Boomer Beginning dradis one sweep...
Crashdown Beginning dradis two sweep. So, Im thinking that we should give this lovely little rock of nothing a name. Im thinking... Kimiko. Kimiko? After a lovely little lady in a lovely little city in a lovely little colony that I used to know.
Boomer Whatever...
Baltar Sorry. So sorry, you had such a good run, though. Well, it looks like the bets to me. I will try and muddle through for another round. Im going to, um, raise you five.
Starbuck No guts, no glory, doctor. Ill see your five and, um... raise you 20.
Baltar Its just you and me. Im not used to playing in this kind of high-stakes game.
Starbuck Its not too late to bow out.
Baltar Now, theres an excellent suggestion. And you know what?, before proceeding any further, I should really examine my motivations for doing so. Staying in the game, I run the risk of losing my entire stake and being humiliated in front of all these lovely people.
Starbuck Humiliated is a such a strong word. Embarrassed would be my choice.
Baltar You do play rough, though, dont you?
Starbuck A little too rough for you?
Baltar Well, my hands not that strong, it certainly wouldnt take much to knock me out of the game.
Starbuck Well, thank you, doctor.
Baltar However... without a little risk, life would be so dull, wouldnt it? Call it.
Starbuck Ahem... okay. Ahem, three on a run.
Baltar Full colors, thank you. Thank you all for a most pleasant evening. A parting gift. Hand-rolled from some of the finest fumarello leaf on Caprica. Its also one of the last left in the universe.
Starbuck Thank you.
Baltar My pleasure. Excuse me.
Dualla Raptors have reported back after three star systems so far. All report negative for water, sir.
Tigh I just checked with astrometrics. Theyre coming up with big goose eggs. Theres no star systems within the range of our telescopes with planetary bodies likely to have water on them.
Dualla Sir? Another Raptor just checked in. Negative on water as well.
Adama Whos left?
Dualla Boomer and Crashdown, sir.
Tigh Well, if they come up negative as well... whats our back-up plan?
Adama We jump to another sector, start the search all over again. Needle in a haystack.
Tigh More like a grain of salt on the beach.
Crashdown Still nothing and... more nothing.
Boomer I got nothing here, either.
Crashdown Well, then thats it. Five moons, five zeroes. Im getting thirsty just thinking about it. I hope somebody else has more luck out there.
Boomer Yeah...
Crashdown Whats on your mind, Boomer?
Boomer I dont know. I have this feeling... Lets run that last sweep again.
Crashdown Youre the boss. Beginning sweep 21...
Boomer Beginning sweep 22...
Crashdown Boomer, Im getting nothing again, how about you?
Boomer I- Im having trouble saying it.
Crashdown What do you mean?
Boomer I think I see... Oh, I have positive contact, yeah!
Crashdown What do you mean? Oh... whoo! Yeah! Good call, Boomer! Whoo!
Dualla Sir, dradis just picked up Boomer s Raptor.
Adama Lets hear it.
Crashdown Galactica, Crashdown. Dradis sweeps indicated its time to break out the swim trunks because we found water. Repeat, positive water contact!
Adama Patch me in to the entire fleet.
Dualla Youre connected, sir!
Adama Attention, this is the commander. We have found water. Lets go have a drink.
Crashdown I think theyre pleased, I can hear them screaming in the background.
Helo Sharon, careful with that needle. Were running low on anti-radiation meds. Not really moms home-cooking.
Caprica_Boomer Yeah? Beats eating grass and leaves.
Helo Well be cooking up a fine meal of twigs and moss by the end of week.
Caprica_Boomer You spoil me.
Helo Can I ask you something, Sharon? Whyd you come back for me?
Caprica_Boomer I hate to fly alone.
Helo Cmon... you disobeyed orders, flew back into this hellhole... I mean, not that I dont appreciate it but... why?
Caprica_Boomer I just couldnt leave you behind. Lets leave it at that.
Helo Its Colonial Fleets signal. I- I cant decode it but it means theres someone.
Caprica_Boomer Someone in the military is still somewhere live and kicking here in Caprica. Ha, ha! Yes!
Helo Now all we have to do is find them.
Apollo Way to go, Boomer!
Cally Nice work, sir.
Apollo Nice job, lets get you debriefed.
Boomer Yes, sir. Chief... could you take a look at my ejection pyros? I think theres a short or something.
Tyrol Yeah... Cally-
Boomer No, chief, if you could take a look at it yourself.
Roslin Thank you for coming, captain Apollo. I am aware that you were in charge of the mission that destroyed the Olympic Carrier. I know what a hard thing that is to live with, for all of us. Im struggling with it myself, frankly.
Apollo I cant stop thinking about it. But a man... has to accept responsibility for his actions. He doesnt second-guess the choices he makes, he lives with them, every day.
Roslin You know, I remember when president Adar sent the marines into Aerilon. 15 people died. In public, of course, he had to say all the usual things. He- he was sure of what hed done, made the right choice, stayed the course. But he knew it was a mistake. And he kept the names of the dead in his desk drawer. He said that it was imperative for a leader to remember and learn from the mistakes even if they cant admit to them publicly.
Apollo Do you think we made a mistake?
Roslin I dont know. I dont have a desk drawer yet, but, I have a pocket. I dont want to add to your burdens, however, I have a request: I would like you to be my personal military advisor.
Apollo Im sorry, um... my father is the senior military officer, he should advise you.
Roslin Oh, no, no, no, no... I dont mean to go behind your fathers back. Nothing like that. Im not looking for military advice. Im looking for advice about the military. That little insight about your father making a gesture, it really helped me. It made me reassess the man. I would appreciate more of those insights. And you can keep your day job at the C-A-G.
Apollo Its pronounced CAG.
Roslin Do you see why I need you?
Apollo Um, so, whos going to tell my father?
Roslin Well... ahem. Uh, I was thinking that that would be your first assignment.
Apollo Somehow, I knew you were gonna say that.
Roslin Thank you, Captain.
Boomer Hey... that is just what I needed.
Tyrol Oh, yeah.
Boomer Did you find the detonator?
Tyrol Yes, I did, I gave it to the master-at-arms.
Boomer What?!
Tyrol Hey- no, no, I told her i found it during maintenance. Listen, calm down. This is the best way to go about this, okay? Look, that puts them on the same trail that were on, doesnt raise any suspicion to you. Listen- Hey, hey, hey... trust me on this, Sharon. Im not gonna let anything happen to you, okay?
Boomer Okay, yeah.
Tyrol Dont worry, sweetie.
Boomer I better go.
Tyrol Okay.
