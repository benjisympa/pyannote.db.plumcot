crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Oh, excuse me, lieutenant?
lt_sharon_valerii Specialist, good evening.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Sir?
lt_sharon_valerii Is something wrong?
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson No, sir, its just... morning, sir.
lt_sharon_valerii What time is it?
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson 05:45.
lt_sharon_valerii Oh, my God! Oh, my God, oh, my God... where are the rest of them?
lt_felix_gaeta Attention, Colonial one will arrive in 30 minutes. Repeat: Colonial one will arrive in 30 minutes.
colonel_saul_tigh Damned, son-of-a-bitch sash... I heard you the first time! one... two... three... four... five... five.
president_laura_roslin Do it!
cpt_lee_adama I cant stop thinking about the Olympic Carrier.
admiral_william_adama That was three days ago. Its ancient history under these circumstances. Leave the second-guessing to the historians.
cpt_lee_adama But dont we have a responsibility? I mean, as leaders, dont we have an obligation to question our actions to... I dont know, to make sure the decisions that we make are the right decisions.
admiral_william_adama We did what we had to do, son. A man takes responsibility for his actions, right or wrong. He accepts the consequences and lives with them. Every day.
lt_felix_gaeta Colonial one, Galactica. Proceed to Omega docking. Contact C.I.C. when you have hard seal.
Pilot#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode02 Roger that, Galactica.
billy_keikeya Excuse me, Madam President, weve arrived.
president_laura_roslin Please dont tell me that we have to go through this every time I step on that ship.
billy_keikeya No, maam, but they will always render honors for your arrival, as protocol.
president_laura_roslin The military... they do love their protocol.
billy_keikeya Well, Im sure that if they knew you didnt like it, theyd be willing to-
president_laura_roslin No, no, let Adama sound the trumpets. I think it makes him feel more comfortable. Maybe if he feels comfortable hell be a little easier to deal with.
billy_keikeya Thats smart.
president_laura_roslin No, its not smart, its politics. I think Im going to get tired of this outfit seeing as I only have three for the rest of my life.
billy_keikeya It looks fine.
president_laura_roslin Fine?
billy_keikeya Uh, it looks... great.
president_laura_roslin You dont know anything about women, do you?
billy_keikeya Shall we?
president_laura_roslin Lets go be presidential.
president_laura_roslin I am confident that I speak for the entire fleet when I say Thank you. Without your extraordinary dedication, your tireless effort, your sacrifice, no one of us would be here today. Im proud to serve as your president. Thank you.
admiral_william_adama Carry on.
officer_anastasia_dualla Sir... the Virgon Express is maneuvering alongside. Theyre standing by for unrep.
admiral_william_adama Thank you very much, D. Officer of the watch, proceed with the unrep.
lt_felix_gaeta Aye, sir.
admiral_william_adama If youll step this way...
president_laura_roslin Thank you.
lt_sharon_valerii Uh, excuse me, chief, a word with you, please.
chief_galen_tyrol Yes, sir, just one second. You know what?, just do it. Whats up?
lt_sharon_valerii Got a problem.
chief_galen_tyrol Well, yes, sir, lieutenant. I believe the navcon modules are ready for inspection.
officer_anastasia_dualla Virgon Express, Galactica. We have you in visual contact. Maintain current course and speed.
VE_Pilot#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode02 Roger that, Galactica. Maintain current course and speed.
lt_felix_gaeta Power up stabilization gyros 24a through 48c.
admiral_william_adama Galacticas water recycling system is close to 100% effective. For all intents and purposes, theres not one drop of water thats wasted aboard. We have enough water for several years before replenishing.
president_laura_roslin I see.
admiral_william_adama Many of the ships, like the Virgon Express, were not made for long-term voyages. Theyll have to tank off of us periodically.
president_laura_roslin Right.
chief_galen_tyrol Whatever it is, whatever it is, were gonna take care of it, okay? All right? Now, tell me what happened. Whats going on?
lt_sharon_valerii There are, at this moment, six G-4 detonators missing from the small arms locker on deck 15.
colonel_saul_tigh Commander, were ready to extend the water boom.
admiral_william_adama Excuse me.
colonel_saul_tigh Hows it going?
admiral_william_adama Oh, boy... I feel like a...
Adama_&_Tigh#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode02 Tour guide?
admiral_william_adama It shows, huh?
colonel_saul_tigh Well, she was a teacher. Probably sees all this as one big educational experience.
president_laura_roslin He thinks Im a total idiot, doesnt he?
cpt_lee_adama What? Uh, no, sir- no.
president_laura_roslin Its all right.
chief_galen_tyrol What are you telling me for? Munitions go missing, you gotta go tell the master-at-arms, right now.
lt_sharon_valerii I know that!
chief_galen_tyrol Sharon, you cant screw around with stuff like this-
lt_sharon_valerii Im not screwing around, okay? The only reason I didnt tell anybody is because theyre gonna think Im the one who took them!
billy_keikeya How are things?
officer_anastasia_dualla Things are good.
billy_keikeya Good. You look good. I really like your hair.
officer_anastasia_dualla My hair?
billy_keikeya I dont know anything about women.
cpt_lee_adama Madam President, if I may? I think you should know that my father... well, this entire ceremony was his idea.
president_laura_roslin I know. I think hes enjoying it.
cpt_lee_adama Well, actually, he hates protocol pomp and all that.
president_laura_roslin Really?
cpt_lee_adama Hes making a gesture, trying to make you feel like the president.
admiral_william_adama Open valves three and five.
lt_sharon_valerii I took the one detonator from the duffel, replaced it, and then went back to my quarters.
chief_galen_tyrol Well, ah... you know what?, you know what? Its not your fault. Someones obviously setting you up to take the fall for something, thats what it is. I mean, you wake up somewhere, you dont know how you got there or anything. Youre drugged or manipulated. Or who knows what, something.
lt_sharon_valerii What do we do? Cause if I report whats happened, theyre gonna think Im a Cylon agent.
chief_galen_tyrol No, theyre not; no, theyre not. No, no, no, why would they think that? Thats crazy.
lt_sharon_valerii People are getting crazy, okay? Youve heard the rumors: Cylons who look like humans, sleeper agents hiding in the fleet.
lt_felix_gaeta Decompression alarm!
admiral_william_adama Damage report, Mr. Gaeta.
lt_felix_gaeta Ruptures in tanks 3, 5, 7, 9...
colonel_saul_tigh Strain on the unrep lines, theyre gonna blow.
admiral_william_adama Release the lines. Veer away, starboard.
colonel_saul_tigh Every tank on the port side has ruptured. Were venting all our water directly into space.
chief_galen_tyrol C.I.C., this is D.C. one. Were entering the tank.
officer_anastasia_dualla Roger that, D.C. one.
chief_galen_tyrol Raptor 478, its D.C. one. I have you in my sights.
lt_sharon_valerii Copy that, D.C. one, I have you in sight.
chief_galen_tyrol Understood.
lt_sharon_valerii Hows it look in there? Can you tell what happened?
chief_galen_tyrol Lieutenant, dont worry. About my team... I got things under control.
lt_sharon_valerii Copy that, D.C. one. I feel better knowing youre on it. Watch the light, youre off target.
president_laura_roslin How much water did we lose?
lt_felix_gaeta Ten million jps, sir. Almost 60% of total potable water reserves.
admiral_william_adama Emergency rations. Shut down laundry, showers, anything non-essential, immediately.
colonel_saul_tigh Yes, sir.
president_laura_roslin How long will our water supplies last?
lt_felix_gaeta Well, aboard Galactica, about six days. But, one third of the other ships in the fleet were depending on us for replenishment. If we dont find new supplies, theyll run out of water in two days.
billy_keikeya one third, thats 16,000 people.
president_laura_roslin Get the names of those ships, tell their captains to go on emergency rations immediately.
colonel_saul_tigh Theres gonna be riots on those ships. Civilians dont like hearing they cant take a bath or wash their clothes or drink more than a thimble a day.
president_laura_roslin Thank you for the warning, colonel.
admiral_william_adama Thatll be all, Mr. Gaeta.
president_laura_roslin And one more thing, lieutenant... do you have any theories about what may have caused the accident?
lt_felix_gaeta There are many theories at this point, madam president.
president_laura_roslin Do you have a guess?
admiral_william_adama I tell my officers not to guess. I prefer to wait until we have fact.
president_laura_roslin Indulge me.
admiral_william_adama Take a guess, Mr. Gaeta.
lt_felix_gaeta Well, I would have to say the most likely explanation is that the tank was structurally weakened during the Cylon nuclear detonation during the first attack, and that caused it to buckle and rupture. But its too early to say, sir.
president_laura_roslin Interesting. Thank you, lieutenant.
admiral_william_adama Back to the matter at hand. Ive ordered an astronomical survey of nearby star systems for potential water sources- colonel?
colonel_saul_tigh Yes, sir.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Chief, take a look at this.
chief_galen_tyrol What do you got?
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Not sure. It looks like burn marks from an explosive. What do you think?
chief_galen_tyrol Its, um... tough- tough to tell, its pretty rusted out.
colonel_saul_tigh Optical and x-ray telescopes say there are five systems within our practical jump radius. All five have planetary bodies with the potential for finding water in either a liquid or a frozen state.
admiral_william_adama Put together a plan for Raptors to scout each star system. I want the first launch at 17:30.
cpt_lee_adama Yes, sir.
president_laura_roslin Colonel, how likely are we to find water on any of these planets?
colonel_saul_tigh Now you want me to guess, I take it?
admiral_william_adama Colonel...
colonel_saul_tigh Sir... my apologies, Madam President. Difficult day for everyone.
president_laura_roslin I understand.
colonel_saul_tigh Most planets are just hunks of rock or balls of gas. The galaxys a pretty barren and desolate place when you get right down to it.
admiral_william_adama Thank you, colonel.
president_laura_roslin The water rationing will make our supply problem worse. Doctor Baltar, please share the results of your study.
dr_gaius_baltar Ive calculated that the rate of consumption regarding basic foodstuffs for the civilian population, this is based on information available to me at the time. The current civilian population of 45,265 will require, at minimum, 82 tons of grain, 85 tons of meat, 119 tons of fruit, 304 tons of vegetables and... 2.5 million jps of water.
cpt_lee_adama Is that per month?
dr_gaius_baltar Per week.
captain_karl_agathon Well, they found your Raptor.
lt_sharon_valerii A few or a lot?
captain_karl_agathon Thats what you get for coming back for me.
lt_sharon_valerii Frak!
captain_karl_agathon Yeah.
lt_sharon_valerii I was sure they didnt track me coming in.
captain_karl_agathon I know.
lt_sharon_valerii I set the jiggers to pulse.
captain_karl_agathon Im sure you did.
lt_sharon_valerii I didnt set off any detection grids, any dradis sweeps, pingers...
captain_karl_agathon Never send a pilot to do an E.C.O.s job.
lt_sharon_valerii I can do your job.
captain_karl_agathon Well, I guess thats why the toasters are crawling all over our ride outta here. I dont suppose we have a plan B.
lt_sharon_valerii Plans B, C, D and E are the same as plan A: get off the planet and get back to the ship, come on.
captain_karl_agathon Wherere we going?
lt_sharon_valerii Dont ask questions, just follow your pilot.
captain_karl_agathon Yes, sir.
chief_galen_tyrol Um, so far weve found five discrete detonation points in the tank and we believe that there may be a sixth. Ive suspected, due to the size of the residual scoring and the burn points, that were dealing with a G-4 type explosive. So I requested a spot-check of all inventory from the master-at-arms, and she indicated to me that there are six detonators missing from a small arms locker in the port flight pod. So, one detonator may still be unaccounted for.
admiral_william_adama Have the master-at-arms post guards at all small arms lockers, immediately.
chief_galen_tyrol Its already done, sir. She also has opened an investigation into who may have had access to that locker. However, due to, um, ahem, spotty record-keeping and lax internal security procedures since the attack, she believes that we may never know who took the detonators.
admiral_william_adama Chief, thank you very much. Everyone except for colonel Tigh, captain Adama and doctor Baltar are now released. Please remember, this briefing is strictly confidential. There is at least one Cylon aboard the Galactica.
president_laura_roslin How many people know Cylons look like humans?
colonel_saul_tigh Rumor mills been working overtime. Half the ships talking about it.
president_laura_roslin Therell always be rumors and for most people thats all theyll ever be. Im asking how many people actually know.
colonel_saul_tigh The five people in this room, plus three marines.
president_laura_roslin Lets keep it that way. once this gets out officially, people will be accusing each other of being Cylons for no reason at all.
admiral_william_adama I agree. Doctor Baltar, how are we doing on the screenings?
dr_gaius_baltar Screenings?
president_laura_roslin Youre supposed to be screening Galactica crew for potential Cylon agents.
number_six Do you remember the first time you lied to a woman? Other than your mother, that is.
dr_gaius_baltar Other than my mother... Sherry Bennett. Fourth grade, on the playground behind the band room. If you show me yours, Ill show you mine. She did. I did... not. You know?, I think I slept with her, actually, many years later, of course.
number_six Of course. Did she turn out to be a beautiful woman?
dr_gaius_baltar As a matter of fact, she did. Very beautiful. But every woman has her beauty, her... feminine charms that are hers and hers alone.
admiral_william_adama Doctor... doctor?
dr_gaius_baltar Oh, right, the screenings. To tell you the truth, there are significant problems with implementing my Cylon detection method that I used aboard Galactica previously, and basically because Ive run out of natural resources. I need a chemical compound. For example, the precursor test. I need large samples of, um, tetrahydrocycline, which, I dont have to tell you- well, maybe I do have to tell you, but its a highly volatile-
admiral_william_adama Let me stop you right there. Your intellect, obviously outstrips everyone in this room. But its also obvious by the way that youre talking, in order to make large-scale screenings youre gonna need help. Staff, resources...
dr_gaius_baltar Yes... that is exactly what Im saying. Exactly. Although, um, more staff...
number_six Someone snooping around, watching your every move? Maybe itll be a woman, you could find her secret beauty.
admiral_william_adama Im going to assign Lieutenant Gaeta to aid you in anything that you might need.
number_six So much for that.
dr_gaius_baltar But, the need for secrecy...
president_laura_roslin Clearly, this falls into the absolutely necessary category. Your screening techniques may be critical to our very survival.
number_six Humanitys very survival rests in your hands. Now, if only you had an actual Cylon detector.
cpt_lee_adama Its a critical mission, Boomer. We already have fights breaking out on some ships over water rations. Theres panic in the air. You dont find water out there and find it soon-
lt_sharon_valerii I understand, captain, well find it.
cpt_lee_adama Good hunting. Hey, chief.
chief_galen_tyrol Captain. Lieutenant.
lt_sharon_valerii Chief. I feel like my heads about to explode.
chief_galen_tyrol Just relax, calm down. Focus on the mission, well take care of everything when you get back.
lt_sharon_valerii What about the investigation?
chief_galen_tyrol Master-at-arms is running it but dont worry, theres no connection to you. In fact, theres no reason to believe you had anything to do with it at all.
lt_sharon_valerii I didnt.
chief_galen_tyrol I know.
lt_sharon_valerii I would never do something like that. Never.
chief_galen_tyrol Sharon, I know.
lt_sharon_valerii Its really important you believe me on this. You do believe me, right?
chief_galen_tyrol Absolutely. Yes, sir!
lt_sharon_valerii Thank you, chief, carry on.
admiral_william_adama Please excuse me for keeping you waiting. I was called in the engine room, itll just take a moment.
president_laura_roslin Its all right. Some time Id like to borrow a book or two. I only brought one with me on the flight to Galactica.
admiral_william_adama What book?
president_laura_roslin A Murder on Picon. I have a weakness for mysteries.
admiral_william_adama Ever read Dark Day?
president_laura_roslin Edward Prima. I am embarrassed to say its one of those classics Ive never gotten around to reading.
admiral_william_adama I think youll enjoy it.
president_laura_roslin Thank you. It may be a while before I get this back to you.
admiral_william_adama Its a gift. Never lend books.
president_laura_roslin Well, then, thank you for the gift.
lt_felix_gaeta Im really looking forward to working with you, doctor.
number_six You have a friend!
dr_gaius_baltar As am I, lieutenant.
lt_felix_gaeta I actually studied genetics in college. In fact, I was planning on going for my graduate degree through the military extension program.
dr_gaius_baltar Wonderful- Is that a card game?
captain_kara_thrace And the girl wins again! Another round? Oh, cmon guys, grace under pressure. Theres nothing like losing a little money to take your mind off those 14-hour patrols.
dr_gaius_baltar Mind if I sit in, lieutenant?
captain_kara_thrace If youve got the cubits, weve got the chair. Of course, if youve got the anything to drink well take that in lieu of cash.
dr_gaius_baltar Do you know?, I dont have any money. But, um... this jacket must be worth at least 15 cubits. Its made of the finest Caprican cloth, warm in winter, cool in summer, it would look great on you. Anybody else got any civilian clothes theyd be interested in putting on the table? Dont let me keep you.
president_laura_roslin Colonel Tigh was right. Rioting broke out on a cruise ship when they reduced water rations. We need to demonstrate an ability to maintain order; we need to do it now.
admiral_william_adama We dont have the manpower for fleet security.
president_laura_roslin You have the only armed, disciplined, force available.
admiral_william_adama Yeah, but Im not gonna be your policeman.
president_laura_roslin Hmm.
admiral_william_adama Theres a reason we separate military and the police: one fights the enemy of the state, the other serves and protects the people. When the military becomes both, then the enemies of the state tend to become the people.
president_laura_roslin I appreciate the complexity of the issue. And I wont let that happen.
admiral_william_adama Ill send troops to the cruise ship.
president_laura_roslin Commander, I wont let that happen.
lt_sharon_valerii Beginning dradis one sweep...
crashdown Beginning dradis two sweep. So, Im thinking that we should give this lovely little rock of nothing a name. Im thinking... Kimiko. Kimiko? After a lovely little lady in a lovely little city in a lovely little colony that I used to know.
lt_sharon_valerii Whatever...
dr_gaius_baltar Sorry. So sorry, you had such a good run, though. Well, it looks like the bets to me. I will try and muddle through for another round. Im going to, um, raise you five.
captain_kara_thrace No guts, no glory, doctor. Ill see your five and, um... raise you 20.
dr_gaius_baltar Its just you and me. Im not used to playing in this kind of high-stakes game.
captain_kara_thrace Its not too late to bow out.
dr_gaius_baltar Now, theres an excellent suggestion. And you know what?, before proceeding any further, I should really examine my motivations for doing so. Staying in the game, I run the risk of losing my entire stake and being humiliated in front of all these lovely people.
captain_kara_thrace Humiliated is a such a strong word. Embarrassed would be my choice.
dr_gaius_baltar You do play rough, though, dont you?
captain_kara_thrace A little too rough for you?
dr_gaius_baltar Well, my hands not that strong, it certainly wouldnt take much to knock me out of the game.
captain_kara_thrace Well, thank you, doctor.
dr_gaius_baltar However... without a little risk, life would be so dull, wouldnt it? Call it.
captain_kara_thrace Ahem... okay. Ahem, three on a run.
dr_gaius_baltar Full colors, thank you. Thank you all for a most pleasant evening. A parting gift. Hand-rolled from some of the finest fumarello leaf on Caprica. Its also one of the last left in the universe.
captain_kara_thrace Thank you.
dr_gaius_baltar My pleasure. Excuse me.
officer_anastasia_dualla Raptors have reported back after three star systems so far. All report negative for water, sir.
colonel_saul_tigh I just checked with astrometrics. Theyre coming up with big goose eggs. Theres no star systems within the range of our telescopes with planetary bodies likely to have water on them.
officer_anastasia_dualla Sir? Another Raptor just checked in. Negative on water as well.
admiral_william_adama Whos left?
officer_anastasia_dualla Boomer and Crashdown, sir.
colonel_saul_tigh Well, if they come up negative as well... whats our back-up plan?
admiral_william_adama We jump to another sector, start the search all over again. Needle in a haystack.
colonel_saul_tigh More like a grain of salt on the beach.
crashdown Still nothing and... more nothing.
lt_sharon_valerii I got nothing here, either.
crashdown Well, then thats it. Five moons, five zeroes. Im getting thirsty just thinking about it. I hope somebody else has more luck out there.
lt_sharon_valerii Yeah...
crashdown Whats on your mind, Boomer?
lt_sharon_valerii I dont know. I have this feeling... Lets run that last sweep again.
crashdown Youre the boss. Beginning sweep 21...
lt_sharon_valerii Beginning sweep 22...
crashdown Boomer, Im getting nothing again, how about you?
lt_sharon_valerii I- Im having trouble saying it.
crashdown What do you mean?
lt_sharon_valerii I think I see... Oh, I have positive contact, yeah!
crashdown What do you mean? Oh... whoo! Yeah! Good call, Boomer! Whoo!
officer_anastasia_dualla Sir, dradis just picked up Boomer s Raptor.
admiral_william_adama Lets hear it.
crashdown Galactica, Crashdown. Dradis sweeps indicated its time to break out the swim trunks because we found water. Repeat, positive water contact!
admiral_william_adama Patch me in to the entire fleet.
officer_anastasia_dualla Youre connected, sir!
admiral_william_adama Attention, this is the commander. We have found water. Lets go have a drink.
crashdown I think theyre pleased, I can hear them screaming in the background.
captain_karl_agathon Sharon, careful with that needle. Were running low on anti-radiation meds. Not really moms home-cooking.
lt_sharon_valerii Yeah? Beats eating grass and leaves.
captain_karl_agathon Well be cooking up a fine meal of twigs and moss by the end of week.
lt_sharon_valerii You spoil me.
captain_karl_agathon Can I ask you something, Sharon? Whyd you come back for me?
lt_sharon_valerii I hate to fly alone.
captain_karl_agathon Cmon... you disobeyed orders, flew back into this hellhole... I mean, not that I dont appreciate it but... why?
lt_sharon_valerii I just couldnt leave you behind. Lets leave it at that.
captain_karl_agathon Its Colonial Fleets signal. I- I cant decode it but it means theres someone.
lt_sharon_valerii Someone in the military is still somewhere live and kicking here in Caprica. Ha, ha! Yes!
captain_karl_agathon Now all we have to do is find them.
cpt_lee_adama Way to go, Boomer!
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Nice work, sir.
cpt_lee_adama Nice job, lets get you debriefed.
lt_sharon_valerii Yes, sir. Chief... could you take a look at my ejection pyros? I think theres a short or something.
chief_galen_tyrol Yeah... Cally-
lt_sharon_valerii No, chief, if you could take a look at it yourself.
president_laura_roslin Thank you for coming, captain Apollo. I am aware that you were in charge of the mission that destroyed the Olympic Carrier. I know what a hard thing that is to live with, for all of us. Im struggling with it myself, frankly.
cpt_lee_adama I cant stop thinking about it. But a man... has to accept responsibility for his actions. He doesnt second-guess the choices he makes, he lives with them, every day.
president_laura_roslin You know, I remember when president Adar sent the marines into Aerilon. 15 people died. In public, of course, he had to say all the usual things. He- he was sure of what hed done, made the right choice, stayed the course. But he knew it was a mistake. And he kept the names of the dead in his desk drawer. He said that it was imperative for a leader to remember and learn from the mistakes even if they cant admit to them publicly.
cpt_lee_adama Do you think we made a mistake?
president_laura_roslin I dont know. I dont have a desk drawer yet, but, I have a pocket. I dont want to add to your burdens, however, I have a request: I would like you to be my personal military advisor.
cpt_lee_adama Im sorry, um... my father is the senior military officer, he should advise you.
president_laura_roslin Oh, no, no, no, no... I dont mean to go behind your fathers back. Nothing like that. Im not looking for military advice. Im looking for advice about the military. That little insight about your father making a gesture, it really helped me. It made me reassess the man. I would appreciate more of those insights. And you can keep your day job at the C-A-G.
cpt_lee_adama Its pronounced CAG.
president_laura_roslin Do you see why I need you?
cpt_lee_adama Um, so, whos going to tell my father?
president_laura_roslin Well... ahem. Uh, I was thinking that that would be your first assignment.
cpt_lee_adama Somehow, I knew you were gonna say that.
president_laura_roslin Thank you, Captain.
lt_sharon_valerii Hey... that is just what I needed.
chief_galen_tyrol Oh, yeah.
lt_sharon_valerii Did you find the detonator?
chief_galen_tyrol Yes, I did, I gave it to the master-at-arms.
lt_sharon_valerii What?!
chief_galen_tyrol Hey- no, no, I told her i found it during maintenance. Listen, calm down. This is the best way to go about this, okay? Look, that puts them on the same trail that were on, doesnt raise any suspicion to you. Listen- Hey, hey, hey... trust me on this, Sharon. Im not gonna let anything happen to you, okay?
lt_sharon_valerii Okay, yeah.
chief_galen_tyrol Dont worry, sweetie.
lt_sharon_valerii I better go.
chief_galen_tyrol Okay.
