Gaeta_on_PA Reveille, reveille, morning stations aboard Battlestar Galactica, all hands report to your stations.
Tigh So, what do we have?
Tyrol Good news, Colonel. We scouted the ice moon, found an entire subsurface ocean. Ive got reports and video for you, sir.
Tigh Mmm, not exactly Caprica beach down there, huh, chief?
Tyrol No, sir. Weve registered temperatures 180 and below... mmm... Venting of methane and CO2. Its gonna be a bitch to work down there, sir.
Tigh Cheer up, you know how lucky we are we found this ugly rock? Water riots breakin out all over the fleet. Civilians, whiny, civi crybabies, cant stand less than a hot shower every day.
Tyrol Yes, sir.
Tigh Even Galacticas down to 10,000 jps of water. Ever see a man die of dehydration, chief?
Tyrol No, sir.
Tigh Well, lets hope you never do, it isnt pretty. So... where were we?
Cally We drilled 23 core samples...
Tigh 13% sodium chloride, what the hell? We cant drink salt water!
Tyrol No, sir, thats why I had Cally test the ice.
Tigh Oh, ho, well, there you go, pure water. A couple of lemons, we could make lemonade. Oh-hoo-hoo-hoo.
Tyrol Uh, yes, sir. We will have to melt the ice before we transport it up to the ship.
Tigh Whats that gonna take?
Socinus High capacity heater expansion tanks, D-25 plasma torches, myrex hoses, centrifugal pumps...
Tigh Sounds like a lot of manpower.
Tyrol Ideally, a thousand men, sir.
Tigh A thousand men. And where are they gonna come from?
Roslin Slave labor.
Adama They are criminals and theyve been sentenced to hard labor, and this is very hard labor, not to mention physically dangerous. This is not for civilians, but...
Apollo Their ship wasnt designed for long-term incarceration. These men have been stuck in cramped cells for weeks, now. They might even prefer to get out, do something, even if it is dangerous.
Roslin If they volunteer; but these men are not slaves, and I will not have them treated as such.
Apollo No... we could offer incentives. Points towards earning freedom.
Adama Excuse me? You wanna start releasing hardened criminals into the fleet?
Apollo Sir, these men were on their way to Caprica for parole hearings, which at least implies they may be ready for release.
Roslin Make it happen, Captain.
Apollo Yes, sir.
Roslin Billy, to address Commander Adamas concerns, Id like you to go along and set up some sort of screening procedure to weed out the hardened criminals.
Billy Yes, maam.
Adama I would like to have a representative from Galactica, who will report directly to me about security issues.
Billy How bout D? Uh, second class petty officer Dualla–
Adama I know who she is.
Billy Im sure shes conversant with the technical details–
Adama Shell be fine. But I think we should send someone from ground crew. Ill make sure that all the men that are chosen know how to handle the equipment.
Roslin Agreed.
Adama If thats all, I have to get to the C.I.C. Excuse me.
Billy Uh, madam President... the doctor.
Roslin Excuse me?
Billy The doctor?
Roslin Oh... Commander? Do you have a ships doctor aboard Galactica?
Adama Major Connell. Is there something wrong?
Roslin No, nothing urgent. Allergies.
Adama Yes, well, hes out on the fleet, checking medical conditions. Ill tell him that you want to see him.
Roslin Thanks.
Roslin Petty officer Dualla, conversant in technical details.
Billy Thinking entirely of the mission.
Roslin Uh-huh.
Adama Something on your mind, Captain?
Apollo I just thought maybe you had something you wanted to say.
Adama I have nothing to say to the personal representative of the President.
Apollo Im still Galacticas lead pilot.
Adama Well, I have nothing to say to him either. Every man has to decide for themselves which side theyre on.
Apollo I didnt know we were pickin sides.
Adama Thats why you havent picked one yet.
Wilkins Im a bus driver, not a warden.
Apollo How many total?
Wilkins 1,500. They dont give me their files or their names. Hell, theyre just numbers.
Apollo Thanks, Wilkins.
Wilkins Mmm. All right... theyre all yours.
Apollo Im Captain Lee Adama, personal representative of the President. Were in a crisis. Thousands of us are on the verge of dying from dehydration. Now, the good news is we have found water. The bad news is its located on a moon with harsh environmental conditions. We need 1,000 able-bodied men to help us get that water. President Roslin feels that you represent our best chance. She also recognizes that you are not slaves. Any man who volunteers to help us during this emergency will earn freedom points, which can be applied toward earning his release. Were offering you a chance for a new beginning. Whoevers interested, please, just step out of your cell.
Zarek Thank you for your offer. We respectfully decline.
Man Zarek!
Billy Oh, my gods, thats... thats Tom Zarek.
Dualla The terrorist?
Man Zarek!
Men Zarek, Zarek! Zarek, Zarek! Zarek, Zarek! Zarek, Zarek! Zarek, Zarek! Zarek, Zarek! Zarek, Zarek! Zarek, Zarek! Zarek, Zarek! Zarek, Zarek! Zarek, Zarek! Zarek, Zarek! Zarek, Zarek!
Wilkins So who the hell is Tom Zarek?
Billy Hes a freedom fighter. Hes a- hes a prisoner of conscience.
Dualla Hes a butcher.
Billy His colony was exploited by the other 11 for centuries. His people were marginalized, brutalized...
Dualla Im from Sagittaron, and that man does not speak for all of us. He blew up a government building, and there is no excuse for that.
Cally Captain, Ive been watching the clock, and if were not gonna get any help, we should move on.
Apollo Zareks got the prisoners united. Lets go through Zarek.
Helo Hello?! Anybody out there?! Anybody wanna help two stranded pilots? Thats what I hate about big cities: no one will help you.
Caprica_Boomer No more shouting, youre making me nervous.
Helo Feel like Im in a movie.
Caprica_Boomer At least it stopped raining.
Helo For now.
Caprica_Boomer Where is everyone?
Helo Somewhere dead... in their beds, at their desks... the ones who werent killed already probably ran into the hills. Wont do any good. I guess Im getting a little...
Caprica_Boomer Depressing? Morbid?
Helo Sorry. Been here longer than you. Wish I could say it gets easier.
Caprica_Boomer Theres more.
Helo Boomer, you might not wanna... Frakkin rats... lets go. Hey... hey, come on. Lets just find a hospital, score some anti-radiation meds. Okay? Weve only got two days worth left. Sharon? Weve made it this far, were gonna make it all the way.
Caprica_Boomer Right.
Helo Damn straight, all the way. Were doin good, real good. Okay, someone must be watching out for us.
Caprica_Doral Shes good.
Caprica_#6 So far.
Caprica_Doral Jealous?
Caprica_#6 Its what makes me so sad.
Caprica_Doral They would have destroyed themselves, anyway. They deserve what they got.
Caprica_#6 Were the children of humanity; that makes them our parents, in a sense.
Caprica_Doral True. But parents have to die. Its the only way children come into their own.
Apollo No, thats not necessary. Id like to talk to you.
Zarek Guard... Prisoner 893893 requests permission to speak with this visitor.
Guard Granted.
Zarek Im not allowed to speak unless asked a direct question. You didnt ask me a direct question. Youve never been in a prison before, have you, Captain?
Apollo No.
Zarek Youre fortunate. May I sit down?
Apollo Yes, of course. We need these men of yours to help us.
Zarek Theyre not my men, they belong to you. I belong to you, you own us. Youre the master, were the slaves.
Apollo Youre clearly a man of principle. I respect that.
Zarek Really?
Apollo The things youve stood for over the years, the book you wrote...
Zarek The book that had to be smuggled out of labor camp because stumps arent allowed freedom of expression?
Apollo I read it, in college. Thought it was radical, challenging. It made me question some things Id accepted before without thinking.
Zarek Nice to hear Im a big hit on campus.
Apollo You arent, the book was banned. I read it, anyway. The point is: I understand where youre coming from, but I dont think you understand how critical the situation is out there. People are gonna start dying.
Man Hey, Stark. Its time for your break.
Billy How can you say that?
Dualla Because its the truth. Zarek and the S.F.M., they dont care about justice...
Billy These people... your people have been exploited!
Dualla You cannot tell me about my people.
Billy Im not telling you about your people...!
Man Excuse me.
Apollo All I want, the President wants, is to offer you a chance to earn your freedom.
Zarek Now, youve said the truth: freedom is earned. Stay where you are, Captain. Itll all be over soon.
Guard Weve got the guards and the crew in separate cells in block seven. Mason is looking after the hostages.
Zarek Nice job.
Man Everythings under control. The men are organizing exactly as planned.
Zarek I knew I could count on you.
Dualla Stay frosty, there, Billy. Everythings gonna be all right.
Billy I dont know about that.
Cally They dont wanna hurt us. That wont get them what they want.
Billy Which is what?
Baltar Frak... frak... Lieutenant Thrace, good to see you.
Starbuck Um, good to see you too!
Baltar Really?
Starbuck No!
#6 Oh...
Baltar I wonder if shes a real blonde.
#6 I doubt it.
Starbuck Now, one of you has been coming in a little hot lately, a little too hot. A little, um, oh, I dont know, hes burning up the deck with his skids because he just cant pull back on the throttle hot. Now, who is this speed demon, my prince?
Boxy Flattop, sir.
Starbuck Flattop. You got a need for speed, do ya? Just cant wait to get back to the big G in the lovin embrace of your fellow pilots?
Starbuck Or maybe you have a hot date with your right hand.
Flattop Hey, it never gets a headache.
Starbuck Tell you what, Flattop: you come in too hot today, you may have to start using your left.
Starbuck All right, youve been fun. Youve been a great audience. Dismissed.
Tigh Theres no smoking in the Ready Room.
Starbuck My room, my rules, sir.
Tigh Wheres your mommy?
Boxy Dead, wheres yours?
Tigh Im lookin for Boomer.
Boxy Its 14:00, Boomer s in the Tool Room.
Tigh A pilot blows his landings and you make a joke out of it?!
Starbuck Screaming at people doesnt always get the best results, sir. I learned that at officer candidate school.
Tigh You are right on the edge, Thrace. Careful you dont fall off.
Starbuck Speaking of falling off... glad to see you found a way to quench your thirst.
Apollo They wont negotiate while youre holding hostages.
Zarek I dont wanna negotiate.
Apollo Then, what do you want?
Zarek To be treated like men, not animals. Finally have somethin to bargain with.
Apollo So what happens now?
Zarek Were gonna talk.
Apollo What about?
Zarek Your father.
Baltar Is this a Montclair original?
Adama Yes.
Baltar Fantastic.
Adama Would you like some water?
Baltar Uh, yes, thank you. Yeah, Im not a collector, myself, but I... I am familiar with his work. And, may I say, you really do have an excellent eye for art.
Adama Thank you. Wheres my Cylon detector, doctor?
Baltar Oh, that. Yes, its taking longer than expected. Unfortunately.
Adama Whats the hangup?
#6 Its not working this time, Gaius. He can see right through you.
Baltar Well, there are a number of obstacles, none of them insurmountable, of course, but they do tend to slow us down. For a start, the, uh- well, the lack of proper facilities. The water shortage, of course, the water shortage, not to mention...
Adama Cut the BS. You said you had a way of detecting human from Cylon. Do you or dont you?
Baltar I don’t.
#6 What?
Baltar I dont think that Im the man for this job. Im not cut out for this kind of work.
#6 You have to do this.
Baltar Why do I keep putting it off? Its my subconscious. Its my subconscious telling me- telling me that Im not the man for this job, please.
#6 Listen to me. If you dont tell him what he wants to hear, hes going to find you out, and when he does, theyre going to tear your head off and throw your body out of an airlock!
Baltar Woo! Pardon me. I, uh- I havent had much sleep recently, so...
Adama Unfortunately, doctor, for both of us, youre the last man we have. So whats the game plan, Doc?
#6 This is what you say: Commander, the truth is, there is one way. Say it!
Baltar Commander, the truth is... there is one way.
#6 “I didnt want to have to ask you for this...”
Baltar I didnt want to have to ask you for this...
#6 “But what I really need...”
Baltar But what I really need to complete the project...
#6 “Is a nuclear warhead.”
Baltar Is a nuclear... warhead.
Zarek That’s how you got to be the personal representative of the President? Because of your father?
Apollo Hardly.
Zarek So they dont get along, Adama and Roslin.
Apollo They have their differences, but not when it comes to dealing with terrorists.
Zarek I thought you said you respected me, read my book.
Apollo That was before you resorted to violence and hostage-taking.
Zarek Its always better when the oppressed dont fight back, isnt it?
Adama A warhead.
#6 “Technically, I need the plutonium inside.”
Baltar Technically, I need the plutonium inside.
#6 Figure out the rest for yourself.
Baltar As you may know, the Cylons are susceptible to certain kinds of radiation. And by taking the plutonium and... embedding it in the carbon nanotube matrix... and it really is that simple... I can construct a filter that will preferentially ionize synthetic molecules and, thus, deliver to you your Cylons.
Adama We have five warheads left aboard this ship. We may need them.
Baltar Well, yes, of course. If you, uh, if you really think that this project has a low priority, then, you know, youre totally within your bounds to...
Adama Youll get your warhead.
#6 Good boy.
Baltar Thank you... Commander.
Tyrol Look, the Master-at-Arms has been over every inch of that locker. Shes come up with nothing.
Boomer So theyve got no idea who took those six g-4 charges or who put that detonator in...
Tyrol Hey, hey, hey... dont worry about it. Ill take care of it, okay?
Tigh Mmm... I need to speak with the lieutenant, alone. You dont honestly think youve been fooling everyone, do you? I know, the old man knows, hell, the whole ship knows about you and the Chief. It stops, now.
Boomer Sir, the chief and I are just friends...
Tigh Back when the ship was being decommissioned, we let you two get away with it. Hell, we let everyone get away with murder. But that was then and this is now. Were at war, this is a combat unit and youre his superior officer. Put a stop to it, thats an order.
Boomer Yes, sir.
Gaeta_on_PA Attention, pass the word: Colonel <Tigh, Colonel <Tigh, please report to C.I.C.
Zarek The crew are my prisoners. They will not be harmed.
Adama Are you recording this?
Gaeta Yes, sir.
Tigh Whats this?
Adama Trouble.
Zarek But I have two conditions before I release my captives. First, the government which controls our fate is illegal and illegitimate, and it must submit to the will of the people. I demand the immediate resignation of Laura Roslin and her ministers. Second, I demand free and open elections to choose a new leadership and a new government that represents all of the people. These demands are made not for me or for the former slaves held on this ship, but for you, the people, the survivors of the holocaust and the children of humanitys future. I am Tom Zarek, and this is the first day of the new era.
Adama We’ve jammed his transmissions.
Roslin A little bit late for that, every ship in the fleet heard that broadcast.
Adama It doesnt matter.
Roslin It does matter. Hes trying to bring down the government.
Adama No ones going to take it seriously.
Roslin You have something to learn when it comes to public opinion, Commander. Tom Zarek is a name with weight, a very sympathetic figure, a legend, almost. 20 years in prison, over a matter of principle.
Adama Hes a criminal and a terrorist, people arent gonna give him credence.
Roslin Dont be so sure, Commander. Rebellions are contagious. People are already rioting over the water crisis. We cant afford to destabilize this government right now.
Adama I agree.
Roslin When are you going in?
Adama I assumed you were gonna talk to him first.
Roslin We dont negotiate with terrorists.
Adama I said “talk”.
Roslin Theres nothing to talk about. What he wants, I cant give him.
Adama Were not ready yet. Talking to Zarek give us a little more time.
Roslin Thats what he wants, he wants legitimacy. He wants to be recognized. He wants his crimes validated. I watched President Adar offer him a full pardon if hed apologize and give up violence as a means of political change. He refused. No commitments, no deals.
Adama Ill let you know what happens.
Starbuck Three assault teams, Alpha, Bravo, Constellation. We jam their dradis, the Raptors cut through the hull here, here and here, without being seen. once were inside, Alpha takes–
Tigh Whats this we crap?
Starbuck Im going, sir.
Tigh Like hell.
Adama We have a few marines left on Galactica, let them handle it, Starbuck.
Starbuck They dont have a sniper. And, with all due respect, sir, I am the best shot in or out of the cockpit.
Tigh Shes right... for once.
Adama Wonders never cease. All right, youre goin in. You get a clear shot at Zarek, you take it. And I want to control that ship immediately. And I want all the hostages alive.
Starbuck Yes, sir.
Dualla I dont even know how I drew this detail.
Billy President thought youd be valuable.
Dualla The President doesnt know who I am.
Billy I told her. Sorry.
Dualla on the other hand, its nice to get out of the C.I.C. Break up the day... meet new people.
Mason Youre not asleep.
Cally Not any more.
Mason Is that your way of telling us youre not scared?
Cally No, its my way of telling you Im tired.
Mason You dont know what tired is.
Cally Right.
Mason Dont! Dont mock me, little girl!
Cally Im not mocking you.
Mason Tom and I, we go way back, long time. If you know whats good for you, youll be nice to me.
Tigh Frequent wireless contact. Keep us informed all the way.
Starbuck Yes, sir.
Tigh Good hunting.
Zarek Who voted for Laura Roslin? You? Did you vote for her?
Apollo She was sworn in under the law...
Zarek The answer is: no one voted for her. No one! And yet shes making decisions for all of us, deciding who lives and who dies. Is that- is that democracy? Is that a free society?
Apollo What is it you want from me? You want me to say she shouldnt be President? We need a government. We need rules. We need a leader.
Zarek We need to be free men and women. If were not free, then were no different than Cylons! They call you Apollo.
Apollo Its my call sign.
Zarek Apollo s one of the gods, a lord of Kobol. You must be a very special man to be called a god.
Apollo Its just a stupid nickname.
Zarek Son of Zeus. Good with a bow, god of the hunt... and also a god of healing. Now, a god can reconcile those two opposing forces. But a mortal has to pick one side or the other. Have you picked a side, Apollo?
Gaeta Astral Queen, Astral Queen, this is the Battlestar Galactica. Commander Adama wishes to speak to Mr. Zarek. Please, respond.
Zarek Zeus is calling. Commander Adama, Tom Zarek. How can I help you?
Adama First, I wanna make sure that my people are unharmed.
Apollo Uh, this is Apollo. Im fine, so are the others. Theyre located on the lower...
Zarek Thats enough, thank you.
Adama Im glad to hear that no ones been hurt. That would have tragic consequences.
Zarek How long until you storm the ship?
Adama Im hoping that wont be necessary. I think that you and I can come up with some kind of an understanding. This is not the only crisis that Im dealing with. The water shortage affects the entire fleet.
Zarek Your men are on their way, even as we speak.
Adama Theres still time to work this out.
Zarek Have the President step down and call for elections.
Adama Thats not gonna happen.
Zarek Then I look forward to meeting your men.
Mason I knew you were faking.
Cally Im a light sleeper.
Mason I dont think I have your respect.
Cally I respect you.
Mason Get up.
Billy Hey, whats goin on? Hey!
Dualla What are you doing?!
Mason Move.
Dualla Where are you taking her?! Cally, its okay, Cally. Cally, youre gonna be okay, they know where we are, Cally.
Billy Captain Adama!
Dualla Cally!
Billy Captain Adama! Hey! Captain Adama!
Apollo Theyre willing to talk.
Zarek Sounded that way.
Apollo You want them to storm the ship.
Marine Soft seal pressurized.
Starbuck Eyes.
Apollo Thats it, isnt it? You dont want elections, you dont want your freedom. You want a bloodbath.
Zarek You dont understand.
Apollo Tom Zareks been out of the headlines, out of the news, forgotten for 20 years as he rots in a cell. And now hes got a chance to go out in a blaze of glory. And hes gonna take it.
Starbuck Alpha one, were in.
Zarek once Roslin uses Adama s soldiers to massacre the people on this ship, prisoners and hostages alike, people in the fleet will never, never forgive them. The entire government will collapse.
Dualla She can take care of herself.
Billy Are you sure?
Dualla Shes been trained. Weve all been trained in captured–
Apollo Youve been saying how everything youre doing is for freedom, but the truth is, its all about Tom Zarek and his personal death wish.
Man Tom, somethings up.
Zarek Thats Mason, what the hell...?
Starbuck Theyre killing the hostages, lets go.
Marine Constellation team, set.
Zarek Mason! Mason! Mason, what are you doing?
Mason She bit my ear off!
Cally Frak you!
Apollo Open the door, shes been shot!
Zarek Mason, put down the gun.
Apollo You said that you werent animals, what do you call this?
Mason 20 years- 20 years, Ive been waitin!
Zarek Mason, no.
Apollo Hes gonna kill er, do something.
Zarek You did this, you put him in a cage! You made him a monster!
Marine Bravo, set.
Manson You filthy bitch! You all deserve to die! You, first.
Starbuck All teams, sniper in position.
Apollo Hes gonna do it!
Zarek You reap what you sow.
Mason You look at me, you see me! Look at me!
Starbuck Come on, Lee, take out the son of a bitch.
Apollo How bout it, Tom? You still have a death wish? You ready to leave this world, right here, right now?
Zarek Yes.
Apollo Too bad. Cause this is what youre gonna do: youre gonna tell your men to help us get that water off the moon. Theyre gonna work for their points, and theyre gonna earn their freedom, and then... then... youre gonna get your elections.
Zarek What?
Apollo Cause youre right, Tom. You were right about democracy and consent of the people. I believe in those things and were gonna have em. And you can have em too. Or you can have this bullet. Your call.
Starbuck What are you doing, Lee? What are you doing? Come on.
Zarek How do I know your father and the President will honor your word?
Apollo You dont.You let the rest of the hostages go, well leave this ship in your hands. They try and come after you, you can still have your last stand. Its your choice. You reap what you sow.
Zarek All right, all right. Lower your weapons. Lower your weapons!
Apollo Back off. Okay, Cally, youre gonna be okay. You just hang in there, you hear?
Starbuck Gotcha.
Apollo Cease fire! Cease fire!
Starbuck All teams, hold positions. Frak.
Zarek Thanks.
Apollo I need a medic here.
Roslin God... I dont believe this.
Adama Its unacceptable.
Apollo Its done. Prisoners have full control of the Astral Queen. We evaced all the guards and support personnel. Its their ship.
Adama Theyre a threat to the entire fleet.
Apollo Theyve been disarmed. The ship itself has no weapons.
Adama The ship itself is a weapon!
Apollo Theyre totally dependent on us for food, fuel, and theyve agreed to organize the workforce for the water detail on the moon.
Roslin Youve committed me to holding elections within the year.
Apollo Madam President, with respect, youre serving out the remainder of President Adars term. When that term is up in seven months, the law says theres an election. I only committed you to obeying the law. Roslin: You are not authorized to make any deal...
Adama You sound like some kind of a lawyer...
Apollo I swore an oath... to defend the articles. The articles say theres an election in seven months. Now, if youre telling me were throwing out the law, then Im not a Captain, youre not a Commander and you are not the President. And I dont owe either of you a damned explanation for anything.
Roslin Hes your son.
Adama Hes your adviser.
Roslin An election...
Adama I guess you finally picked your side. Madam President.
Tigh What the hell is this, water?
Starbuck Bet your ass. Theres plenty more where that came from. Um, I have my flaws too.
Tigh The difference is my flaws are personal, yours are professional. Thank you, Lieutenant, thatll be all.
