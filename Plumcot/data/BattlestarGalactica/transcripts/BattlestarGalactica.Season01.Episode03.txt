lt_felix_gaeta Reveille, reveille, morning stations aboard Battlestar Galactica, all hands report to your stations.
colonel_saul_tigh So, what do we have?
chief_galen_tyrol Good news, Colonel. We scouted the ice moon, found an entire subsurface ocean. Ive got reports and video for you, sir.
colonel_saul_tigh Mmm, not exactly Caprica beach down there, huh, chief?
chief_galen_tyrol No, sir. Weve registered temperatures 180 and below... mmm... Venting of methane and CO2. Its gonna be a bitch to work down there, sir.
colonel_saul_tigh Cheer up, you know how lucky we are we found this ugly rock? Water riots breakin out all over the fleet. Civilians, whiny, civi crybabies, cant stand less than a hot shower every day.
chief_galen_tyrol Yes, sir.
colonel_saul_tigh Even Galacticas down to 10,000 jps of water. Ever see a man die of dehydration, chief?
chief_galen_tyrol No, sir.
colonel_saul_tigh Well, lets hope you never do, it isnt pretty. So... where were we?
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson We drilled 23 core samples...
colonel_saul_tigh 13% sodium chloride, what the hell? We cant drink salt water!
chief_galen_tyrol No, sir, thats why I had Cally test the ice.
colonel_saul_tigh Oh, ho, well, there you go, pure water. A couple of lemons, we could make lemonade. Oh-hoo-hoo-hoo.
chief_galen_tyrol Uh, yes, sir. We will have to melt the ice before we transport it up to the ship.
colonel_saul_tigh Whats that gonna take?
crewman_specialist_socinus High capacity heater expansion tanks, D-25 plasma torches, myrex hoses, centrifugal pumps...
colonel_saul_tigh Sounds like a lot of manpower.
chief_galen_tyrol Ideally, a thousand men, sir.
colonel_saul_tigh A thousand men. And where are they gonna come from?
president_laura_roslin Slave labor.
admiral_william_adama They are criminals and theyve been sentenced to hard labor, and this is very hard labor, not to mention physically dangerous. This is not for civilians, but...
cpt_lee_adama Their ship wasnt designed for long-term incarceration. These men have been stuck in cramped cells for weeks, now. They might even prefer to get out, do something, even if it is dangerous.
president_laura_roslin If they volunteer; but these men are not slaves, and I will not have them treated as such.
cpt_lee_adama No... we could offer incentives. Points towards earning freedom.
admiral_william_adama Excuse me? You wanna start releasing hardened criminals into the fleet?
cpt_lee_adama Sir, these men were on their way to Caprica for parole hearings, which at least implies they may be ready for release.
president_laura_roslin Make it happen, Captain.
cpt_lee_adama Yes, sir.
president_laura_roslin Billy, to address Commander Adamas concerns, Id like you to go along and set up some sort of screening procedure to weed out the hardened criminals.
billy_keikeya Yes, maam.
admiral_william_adama I would like to have a representative from Galactica, who will report directly to me about security issues.
billy_keikeya How bout D? Uh, second class petty officer Dualla–
admiral_william_adama I know who she is.
billy_keikeya Im sure shes conversant with the technical details–
admiral_william_adama Shell be fine. But I think we should send someone from ground crew. Ill make sure that all the men that are chosen know how to handle the equipment.
president_laura_roslin Agreed.
admiral_william_adama If thats all, I have to get to the C.I.C. Excuse me.
billy_keikeya Uh, madam President... the doctor.
president_laura_roslin Excuse me?
billy_keikeya The doctor?
president_laura_roslin Oh... Commander? Do you have a ships doctor aboard Galactica?
admiral_william_adama Major Connell. Is there something wrong?
president_laura_roslin No, nothing urgent. Allergies.
admiral_william_adama Yes, well, hes out on the fleet, checking medical conditions. Ill tell him that you want to see him.
president_laura_roslin Thanks.
president_laura_roslin Petty officer Dualla, conversant in technical details.
billy_keikeya Thinking entirely of the mission.
president_laura_roslin Uh-huh.
admiral_william_adama Something on your mind, Captain?
cpt_lee_adama I just thought maybe you had something you wanted to say.
admiral_william_adama I have nothing to say to the personal representative of the President.
cpt_lee_adama Im still Galacticas lead pilot.
admiral_william_adama Well, I have nothing to say to him either. Every man has to decide for themselves which side theyre on.
cpt_lee_adama I didnt know we were pickin sides.
admiral_william_adama Thats why you havent picked one yet.
wilkens Im a bus driver, not a warden.
cpt_lee_adama How many total?
wilkens 1,500. They dont give me their files or their names. Hell, theyre just numbers.
cpt_lee_adama Thanks, Wilkins.
wilkens Mmm. All right... theyre all yours.
cpt_lee_adama Im Captain Lee Adama, personal representative of the President. Were in a crisis. Thousands of us are on the verge of dying from dehydration. Now, the good news is we have found water. The bad news is its located on a moon with harsh environmental conditions. We need 1,000 able-bodied men to help us get that water. President Roslin feels that you represent our best chance. She also recognizes that you are not slaves. Any man who volunteers to help us during this emergency will earn freedom points, which can be applied toward earning his release. Were offering you a chance for a new beginning. Whoevers interested, please, just step out of your cell.
tom_zarek Thank you for your offer. We respectfully decline.
Man#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode03 Zarek!
billy_keikeya Oh, my gods, thats... thats Tom Zarek.
officer_anastasia_dualla The terrorist?
Man#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode03 Zarek!
Men#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode03 Zarek, Zarek! Zarek, Zarek! Zarek, Zarek! Zarek, Zarek! Zarek, Zarek! Zarek, Zarek! Zarek, Zarek! Zarek, Zarek! Zarek, Zarek! Zarek, Zarek! Zarek, Zarek! Zarek, Zarek! Zarek, Zarek!
wilkens So who the hell is Tom Zarek?
billy_keikeya Hes a freedom fighter. Hes a- hes a prisoner of conscience.
officer_anastasia_dualla Hes a butcher.
billy_keikeya His colony was exploited by the other 11 for centuries. His people were marginalized, brutalized...
officer_anastasia_dualla Im from Sagittaron, and that man does not speak for all of us. He blew up a government building, and there is no excuse for that.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Captain, Ive been watching the clock, and if were not gonna get any help, we should move on.
cpt_lee_adama Zareks got the prisoners united. Lets go through Zarek.
captain_karl_agathon Hello?! Anybody out there?! Anybody wanna help two stranded pilots? Thats what I hate about big cities: no one will help you.
lt_sharon_valerii No more shouting, youre making me nervous.
captain_karl_agathon Feel like Im in a movie.
lt_sharon_valerii At least it stopped raining.
captain_karl_agathon For now.
lt_sharon_valerii Where is everyone?
captain_karl_agathon Somewhere dead... in their beds, at their desks... the ones who werent killed already probably ran into the hills. Wont do any good. I guess Im getting a little...
lt_sharon_valerii Depressing? Morbid?
captain_karl_agathon Sorry. Been here longer than you. Wish I could say it gets easier.
lt_sharon_valerii Theres more.
captain_karl_agathon Boomer, you might not wanna... Frakkin rats... lets go. Hey... hey, come on. Lets just find a hospital, score some anti-radiation meds. Okay? Weve only got two days worth left. Sharon? Weve made it this far, were gonna make it all the way.
lt_sharon_valerii Right.
captain_karl_agathon Damn straight, all the way. Were doin good, real good. Okay, someone must be watching out for us.
aaron_doral Shes good.
number_six So far.
aaron_doral Jealous?
number_six Its what makes me so sad.
aaron_doral They would have destroyed themselves, anyway. They deserve what they got.
number_six Were the children of humanity; that makes them our parents, in a sense.
aaron_doral True. But parents have to die. Its the only way children come into their own.
cpt_lee_adama No, thats not necessary. Id like to talk to you.
tom_zarek Guard... Prisoner 893893 requests permission to speak with this visitor.
Guard#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode03 Granted.
tom_zarek Im not allowed to speak unless asked a direct question. You didnt ask me a direct question. Youve never been in a prison before, have you, Captain?
cpt_lee_adama No.
tom_zarek Youre fortunate. May I sit down?
cpt_lee_adama Yes, of course. We need these men of yours to help us.
tom_zarek Theyre not my men, they belong to you. I belong to you, you own us. Youre the master, were the slaves.
cpt_lee_adama Youre clearly a man of principle. I respect that.
tom_zarek Really?
cpt_lee_adama The things youve stood for over the years, the book you wrote...
tom_zarek The book that had to be smuggled out of labor camp because stumps arent allowed freedom of expression?
cpt_lee_adama I read it, in college. Thought it was radical, challenging. It made me question some things Id accepted before without thinking.
tom_zarek Nice to hear Im a big hit on campus.
cpt_lee_adama You arent, the book was banned. I read it, anyway. The point is: I understand where youre coming from, but I dont think you understand how critical the situation is out there. People are gonna start dying.
Man#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode03 Hey, Stark. Its time for your break.
billy_keikeya How can you say that?
officer_anastasia_dualla Because its the truth. Zarek and the S.F.M., they dont care about justice...
billy_keikeya These people... your people have been exploited!
officer_anastasia_dualla You cannot tell me about my people.
billy_keikeya Im not telling you about your people...!
Man#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode03 Excuse me.
cpt_lee_adama All I want, the President wants, is to offer you a chance to earn your freedom.
tom_zarek Now, youve said the truth: freedom is earned. Stay where you are, Captain. Itll all be over soon.
Guard#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode03 Weve got the guards and the crew in separate cells in block seven. Mason is looking after the hostages.
tom_zarek Nice job.
Man#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode03 Everythings under control. The men are organizing exactly as planned.
tom_zarek I knew I could count on you.
officer_anastasia_dualla Stay frosty, there, Billy. Everythings gonna be all right.
billy_keikeya I dont know about that.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson They dont wanna hurt us. That wont get them what they want.
billy_keikeya Which is what?
dr_gaius_baltar Frak... frak... Lieutenant Thrace, good to see you.
captain_kara_thrace Um, good to see you too!
dr_gaius_baltar Really?
captain_kara_thrace No!
number_six Oh...
dr_gaius_baltar I wonder if shes a real blonde.
number_six I doubt it.
captain_kara_thrace Now, one of you has been coming in a little hot lately, a little too hot. A little, um, oh, I dont know, hes burning up the deck with his skids because he just cant pull back on the throttle hot. Now, who is this speed demon, my prince?
boxey Flattop, sir.
captain_kara_thrace Flattop. You got a need for speed, do ya? Just cant wait to get back to the big G in the lovin embrace of your fellow pilots?
captain_kara_thrace Or maybe you have a hot date with your right hand.
lt_dwight_saunders Hey, it never gets a headache.
captain_kara_thrace Tell you what, Flattop: you come in too hot today, you may have to start using your left.
captain_kara_thrace All right, youve been fun. Youve been a great audience. Dismissed.
colonel_saul_tigh Theres no smoking in the Ready Room.
captain_kara_thrace My room, my rules, sir.
colonel_saul_tigh Wheres your mommy?
boxey Dead, wheres yours?
colonel_saul_tigh Im lookin for Boomer.
boxey Its 14:00, Boomer s in the Tool Room.
colonel_saul_tigh A pilot blows his landings and you make a joke out of it?!
captain_kara_thrace Screaming at people doesnt always get the best results, sir. I learned that at officer candidate school.
colonel_saul_tigh You are right on the edge, Thrace. Careful you dont fall off.
captain_kara_thrace Speaking of falling off... glad to see you found a way to quench your thirst.
cpt_lee_adama They wont negotiate while youre holding hostages.
tom_zarek I dont wanna negotiate.
cpt_lee_adama Then, what do you want?
tom_zarek To be treated like men, not animals. Finally have somethin to bargain with.
cpt_lee_adama So what happens now?
tom_zarek Were gonna talk.
cpt_lee_adama What about?
tom_zarek Your father.
dr_gaius_baltar Is this a Montclair original?
admiral_william_adama Yes.
dr_gaius_baltar Fantastic.
admiral_william_adama Would you like some water?
dr_gaius_baltar Uh, yes, thank you. Yeah, Im not a collector, myself, but I... I am familiar with his work. And, may I say, you really do have an excellent eye for art.
admiral_william_adama Thank you. Wheres my Cylon detector, doctor?
dr_gaius_baltar Oh, that. Yes, its taking longer than expected. Unfortunately.
admiral_william_adama Whats the hangup?
number_six Its not working this time, Gaius. He can see right through you.
dr_gaius_baltar Well, there are a number of obstacles, none of them insurmountable, of course, but they do tend to slow us down. For a start, the, uh- well, the lack of proper facilities. The water shortage, of course, the water shortage, not to mention...
admiral_william_adama Cut the BS. You said you had a way of detecting human from Cylon. Do you or dont you?
dr_gaius_baltar I don’t.
number_six What?
dr_gaius_baltar I dont think that Im the man for this job. Im not cut out for this kind of work.
number_six You have to do this.
dr_gaius_baltar Why do I keep putting it off? Its my subconscious. Its my subconscious telling me- telling me that Im not the man for this job, please.
number_six Listen to me. If you dont tell him what he wants to hear, hes going to find you out, and when he does, theyre going to tear your head off and throw your body out of an airlock!
dr_gaius_baltar Woo! Pardon me. I, uh- I havent had much sleep recently, so...
admiral_william_adama Unfortunately, doctor, for both of us, youre the last man we have. So whats the game plan, Doc?
number_six This is what you say: Commander, the truth is, there is one way. Say it!
dr_gaius_baltar Commander, the truth is... there is one way.
number_six “I didnt want to have to ask you for this...”
dr_gaius_baltar I didnt want to have to ask you for this...
number_six “But what I really need...”
dr_gaius_baltar But what I really need to complete the project...
number_six “Is a nuclear warhead.”
dr_gaius_baltar Is a nuclear... warhead.
tom_zarek That’s how you got to be the personal representative of the President? Because of your father?
cpt_lee_adama Hardly.
tom_zarek So they dont get along, Adama and Roslin.
cpt_lee_adama They have their differences, but not when it comes to dealing with terrorists.
tom_zarek I thought you said you respected me, read my book.
cpt_lee_adama That was before you resorted to violence and hostage-taking.
tom_zarek Its always better when the oppressed dont fight back, isnt it?
admiral_william_adama A warhead.
number_six “Technically, I need the plutonium inside.”
dr_gaius_baltar Technically, I need the plutonium inside.
number_six Figure out the rest for yourself.
dr_gaius_baltar As you may know, the Cylons are susceptible to certain kinds of radiation. And by taking the plutonium and... embedding it in the carbon nanotube matrix... and it really is that simple... I can construct a filter that will preferentially ionize synthetic molecules and, thus, deliver to you your Cylons.
admiral_william_adama We have five warheads left aboard this ship. We may need them.
dr_gaius_baltar Well, yes, of course. If you, uh, if you really think that this project has a low priority, then, you know, youre totally within your bounds to...
admiral_william_adama Youll get your warhead.
number_six Good boy.
dr_gaius_baltar Thank you... Commander.
chief_galen_tyrol Look, the Master-at-Arms has been over every inch of that locker. Shes come up with nothing.
lt_sharon_valerii So theyve got no idea who took those six g-4 charges or who put that detonator in...
chief_galen_tyrol Hey, hey, hey... dont worry about it. Ill take care of it, okay?
colonel_saul_tigh Mmm... I need to speak with the lieutenant, alone. You dont honestly think youve been fooling everyone, do you? I know, the old man knows, hell, the whole ship knows about you and the Chief. It stops, now.
lt_sharon_valerii Sir, the chief and I are just friends...
colonel_saul_tigh Back when the ship was being decommissioned, we let you two get away with it. Hell, we let everyone get away with murder. But that was then and this is now. Were at war, this is a combat unit and youre his superior officer. Put a stop to it, thats an order.
lt_sharon_valerii Yes, sir.
lt_felix_gaeta Attention, pass the word: Colonel <Tigh, Colonel <Tigh, please report to C.I.C.
tom_zarek The crew are my prisoners. They will not be harmed.
admiral_william_adama Are you recording this?
lt_felix_gaeta Yes, sir.
colonel_saul_tigh Whats this?
admiral_william_adama Trouble.
tom_zarek But I have two conditions before I release my captives. First, the government which controls our fate is illegal and illegitimate, and it must submit to the will of the people. I demand the immediate resignation of Laura Roslin and her ministers. Second, I demand free and open elections to choose a new leadership and a new government that represents all of the people. These demands are made not for me or for the former slaves held on this ship, but for you, the people, the survivors of the holocaust and the children of humanitys future. I am Tom Zarek, and this is the first day of the new era.
admiral_william_adama We’ve jammed his transmissions.
president_laura_roslin A little bit late for that, every ship in the fleet heard that broadcast.
admiral_william_adama It doesnt matter.
president_laura_roslin It does matter. Hes trying to bring down the government.
admiral_william_adama No ones going to take it seriously.
president_laura_roslin You have something to learn when it comes to public opinion, Commander. Tom Zarek is a name with weight, a very sympathetic figure, a legend, almost. 20 years in prison, over a matter of principle.
admiral_william_adama Hes a criminal and a terrorist, people arent gonna give him credence.
president_laura_roslin Dont be so sure, Commander. Rebellions are contagious. People are already rioting over the water crisis. We cant afford to destabilize this government right now.
admiral_william_adama I agree.
president_laura_roslin When are you going in?
admiral_william_adama I assumed you were gonna talk to him first.
president_laura_roslin We dont negotiate with terrorists.
admiral_william_adama I said “talk”.
president_laura_roslin Theres nothing to talk about. What he wants, I cant give him.
admiral_william_adama Were not ready yet. Talking to Zarek give us a little more time.
president_laura_roslin Thats what he wants, he wants legitimacy. He wants to be recognized. He wants his crimes validated. I watched President Adar offer him a full pardon if hed apologize and give up violence as a means of political change. He refused. No commitments, no deals.
admiral_william_adama Ill let you know what happens.
captain_kara_thrace Three assault teams, Alpha, Bravo, Constellation. We jam their dradis, the Raptors cut through the hull here, here and here, without being seen. once were inside, Alpha takes–
colonel_saul_tigh Whats this we crap?
captain_kara_thrace Im going, sir.
colonel_saul_tigh Like hell.
admiral_william_adama We have a few marines left on Galactica, let them handle it, Starbuck.
captain_kara_thrace They dont have a sniper. And, with all due respect, sir, I am the best shot in or out of the cockpit.
colonel_saul_tigh Shes right... for once.
admiral_william_adama Wonders never cease. All right, youre goin in. You get a clear shot at Zarek, you take it. And I want to control that ship immediately. And I want all the hostages alive.
captain_kara_thrace Yes, sir.
officer_anastasia_dualla I dont even know how I drew this detail.
billy_keikeya President thought youd be valuable.
officer_anastasia_dualla The President doesnt know who I am.
billy_keikeya I told her. Sorry.
officer_anastasia_dualla on the other hand, its nice to get out of the C.I.C. Break up the day... meet new people.
mason Youre not asleep.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Not any more.
mason Is that your way of telling us youre not scared?
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson No, its my way of telling you Im tired.
mason You dont know what tired is.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Right.
mason Dont! Dont mock me, little girl!
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Im not mocking you.
mason Tom and I, we go way back, long time. If you know whats good for you, youll be nice to me.
colonel_saul_tigh Frequent wireless contact. Keep us informed all the way.
captain_kara_thrace Yes, sir.
colonel_saul_tigh Good hunting.
tom_zarek Who voted for Laura Roslin? You? Did you vote for her?
cpt_lee_adama She was sworn in under the law...
tom_zarek The answer is: no one voted for her. No one! And yet shes making decisions for all of us, deciding who lives and who dies. Is that- is that democracy? Is that a free society?
cpt_lee_adama What is it you want from me? You want me to say she shouldnt be President? We need a government. We need rules. We need a leader.
tom_zarek We need to be free men and women. If were not free, then were no different than Cylons! They call you Apollo.
cpt_lee_adama Its my call sign.
tom_zarek Apollo s one of the gods, a lord of Kobol. You must be a very special man to be called a god.
cpt_lee_adama Its just a stupid nickname.
tom_zarek Son of Zeus. Good with a bow, god of the hunt... and also a god of healing. Now, a god can reconcile those two opposing forces. But a mortal has to pick one side or the other. Have you picked a side, Apollo?
lt_felix_gaeta Astral Queen, Astral Queen, this is the Battlestar Galactica. Commander Adama wishes to speak to Mr. Zarek. Please, respond.
tom_zarek Zeus is calling. Commander Adama, Tom Zarek. How can I help you?
admiral_william_adama First, I wanna make sure that my people are unharmed.
cpt_lee_adama Uh, this is Apollo. Im fine, so are the others. Theyre located on the lower...
tom_zarek Thats enough, thank you.
admiral_william_adama Im glad to hear that no ones been hurt. That would have tragic consequences.
tom_zarek How long until you storm the ship?
admiral_william_adama Im hoping that wont be necessary. I think that you and I can come up with some kind of an understanding. This is not the only crisis that Im dealing with. The water shortage affects the entire fleet.
tom_zarek Your men are on their way, even as we speak.
admiral_william_adama Theres still time to work this out.
tom_zarek Have the President step down and call for elections.
admiral_william_adama Thats not gonna happen.
tom_zarek Then I look forward to meeting your men.
mason I knew you were faking.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Im a light sleeper.
mason I dont think I have your respect.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson I respect you.
mason Get up.
billy_keikeya Hey, whats goin on? Hey!
officer_anastasia_dualla What are you doing?!
mason Move.
officer_anastasia_dualla Where are you taking her?! Cally, its okay, Cally. Cally, youre gonna be okay, they know where we are, Cally.
billy_keikeya Captain Adama!
officer_anastasia_dualla Cally!
billy_keikeya Captain Adama! Hey! Captain Adama!
cpt_lee_adama Theyre willing to talk.
tom_zarek Sounded that way.
cpt_lee_adama You want them to storm the ship.
Marine#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode03 Soft seal pressurized.
captain_kara_thrace Eyes.
cpt_lee_adama Thats it, isnt it? You dont want elections, you dont want your freedom. You want a bloodbath.
tom_zarek You dont understand.
cpt_lee_adama Tom Zareks been out of the headlines, out of the news, forgotten for 20 years as he rots in a cell. And now hes got a chance to go out in a blaze of glory. And hes gonna take it.
captain_kara_thrace Alpha one, were in.
tom_zarek once Roslin uses Adama s soldiers to massacre the people on this ship, prisoners and hostages alike, people in the fleet will never, never forgive them. The entire government will collapse.
officer_anastasia_dualla She can take care of herself.
billy_keikeya Are you sure?
officer_anastasia_dualla Shes been trained. Weve all been trained in captured–
cpt_lee_adama Youve been saying how everything youre doing is for freedom, but the truth is, its all about Tom Zarek and his personal death wish.
Man#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode03 Tom, somethings up.
tom_zarek Thats Mason, what the hell...?
captain_kara_thrace Theyre killing the hostages, lets go.
Marine#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode03 Constellation team, set.
tom_zarek Mason! Mason! Mason, what are you doing?
mason She bit my ear off!
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Frak you!
cpt_lee_adama Open the door, shes been shot!
tom_zarek Mason, put down the gun.
cpt_lee_adama You said that you werent animals, what do you call this?
mason 20 years- 20 years, Ive been waitin!
tom_zarek Mason, no.
cpt_lee_adama Hes gonna kill er, do something.
tom_zarek You did this, you put him in a cage! You made him a monster!
Marine#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode03 Bravo, set.
mason You filthy bitch! You all deserve to die! You, first.
captain_kara_thrace All teams, sniper in position.
cpt_lee_adama Hes gonna do it!
tom_zarek You reap what you sow.
mason You look at me, you see me! Look at me!
captain_kara_thrace Come on, Lee, take out the son of a bitch.
cpt_lee_adama How bout it, Tom? You still have a death wish? You ready to leave this world, right here, right now?
tom_zarek Yes.
cpt_lee_adama Too bad. Cause this is what youre gonna do: youre gonna tell your men to help us get that water off the moon. Theyre gonna work for their points, and theyre gonna earn their freedom, and then... then... youre gonna get your elections.
tom_zarek What?
cpt_lee_adama Cause youre right, Tom. You were right about democracy and consent of the people. I believe in those things and were gonna have em. And you can have em too. Or you can have this bullet. Your call.
captain_kara_thrace What are you doing, Lee? What are you doing? Come on.
tom_zarek How do I know your father and the President will honor your word?
cpt_lee_adama You dont.You let the rest of the hostages go, well leave this ship in your hands. They try and come after you, you can still have your last stand. Its your choice. You reap what you sow.
tom_zarek All right, all right. Lower your weapons. Lower your weapons!
cpt_lee_adama Back off. Okay, Cally, youre gonna be okay. You just hang in there, you hear?
captain_kara_thrace Gotcha.
cpt_lee_adama Cease fire! Cease fire!
captain_kara_thrace All teams, hold positions. Frak.
tom_zarek Thanks.
cpt_lee_adama I need a medic here.
president_laura_roslin God... I dont believe this.
admiral_william_adama Its unacceptable.
cpt_lee_adama Its done. Prisoners have full control of the Astral Queen. We evaced all the guards and support personnel. Its their ship.
admiral_william_adama Theyre a threat to the entire fleet.
cpt_lee_adama Theyve been disarmed. The ship itself has no weapons.
admiral_william_adama The ship itself is a weapon!
cpt_lee_adama Theyre totally dependent on us for food, fuel, and theyve agreed to organize the workforce for the water detail on the moon.
president_laura_roslin Youve committed me to holding elections within the year.
cpt_lee_adama Madam President, with respect, youre serving out the remainder of President Adars term. When that term is up in seven months, the law says theres an election. I only committed you to obeying the law. Roslin: You are not authorized to make any deal...
admiral_william_adama You sound like some kind of a lawyer...
cpt_lee_adama I swore an oath... to defend the articles. The articles say theres an election in seven months. Now, if youre telling me were throwing out the law, then Im not a Captain, youre not a Commander and you are not the President. And I dont owe either of you a damned explanation for anything.
president_laura_roslin Hes your son.
admiral_william_adama Hes your adviser.
president_laura_roslin An election...
admiral_william_adama I guess you finally picked your side. Madam President.
colonel_saul_tigh What the hell is this, water?
captain_kara_thrace Bet your ass. Theres plenty more where that came from. Um, I have my flaws too.
colonel_saul_tigh The difference is my flaws are personal, yours are professional. Thank you, Lieutenant, thatll be all.
