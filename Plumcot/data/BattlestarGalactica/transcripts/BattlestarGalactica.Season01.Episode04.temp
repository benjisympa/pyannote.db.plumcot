Apollo Helmet.
Starbuck You are so unprepared.
Apollo Shut up.
Starbuck Youre the worst CAG in the history of CAGs, actually.
Intercom Raptor Pilot Lieutenant Dwight Flat Top Sanders entering hangar deck 12B. Deck hands please report. Repeat, deck hands please report to 12B.
Group Hey, hey. Flat Top hit 1000!
Group Raptor pilots flying high...
Apollo Paint incoming.
Starbuck Brush.
Apollo Brush.
Starbuck Oh, youre the worst, the absolute worst.
Chief What the hells this? Flat Tops thousandth landing, nobody tells me. Now we look like idiots. Find a wagon!
Woman Yes, sir.
Chief Somebody get me a wagon!
Apollo One, zero, zero...
Adama Youre not ready yet?
Adama Someones gonna have to pick that up. Thats enough, come on.
Chief Here, take this. Gimme a hand. Unload this, itll work. You two, come here. Take this wagon to the pilots.
Starbuck So, the commander ever tell you what happened on his thousandth landing?
Adama I dont remember telling you about what I did.
Starbuck Yeah, uh huh, whatever. Hes landing on the Atlantea, and hes been having this ongoing fight with the LSO, and so he decides hes really gonna stick it to him good, right?
Adama This has all been overexaggerated.
Starbuck So -
Pilots Three little Cylons in the air, watch their metal burn and flair...
Starbuck ...so he skids to a stop on the fly deck, and the LSO hears over the wireless this big, loud, long, obnoxious
Adama I was young.
Starbuck No, it was great, it was really funny.
Starbuck The LSOs freaking out, your dad doesnt care because he hates the guy, and he figures he can get away with it anyway because its his thousandth landing. I can get away with anything today!
Starbuck Personally-
Intercom Attention, fire in the port hangar deck. Away the fire and rescue teams.
Adama Lets go.
Masteratarms Metal fatigue. Old equipment... worn strap fails, drops a million-cubit drone to the deck. Kills thirteen pilots, lands seven more in sick bay. Its hard to hear this, I know, but we got lucky. If that had been a missile instead of a com drone? It would have taken out the side of the ship.
Chief Never had a death in my hangar deck. Accidents - never a death.
Apollo Services for the dead. Services will commence at eleven hundred hours on the forward hangar deck. Mid-ships hangar deck remains closed for investigation and clean-up until further notice. Uniforms for the services will be dress grays. I wish I knew what to say. Words to make this better. Can anything make this better, I dont know.
Crashdown Attention on deck!
Adama As you were. May I?
Apollo Yes, sir.
Adama Give me your eyes. I know this has been a hard day. Theres been plenty of them lately. I can guarantee you therell be more to come. Remember your self-esteem, your self-respect, and your self-worth. Hold strong to them, because people are watching. Youre the guardians of the fleet. They need to know that they can count on you, even at a time like this.
Adama Are you Lieutenant Thrace? Im Commander Adama. Im Zaks father.
Starbuck I know, sir. Im sorry, sir, I was planning on coming to see you tomorrow before the funeral.
Adama Dont need to explain anything.
Elosha Once again, we are charged with a solemn duty to return the bodies of our own to the universe. From which the Lords of Kobol brought them to us.
Priest The burdens of this life are with us but a short time. For Lieutenant Zak Adama, son of William and Caroline Adama, brother of Lee, the time was too short, but we take comfort in knowing his life was willingly given in service to all of us. We honor him for that, and thus it falls upon us to repent our sins. And, with the help of the Lords of Kobol, make our own lives worthy of that gift. And now we commit his body to the ground, from which we were all made.
Elosha ...secure in the knowledge that we will be reunited with them in a better world to come.
Elosha So say we all.
Adama So say we all.
Adama Pilots weve known. We have to start training new pilots.
Starbuck There it is. I, umm, kinda thought this was about that. Umm. I dont know if Im the right person for this.
Adama You know someone better?
Starbuck No, no. But, um - theres almost fifty thousand people out there. You trying to tell me theres not one flight instructor?
Adama Theres two. Civilians both. I need someone to teach combat tactics.
Starbuck You know, I dont know if Id be any use to you. I wasnt the most patient -
Adama Lets get down to it. This is about Zak. It was not your fault. You had nothing to do with what happened. It was an accident.
Starbuck Lee? Zak failed basic flight.
Lee What?
Starbuck Or at least he should have, but he didnt. Because I passed him. His technique was sloppy and he had no feel for flying, but I passed him, because he and I... Because I felt something, and I let it get in the way of doing my job, and I couldnt fail him.
Adama Zak passed basic flight. He was trained and ready to sit in that cockpit. What happened to him could have happened to any qualified pilot. You know thats true.
Starbuck Right.
Adama You did your job to the best of your ability. Thats all I can ask. I need new pilots and I want you to train them.
Starbuck I can do that.
Adama Just give them the attention and the professionalism that you gave my son. Theyll be one hell of a squadron.
Crashdown Ten cubits says she takes him this time.
Boomer Youre on.
Baltar Thanks for the vote of confidence. Ten to stay.
Crashdown So, Gaeta, how are you and the doc here doing on your Cylon detector?
Gaeta What Cylon detector?
Crashdown Rumor has it that Cylons look like people, and you guys are working on a way to weed em out.
Zak I want you to tell me the truth about something.
Starbuck You passed. By the skin of your teeth, but you passed.
Zak I dont want any special treatment. Not from my father, and certainly not from you.
Gaeta If there were such a program, it would be classified, and I wouldnt be able to talk about it.
Baltar Something smells horrible in here. Is that you, Crashdown?
Crashdown Umm, yeah, thats me.
Baltar Your card. Your card.
Starbuck Zak, I am a flight instructor. Im not going to send you to Vipers if I dont think youve got the chops. Okay?
Baltar You all right?
Baltar Maybe youd like to take a break?
Starbuck Im out of here.
Crashdown Whoa, whoa, Starbuck - Okay, she cant do that.
Boomer She can, and she did.
Boomer This is it.
Helo A restaurant?
Boomer Its almost on top of the signal.
Helo I dont get it. How does a military-coded signal end up coming from in here?
Boomer Lets find out.
Helo Nothing. Is that thing working?
Boomer I checked it three times. This thing says were right on top of it.
Helo Of what?
Helo All right.
Boomer Helo.
Helo Youre frakking kidding me. Food, medical supplies! Hey, hey, hey, w-wait a minute. The signal.
Boomer Oh. Disaster beacon. Must have been set to go off if there was an attack.
Helo Some poor slob goes to all the trouble of building a fallout shelter, stocks it, has a beacon... the whole plan. Then what? What happens to him?
Boomer Lets just call ourselves lucky and leave it at that.
Doctor Madame President.
Roslin Could you close that curtain, please?
Doctor You are obviously an intelligent well-educated young woman. Would you mind explaining to me why you waited five years in between breast exams?
Roslin Yes, I would mind. Its none of your business. I was busy.
Doctor And now here we are.
Roslin Yes, here we are. Would you mind?
Doctor I do, actually. But your doctor back on Caprica was right. Its too damn late to operate, the cancers too far advanced. All we can do now is try to shrink the tumor with gamma treatments, and follow that up with IV CIS Diloxin. Did he explain to you the side effects of Diloxin?
Roslin Hair loss, nausea, muscle degeneration. I watched my mother endure two years of Diloxin before she died. I would like to explore alternate treatment.
Doctor Prayer?
Roslin Witty. Have you ever heard of Kamala extract?
Doctor Oh gods. Youre one of those.
Roslin What if it works?
Doctor All the evidence on Kamala is anecdotal. Its nothing but a bunch of loose talk and false hope.
Roslin I take that as a yes.
Doctor All right. Ill, um, Ill put out a med request to the civilian fleet. Maybe theres some other wide-eyed dreamer out there with a secret horde of Kamala extract in their luggage. You can put your clothes back on now.
Roslin Thank you.
Doctor And for what its worth, I would... seriously... consider prayer.
Starbuck Boonie jumpers, shuttle jockeys and a Fleet Academy washout. This is the best that you could come up with?
Apollo Diamonds in the rough.
Starbuck Yeah, right.
Apollo Theyre the most qualified pilots in the fleet.
Starbuck Great.
Starbuck Attention on deck. That means get on your feet, Nuggets! You are joining the Colonial Fleet, boys and girls, not some afterschool club. Seats. Pilots call me Starbuck; you may refer to me as God. You have all flown before, but youre about to enter a whole new world, so pay attention. We dont have any flight simulators on board, so were putting you in the cockpit. Today. This is the Viper Mark II. Its as maneuverable as a jackrabbit and can flip end for end in .35 seconds. You have never flown anything remotely like it, so dont think that you have. Today we will be doing basic launch, approach and landing maneuvers. Anyone not paying attention is liable to end up as a puddle of something to be hosed out of cockpit by the chief of the deck.
Guy Shes laying it on a little thick.
Starbuck Costanza, right?
Guy Uh, yes... God... sir.
Starbuck Not anymore. From now on, your name is Hot Dog, and when God speaks, Hot Dog, you listen. Maybe if youd learned that at the academy, you wouldnt have washed out. Sit up.
Intercom Viper seven-niner-one, Galactica. You are cleared for approach. Speed 1-7-5, port bay, hands-on approach, checkers green, call the ball.
Female_trainee I have the ball.
Starbuck Easy on the throttle, Kat. Are you listening to me? Dont chase the lights, okay?
Kat Roger, Starbuck.
Starbuck Kat, dont chase the lights. Set it by the numbers and correct with thrusters.
Intercom Wave off, wave off.
Starbuck Punch it, Kat.
Starbuck Worse than awful. Wretched beyond belief, actually. Huh. You call yourselves pilots. Its gonna take the knuckle-draggers a week to pound your divots out of the flight deck.
Kat With due respect, sir, thats unfair.
Trainee Yes, sir, this was only our first day.
Starbuck No, its your last. Itd be criminal to let any of you near a Viper again. So pack your gear, get the hell off my ship. Youre done.
Apollo What are you doing here, Kara? You cant wash them out on their first day.
Starbuck I just did.
Apollo Look, Ive got forty Vipers and twenty-one pilots. Thats it. We are sitting ducks until we finish water ops. We cant even maintain a CAP. Gods forbid the Cylons show up...
Starbuck Gods forbid. Lets bring in the next group of candidates.
Apollo The next group has never even been in a cockpit. Theyre starting basic flight.
Starbuck Well then they start basic flight, because that group is done. Says so right there, maybe you should read it again.
Apollo Lt. Thrace, this is not a request.
Starbuck Well, Captain Adama, I am the flight instructor, sir. My word is scripture, sir. I will not, repeat, not pass another student who isnt ready.
Apollo So thats what this is about? Its not them. Its Zak.
Starbuck Careful.
Apollo Step back.
Adama Starbuck says they cant cut it, they cant cut it.
Apollo Shes not giving them a chance. Its day one.
Adama Shes one of the finest pilots Ive ever seen in my life. If one day in the cockpit is all she needs to know if they cant hack it or not, she got that.
Apollo Im not arguing that, sir. Im just saying, I think shes letting her personal feelings cloud her judgement.
Adama Please sit down, Captain. What are those feelings?
Apollo About Zak.
Adama Weve talked about Zak.
Apollo Y-you did?
Adama We talked about a lot of things. Weve been aboard this ship for over two years, we know each other very well. When I asked her to be the instructor, I knew it was going to release a lot of loose baggage. She acknowledged it. Shes a professional, shell do her job.
Apollo Okay. Im just saying... you should talk to her. Shes walking around with a lot of emotion. She almost decked me in the rec room. Right, you wouldnt smile if you were there.
Adama Ill talk to her.
Apollo Thank you. Personally, I think shes trying to work out her guilt over what she did for Zak. I think shes trying to make up for it by beating up on these guys.
Adama Guilt? Over what? What did she do for Zak?
Apollo I - I thought you just said -
Adama What did she do?
Apollo Its not my place to say, and Ive already said more than I shouldve. Youll have to ask her, Im sorry.
Adama Captain -
Apollo Dad, youll have to ask her.
Zak I dont want any special treatment. Not from my father, and certainly not from you.
Starbuck You passed. By the skin of your teeth, but you passed. Zak.
Intercom Attention, pass the word to Lt. Thrace. Lt. Thrace, please report to the COs quarters.
Adama Yes, come in. Lee was just here before.
Starbuck I knew it.
Adama He thinks you washed out the nuggets without giving them a chance.
Starbuck They didnt cut it. Thats it.
Adama He thought you were... letting personal feelings cloud your judgement.
Starbuck Really.
Adama Your feelings about Zak.
Starbuck Thats not the case.
Adama Okay. He said something else. He said something that I would like to ask you directly. He said that you might have been feeling about something that you did for Zak. What did you do for him?
Starbuck I dont know, youd have to ask Lee.
Adama No, Im asking you.
Starbuck Well, I dont, umm, I dont really know what he was talking about, so...
Adama Dont fence with me, Kara. I love you like a daughter; I dont deserve that.
Starbuck Umm. Zak failed basic flight. He wasnt a bad pilot, he just had no feel for flying. And, umm. When it came to his final check ride, he busted three of the test maneuvers. And I should have flunked him, but I didnt. The bottom line is that your son didnt have the chops to fly a Viper. And it killed him.
Adama He told me that you were an amazing instructor. And that he was involved with you, and that it was serious. Hed asked me to come to his graduation at flight school, watch him get his wings.
Starbuck I know, I read the letter.
Adama I see. Well then, maybe you can tell me what he was hinting at. A surprise, about you.
Starbuck We were going to, uh... you know what, its not important. I dont want that to, uh...
Adama You were engaged, right?
Adama You did it because you were engaged.
Starbuck Because I made a mistake. Because I was just... I was so in love with him, and I let that get in the way of doing my job. And, umm, he, umm... He just wanted it so much, and I just didnt want to be the one who crushed him.
Adama Reinstate the trainees to flight status.
Starbuck I will. I, umm - but I just, I want you to understand that I -
Adama Do your job.
Starbuck Yes, sir.
Adama And walk out of this cabin while you still can.
Starbuck Unpack your gear. You are all returned to flight status. Were gonna try this again. Those of you who can be trained to safely fly the Viper Mark II will pass, those of you who cannot will be cut. It is my job to figure out which is which, without personal feeling either way. And Im gonna do my job. Kat, Chuckles, Hot Dog, youre up first. Pre-flight briefing in twenty minutes.
Chuckles Where the hell are you going, Hot Dog? Stay on me.
Hot_Dog Target acquired and destroyed.
Starbuck Not bad, Hot Dog. But you left your leader behind.
Kat Looks like youre having a bad day, Hot Dog.
Starbuck And the moral of the story is...?
Hot_Dog Never leave your leader.
Starbuck Thank you, that is correct. You never want to be out here alone. Okay, Chuckles, take Kats wing. Hot Dog, youre on me. Were gonna try a little maneuver called The Thorch Weave.
Tigh Ill be damned. Whats got into Starbuck? She actually sounds like a real instructor for a change. She may actually make Viper pilots out of some of those nuggets after all.
Starbuck Holy frak, weve got incoming.
Tigh Where the hell did they come from?
Gaeta DRADIS. Multiple contacts. Its the Cylons.
Tigh Why didnt we see them coming?
Apollo Launch the alert fighters.
Tigh Attention, set Condition One throughout the fleet.
Starbuck Galactica, were gonna need you to send the cavalry. Nuggets, punch it for home.
Adama Wheres the base ship?
Gaeta Uh, no base ships detected, sir. Eight raiders, bearing 0-4-7, carom 1-1-8, range 22,000.
Tigh They found us. It was only a matter of time.
Starbuck Galactica, Starbuck. Where the hell are the alert fighters?
Pilot Starbuck, Alert One. Well be there in two minutes.
Gaeta Cylons are gaining.
Starbuck All right, listen up, Nuggets. Stay together and keep your throttles firewalled until you reach that deck. Now go.
Adama Whats she doing?
Tigh Starbucks gonna take on all eight. Get herself killed.
Kat Hey, Hot Dog, wherere you going?
Kat Hot Dog, what are you doing?
Hot_Dog Whoa, got one!
Starbuck Hot Dog, get out of here. Hot Dog, I thought I told you to get your ass home.
Hot_Dog You said never to leave your leader.
Starbuck And I also said never disobey an order.
Hot_Dog Im hit!
Starbuck I gotcha, Hot Dog, were gonna make it through this. Break right, now, now, now.
Adama Shell make it.
Hot_Dog Ive just lost all three mains.
Starbuck Its all right, Hot Dog, you did good. Youre gonna be okay, I promise you. At least one of us will. That about does it, I think theres only one left.
Starbuck Frak. Hes right on my tail, but I got it covered.
Dualla Starbucks wireless and transponder just cut out.
Man Alert One. We spotted Hot Dog. No ID or visual on Starbuck.
Starbuck Oh, frak me.
