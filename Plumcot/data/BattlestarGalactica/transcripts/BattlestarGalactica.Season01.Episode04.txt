cpt_lee_adama Helmet.
captain_kara_thrace You are so unprepared.
cpt_lee_adama Shut up.
captain_kara_thrace Youre the worst CAG in the history of CAGs, actually.
Intercom#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode04 Raptor Pilot Lieutenant Dwight Flat Top Sanders entering hangar deck 12B. Deck hands please report. Repeat, deck hands please report to 12B.
Group#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode04 Hey, hey. Flat Top hit 1000!
Group#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode04 Raptor pilots flying high...
cpt_lee_adama Paint incoming.
captain_kara_thrace Brush.
cpt_lee_adama Brush.
captain_kara_thrace Oh, youre the worst, the absolute worst.
chief_galen_tyrol What the hells this? Flat Tops thousandth landing, nobody tells me. Now we look like idiots. Find a wagon!
Woman#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode04 Yes, sir.
chief_galen_tyrol Somebody get me a wagon!
cpt_lee_adama One, zero, zero...
admiral_william_adama Youre not ready yet?
admiral_william_adama Someones gonna have to pick that up. Thats enough, come on.
chief_galen_tyrol Here, take this. Gimme a hand. Unload this, itll work. You two, come here. Take this wagon to the pilots.
captain_kara_thrace So, the commander ever tell you what happened on his thousandth landing?
admiral_william_adama I dont remember telling you about what I did.
captain_kara_thrace Yeah, uh huh, whatever. Hes landing on the Atlantea, and hes been having this ongoing fight with the LSO, and so he decides hes really gonna stick it to him good, right?
admiral_william_adama This has all been overexaggerated.
captain_kara_thrace So -
Pilots#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode04 Three little Cylons in the air, watch their metal burn and flair...
captain_kara_thrace ...so he skids to a stop on the fly deck, and the LSO hears over the wireless this big, loud, long, obnoxious
admiral_william_adama I was young.
captain_kara_thrace No, it was great, it was really funny.
captain_kara_thrace The LSOs freaking out, your dad doesnt care because he hates the guy, and he figures he can get away with it anyway because its his thousandth landing. I can get away with anything today!
captain_kara_thrace Personally-
Intercom#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode04 Attention, fire in the port hangar deck. Away the fire and rescue teams.
admiral_william_adama Lets go.
Masteratarms#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode04 Metal fatigue. Old equipment... worn strap fails, drops a million-cubit drone to the deck. Kills thirteen pilots, lands seven more in sick bay. Its hard to hear this, I know, but we got lucky. If that had been a missile instead of a com drone? It would have taken out the side of the ship.
chief_galen_tyrol Never had a death in my hangar deck. Accidents - never a death.
cpt_lee_adama Services for the dead. Services will commence at eleven hundred hours on the forward hangar deck. Mid-ships hangar deck remains closed for investigation and clean-up until further notice. Uniforms for the services will be dress grays. I wish I knew what to say. Words to make this better. Can anything make this better, I dont know.
crashdown Attention on deck!
admiral_william_adama As you were. May I?
cpt_lee_adama Yes, sir.
admiral_william_adama Give me your eyes. I know this has been a hard day. Theres been plenty of them lately. I can guarantee you therell be more to come. Remember your self-esteem, your self-respect, and your self-worth. Hold strong to them, because people are watching. Youre the guardians of the fleet. They need to know that they can count on you, even at a time like this.
admiral_william_adama Are you Lieutenant Thrace? Im Commander Adama. Im Zaks father.
captain_kara_thrace I know, sir. Im sorry, sir, I was planning on coming to see you tomorrow before the funeral.
admiral_william_adama Dont need to explain anything.
elosha Once again, we are charged with a solemn duty to return the bodies of our own to the universe. From which the Lords of Kobol brought them to us.
Priest#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode04 The burdens of this life are with us but a short time. For Lieutenant Zak Adama, son of William and Caroline Adama, brother of Lee, the time was too short, but we take comfort in knowing his life was willingly given in service to all of us. We honor him for that, and thus it falls upon us to repent our sins. And, with the help of the Lords of Kobol, make our own lives worthy of that gift. And now we commit his body to the ground, from which we were all made.
elosha ...secure in the knowledge that we will be reunited with them in a better world to come.
elosha So say we all.
admiral_william_adama So say we all.
admiral_william_adama Pilots weve known. We have to start training new pilots.
captain_kara_thrace There it is. I, umm, kinda thought this was about that. Umm. I dont know if Im the right person for this.
admiral_william_adama You know someone better?
captain_kara_thrace No, no. But, um - theres almost fifty thousand people out there. You trying to tell me theres not one flight instructor?
admiral_william_adama Theres two. Civilians both. I need someone to teach combat tactics.
captain_kara_thrace You know, I dont know if Id be any use to you. I wasnt the most patient -
admiral_william_adama Lets get down to it. This is about Zak. It was not your fault. You had nothing to do with what happened. It was an accident.
captain_kara_thrace Lee? Zak failed basic flight.
lt_dwight_saunders What?
captain_kara_thrace Or at least he should have, but he didnt. Because I passed him. His technique was sloppy and he had no feel for flying, but I passed him, because he and I... Because I felt something, and I let it get in the way of doing my job, and I couldnt fail him.
admiral_william_adama Zak passed basic flight. He was trained and ready to sit in that cockpit. What happened to him could have happened to any qualified pilot. You know thats true.
captain_kara_thrace Right.
admiral_william_adama You did your job to the best of your ability. Thats all I can ask. I need new pilots and I want you to train them.
captain_kara_thrace I can do that.
admiral_william_adama Just give them the attention and the professionalism that you gave my son. Theyll be one hell of a squadron.
crashdown Ten cubits says she takes him this time.
lt_sharon_valerii Youre on.
dr_gaius_baltar Thanks for the vote of confidence. Ten to stay.
crashdown So, Gaeta, how are you and the doc here doing on your Cylon detector?
lt_felix_gaeta What Cylon detector?
crashdown Rumor has it that Cylons look like people, and you guys are working on a way to weed em out.
zak_adama I want you to tell me the truth about something.
captain_kara_thrace You passed. By the skin of your teeth, but you passed.
zak_adama I dont want any special treatment. Not from my father, and certainly not from you.
lt_felix_gaeta If there were such a program, it would be classified, and I wouldnt be able to talk about it.
dr_gaius_baltar Something smells horrible in here. Is that you, Crashdown?
crashdown Umm, yeah, thats me.
dr_gaius_baltar Your card. Your card.
captain_kara_thrace Zak, I am a flight instructor. Im not going to send you to Vipers if I dont think youve got the chops. Okay?
dr_gaius_baltar You all right?
dr_gaius_baltar Maybe youd like to take a break?
captain_kara_thrace Im out of here.
crashdown Whoa, whoa, Starbuck - Okay, she cant do that.
lt_sharon_valerii She can, and she did.
lt_sharon_valerii This is it.
captain_karl_agathon A restaurant?
lt_sharon_valerii Its almost on top of the signal.
captain_karl_agathon I dont get it. How does a military-coded signal end up coming from in here?
lt_sharon_valerii Lets find out.
captain_karl_agathon Nothing. Is that thing working?
lt_sharon_valerii I checked it three times. This thing says were right on top of it.
captain_karl_agathon Of what?
captain_karl_agathon All right.
lt_sharon_valerii Helo.
captain_karl_agathon Youre frakking kidding me. Food, medical supplies! Hey, hey, hey, w-wait a minute. The signal.
lt_sharon_valerii Oh. Disaster beacon. Must have been set to go off if there was an attack.
captain_karl_agathon Some poor slob goes to all the trouble of building a fallout shelter, stocks it, has a beacon... the whole plan. Then what? What happens to him?
lt_sharon_valerii Lets just call ourselves lucky and leave it at that.
dr_cottle Madame President.
president_laura_roslin Could you close that curtain, please?
dr_cottle You are obviously an intelligent well-educated young woman. Would you mind explaining to me why you waited five years in between breast exams?
president_laura_roslin Yes, I would mind. Its none of your business. I was busy.
dr_cottle And now here we are.
president_laura_roslin Yes, here we are. Would you mind?
dr_cottle I do, actually. But your doctor back on Caprica was right. Its too damn late to operate, the cancers too far advanced. All we can do now is try to shrink the tumor with gamma treatments, and follow that up with IV CIS Diloxin. Did he explain to you the side effects of Diloxin?
president_laura_roslin Hair loss, nausea, muscle degeneration. I watched my mother endure two years of Diloxin before she died. I would like to explore alternate treatment.
dr_cottle Prayer?
president_laura_roslin Witty. Have you ever heard of Kamala extract?
dr_cottle Oh gods. Youre one of those.
president_laura_roslin What if it works?
dr_cottle All the evidence on Kamala is anecdotal. Its nothing but a bunch of loose talk and false hope.
president_laura_roslin I take that as a yes.
dr_cottle All right. Ill, um, Ill put out a med request to the civilian fleet. Maybe theres some other wide-eyed dreamer out there with a secret horde of Kamala extract in their luggage. You can put your clothes back on now.
president_laura_roslin Thank you.
dr_cottle And for what its worth, I would... seriously... consider prayer.
captain_kara_thrace Boonie jumpers, shuttle jockeys and a Fleet Academy washout. This is the best that you could come up with?
cpt_lee_adama Diamonds in the rough.
captain_kara_thrace Yeah, right.
cpt_lee_adama Theyre the most qualified pilots in the fleet.
captain_kara_thrace Great.
captain_kara_thrace Attention on deck. That means get on your feet, Nuggets! You are joining the Colonial Fleet, boys and girls, not some afterschool club. Seats. Pilots call me Starbuck; you may refer to me as God. You have all flown before, but youre about to enter a whole new world, so pay attention. We dont have any flight simulators on board, so were putting you in the cockpit. Today. This is the Viper Mark II. Its as maneuverable as a jackrabbit and can flip end for end in .35 seconds. You have never flown anything remotely like it, so dont think that you have. Today we will be doing basic launch, approach and landing maneuvers. Anyone not paying attention is liable to end up as a puddle of something to be hosed out of cockpit by the chief of the deck.
Guy#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode04 Shes laying it on a little thick.
captain_kara_thrace Costanza, right?
Guy#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode04 Uh, yes... God... sir.
captain_kara_thrace Not anymore. From now on, your name is Hot Dog, and when God speaks, Hot Dog, you listen. Maybe if youd learned that at the academy, you wouldnt have washed out. Sit up.
Intercom#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode04 Viper seven-niner-one, Galactica. You are cleared for approach. Speed 1-7-5, port bay, hands-on approach, checkers green, call the ball.
Female_trainee#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode04 I have the ball.
captain_kara_thrace Easy on the throttle, Kat. Are you listening to me? Dont chase the lights, okay?
louanne_katraine Roger, Starbuck.
captain_kara_thrace Kat, dont chase the lights. Set it by the numbers and correct with thrusters.
Intercom#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode04 Wave off, wave off.
captain_kara_thrace Punch it, Kat.
captain_kara_thrace Worse than awful. Wretched beyond belief, actually. Huh. You call yourselves pilots. Its gonna take the knuckle-draggers a week to pound your divots out of the flight deck.
louanne_katraine With due respect, sir, thats unfair.
Trainee#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode04 Yes, sir, this was only our first day.
captain_kara_thrace No, its your last. Itd be criminal to let any of you near a Viper again. So pack your gear, get the hell off my ship. Youre done.
cpt_lee_adama What are you doing here, Kara? You cant wash them out on their first day.
captain_kara_thrace I just did.
cpt_lee_adama Look, Ive got forty Vipers and twenty-one pilots. Thats it. We are sitting ducks until we finish water ops. We cant even maintain a CAP. Gods forbid the Cylons show up...
captain_kara_thrace Gods forbid. Lets bring in the next group of candidates.
cpt_lee_adama The next group has never even been in a cockpit. Theyre starting basic flight.
captain_kara_thrace Well then they start basic flight, because that group is done. Says so right there, maybe you should read it again.
cpt_lee_adama Lt. Thrace, this is not a request.
captain_kara_thrace Well, Captain Adama, I am the flight instructor, sir. My word is scripture, sir. I will not, repeat, not pass another student who isnt ready.
cpt_lee_adama So thats what this is about? Its not them. Its Zak.
captain_kara_thrace Careful.
cpt_lee_adama Step back.
admiral_william_adama Starbuck says they cant cut it, they cant cut it.
cpt_lee_adama Shes not giving them a chance. Its day one.
admiral_william_adama Shes one of the finest pilots Ive ever seen in my life. If one day in the cockpit is all she needs to know if they cant hack it or not, she got that.
cpt_lee_adama Im not arguing that, sir. Im just saying, I think shes letting her personal feelings cloud her judgement.
admiral_william_adama Please sit down, Captain. What are those feelings?
cpt_lee_adama About Zak.
admiral_william_adama Weve talked about Zak.
cpt_lee_adama Y-you did?
admiral_william_adama We talked about a lot of things. Weve been aboard this ship for over two years, we know each other very well. When I asked her to be the instructor, I knew it was going to release a lot of loose baggage. She acknowledged it. Shes a professional, shell do her job.
cpt_lee_adama Okay. Im just saying... you should talk to her. Shes walking around with a lot of emotion. She almost decked me in the rec room. Right, you wouldnt smile if you were there.
admiral_william_adama Ill talk to her.
cpt_lee_adama Thank you. Personally, I think shes trying to work out her guilt over what she did for Zak. I think shes trying to make up for it by beating up on these guys.
admiral_william_adama Guilt? Over what? What did she do for Zak?
cpt_lee_adama I - I thought you just said -
admiral_william_adama What did she do?
cpt_lee_adama Its not my place to say, and Ive already said more than I shouldve. Youll have to ask her, Im sorry.
admiral_william_adama Captain -
cpt_lee_adama Dad, youll have to ask her.
zak_adama I dont want any special treatment. Not from my father, and certainly not from you.
captain_kara_thrace You passed. By the skin of your teeth, but you passed. Zak.
Intercom#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode04 Attention, pass the word to Lt. Thrace. Lt. Thrace, please report to the COs quarters.
admiral_william_adama Yes, come in. Lee was just here before.
captain_kara_thrace I knew it.
admiral_william_adama He thinks you washed out the nuggets without giving them a chance.
captain_kara_thrace They didnt cut it. Thats it.
admiral_william_adama He thought you were... letting personal feelings cloud your judgement.
captain_kara_thrace Really.
admiral_william_adama Your feelings about Zak.
captain_kara_thrace Thats not the case.
admiral_william_adama Okay. He said something else. He said something that I would like to ask you directly. He said that you might have been feeling about something that you did for Zak. What did you do for him?
captain_kara_thrace I dont know, youd have to ask Lee.
admiral_william_adama No, Im asking you.
captain_kara_thrace Well, I dont, umm, I dont really know what he was talking about, so...
admiral_william_adama Dont fence with me, Kara. I love you like a daughter; I dont deserve that.
captain_kara_thrace Umm. Zak failed basic flight. He wasnt a bad pilot, he just had no feel for flying. And, umm. When it came to his final check ride, he busted three of the test maneuvers. And I should have flunked him, but I didnt. The bottom line is that your son didnt have the chops to fly a Viper. And it killed him.
admiral_william_adama He told me that you were an amazing instructor. And that he was involved with you, and that it was serious. Hed asked me to come to his graduation at flight school, watch him get his wings.
captain_kara_thrace I know, I read the letter.
admiral_william_adama I see. Well then, maybe you can tell me what he was hinting at. A surprise, about you.
captain_kara_thrace We were going to, uh... you know what, its not important. I dont want that to, uh...
admiral_william_adama You were engaged, right?
admiral_william_adama You did it because you were engaged.
captain_kara_thrace Because I made a mistake. Because I was just... I was so in love with him, and I let that get in the way of doing my job. And, umm, he, umm... He just wanted it so much, and I just didnt want to be the one who crushed him.
admiral_william_adama Reinstate the trainees to flight status.
captain_kara_thrace I will. I, umm - but I just, I want you to understand that I -
admiral_william_adama Do your job.
captain_kara_thrace Yes, sir.
admiral_william_adama And walk out of this cabin while you still can.
captain_kara_thrace Unpack your gear. You are all returned to flight status. Were gonna try this again. Those of you who can be trained to safely fly the Viper Mark II will pass, those of you who cannot will be cut. It is my job to figure out which is which, without personal feeling either way. And Im gonna do my job. Kat, Chuckles, Hot Dog, youre up first. Pre-flight briefing in twenty minutes.
chuckles Where the hell are you going, Hot Dog? Stay on me.
lt_brendan_constanza Target acquired and destroyed.
captain_kara_thrace Not bad, Hot Dog. But you left your leader behind.
louanne_katraine Looks like youre having a bad day, Hot Dog.
captain_kara_thrace And the moral of the story is...?
lt_brendan_constanza Never leave your leader.
captain_kara_thrace Thank you, that is correct. You never want to be out here alone. Okay, Chuckles, take Kats wing. Hot Dog, youre on me. Were gonna try a little maneuver called The Thorch Weave.
colonel_saul_tigh Ill be damned. Whats got into Starbuck? She actually sounds like a real instructor for a change. She may actually make Viper pilots out of some of those nuggets after all.
captain_kara_thrace Holy frak, weve got incoming.
colonel_saul_tigh Where the hell did they come from?
lt_felix_gaeta DRADIS. Multiple contacts. Its the Cylons.
colonel_saul_tigh Why didnt we see them coming?
cpt_lee_adama Launch the alert fighters.
colonel_saul_tigh Attention, set Condition One throughout the fleet.
captain_kara_thrace Galactica, were gonna need you to send the cavalry. Nuggets, punch it for home.
admiral_william_adama Wheres the base ship?
lt_felix_gaeta Uh, no base ships detected, sir. Eight raiders, bearing 0-4-7, carom 1-1-8, range 22,000.
colonel_saul_tigh They found us. It was only a matter of time.
captain_kara_thrace Galactica, Starbuck. Where the hell are the alert fighters?
billy_keikeya Starbuck, Alert One. Well be there in two minutes.
lt_felix_gaeta Cylons are gaining.
captain_kara_thrace All right, listen up, Nuggets. Stay together and keep your throttles firewalled until you reach that deck. Now go.
admiral_william_adama Whats she doing?
colonel_saul_tigh Starbucks gonna take on all eight. Get herself killed.
louanne_katraine Hey, Hot Dog, wherere you going?
louanne_katraine Hot Dog, what are you doing?
lt_brendan_constanza Whoa, got one!
captain_kara_thrace Hot Dog, get out of here. Hot Dog, I thought I told you to get your ass home.
lt_brendan_constanza You said never to leave your leader.
captain_kara_thrace And I also said never disobey an order.
lt_brendan_constanza Im hit!
captain_kara_thrace I gotcha, Hot Dog, were gonna make it through this. Break right, now, now, now.
admiral_william_adama Shell make it.
lt_brendan_constanza Ive just lost all three mains.
captain_kara_thrace Its all right, Hot Dog, you did good. Youre gonna be okay, I promise you. At least one of us will. That about does it, I think theres only one left.
captain_kara_thrace Frak. Hes right on my tail, but I got it covered.
officer_anastasia_dualla Starbucks wireless and transponder just cut out.
Man#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode04 Alert One. We spotted Hot Dog. No ID or visual on Starbuck.
captain_kara_thrace Oh, frak me.
