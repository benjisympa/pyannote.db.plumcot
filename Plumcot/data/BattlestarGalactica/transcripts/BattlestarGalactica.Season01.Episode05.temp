Boomer Galactica, Boomer. Hotdogs aboard.
Crashdown Yeah. Sos his lunch. Take it easy, Hotdog, youre not the first to lose it in combat, you wont be the last.
Boomer No sign of Starbuck, he says she was hit. Still in the fight when he lost track of her.
Dualla Roger that, Boomer. Search and rescue ops are underway for Starbuck. Bring Hotdog in, the old man wants to talk to him.
Adama This is where you found him?
Boomer Yes, sir. He had drifted quite a ways in the fight.
Adama Was she maneuvering?
Hotdog I think so... yes. Yes, sir.
Boomer So, she survived the initial hits. She could still be alive.
Adama She is alive, Lieutenant. Were gonna find her.
Boomer Yes, sir.
Adama Get this man to sick bay.
Crashdown Yes, sir.
Apollo I think you earned those today.
Socinus The artillery R-T switch is sticking a bit, sir, but shell fly.
Apollo Polish up the canopy, I want it crystal clear.
Tyrol Yes, sir!
Adama Find her.
Apollo I will.
Starbuck Oh, frak!
Gaeta Still no joy from the search teams, sir. In the last four hours weve combed everywhere within a 200 click sphere of Starbucks last known position. No ship, no ejection seat, no debris. So were extending the radius another 50.
Adama We need more pilots.
Gaeta Everybody who can fly is up, sir.
Adama What about Starbucks course computations?
Gaeta The variables of combat would make them almost meaningless, sir.
Adama Well, its time to start guessing.
Gaeta Yes, sir.
Gaeta Since theres been no dradis contact in the area, I would have to guess that her Viper was captured by the gravity of a planetary body.
Tigh The only nearby gravity wells are the gas giant and this moon. If the gas giant pulled her in, its radiation would fry her like an egg.
Adama What about the moon?
Gaeta The spectroscope people would call the atmosphere as CO2, methane, some argon. The clouds are mostly hydrocarbons. Its cold as hell down there, but she could survive on the surface.
Tigh Until her oxygen runs out.
Adama When?
Gaeta 46 hours and change, sir.
Tigh A hell of a long time to stay in one place. What if the Cylons appear?
Adama They wont, not for a while.
Tigh What makes you say that?
Adama Sending a patrol instead of the base ship tells me that they didnt even know we were here. So, theyre searching a lot of other places, places with potential supplies.
Tigh Like staking out water holes in the desert.
Adama Right. If we sent eight fighters to search an entire star system for 60-odd ships, it would take us...
Tigh Weeks?
Adama Assume theyre better and faster. Itll take them days.
Tigh A lot of assumptions youre making.
Adama Educated guess. Talk to me about searching the moon.
Tigh Its gonna be slow going. Cant see squat through those clouds.
Adama Send the ships below the cloud cover. Tell the pilots to take a hard look the old-fashioned way.
Gaeta Mark one eyeball, sir.
Adama Mark one eyeball.
Dualla Commander... call from Colonial one.
Adama Adama.
Roslin Commander Adama, I dont want to take much of your time I just wanted to say how happy we all are that you found one of your pilots.
Adama Thank you, Madam President.
Roslin How is the search progressing for the other pilot?
Adama Nothing yet, but weve just begun.
Roslin Ive spoken with the other captains in the fleet, theyve agreed to give over their ships at your disposal if itll increase the odds of finding her.
Adama Frak the odds, were gonna find her. Excuse me. Thank you. Tell them we can sure use the help.
Roslin Ill coordinate their efforts with your C.I.C. Continued good luck.
Adama Thank you.
Roslin Oh, thank you.
Baltar So it looks like were gonna be staying here for a while.
Roslin You all right?
Baltar Yeah, Im fine, its, um...
#6 How long do you think itll be before the Cylons wonder what happened to their missing patrol and send another one here to look for it?
Baltar You have attacked us hundreds of times. Were still here. I think youll find that we are more than adequately protected.
#6 Might be a little tricky with the fleet scattered over half the system looking for the lost pilot. How many days until the Cylons return, Gaius? one? Two? Three, at the most.
Roslin Doctor? Your requisition.
Baltar Thank you. Madam President, I, uh, I dont mean to be impertinent, really, but, uh, do you honestly think this is wise? You are compromising the security of the entire fleet while we search for one solitary pilot.
Roslin It is a risk, but those pilots put their lives on the line for us every day.
Baltar Yes... yeah, I was just saying that to, uh- Im not insensitive to that, is what Im saying. I happen to know the missing pilot personally.
#6 Not as personally as youd like. Guess youll never get to find out if shes a real blonde.
Baltar Which makes it all the more difficult for me because on one hand, I think of the pilot and then the other hand, I think of the thousands of defenseless women and children and men throughout the fleet.
Roslin I am sure Commander Adama has considered all of this, thank you, doctor.
Baltar Yes, of course he has. Of course he has, thank you.
Starbuck Its okay... its okay, its okay, its okay. Okay, okay, get to higher ground. Then they see you... then they rescue you.
Apollo Galactica, Apollo. We are being passed around like beach balls down here. Visibility about two, best spectrum.
Dualla Copy, Apollo.
Apollo Whoa! Blue flight, go vertical, now, now, now!
Caprica_Boomer Anything?
Helo No. I dont think anyones left out there.
Caprica_Boomer There must be someone. We cant be the only two people left in the world.
Helo Well, good news is my legs much better. And weve got anti-radiation meds to last three months. I say we load up as much food as we can and-
Caprica_Boomer ...move out. Try to find a Raptor or a transport or something we can fly off Caprica. Unless you can think of a reason to stay.
Helo Im not really looking forward to going back out there. Ive almost started to think of this place as...
Helo_&_Caprica_Boomer ...home.
Helo No, sleep a little longer. Who knows when well find clean sheets again. Im gonna go topside and make some breakfast.
Helo Breakfast...
Caprica_Boomer Hey, is breakfast ready?
Helo Sharon, get out of here! Go, go, go!
Starbuck Lords, its Kara Thrace. Im running a little low on O2 and I could use a lucky break. No? Okay, just thought Id mention it. Oh, frak. Not bad shooting if I do say so myself. Lords, I owe you one. Looks like I found my ride out of here... if I can fix you up.
Apollo Galactica, Apollo. Bingo fuel.
Dualla Roger, Apollo, return to base.
Apollo What, cant you tank me in orbit?
Dualla Negative, Apollo, the tankers are refilling. Youll be dry before they can launch.
Adama Are these figures correct?
Gaeta Yes, sir, atmospheric ops mean that Viper and Raptor engines have to run continuously. Fuels gonna be a real problem if we keep it up.
Adama Any report from the civilian ships?
Tigh Nothing. Theyre spread pretty far out. Were gonna have a hell of a time trying to cover them if the Cylons pop in. We should consider pulling the civvies into a defensible formation.
Adama No... keep all the ships on the search. Weve left enough people behind. I dont wanna leave Starbuck behind.
Tigh Im just saying, committing the entire fleet to this search-
Adama I said no! Were gonna find our missing pilot! And were gonna bring her home. We leave no one behind. Resume your duties.
Helo Sharon?! Sharon, where are you? Damn it Sharon, where are you?
Helo Sharon?! Sharon...?!
Starbuck Frak me. Are you... alive? And she keeps going at it with the knife.
Tyrol What the hell happened this time, Captain?
Apollo I hit the roll thrusters to level off for set down but only the left one fired.
Tyrol Oh, gods, its that crap youre flyin into down there. Gums everything up.
Apollo Get me another Viper.
Tyrol Id love to, Captain but this is 13 Vipers that are down plus your Mark 7. Im out!
Apollo Damn it, Ive got a pilot down and I need another Viper now!
Tyrol I realize that, Captain but you can push people a hell of a lot further than you can push machines.
Apollo Tyrol, Im the CAG, youre the Chief, just make it happen.
Gaeta Commander, the clock has passed five hours, sir, for Starbucks O2 supply.
Adama Noted.
Gaeta Heres the photo mosaic for the area weve searched so far.
Adama We gotta do better than this.
Tigh Cant see very far when youre hugging the ground.
Apollo You cant see anything at all from altitude, not to mention the crap in the air that keeps screwing up our ships. 13 Vipers down for repairs.
Adama We need more eyes.
Tigh Yeah, where you gonna get em?
Apollo Pull the CAP.
Tigh What?
Apollo Redeploy the combat air patrol to the search.
Tigh Bad idea, the CAP is the fleets only defense. If all our Vipers are frakin around on the moon when the Cylons come calling, were maggot meat.
Apollo Well, then bring the fleet closer to the moon. We can always scramble the Vipers from the search to meet any attack.
Tigh You gotta be kidding.
Apollo Bottom line: we can double the area we can search in the time we have left.
Tigh Starbuck would be the first one to tell you not to do this.
Apollo Nothing would make you happier would it? Leave her behind, get rid of the foul-mouthed insubordinate pilot that keeps challenging your authority.
Tigh You are way out of line, mister, Im not the one confusing personal feelings with duty.
Apollo Oh, yeah? What the hell does that mean?
Tigh It means you are way too close to this because she is your friend-
Adama Gentlemen! We have work to do. Captain, get as many birds up in the air as you can and you find our girl.
Apollo You got it.
Starbuck Oh... my... gods... you bite me and Ill bite you back. So, I guess the only thing flying you, is you. This must be your brain. I dont think youll need it. Its a good thing that I brought one of my own. Frak... even cockroaches have to breathe. How the hell do you?
Socinus Captain, call for you, sir!
Apollo Can someone finish this up for me?
Creman Sure.
Apollo Where is it?
Scoinus That way.
Apollo Yeah, Apollo.
Billy Call from President Roslin.
Roslin How are you holding up?
Apollo Better than my Viper. Were slapping one together from pieces of the others.
Roslin I need your help. Do you know that your father just redeployed the combat air patrol?
Apollo Yes, Madam President, it was my idea.
Roslin Your idea?
Apollo We need every Viper weve got.
Roslin Now, maybe Im missing something about the tactics involved here, but isnt the fleet defenseless without the C.A.P.?
Apollo only for a short time. Because after that... because after that, Karas oxygen will be gone and shell be dead.
Roslin Are you very close with Lieutenant Thrace?
Apollo Im close with all my pilots.
Roslin And I assume the same is true for your father?
Apollo His pilots mean a lot to him, to all of us. We dont leave anyone behind.
Roslin But we have left people behind, you know that.
Apollo Not this time. Your F.T.L. drive should be spun up and ready. Just make sure everyone is set to jump at the first sign of trouble.
Roslin With all due respect, Captain, there are times when it is necessary for the safety of the fleet to-
Apollo Not this time. Madam President, we just havent exhausted all the options and the safety of the fleet has not been compromised.
Roslin I hope you find her.
Apollo Thank you.
Gaeta Blue flight reports bingo fuel, sir.
Adama Have them stay on the search. Send the tanker to them. Is there a problem, Mr. Gaeta?
Gaeta Its just that trying to tank in that turbulence, sir, will be extremely hairy. I suggest we wait until the clock has run down and then tank them up on the way back to Galactica.
Adama Did someone call them back to Galactica?
Gaeta I just assumed-
Adama ...the search was over? That it was hopeless? That we should write Starbuck off as dead? Is that what youre telling me, Mr. Gaeta?
Gaeta No, sir.
Adama Then what are you trying to tell me, Mr. Gaeta? You have your orders.
Gaeta Yes, sir.
Tigh Times up, shes out of O2.
Adama The clock is a guess. We dont know for a fact Starbuck is out of air.
Tigh Her tank only holds so much oxygen.
Adama She could have a reserve supply in her survival gear.
Tigh A reserve?
Adama Yes.
Tigh What, she just happened to pack an extra bottle today?
Adama Its possible.
Tigh We are putting people at risk. We have pilots out there who are pushing themselves and their ships too hard, all for the sake of-
Adama We are not quitting. And you are relieved, Colonel.
Tigh I stand relieved, sir.
Starbuck Come on... youre part biological, right? Which means that you need oxygen, right? So, its gotta be here... somewhere.
Dualla Commander, the President.
Adama Adama.
Roslin Commander Adama, I just want to say how very sorry I am about Lieutenant Thrace. Please give my condolences to your son and to the rest of the crew.
Adama Excuse me, maam, but I think youve been misinformed.
Roslin How?
Adama We dont know if Starbucks dead.
Roslin I was told that her oxygen had run out a half an hour ago?
Adama Thats an estimate. She may have a reserve supply. Well continue the search as long as theres a chance she may be alive.
Roslin And how long will that be?
Adama Until I say stop. This is a military decision, Madam President. Thank you for your concern.
Starbuck First on the list: seal you up, and figure out what controls what. one of us needs a bath... ugh. All right... now youre gonna teach me how to fly.
Gaeta Commander? Red flight reports an area of highlands here. Increased visibility out to 15 clicks, maybe.
Adama Its the wrong side of the moon-
Dualla Excuse me, Commander?
Adama Almost impossible for her to land there-
Dualla Sir, we have a signal from Colonial ones shuttle. They request permission to land. They have the President on board, sir.
Adama Why wasnt I notified the President was coming on board?
Dualla There was no advance notice, sir. I didnt know she was coming.
Adama Lets go. Have Colonel Tigh meet her at the airlock and bring her to my quarters, please.
Dualla Very well.
Starbuck Every flying machine has four basic controls: power, pitch, yaw and roll. Where are yours? Safety tip number one: dont touch that.
Tigh Are you gonna order us to stop the search?
Roslin I came here to talk, not to give orders.
Tigh It may take an order.
Roslin Why? Colonel Tigh, do I need to know something?
Tigh Its gone beyond military needs. Its personal. For the Commander and for Lee too. Because of Lieutenant Thrace. Because of her, and because of Zak Adama.
Roslin The Commanders dead son?
Tigh Its complicated. It would take about three weeks to explain.
Roslin Weve got about three minutes, talk fast.
Adama Shes gonna press.
Apollo Im with you.
Tigh President Roslin.
Adama Madam President.
Roslin Skip the formalities, you both know why Im here.
Adama Termination of a pilots rescue mission is a military decision.
Roslin Thats a bunch of crap. This isnt military, its personal. Neither of you can let go of Kara Thrace because shes your last link to Zak.
Apollo You dont know anything about my brother-
Roslin Dont even begin, Captain. Youve lost perspective, as have you. Under normal circumstances it would just be sad that the two of you cant come to terms with Zaks death. In this situation, youre putting your pilots at risk and youre exposing the entire fleet to possible attack every moment we stay here.
Adama Weve been at risk of an attack since day one. s wont be missing the patrol for at least one more day.
Roslin Colonel Tigh, how much aviation fuel has been expended in this operation?
Tigh 43% of reserves.
Roslin Almost half. Thats unacceptable. And operations in the moons atmosphere have put one-third of your fighters out of action. That is also completely unacceptable.
Adama Crap unacceptable. Whatever it is you feel about this, the recovery of one pilot is a military matter.
Roslin All right... its military, fine. And youre both officers and youre both honorable men and youre both perfectly aware that you are putting the lives of over 45,000 people and the future of this civilization at risk, for your personal feelings. Now, if the two of you, of all people, can live with that, then the human race doesnt stand a chance. Clear your heads.
Apollo Combat, stand by.
Adama This is the Commander. Terminate search operations, bring everyone home. Prepare the fleet to make a jump into the next system. Were leaving.
Starbuck Okay, so it either works or it doesnt. Okay, okay... thats power, roll, pitch and yaw. We have control. Take me home! Oh, you stink, but youre one hell of a flying machine!
Apollo I want you to know, I think shes wrong. I think we have come to terms with what happened to Zak.
Adama I havent.
Apollo I need to know something: why did you do this? Why did we do this? Is it for Kara? For Zak? For what?
Adama Kara was family. You do whatever you have to do. Sometimes you break the rules.
Apollo And if it was me down there instead?
Adama You dont have to ask that.
Apollo Are you sure?
Adama If it were you... wed never leave.
Adama Colonel.
Tigh Commander.
Adama Resume your duties.
Tigh Sir. Fighters are aboard, sir. Civilian ships have begun their jumps to the next star system. You give the word, well start our clock.
Adama Start the clock.
Tigh Mr. Gaeta, start the clock.
Adama Madam President, would you like to return to your ship?
Roslin Thank you, Ill stay here. Id like to see how the professionals do it.
Adama As you wish. Execute jump, Lieutenant Gaeta.
Gaeta Aye, sir. Jump clock is running. Navigation?
Navigation_Officer Go!
Gaeta F.T.L.?
FTL_Officer Go!
Gaeta Tactical?
Tactical_Officer Go!
Gaeta Flight Ops?
Dualla Contact! Dradis contact. Incoming, bearing zero-six-zero carom three-zero-eight.
Adama Hold count.
Gaeta Count held.
Dualla Contact is...
Adama Well?
Dualla Raider, sir.
Adama You were right, its just a matter of time.
Dualla Hes on an intercept course. Hell be on us before we complete the jump, sir.
Adama Action stations, launch Vipers.
Tigh Action stations, action stations. Launch the Alert fighters, Raider approaching.
Starbuck Okay... now, look before you shoot, please.
Gaeta Gun captains report weapons manned and ready.
Tigh Where the hell are the Vipers?
Dualla Most are being fueled. Hotdog and Apollo are in the tubes.
Flight_Computer Viper one, clear forward, navcon-green. Interval failure, abort launch.
Hotdog Frak! Frak, frak, frak!
Apollo I guess Im going solo.
Roslin Why only one this time?
Tigh Could be a lone recon mission, or the vanguard for a base ship about to jump on top of us. Either way, were gonna have to take it out before we can jump.
Apollo Galactica, Apollo. Target in sight.
Starbuck You idiot! Didnt anybody teach you intercept protocol? Okay, were gonna have to do this the hard way then.
Apollo Lords, this bastards good.
Gaeta Theyre closing fast. Port guns have a firing solution.
Adama Very well.
Apollo Hold still, you little-
Starbuck No cigar for you. Just a little... bit... closer... not that close!
Apollo What the?! Ive lost him! Galactica, I repeat: he is nowhere to be seen.
Adama Dradis?
Gaeta No help, their reports have merged.
Tigh Launch tube status?
Dualla Still fouled. Well have a Viper away in 45 seconds.
Adama_and_Tigh Thisll be over in 45 seconds.
Apollo Holy- Galactica, the is now flying in formation with me, right above my head. This thing is acting weird. Hook me through. Ha ha...! Its Starbuck!
Adama What?! Come again, Apollo.
Apollo Galactica, the Raider is marked Starbuck! Its written under the frakin wing!
Adama Bring it into the bay! If it does anything, take it out!
Apollo Wilco, Galactica, but I tell you what: its has got to be her. This thing is flying with some serious attitude.
Tyrol Now your ass belongs to me.
Starbuck Like my new toy?
Apollo Boy, when you take a souvenir, you dont screw around. Oh, my gods, you smell like a latrine.
Starbuck Mmm... you wanna give me a bath?
Adama How you feeling?
Starbuck Been a hell of a lot worse. Dont have any ambrosia but the doc can fix you up with some really nice stuff. Its not bad, is it? The knee?
Adama Doc says its too early to tell, but knowing you, youll be fine. Kara...
Starbuck Yeah?
Adama You did good... you did real good. Need anything?
Starbuck A stogie would be nice.
Adama I had a feeling. Its my last one, so enjoy.
Starbuck Thank you.
Adama Get some rest.
