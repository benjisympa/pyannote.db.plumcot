Man_on_loudspeaker Attention. The Scorpia Traveler has docked. Civilians currently boarding Galactica, please proceed to security checkpoints.
Marine Next. Next. Next.
Tyrol Its all clear ?
Cally I got your back, Chief.
Tyro Thanks.
Tyrol Anybody see you ?
Boomer No, I went through the hatchcombing on “C” causeway.
Tyrol Mmm, good girl.
Tyrol You know, sometimes, at work... I try and conjure up what your face looks like. The curve of your lips, the way your hair falls, how you smell.
Boomer You see my face every day.
Tyrol Yeah, but not like this.
Tigh Security, X.O. Send an armed detail to meet me in the midpoint promenade deck causeway, “C” level. Approach from aft, repeat, approach from aft.
Adama Doral !
Adama Whats the count ?
Cottle Three dead, 13 injured.
Tigh You get a good look at the bomber ?
Adama Yes.
Tigh It was him, right ?
Adama Yes. I wanna see the master-at-arms in my office, in 10 minutes.
Hadrian A Cylon ? Eyewitness accounts all state the bomber was a man.
Tigh The Cylons look like us now.
Hadrian Like us ?
Adama Yeah, they appear human. Flesh, the blood, the whole thing. The bomber was another copy of a man we knew as Doral, posing as the public relations officer aboard this ship. Weve learned that there are multiple versions of the same Cylon. I want you to open an investigation immediately. I want to find out how that Cylon, or any civilian, could break through our security.
Hadrian There have been a string of security incidents aboard ship, sir. The water tank explosion, the discovery of explosives aboard a raptor, and now this—
Adama your point ?
Hadrian I need a free hand. The authority to follow evidence wherever it might lead, without command review.
Adama Independent tribunal ?
Hadrian Yes, sir.
Adama Youll get it.
Hadrian Thank you.
Adama Thatll be all, Sergeant.
Hadrian I also strongly recommend alerting the public to the Cylon threat. If there are other copies of this man aboard the fleet, we should find them before they strike again.
Adama Ill take that under advisement. Thatll be all.
Hadrian Sirs.
Tigh Open to the public, theres a can of worms.
Adama Keeping silent hasnt helped us very much. Maybe shining a light on the situation will make things pop up.
Tigh All right.
Adama Hey... I owe you one.
Tigh Sir.
Adama Colonel. … Get me the president.
Cally Dont pinch the line... there. You got it.
Socinus All right, okay, lets go.
Cally So whos first ?
Tyrol How bout me ?
Jammer Hey, Chief. Hows it goin, up top ?
Cally Hi.
Tyrol Come on, lets have it. Come on. you people are the sorriest of the sorry, the dumbest of the dumb. The only thing youre makin out of this is a one-way trip to sickbay or the morgue. Now, tonight, after night call, one of you brings me twice that length of copper tubing, a spot heater, and a C-O-2 scrubber. Ill show you people how this is done. All right ? Now get the hell out of here, before I change my mind. Thank you.
Tyrol children.
#6 hes very handsome.
Doral you really think so ?
Caprica_Boomer She says that about everyone.
#6 You disagree ?
Caprica_Boomer Hes attractive.
#6 I hope youre more convincing than that with him.
Caprica_Boomer If he wants to find me, hell head north towards Cylon forces hes already seen. If he wants to go alone, hell go south, hoping to find another way off the planet. Either way, he wont make his move until nightfall.
Doral If he flees, he dies.
Roslin Theres going to be a huge reaction.
Adama If there are any other Cylons aboard any of our ships, we need to find them. If we enlist the help of the public, itll make it a lot easier.
Roslin People are going to be shocked, angry, terrified, paranoid. There is a price to be paid, when asking for the publics help. Theyre going to demand, at the very least, that someone be held accountable.
Adama Im setting up a tribunal.
Roslin And that tribunal will have to come back to the public with a name, someone who screwed up.
Adama We dont know if anybody screwed up.
Roslin A Cylon agent penetrated your security, killing three people. At least one of your men or women screwed up. Look, heres my view. Independent tribunal, openness, transparency, it all sounds great. But after 20 years in political office, Im telling you, these things have a way of inflicting damage on the people you least expect. I do not want a witch hunt on our hands.
Hadrian So, where were you at the time of the bombing ?
Cally In my rack, reading some trashy novel Socinus gave me.
Hadrian Did you see the Chief ?
Cally Chief ? He was on the hangar deck, going over some paperwork, I think.
Hadrian How do you know that, if you were in your rack ?
Cally Oh. I saw him right before I turned in.
Jammer I was with Cally, playing pyramid in the mess hall corridor.
Hadrian You sure ?
Jammer Oh, yeah, yeah, shes pretty good.
Hadrian See the Chief ?
Jammer Yeah, he was there. I mean, not the whole time, but he dropped in and watched us play for a while.
Hadrian Okay.
Socinus I was on watch.
Hadrian Did you see the Chief ?
Socinus The Chief ? No.
Hadrian He wasnt on the hangar deck ?
Socinus No. Oh, wait, yeah. Yeah, yeah, he was. He came in, did some work on one of the vipers that the captain rides.
Hadrian Thank you. ...
Tyrol Asleep in my rack.
Hadrian You sure about that ?
Tyrol Positive. I was asleep, Sergeant.
Hadrian All right. Thatll be all for now.
Tyrol What do you got ?
Roslin Good afternoon, and thank you for coming. Please be seated. Im sure, by now, word of the explosion on Galactica has spread through the entire fleet. We offer our continued gratitude to the brave men and women aboard this mighty ship. In consultation with Commander Adama, I have appointed an independent tribunal to investigate the circumstances surrounding this explosion. Also, in the interest of security and public safety, I feel it is time to reveal certain information that has, until now, remained a tightly guarded secret. This information was known only to myself, commander Adama, and a few select advisers.
Tigh Cats out of the bag.
Roslin The Cylons have the ability to mimic human form, they look like us now. We have reason to believe that a Cylon agent was responsible for the explosions aboard Galactica. This man has been identified as a Cylon agent. We believe him to be responsible for the bombing. He evidently slipped aboard the Galactica with a civilian group, killed a marine guard, stole the explosives, and detonated them, killing three members of the crew, and destroying himself. This man has also been identified as a Cylon, and we now know that there are duplicates of each Cylon model. Anyone seeing either of these two men, at any time, anywhere in the fleet, should immediately contact the Battlestar Galactica and the office of the president. Now Ill take your questions.
Jammer Theyve known about this the whole time, they just decide to tell us now ?
Socinus A Cylon ? Cylon ? I mean, whos a Cylon now ?
Cally This is too much. I dont even wanna know this.
Hadrian Excuse me. Sir, will you come with us, please ?
Boomer What, why ?
Tyrol Whats up, whats goin on, Sergeant ?
Hadrian Chief, need you to come along as well.
Jammer Youre arresting the Chief ?
Socinus Whos arresting the Chief ?
Hadrian No one is under arrest.
Crashdown Whats the meaning of all this ?
Hadrian Step back.
Crashdown Ooh...
Tyrol The Lieutenant asked you a question, Sergeant.
Hadrian A tribunal has been convened to look into the Cylon penetration of our defenses. It requires the presence of Lt. Valerii and Chief Tyrol, and I am here to escort them to the ward room, sir.
Crashdown Very well, proceed.
Hadrian Thank you, sir. Lieutenant, Chief, if youll come with me, please.
Tyrol Youre it til I get back, dont worry.
Hadrian Lt. Valerii, where were you at the time of the explosion ?
Boomer Um, I was in my rack, asleep.
Hadrian Did anyone see you, sir ?
Boomer I dont know, I was asleep.
Hadrian Lieutenant, is it true that you and the Chief are involved in a romantic and physical relationship, in violation of the Colonial Code of Military Conduct ?
Boomer I thought this was about—
Hadrian Just answer the question, please. Are you and the Chief involved in a relationship ?
Boomer No. The X.O. Ordered us to put a stop to it, so we did.
Hadrian Sir, can you testify as to the whereabouts of Chief Petty Officer Tyrol at the time of the bombing ?
Boomer I have no idea where he was.
Hadrian Thank you, sir.
Candice_Myson Youre excused, Lieutenant.
Boomer But I am sure he had nothing to do with the bombing—
Candice_Myson You are excused, Lieutenant.
Hadrian Bring in the next witness, please.
Hadrian The testimony you give before this tribunal may be used to adjudicate your guilt, or innocence, in the matter under investigation. Do you understand ?
Tyrol Yes.
Hadrian The matter being investigated is, first, how a Cylon penetrated Galacticas security system, and, second, whether one of Galacticas crew members aided and abetted this crime through conspiracy and collusion with the Cylons.
Tyrol Collusion with the Cylons...
Hadrian Do you consent to give your testimony freely, without invoking your right to remain silent, as provided for under the 23rd Article of Colonization ?
Tyrol I do.
Hadrian Then lets begin.
Cally Theyre going after the Chief.
Jammer Theyre going after the Cylons.
Socinus What the hell does that mean ?
Jammer Wake up ! Worlds changed while you were asleep, little man.
Socinus Frak you.
Jammer Cylons look like people, that means anyone. Anyone.
Cally Not the Chief.
Jammer How do you know ?
Cally I know.
Socinus This is stupid.
Jammer No, you two just dont wanna deal with reality, you wanna keep your heads buried in the sand.
Cally Thats exactly what the Cylons want, for us to turn on each other. Start getting suspicious, paranoid.
Socinus Shes right. If we dont believe in each other, then we dont got each others backs when the heat comes down. We aint nothin.
Jammer Nah, that kinda thinkin is over. Its every man for himself now. You better watch your backs.
Hadrian You had the mid watch, before the bombing, correct ?
Tyrol Yes.
Hadrian Will you please explain to the tribunal what you do on watch ?
Tyrol I walk the perimeter of the hangar deck, the tool room, storage facilities.
Hadrian Make sure all hatches are sealed ?
Tyrol Yes.
Hadrian That no unauthorized personnel is poking around where they shouldnt ?
Tyrol Thats right. And there was no one on the hangar deck that night.
Hadrian Hmm. I believe thats what your log says. What about the hatchcombing for causeway “C” ?
Flashback_Tyrol Anybody see you ?
Flashback_Boomer No, I went through the hatchcombing on “C” causeway.
Hadrian Your log indicates that all hatches and portals were locked and sealed.
Tyrol If thats what the log indicates, then thats the case.
Hadrian Which would include the hatchcombing for causeway “C”.
Tyrol You know, I dont know where the Sergeant is going with this, but theyre not related.
Hadrian What if I told you that I found the hatch open after the bombing ?
Tyrol I would say that I dont know how thats possible.
Hadrian And its not just any hatch on the hangar deck, it opens onto a causeway which leads directly to a small arms locker, where a marine guard was found dead at the scene. The locker was opened with the correct code. Do you have the correct code to that locker, Chief ?
Chief Yes, I do, as do dozens of others, including the guard. Its possible the Cylon forced the guard to open it before he killed him. I would also like to take this opportunity to point out that that was an internal security matter, and internal security falls under the purview of the master-at-arms, and the master-at-arms is Sergeant Hadrian.
Hadrian Did Lt. Valerii leave the hatchcombing open last night ?
Tyrol I have no idea who left the hatchcombing open last night.
Hadrian Chief, were you doing paperwork at the time of the bombing ?
Tyrol No.
Hadrian Chief, were you working on a viper at the time of the bombing ?
Tyrol No.
Hadrian Chief, were you watching a pickup game of pyramid in the mess hall at the time of the bombing ?
Tyrol No, as I told you earlier today, I was asleep in my rack.
Hadrian Then why do I have three different statements from three of your deckhands, stating variously that they all saw you, and you were anywhere but in your rack. Chief Tyrol, where were you at the time of the bombing ? Were you, in fact, meeting with a Cylon agent ?
Tyrol I exercise my right under article 23.
Hadrian By invoking the 23rd article at this time, the tribunal will look on this as further evidence of your guilt, so I will ask you one last time. Who were you with at the time of the bombing, and was this person a Cylon agent
Hadrian Specialist, your sworn statement indicates that you were on watch at the time of the bombing, and that you saw Chief Tyrol work on one of the vipers. Is that true ?
Socinus Yes, sir.
Hadrian Specialist, can you explain to us why Chief Tyrol told us, in his testimony, that he was in his rack, asleep at the time of the bombing ?
Socinus Uh...
Hadrian Speak up, Specialist.
Socinus He said that ?
Hadrian Did you see him, or didnt you ? Specialist.
Socinus No. No, I did not, sir.
Hadrian So the Chief did not come to the hangar deck after all ?
Socinus I dont know, I, uh... I left my post.
Hadrian Excuse me ?
Socinus I left my post, sir. I, uh, I ducked out to get a smoke. I went to the galley to get some chow, the Chief... I dont know where he was. Im sure he was asleep in his rack, just like he said.
Hadrian You went to the galley ?
Socinus Yes, sir.
Hadrian Did you go through the hatchcombing on “C” deck ?
Socinus Well, to get to the galley, thatd be the best way. Yes, sir, I went through the hatch.
Hadrian Did you leave it open ?
Socinus Im not sure. Yes, sir, I think I did. But the Chief had nothin to do with it. It was me, I left my post, and I left the hatch open. It was me, just me.
Hadrian Well, you realize, dont you, that by leaving the hatch open, you allowed a Cylon to gain access to a small arms locker ?
Socinus Yes, sir.
Hadrian Specialist, did Chief Tyrol instruct you to leave the hatch open deliberately, as part of a conspiracy to allow the Cylon to gain access to the small arms locker ?
Socinus The Chief is innocent, he didnt do anything.
Hadrian Specialist, did you leave the hatch open deliberately ?
Socinus Yes, sir. Whatever happened, it was me. Just me.
Doral South. You overestimated his willingness to risk himself for you.
#6 He just doesnt love you.
Caprica_Boomer Wait.
Doral North, toward his love. Seems you made an impression after all.
Caprica_Boomer Hes a good man. He always does the right thing.
Doral Are you prepared for the next step ?
Caprica_Boomer Yes.
Baltar Hello, Lieutenant.
Starbuck Doctor.
Baltar I, um, I brought you a cigar. Recovery gift. How are you ?
Starbuck Im good. The, uh, food is good, companys better.
Baltar Yes, well, I just happened to be absolutely nowhere near sickbay, and I thought I would, uh, see how youre doing.
Starbuck So, doctor, youre super-secret projects on “C” deck, right ?
Baltar Im not at liberty to divulge exactly what I am doing on “C” deck, but youre more than welcome to pop by once youre ambulatory.
Starbuck The bomber was on “C” deck, right ?
Baltar Yes, I know, I heard the explosion. Very frightening.
Starbuck Do you think thats where it was headed ?
Baltar Im sorry, I dont follow you.
The_Cylon_bomber Do you think that he was trying to blow up your project ?
#6 And you along with it ?
Baltar Its funny, I hadnt thought of that.
Starbuck Kinda hits you where you live, huh ?
Baltar Yes, it does, actually. Um... you get well soon.
Baltar Theyre trying to kill me.
#6 Me, me, always me. Theyre trying to destroy your work. Destroying you is an added bonus.
Baltar But why ? Thats what I dont understand, why ? Why are they trying to blow me up ?  Youre the one that told me what to do in the first place. I wouldnt even be making this flipping Cylon detector if it wasnt for you.
#6 But Im just in your head, Gaius. They dont know about me, or us, or our life together.
Baltar How romantic.  Well, Im going to have to destroy that Cylon detector myself, blame the sabotage on Cylon agents, thats what Ill tell Adama-- oh !
#6 No, you wont. Youre gonna complete the project, just like I told you.
Baltar Really. Will I ? Or what ?
#6 Dont make me angry, Gaius. You wouldnt like me when Im angry.
Doral Sharon ?
Caprica_Boomer Is that enough ?
#6 No, Sharon wouldnt give up without a much harder fight.
Adama Did you read the tribunal report.
Rolsin Yes, and Im sorry to read that one of your men has been charged with conspiracy and collusion with a Cylon agent.
Adama Specialist Socinus. But, after reading the transcripts, I have my doubts.
Roslin What about this other man, your Chief Tyrol ? He took the 23rd. What is that about, do you think ?
Adama Its his right. The courts have never held that invoking the right to remain silent can be used as evidence of guilt.
Roslin You sound like a lawyer.
Adama My father was a lawyer, civil liberties.
Roslin Lets set aside the legalities for a moment. Obviously, you are defending your man. I respect that, I do, but he is hiding something.
Adama Chief tyrols been under my command for over five years, and if he really wanted to take this ship down, he could. I think this is over. Madam President, Im gonna have to call you right back. What ?
Marine_Coporal I have orders to bring you before the tribunal, sir.
Adama Lets go.
Helo Its okay.
Caprica_Boomer Helo, how did you know... I was up here ?
Helo Shh. Okay, can you, can you walk ?
Caprica_Boomer I think so.
Helo Come on. Okay, okay. Now were even.
Caprica_Boomer I think we should go.
Helo All right, okay. Come on. Its gonna be all right. Youre gonna be just fine.
Hadrian Commander Adama, when did you first learn the truth about the Cylons ?
Adama on ragnar station, before we left.
Hadrian And you chose to withhold this crucial information, sir.
Adama Yes.
Hadrian Why ?
Adama I felt that to alarm the public would only cause chaos and panic.
Hadrian But you also withheld the information from your own security detachment aboard ship, sir.
Adama Not knowing who to trust, I decided to keep the information compartmentalized for the time being.
Hadrian Sir, isnt it true, that, had we known that the Cylons appeared human, different security procedures would have been followed ?
Adama Probably. But I had to weight the possible ramifications of both.
Hadrian Well, isnt it also true, sir, that, had different procedures been followed, the bombing may have been prevented.
Adama Thats speculative.
Hadrian Im asking if its possible.
Adama I know what youre asking, sergeant. I will not speculate as to what might have happened.
Hadrian Do you personally believe that a Cylon agent planted explosives in the ships water tank ?
Adama Yes.
Hadrian Do you believe that there are Cylon agents aboard ship even as we speak ?
Adama Yes, I do.
Hadrian Sir, isnt it true that you knew that Lt. Valerii and Chief Tyrol were having an illicit relationship, in violation of regulations ?
Adama I dont see the relevance of this line of questioning, sergeant.
Hadrian Well, the Commander should bear in mind that my questions are not subject to Commanders review. Why did you allow the relationship to continue, knowing it was against regulations ?
Adama Im a soft touch.
Hadrian Sir, are you aware of the fact that both Lt. Valerii and Chief Tyrol have been implicated as possibly being in collusion with the Cylons ?
Adama Im aware of the allegations. Where are you going with this, Sergeant ?
Hadrian I will ask the questions, sir. Isnt it true that, by allowing their relationship to continue, in violation of regulations, you may have made it possible for two Cylon collaborators to compromise the safety and security of this ship ?
Adama were done here.
Hadrian Excuse me, sir, but my questions are not finished.
Adama Youve lost your way, sergeant. Youve lost sight of the purpose of the law, to protect its citizens, not persecute them. Whatever we are, whatevers left of us, were better than that. Now, these proceedings are closed. Youll be transported back to your ships, and we appreciate your help.
Candice_Myson Commander. This is an independent board. You have no authority to close our inquiry.
Adama This is a witch hunt. I will not have it aboard my ship.
Hadrian Corporal of the guard, restrain the Commander and return him to the witness chair.
Adama Your orders are to escort Sgt. Hadrian back to her quarters and keep her in confinement until further notice. Make your choice, son.
Marine_Corporal Sgt. Hadrian, if youll come with us, please.
Roslin Good evening, have a seat. The investigation into the suicide bombing aboard Galactica and how it was allowed to occur has come to a close. You are all aware that the bomber was a Cylon agent. The tribunal has determined that the Cylon gained access to the explosives by going through a hatch door in the hangar deck of the ship. This door was left open due to negligence of one of the ships crewmen. His name is specialist Socinus. He has confessed to lying under oath and dereliction of duty in time of war. Hes been stripped of his rank, and confined to the brig. At this point, we have no reason to believe that there were any other parties responsible. Now Ill take your questions. You, sir.
Tyrol Commander, permission to enter.
Adama What is it, Chief ?
Tyrol Thank you, sir. Sir, I believe that Socinus... I believe that his confession was a lie. I think that hes covering for me.
Adama For you ?
Tyrol I think that hes doing this out of a sense of misplaced loyalty to me.
Adama Somewhere in this theres truth. You care to take me to it ?
Tyrol Sir, I was with Lt. Valerii at the time of the bombing. The deck gang, they all knew it. Theyve known all along. Theyre trying to cover for me, they started lying. Socinus... I dont know, I think that he thinks that hes helping protect me, by taking a fall like this.
Adama You dont really know whether he was on duty or not, do you ?
Tyrol Commander, hes innocent. I know that much. I should be in the brig.
Adama Thats a fact. You should be in the brig.
Tyrol Commander, this isnt right. You cant let an innocent kid—
Adama I cant ? What I cant do is I cant let someone that wears this uniform get on a witness stand and lie under oath. And thats what your man did. He either lied the first time, or he lied the second time. And it doesnt matter. Hes guilty, and hell pay the price. You, youll pay a different price. Youll have to walk out on that hangar deck every day, knowing that one of your men is in the brig because you couldnt keep your fly zipped. Youre the most experienced non-commissioned officer we have left. You keep my planes flying. I need my planes to fly. Dismissed.
Tyrol Sir.
Boomer Hi...
Tyrol Sharon, no, no, no.
Boomer What ?
Tyrol Sharon, were done. Its over.
Boomer What do you mean, its over ?
Tyrol I love you, I really do. Im sorry.
Boomer Wait a minute. I deserve more of an explanation than that.
Tyrol Sure. one of my men is in the brig, confessed to a crime that he didnt commit to protect me, to protect us. Well, there can be no more us. No more secrets, no more lies, thats it. Its over.
Boomer I cant believe you can just turn your back on us.
Tyrol I put everything on the line for you, everything. I cover for you, I protect you. I risked my career, my freedom, my integrity, for what ? So some innocent kid, one of my kids, can take the fall for me ? No ! We are not worth that.
Boomer Okay. Guess Ill see ya round.
Tyrol one more thing... did you leave the hatchcombing open last night ?
Boomer What ?
Tyrol Did you leave the hatchcombing open last night ?
Boomer What are you saying ? That I helped the Cylon ?
Tyrol I didnt say anything. I was just asking you a question. I think I deserve an answer.
Boomer You have the only answer youre ever gonna get.
