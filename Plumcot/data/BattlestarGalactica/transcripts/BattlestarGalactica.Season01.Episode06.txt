Man_on_loudspeaker#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode06 Attention. The Scorpia Traveler has docked. Civilians currently boarding Galactica, please proceed to security checkpoints.
Marine#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode06 Next. Next. Next.
chief_galen_tyrol Its all clear ?
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson I got your back, Chief.
Tyro#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode06 Thanks.
chief_galen_tyrol Anybody see you ?
lt_sharon_valerii No, I went through the hatchcombing on “C” causeway.
chief_galen_tyrol Mmm, good girl.
chief_galen_tyrol You know, sometimes, at work... I try and conjure up what your face looks like. The curve of your lips, the way your hair falls, how you smell.
lt_sharon_valerii You see my face every day.
chief_galen_tyrol Yeah, but not like this.
colonel_saul_tigh Security, X.O. Send an armed detail to meet me in the midpoint promenade deck causeway, “C” level. Approach from aft, repeat, approach from aft.
admiral_william_adama Doral !
admiral_william_adama Whats the count ?
dr_cottle Three dead, 13 injured.
colonel_saul_tigh You get a good look at the bomber ?
admiral_william_adama Yes.
colonel_saul_tigh It was him, right ?
admiral_william_adama Yes. I wanna see the master-at-arms in my office, in 10 minutes.
sgt_hadrian A Cylon ? Eyewitness accounts all state the bomber was a man.
colonel_saul_tigh The Cylons look like us now.
sgt_hadrian Like us ?
admiral_william_adama Yeah, they appear human. Flesh, the blood, the whole thing. The bomber was another copy of a man we knew as Doral, posing as the public relations officer aboard this ship. Weve learned that there are multiple versions of the same Cylon. I want you to open an investigation immediately. I want to find out how that Cylon, or any civilian, could break through our security.
sgt_hadrian There have been a string of security incidents aboard ship, sir. The water tank explosion, the discovery of explosives aboard a raptor, and now this—
admiral_william_adama your point ?
sgt_hadrian I need a free hand. The authority to follow evidence wherever it might lead, without command review.
admiral_william_adama Independent tribunal ?
sgt_hadrian Yes, sir.
admiral_william_adama Youll get it.
sgt_hadrian Thank you.
admiral_william_adama Thatll be all, Sergeant.
sgt_hadrian I also strongly recommend alerting the public to the Cylon threat. If there are other copies of this man aboard the fleet, we should find them before they strike again.
admiral_william_adama Ill take that under advisement. Thatll be all.
sgt_hadrian Sirs.
colonel_saul_tigh Open to the public, theres a can of worms.
admiral_william_adama Keeping silent hasnt helped us very much. Maybe shining a light on the situation will make things pop up.
colonel_saul_tigh All right.
admiral_william_adama Hey... I owe you one.
colonel_saul_tigh Sir.
admiral_william_adama Colonel. … Get me the president.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Dont pinch the line... there. You got it.
crewman_specialist_socinus All right, okay, lets go.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson So whos first ?
chief_galen_tyrol How bout me ?
jammer Hey, Chief. Hows it goin, up top ?
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Hi.
chief_galen_tyrol Come on, lets have it. Come on. you people are the sorriest of the sorry, the dumbest of the dumb. The only thing youre makin out of this is a one-way trip to sickbay or the morgue. Now, tonight, after night call, one of you brings me twice that length of copper tubing, a spot heater, and a C-O-2 scrubber. Ill show you people how this is done. All right ? Now get the hell out of here, before I change my mind. Thank you.
chief_galen_tyrol children.
number_six hes very handsome.
aaron_doral you really think so ?
lt_sharon_valerii She says that about everyone.
number_six You disagree ?
lt_sharon_valerii Hes attractive.
number_six I hope youre more convincing than that with him.
lt_sharon_valerii If he wants to find me, hell head north towards Cylon forces hes already seen. If he wants to go alone, hell go south, hoping to find another way off the planet. Either way, he wont make his move until nightfall.
aaron_doral If he flees, he dies.
president_laura_roslin Theres going to be a huge reaction.
admiral_william_adama If there are any other Cylons aboard any of our ships, we need to find them. If we enlist the help of the public, itll make it a lot easier.
president_laura_roslin People are going to be shocked, angry, terrified, paranoid. There is a price to be paid, when asking for the publics help. Theyre going to demand, at the very least, that someone be held accountable.
admiral_william_adama Im setting up a tribunal.
president_laura_roslin And that tribunal will have to come back to the public with a name, someone who screwed up.
admiral_william_adama We dont know if anybody screwed up.
president_laura_roslin A Cylon agent penetrated your security, killing three people. At least one of your men or women screwed up. Look, heres my view. Independent tribunal, openness, transparency, it all sounds great. But after 20 years in political office, Im telling you, these things have a way of inflicting damage on the people you least expect. I do not want a witch hunt on our hands.
sgt_hadrian So, where were you at the time of the bombing ?
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson In my rack, reading some trashy novel Socinus gave me.
sgt_hadrian Did you see the Chief ?
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Chief ? He was on the hangar deck, going over some paperwork, I think.
sgt_hadrian How do you know that, if you were in your rack ?
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Oh. I saw him right before I turned in.
jammer I was with Cally, playing pyramid in the mess hall corridor.
sgt_hadrian You sure ?
jammer Oh, yeah, yeah, shes pretty good.
sgt_hadrian See the Chief ?
jammer Yeah, he was there. I mean, not the whole time, but he dropped in and watched us play for a while.
sgt_hadrian Okay.
crewman_specialist_socinus I was on watch.
sgt_hadrian Did you see the Chief ?
crewman_specialist_socinus The Chief ? No.
sgt_hadrian He wasnt on the hangar deck ?
crewman_specialist_socinus No. Oh, wait, yeah. Yeah, yeah, he was. He came in, did some work on one of the vipers that the captain rides.
sgt_hadrian Thank you. ...
chief_galen_tyrol Asleep in my rack.
sgt_hadrian You sure about that ?
chief_galen_tyrol Positive. I was asleep, Sergeant.
sgt_hadrian All right. Thatll be all for now.
chief_galen_tyrol What do you got ?
president_laura_roslin Good afternoon, and thank you for coming. Please be seated. Im sure, by now, word of the explosion on Galactica has spread through the entire fleet. We offer our continued gratitude to the brave men and women aboard this mighty ship. In consultation with Commander Adama, I have appointed an independent tribunal to investigate the circumstances surrounding this explosion. Also, in the interest of security and public safety, I feel it is time to reveal certain information that has, until now, remained a tightly guarded secret. This information was known only to myself, commander Adama, and a few select advisers.
colonel_saul_tigh Cats out of the bag.
president_laura_roslin The Cylons have the ability to mimic human form, they look like us now. We have reason to believe that a Cylon agent was responsible for the explosions aboard Galactica. This man has been identified as a Cylon agent. We believe him to be responsible for the bombing. He evidently slipped aboard the Galactica with a civilian group, killed a marine guard, stole the explosives, and detonated them, killing three members of the crew, and destroying himself. This man has also been identified as a Cylon, and we now know that there are duplicates of each Cylon model. Anyone seeing either of these two men, at any time, anywhere in the fleet, should immediately contact the Battlestar Galactica and the office of the president. Now Ill take your questions.
jammer Theyve known about this the whole time, they just decide to tell us now ?
crewman_specialist_socinus A Cylon ? Cylon ? I mean, whos a Cylon now ?
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson This is too much. I dont even wanna know this.
sgt_hadrian Excuse me. Sir, will you come with us, please ?
lt_sharon_valerii What, why ?
chief_galen_tyrol Whats up, whats goin on, Sergeant ?
sgt_hadrian Chief, need you to come along as well.
jammer Youre arresting the Chief ?
crewman_specialist_socinus Whos arresting the Chief ?
sgt_hadrian No one is under arrest.
crashdown Whats the meaning of all this ?
sgt_hadrian Step back.
crashdown Ooh...
chief_galen_tyrol The Lieutenant asked you a question, Sergeant.
sgt_hadrian A tribunal has been convened to look into the Cylon penetration of our defenses. It requires the presence of Lt. Valerii and Chief Tyrol, and I am here to escort them to the ward room, sir.
crashdown Very well, proceed.
sgt_hadrian Thank you, sir. Lieutenant, Chief, if youll come with me, please.
chief_galen_tyrol Youre it til I get back, dont worry.
sgt_hadrian Lt. Valerii, where were you at the time of the explosion ?
lt_sharon_valerii Um, I was in my rack, asleep.
sgt_hadrian Did anyone see you, sir ?
lt_sharon_valerii I dont know, I was asleep.
sgt_hadrian Lieutenant, is it true that you and the Chief are involved in a romantic and physical relationship, in violation of the Colonial Code of Military Conduct ?
lt_sharon_valerii I thought this was about—
sgt_hadrian Just answer the question, please. Are you and the Chief involved in a relationship ?
lt_sharon_valerii No. The X.O. Ordered us to put a stop to it, so we did.
sgt_hadrian Sir, can you testify as to the whereabouts of Chief Petty Officer Tyrol at the time of the bombing ?
lt_sharon_valerii I have no idea where he was.
sgt_hadrian Thank you, sir.
candace_myson_tribunal Youre excused, Lieutenant.
lt_sharon_valerii But I am sure he had nothing to do with the bombing—
candace_myson_tribunal You are excused, Lieutenant.
sgt_hadrian Bring in the next witness, please.
sgt_hadrian The testimony you give before this tribunal may be used to adjudicate your guilt, or innocence, in the matter under investigation. Do you understand ?
chief_galen_tyrol Yes.
sgt_hadrian The matter being investigated is, first, how a Cylon penetrated Galacticas security system, and, second, whether one of Galacticas crew members aided and abetted this crime through conspiracy and collusion with the Cylons.
chief_galen_tyrol Collusion with the Cylons...
sgt_hadrian Do you consent to give your testimony freely, without invoking your right to remain silent, as provided for under the 23rd Article of Colonization ?
chief_galen_tyrol I do.
sgt_hadrian Then lets begin.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Theyre going after the Chief.
jammer Theyre going after the Cylons.
crewman_specialist_socinus What the hell does that mean ?
jammer Wake up ! Worlds changed while you were asleep, little man.
crewman_specialist_socinus Frak you.
jammer Cylons look like people, that means anyone. Anyone.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Not the Chief.
jammer How do you know ?
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson I know.
crewman_specialist_socinus This is stupid.
jammer No, you two just dont wanna deal with reality, you wanna keep your heads buried in the sand.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Thats exactly what the Cylons want, for us to turn on each other. Start getting suspicious, paranoid.
crewman_specialist_socinus Shes right. If we dont believe in each other, then we dont got each others backs when the heat comes down. We aint nothin.
jammer Nah, that kinda thinkin is over. Its every man for himself now. You better watch your backs.
sgt_hadrian You had the mid watch, before the bombing, correct ?
chief_galen_tyrol Yes.
sgt_hadrian Will you please explain to the tribunal what you do on watch ?
chief_galen_tyrol I walk the perimeter of the hangar deck, the tool room, storage facilities.
sgt_hadrian Make sure all hatches are sealed ?
chief_galen_tyrol Yes.
sgt_hadrian That no unauthorized personnel is poking around where they shouldnt ?
chief_galen_tyrol Thats right. And there was no one on the hangar deck that night.
sgt_hadrian Hmm. I believe thats what your log says. What about the hatchcombing for causeway “C” ?
chief_galen_tyrol Anybody see you ?
lt_sharon_valerii No, I went through the hatchcombing on “C” causeway.
sgt_hadrian Your log indicates that all hatches and portals were locked and sealed.
chief_galen_tyrol If thats what the log indicates, then thats the case.
sgt_hadrian Which would include the hatchcombing for causeway “C”.
chief_galen_tyrol You know, I dont know where the Sergeant is going with this, but theyre not related.
sgt_hadrian What if I told you that I found the hatch open after the bombing ?
chief_galen_tyrol I would say that I dont know how thats possible.
sgt_hadrian And its not just any hatch on the hangar deck, it opens onto a causeway which leads directly to a small arms locker, where a marine guard was found dead at the scene. The locker was opened with the correct code. Do you have the correct code to that locker, Chief ?
Chief#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode06 Yes, I do, as do dozens of others, including the guard. Its possible the Cylon forced the guard to open it before he killed him. I would also like to take this opportunity to point out that that was an internal security matter, and internal security falls under the purview of the master-at-arms, and the master-at-arms is Sergeant Hadrian.
sgt_hadrian Did Lt. Valerii leave the hatchcombing open last night ?
chief_galen_tyrol I have no idea who left the hatchcombing open last night.
sgt_hadrian Chief, were you doing paperwork at the time of the bombing ?
chief_galen_tyrol No.
sgt_hadrian Chief, were you working on a viper at the time of the bombing ?
chief_galen_tyrol No.
sgt_hadrian Chief, were you watching a pickup game of pyramid in the mess hall at the time of the bombing ?
chief_galen_tyrol No, as I told you earlier today, I was asleep in my rack.
sgt_hadrian Then why do I have three different statements from three of your deckhands, stating variously that they all saw you, and you were anywhere but in your rack. Chief Tyrol, where were you at the time of the bombing ? Were you, in fact, meeting with a Cylon agent ?
chief_galen_tyrol I exercise my right under article 23.
sgt_hadrian By invoking the 23rd article at this time, the tribunal will look on this as further evidence of your guilt, so I will ask you one last time. Who were you with at the time of the bombing, and was this person a Cylon agent
sgt_hadrian Specialist, your sworn statement indicates that you were on watch at the time of the bombing, and that you saw Chief Tyrol work on one of the vipers. Is that true ?
crewman_specialist_socinus Yes, sir.
sgt_hadrian Specialist, can you explain to us why Chief Tyrol told us, in his testimony, that he was in his rack, asleep at the time of the bombing ?
crewman_specialist_socinus Uh...
sgt_hadrian Speak up, Specialist.
crewman_specialist_socinus He said that ?
sgt_hadrian Did you see him, or didnt you ? Specialist.
crewman_specialist_socinus No. No, I did not, sir.
sgt_hadrian So the Chief did not come to the hangar deck after all ?
crewman_specialist_socinus I dont know, I, uh... I left my post.
sgt_hadrian Excuse me ?
crewman_specialist_socinus I left my post, sir. I, uh, I ducked out to get a smoke. I went to the galley to get some chow, the Chief... I dont know where he was. Im sure he was asleep in his rack, just like he said.
sgt_hadrian You went to the galley ?
crewman_specialist_socinus Yes, sir.
sgt_hadrian Did you go through the hatchcombing on “C” deck ?
crewman_specialist_socinus Well, to get to the galley, thatd be the best way. Yes, sir, I went through the hatch.
sgt_hadrian Did you leave it open ?
crewman_specialist_socinus Im not sure. Yes, sir, I think I did. But the Chief had nothin to do with it. It was me, I left my post, and I left the hatch open. It was me, just me.
sgt_hadrian Well, you realize, dont you, that by leaving the hatch open, you allowed a Cylon to gain access to a small arms locker ?
crewman_specialist_socinus Yes, sir.
sgt_hadrian Specialist, did Chief Tyrol instruct you to leave the hatch open deliberately, as part of a conspiracy to allow the Cylon to gain access to the small arms locker ?
crewman_specialist_socinus The Chief is innocent, he didnt do anything.
sgt_hadrian Specialist, did you leave the hatch open deliberately ?
crewman_specialist_socinus Yes, sir. Whatever happened, it was me. Just me.
aaron_doral South. You overestimated his willingness to risk himself for you.
number_six He just doesnt love you.
lt_sharon_valerii Wait.
aaron_doral North, toward his love. Seems you made an impression after all.
lt_sharon_valerii Hes a good man. He always does the right thing.
aaron_doral Are you prepared for the next step ?
lt_sharon_valerii Yes.
dr_gaius_baltar Hello, Lieutenant.
captain_kara_thrace Doctor.
dr_gaius_baltar I, um, I brought you a cigar. Recovery gift. How are you ?
captain_kara_thrace Im good. The, uh, food is good, companys better.
dr_gaius_baltar Yes, well, I just happened to be absolutely nowhere near sickbay, and I thought I would, uh, see how youre doing.
captain_kara_thrace So, doctor, youre super-secret projects on “C” deck, right ?
dr_gaius_baltar Im not at liberty to divulge exactly what I am doing on “C” deck, but youre more than welcome to pop by once youre ambulatory.
captain_kara_thrace The bomber was on “C” deck, right ?
dr_gaius_baltar Yes, I know, I heard the explosion. Very frightening.
captain_kara_thrace Do you think thats where it was headed ?
dr_gaius_baltar Im sorry, I dont follow you.
The_Cylon_bomber#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode06 Do you think that he was trying to blow up your project ?
number_six And you along with it ?
dr_gaius_baltar Its funny, I hadnt thought of that.
captain_kara_thrace Kinda hits you where you live, huh ?
dr_gaius_baltar Yes, it does, actually. Um... you get well soon.
dr_gaius_baltar Theyre trying to kill me.
number_six Me, me, always me. Theyre trying to destroy your work. Destroying you is an added bonus.
dr_gaius_baltar But why ? Thats what I dont understand, why ? Why are they trying to blow me up ? Youre the one that told me what to do in the first place. I wouldnt even be making this flipping Cylon detector if it wasnt for you.
number_six But Im just in your head, Gaius. They dont know about me, or us, or our life together.
dr_gaius_baltar How romantic. Well, Im going to have to destroy that Cylon detector myself, blame the sabotage on Cylon agents, thats what Ill tell Adama-- oh !
number_six No, you wont. Youre gonna complete the project, just like I told you.
dr_gaius_baltar Really. Will I ? Or what ?
number_six Dont make me angry, Gaius. You wouldnt like me when Im angry.
aaron_doral Sharon ?
lt_sharon_valerii Is that enough ?
number_six No, Sharon wouldnt give up without a much harder fight.
admiral_william_adama Did you read the tribunal report.
Rolsin#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode06 Yes, and Im sorry to read that one of your men has been charged with conspiracy and collusion with a Cylon agent.
admiral_william_adama Specialist Socinus. But, after reading the transcripts, I have my doubts.
president_laura_roslin What about this other man, your Chief Tyrol ? He took the 23rd. What is that about, do you think ?
admiral_william_adama Its his right. The courts have never held that invoking the right to remain silent can be used as evidence of guilt.
president_laura_roslin You sound like a lawyer.
admiral_william_adama My father was a lawyer, civil liberties.
president_laura_roslin Lets set aside the legalities for a moment. Obviously, you are defending your man. I respect that, I do, but he is hiding something.
admiral_william_adama Chief tyrols been under my command for over five years, and if he really wanted to take this ship down, he could. I think this is over. Madam President, Im gonna have to call you right back. What ?
marine_corporal I have orders to bring you before the tribunal, sir.
admiral_william_adama Lets go.
captain_karl_agathon Its okay.
lt_sharon_valerii Helo, how did you know... I was up here ?
captain_karl_agathon Shh. Okay, can you, can you walk ?
lt_sharon_valerii I think so.
captain_karl_agathon Come on. Okay, okay. Now were even.
lt_sharon_valerii I think we should go.
captain_karl_agathon All right, okay. Come on. Its gonna be all right. Youre gonna be just fine.
sgt_hadrian Commander Adama, when did you first learn the truth about the Cylons ?
admiral_william_adama on ragnar station, before we left.
sgt_hadrian And you chose to withhold this crucial information, sir.
admiral_william_adama Yes.
sgt_hadrian Why ?
admiral_william_adama I felt that to alarm the public would only cause chaos and panic.
sgt_hadrian But you also withheld the information from your own security detachment aboard ship, sir.
admiral_william_adama Not knowing who to trust, I decided to keep the information compartmentalized for the time being.
sgt_hadrian Sir, isnt it true, that, had we known that the Cylons appeared human, different security procedures would have been followed ?
admiral_william_adama Probably. But I had to weight the possible ramifications of both.
sgt_hadrian Well, isnt it also true, sir, that, had different procedures been followed, the bombing may have been prevented.
admiral_william_adama Thats speculative.
sgt_hadrian Im asking if its possible.
admiral_william_adama I know what youre asking, sergeant. I will not speculate as to what might have happened.
sgt_hadrian Do you personally believe that a Cylon agent planted explosives in the ships water tank ?
admiral_william_adama Yes.
sgt_hadrian Do you believe that there are Cylon agents aboard ship even as we speak ?
admiral_william_adama Yes, I do.
sgt_hadrian Sir, isnt it true that you knew that Lt. Valerii and Chief Tyrol were having an illicit relationship, in violation of regulations ?
admiral_william_adama I dont see the relevance of this line of questioning, sergeant.
sgt_hadrian Well, the Commander should bear in mind that my questions are not subject to Commanders review. Why did you allow the relationship to continue, knowing it was against regulations ?
admiral_william_adama Im a soft touch.
sgt_hadrian Sir, are you aware of the fact that both Lt. Valerii and Chief Tyrol have been implicated as possibly being in collusion with the Cylons ?
admiral_william_adama Im aware of the allegations. Where are you going with this, Sergeant ?
sgt_hadrian I will ask the questions, sir. Isnt it true that, by allowing their relationship to continue, in violation of regulations, you may have made it possible for two Cylon collaborators to compromise the safety and security of this ship ?
admiral_william_adama were done here.
sgt_hadrian Excuse me, sir, but my questions are not finished.
admiral_william_adama Youve lost your way, sergeant. Youve lost sight of the purpose of the law, to protect its citizens, not persecute them. Whatever we are, whatevers left of us, were better than that. Now, these proceedings are closed. Youll be transported back to your ships, and we appreciate your help.
candace_myson_tribunal Commander. This is an independent board. You have no authority to close our inquiry.
admiral_william_adama This is a witch hunt. I will not have it aboard my ship.
sgt_hadrian Corporal of the guard, restrain the Commander and return him to the witness chair.
admiral_william_adama Your orders are to escort Sgt. Hadrian back to her quarters and keep her in confinement until further notice. Make your choice, son.
marine_corporal Sgt. Hadrian, if youll come with us, please.
president_laura_roslin Good evening, have a seat. The investigation into the suicide bombing aboard Galactica and how it was allowed to occur has come to a close. You are all aware that the bomber was a Cylon agent. The tribunal has determined that the Cylon gained access to the explosives by going through a hatch door in the hangar deck of the ship. This door was left open due to negligence of one of the ships crewmen. His name is specialist Socinus. He has confessed to lying under oath and dereliction of duty in time of war. Hes been stripped of his rank, and confined to the brig. At this point, we have no reason to believe that there were any other parties responsible. Now Ill take your questions. You, sir.
chief_galen_tyrol Commander, permission to enter.
admiral_william_adama What is it, Chief ?
chief_galen_tyrol Thank you, sir. Sir, I believe that Socinus... I believe that his confession was a lie. I think that hes covering for me.
admiral_william_adama For you ?
chief_galen_tyrol I think that hes doing this out of a sense of misplaced loyalty to me.
admiral_william_adama Somewhere in this theres truth. You care to take me to it ?
chief_galen_tyrol Sir, I was with Lt. Valerii at the time of the bombing. The deck gang, they all knew it. Theyve known all along. Theyre trying to cover for me, they started lying. Socinus... I dont know, I think that he thinks that hes helping protect me, by taking a fall like this.
admiral_william_adama You dont really know whether he was on duty or not, do you ?
chief_galen_tyrol Commander, hes innocent. I know that much. I should be in the brig.
admiral_william_adama Thats a fact. You should be in the brig.
chief_galen_tyrol Commander, this isnt right. You cant let an innocent kid—
admiral_william_adama I cant ? What I cant do is I cant let someone that wears this uniform get on a witness stand and lie under oath. And thats what your man did. He either lied the first time, or he lied the second time. And it doesnt matter. Hes guilty, and hell pay the price. You, youll pay a different price. Youll have to walk out on that hangar deck every day, knowing that one of your men is in the brig because you couldnt keep your fly zipped. Youre the most experienced non-commissioned officer we have left. You keep my planes flying. I need my planes to fly. Dismissed.
chief_galen_tyrol Sir.
lt_sharon_valerii Hi...
chief_galen_tyrol Sharon, no, no, no.
lt_sharon_valerii What ?
chief_galen_tyrol Sharon, were done. Its over.
lt_sharon_valerii What do you mean, its over ?
chief_galen_tyrol I love you, I really do. Im sorry.
lt_sharon_valerii Wait a minute. I deserve more of an explanation than that.
chief_galen_tyrol Sure. one of my men is in the brig, confessed to a crime that he didnt commit to protect me, to protect us. Well, there can be no more us. No more secrets, no more lies, thats it. Its over.
lt_sharon_valerii I cant believe you can just turn your back on us.
chief_galen_tyrol I put everything on the line for you, everything. I cover for you, I protect you. I risked my career, my freedom, my integrity, for what ? So some innocent kid, one of my kids, can take the fall for me ? No ! We are not worth that.
lt_sharon_valerii Okay. Guess Ill see ya round.
chief_galen_tyrol one more thing... did you leave the hatchcombing open last night ?
lt_sharon_valerii What ?
chief_galen_tyrol Did you leave the hatchcombing open last night ?
lt_sharon_valerii What are you saying ? That I helped the Cylon ?
chief_galen_tyrol I didnt say anything. I was just asking you a question. I think I deserve an answer.
lt_sharon_valerii You have the only answer youre ever gonna get.
