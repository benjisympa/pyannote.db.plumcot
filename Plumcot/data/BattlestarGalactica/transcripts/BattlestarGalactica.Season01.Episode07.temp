Baltar I dont see the hand of god in here. Could I be looking in the wrong place ? Let me see, proteins... yes. Hemoglobins... yes. Divine digits... uh, no. Sorry. Im sure I can find evidence of his divine hand in some of these delightful little samples. After all, there are so fraking many Im sure even I can be relied upon to find god in one of them.
#6 What is it that drives you to blasphemy, Gaius ? A need to tempt fate ?
Baltar Boredom, actually. Indeed, every waking hour is spent in what some might say has become my own personal religion, the church of the mystic Cylon detector.
#6 Well... are you finished ?
#6 If you would give yourself over to gods will, youd find peace in his love like I have.
Baltar Can you help me with the zipper, Im having a bit of trouble—
#6 He has a plan for us.
Baltar How do you know its a he.
#6 There is only one true god.
Baltar Really ? You, uh, you running a glitch in the program or something ? Because you say the same thing over and over again. Now, Ive accepted your god and all that. Cant we reboot the hard drive ?
#6 Hes not my god, he is god.
Baltar Yeah, your god, my god, everyones god-- hes big enough for all of us, isnt he ? Now, please, please, I mean... cant we do something a little more... elevating ?
#6 Its important you form a personal relationship with god. only you can give yourself over to his eternal love.
Baltar Oh, for gods sake ! I cant take this any more !
#6 Im trying to save your immortal soul, Gaius.
Baltar No, what you are doing, darling, is boring me to death with your superstitious drivel, your-- your metaphysical nonsense. Which, to be fair to you, actually appeals to the half-educated dullards that make up most of human society but which, I hasten to add, no rational, intelligent free-thinking human being truly believes. Which leads me to the inescapable conclusion that Cylons are, in the final-- that Cylons are, in the final analysis little more than toasters... with great-looking legs. Its my fantasy, see if I care. Ill, dream up someone new, maybe. Brunette, maybe. really ? Maybe we can dispense with the foreplay, get right down to—
Dualla What did you say ?
Baltar That, um... that was nothing. I was just talking to myself. I talk to myself. Hang me.
Dualla The commander would like to see you in the c-I-c, doctor.
Baltar Ah, there you are. Very nice. Blouse could open up a button or two—
Godfrey Excuse me ?
Baltar Just a thought-- you wanted to see me, commander ?
Adama Miss Godfrey has brought some very disturbing accusations to my attention. I think you should have the chance to answer them in person.
Baltar All right, thank you, and um... she is...
Tigh Shes standing right there.
Godfrey Im right here.
Baltar Yeah, of course you are.
Gaeta Doctor... this is Miss Godfrey.
Baltar All of you can see her. You can all see her !
Tigh Shes standing right next to you.
Adama Something wrong ?
Baltar No, um...
Litmus_Flashback_#6 Dont make me angry, Gaius.
33_Flashback_#6 Id say you have a serious problem.
Miniseries_Flashback_#6 Get down.
Baltar Um, yes, maybe I, uh... youll have to forgive me, Miss Godfrey, Im very pleased, if slightly puzzled, to make your acquaintance—
Godfrey Dont touch me, you traitor.
Baltar Is she talking to me ? Are you talking to me ?
Godfrey Youre the one who let the Cylons into the defense mainframe. You betrayed your entire race. Youre the man responsible for the holocaust and Im here to see that youre exposed and sentenced to death as the traitor you really are.
Adama Doctor... Miss Godfrey has made some startling accusations.
Baltar Ive never seen this woman before in my life.
Godfrey Im not surprised you dont remember me, I was just a lowly systems analyst at the defense ministry. Dr. Amarak was my associate.
Tigh She says you sold out the human race. That you let the Cylons into our defense plans.
Godfrey Doctor Amarak told me he had evidence that Dr. Baltar was involved in the sneak attack. He was trying to reach the president and give her that information when he was killed.
Baltar He told you that, did he ?
Godfrey Yes, as a matter of fact.
Baltar Well, its a pity hes no longer with us. How convenient that we only have your word for that.
Godfrey Theres also this.
Baltar Yeah ? What the fraks that ?
Godfrey He gave me this, for safekeeping.
Adama Its I.D. Coded. Colonial defense ministry.
Godfrey Dr. Amarak gave the disk to me before he died.
Baltar What, as opposed to after he died ?
Godfrey Amarak gave the disc to me for safekeeping. on the disc is a photo. It was captured from the security camera in the defense mainframe on Caprica. It shows the doctor entering the mainframe without permission the day before the attack.
Baltar Nothing criminal about that.
Godfrey As you can see, the man in the photo is carrying an explosive device.
Baltar Sorry, hes what ? Hes... I definitely never did that.
Godfrey Just before the Cylon attack, the entire defense mainframe was destroyed by this device.
Baltar Honestly, that is not me. I wasnt there, its somebody else. Look, its not me, Im not the man in the photograph !
Adama I see a man, same height, same build but thats a long way from proof, Miss Godfrey.
Baltar Thank you, Commander. Now, if were quite done with this charade, Im a very busy—
Godfrey I agree, Commander, but look here. In the faceplate of the computer terminal theres a reflection of the mans face.
Tigh I cant tell anything from that.
Baltar Thank you, Colonel Tigh.
Godfrey With the right equipment the image could be enlarged and sharpened. We could see his face.
Gaeta Um, enlarging the image is no problem but, uh, sharpening it...
Baltar Take forever.
Gaeta It would take at least a day, sir.
Adama Mr. Gaeta, let me know as soon as you have an image.
Gaeta Yes, sir.
Adama Im gonna suspend all work on the Cylon detector.
Baltar What ?
Adama As well as your security privileges.
Cally Starbucks notes on the Cylon raider are a mess. She said the engine power-up sequence began by squeezing something that looks like a red ligament with blue veins on the right side coming out of a sack of gooey fluid, shaped like a dog.
Tyrol Are you kidding me ? This whole thing is a bunch of veins and ligaments and sacks of goo.
Cally Squeeze the ligament with your hand while you slide your weight on your left hip, into the lymphatic sack.
Tyrol Well, thats just stupid !
Cally Oh... afternoon, sir.
Tigh Specialist. Chiefs inside ?
Cally Yeah.
Tigh Chief ?
Tyrol Ow, gods-- yes, sir ?
Tigh Hows it coming in there ?
Tyrol Uh... Im getting there, sir. Havent quite figured out all the tricks but Im getting there.
Apollo Come on, Starbuck, you can do it. Ahh, that smarts. Yeah, that smarts, but I dont care.
Starbuck You dont care.
Apollo I dont care, because your pain is my entertainment. Your crutches of death, sir. Use them wisely.
Starbuck Shut up.
Cottle Its gonna hurt like hell but its supposed to.
Starbuck Thanks, doc.
Apollo No pain, no gain. No cliche left unturned as Kara Thrace returns to the world of the walking, can she do it, or will she fall on her ass ?
Starbuck I swear to the gods, Im gonna beat the crap out of both of you as soon as I get better... no, I cant.
Apollo Yes, you can, you did it.
Starbuck I cant, I cant... I cant.
Cottle Youre not gonna get better lying on your back.
Starbuck Oh, frak off.
Apollo Just take a break for five minutes, well try again.
Starbuck I dont want to do it again, I want a pill, now, please.
Cottle Sorry, were weaning you off the magic pills, starting today. And besides, I need em for myself.
Starbuck You son of a bitch.
Roslin I am finding this whole thing hard to fathom, doctor.
Baltar Oh, thank you, Madam President. I cant tell you how much that means to me. Um, look, I was wondering, is there any chance that, uh, while this investigation is going on, I could come back to the colonial one because Ive, uh, Ive left some of my things there.
Roslin No, Im sorry, Doctor. You have been put on a no-fly list. Security.
Baltar Madam President, I need to get off Galactica, I need to get away from this Shelly Godfrey woman in particular, shes got it in for me.
Baltar Where are you ?
Baltar Madam president, I have reason to believe... that she may be... a Cylon. Madam president ?
Billy Madam president ?
Baltar Hello... hello ?
Billy Get on the wireless, get Doc Cottle over here now, the Presidents collapsed.
Baltar Madam president ? Hello ?
Playa Billy, is she alive ?
Billy Yes, the president is alive. I told you, shes conscious, she is resting—
Billy Shes receiving treatment.
Reporter What kind of treatment ?
Billy Asked and answered. We dont know, we think its the stomach flu—
Cottle How many of these did you take, young lady ? one... ? Two... ? Two. Three. Three times the dosage. Must work three times as fast, then, right ? Everybody wants to be their own doctor. You are lucky that you didnt lapse into a coma. You cant cure cancer by overdose.
Billy Storys all over the fleet, I am so sorry.
Roslin Its okay.
Billy It seemed like an emergency, I wasnt even thinking that anyone might be picking up the transmission.
Roslin Were all new at this, its okay. Thing to do now is get me on my feet and in front of the press before the end of the day.
Cottle I could give you a shot, but you wouldnt like the side effects.
Roslin Just... do it.
Cottle You know, a time is going to come when you are not going to be able to hide what youre going through. Its not that kind of a shot.
Adama Thank you. Baltars correct... about the convenience of it all. Amarak just happens to bring you the key piece of evidence just before he dies...
Godfrey Something was going on. He was almost paranoid. Kept saying that the olympic carrier had been infiltrated by the Cylons. He wanted me to take some things off the ship for safekeeping.
Adama Why did he give it to you ?
Godfrey We were friends. Friends. I loved him. I loved him very much. There are times when I just feel so alone now. Times when I just want so much to be held again. You understand that, dont you ?
Adama Of course.
Godfrey There must be times when... when you feel alone. When the thought of another body next to yours seems like something out of a dream.
Caprica_Boomer Ughnn...
Helo Come on, come on. Sharon, get up, come on.
Officer Excuse me.
Baltar Lieutenant... is that you ?
Gaeta Doctor ?
Baltar Well, isnt this a coincidence ? So, um, how you doing ?
Gaeta Um, Im—
Baltar Youre busy, I know and I dont want to distract you, please, dont let me interrupt you.
Baltar You still there ?
Gaeta Yup.
Baltar Look, I know this is not a good time but it occurs to me that I never really told you how invaluable your assistance has been to me over past few weeks.
Gaeta Thank you, Doctor, uh, you have no idea how much that means to me.
Baltar Not at all... not at all. So, hows it going over there ?
Gaeta Uh...
Baltar In the lab, that is. Im talking about the photograph.
Gaeta Right, right, its um... coming along quite quickly, actually. A few more hours to go, yeah.
Baltar Has it ever occurred to you that the photograph, the disc itself, could be a fake ?
Gaeta Ive already authenticated the disc.
Baltar You have and obviously youre quite good, but there are many ways around security. Now, listen, if I could join you in the lab, for just... for just two minutes of your time, I could show you—
Gaeta I really dont think that thats possible.
Baltar Gaeta, listen to me, nobody would need to know, it would just be you and me. Just you and me. I know... for gods sake, Gaeta, my life is on the line. My reputation is at stake.
Gaeta Yeah, so is mine, doctor, I really—
Baltar Shh, shhhh... someones coming, someones coming. Where-- where you going ? You forgot to wash your hands !
Godfrey What the hell do you—
Baltar I want answers, and I want them now and I am not interested in playing any more of your stupid games.
Godfrey Have you lost your mind ?
Baltar I dont know, thats an interesting question, one I pose to myself on a regular basis. Now, tell me, whos really in the photograph ?
Godfrey You are !
Baltar I didnt plant any bomb, anywhere, at any time and you know that.
Godfrey I dont know anything of the sort. Now, if youll excuse me.
Baltar All right, lets entertain the notion, just for a moment that you are not the woman that I see everywhere. You are not shelly Godfrey, either. Youre a fake, youre just a copy. Another Cylon copy.
Godfrey Get... out.
Baltar Struck a nerve, have I ? Which I find rather impossible to believe ! You think this is over ? This is not over ! You have not heard the last ! No more Mr. Nice Gaius !
Tyrol unbelievable... frak it !
Boomer Ahem... uh, not a good time ?
Tyrol No, its fine.
Boomer Guess youre having problems ?
Tyrol I just, I cant get this thing to work. Ive been over it and over it and over it and over and... nothing ! I have no idea how Starbuck got this thing to move, much less fly.
Boomer Its not really a thing, you know ? Its probably a Cylon itself. More of an animal, maybe, than the human models. Maybe they genetically design it to perform a task. To be a fighter. You cant treat it like a thing and expect it to respond. You have to treat it like... a pet. But... at least, thats my guess.
Tyrol Your guess ?
Boomer Yeah, thats right, my guess. There something else you wanna say ?
Tyrol No. Lieutenant...
Tigh I heard you were supposed to be up on your feet by now.
Starbuck You heard wrong.
Tigh Well, I figured you wouldnt bounce back so fast.
Starbuck Is there something you wanted, or did you just drop by to torment me, sir ?
Tigh Nah, the chief wanted me to kick your ass out of bed so you could help figure out that raider of yours but, clearly, you still need the rest.
Tigh So take your time, no rush.
Starbuck Do you actually think that reverse psychology crap is gonna work on me ?
Tigh I really dont care what you think, lieutenant. All I know is that every day you spend in that bed is another day that I have my opinion of you confirmed. As you were.
Baltar And I am convinced, in fact, that she is a Cylon agent. In my opinion, she should be locked up before she can do any more damage.
Baltar Where are you ? Youre having a little fun, eh ? Are you enjoying messing around with my life ?
Adama Do you have any evidence to support this charge ?
Baltar Work on the Cylon detector is nearly complete. With a few tweaks here and there, Ill have a test regime up and running. All I need is a tissue sample from this woman for analysis.
Baltar I thought we had something. Something... special.
Adama I cant allow you access to your equipment.
Baltar All right. But, under instruction, I could show lt. Gaeta how to prepare the samples, its not difficult.
Adama Let me be frank with you, doctor. If your pictures on that photograph, every piece of equipment in your laboratory will be dismantled and quarantined and every person that youve met will be questioned and investigated.
Baltar I love you. There, Ive said it. Isnt that what youve been dying to hear ? Well, I am willing to make that commitment to you right now.
Baltar The president believes Im innocent.
Adama The president hopes youre innocent. And so do I. Because if youre not, then youve made fools of both of us. And I dont like to be made a fool of.
Baltar And I dont like to be accused of participating in the genocide of the human race, based solely on the word of a woman whom I have already indicated to you may well be a Cylon agent.
Baltar Im willing to do anything, anything at all. only, I need your help.
Baltar I did not conspire with the Cylons. I am an innocent man, who is being convicted in the court of public opinion without trial.
Dualla Fire, all hands report to damage control stations, fire—
Guard Got a fire, lets go !
Dualla No fires reported anywhere on the ship, Commander.
Adama Exact location of the alarm ?
Dualla D-wing corridor where it intersects c-wing.
Adama Thats the lab.
Baltar Erase, erase, erase... yes... yes.
Adama Put it down ! Put it down. All right, move in. Take him to the brig.
Guard Yes, commander.
Baltar I would-- I would like to speak to my attorney. Cant I speak to my attorney ? I need some representation here, its not what it looks like... shes got it in for me, that Shelly Godfrey !
Apollo Hey.
Starbuck Shut up... all of you. Not one single word from any of you, okay ? What seems to be the problem ?
Tyrol Well, your new boyfriends a bit of a jerk, sir.
Starbuck Its a girl.
Tyrol Well, if you dont mind her goo on your face, shes all yours, sir.
Starbuck Okay...
Tyrol She likes the warm light.
Starbuck Makes the touch easier, right ? Maybe... okay. Mmmm... this is stupid this is stupid... this is stupid !
Tyrol Its worth a try, sir. And it did fly for you once. Hasnt made so much as a grunt since. Maybe... uh, take her for a ride.
Starbuck Ride it ?
Tyrol Treat it like a horse.
Starbuck Okay... a horse, a horse, a horse. Why not a goat ? I mean, thats good, right ? Think of it as a goat. Okay, whatever... come on, boy, giddyup. Come on, come on. Okay, come on-- oh-oh, okay, youre kidding. Chief... Chief !
Tyrol Dont shoot anything.
Roslin Doctor.
Baltar Madam president.
Roslin Im so sorry.
Baltar Thank you. You are here to free me, right ? To bring this travesty to a close, because... you know Im innocent.
Roslin Just tell me, so I understand because I want to understand why. Why you did it.
Baltar I didnt do it. It wasnt me. Im being framed !
Roslin Why would she do that ?
Baltar Because shes a Cylon.
Roslin Shes a Cylon.
Baltar You are going to have to believe me.
Roslin I wanna believe you. I wanna believe that I havent made such a profound error in judgment in trusting you, in asking your advice. But heres where we are, doctor. If anyone can be a Cylon, and its hard to tell us apart then we only have one thing left to trust. Our instincts, our feelings. And the moment they told me it was your face in the photo I knew I believed it. I believe you were involved in the attack... somehow. I feel it.
Baltar Youll forgive me, madam president, if I dont wish to be executed based solely on your gut feeling.
Roslin May the gods have mercy on your soul.
Helo Call it.
Caprica_Boomer Heads.
Helo Heads, you win. You sleep, I watch.
Caprica_Boomer No, youre the one who needs sleep.
Helo I couldnt sleep if I had to listen to Tyrol read the flight manual.
Caprica_Boomer Okay.
Helo Truth is, if something happened to you I wouldnt know how to deal with it.
Caprica_Boomer I feel the same way.
Helo Back on the ship, I, uh... look, I knew what was going on. I mean, between you and the Chief.
Caprica_Boomer I think everybody did.
Helo And I respected it, your feelings, his, but... I would have given anything to be him. Hey, Im not trying to put you on the spot, here. I dont wanna step into what you two have. You feel the way you feel and I have to respect that—
Capirca_Boomer_and_Helo Ohhh !
Baltar I know we havent spoken before, and I dont wish to offend. Please... please. Dear god. And I now acknowledge that you are the one true god. Deliver me from this evil and I will... I will devote the rest of what is left of my wretched life to doing good, and... uh... to carrying out your divine will is what I want to do. To carrying out your divine will. I dont know what to do. Grant me grace, grant me forgiveness.
#6 Shhh... shhh... Im here now, Im here. All will be well. It will be as god wants it to be. Shhh...
Gaeta Open the door.
Baltar Wait... I havent even had a trial yet. No, no, wait, its a lie, its a lie !
Gaeta Doctor, its all right.
Baltar Its a lie !
Gaeta The photograph was a fake.
Baltar What ?
Gaeta It was almost seamless but, your face, the man, the reflection... it was all a fake.
Baltar Well, of course it was a fake. Id never wear a shirt like that. How did you, uh...
Gaeta I went back, I re-ran all the security checks. This time I found markers which, uh, pointed to photo manipulation. They werent apparent until the photo was fully resolved.
Baltar You re-ran the security checks. Thank you. Thank you.
Gaeta I just knew that you could never have anything to do with that attack. I mean, youre not that kind of man. Uh, it was really nothing, you know, doctor. once the photos were fully resolved, it was almost too easy, like she wanted to be found out.
Adama How did she get off of the ship ?
Tigh Got me, theres been no ships coming or going—
Adama I gave you an order.
Tigh I had two marines tailing her, they say they went around a corner and she was gone.
Dualla Every ship in the fleet has reported in, sir, theres no sign of her.
Adama Thats unacceptable. She was here, she was right here. This woman existed, she didnt just vanish. Have them check again.
Dualla Every ship ?
Adama Every ship, including this one. She didnt just vanish.
#6 Youre a hero. Youre even more popular and powerful than ever before. Youve had your trial by fire, so now they truly believe in you. Hard for anyone to accuse you of treason again.
Baltar Was that the plan all along ? Build me up in the public mind by first tearing me down ? Right. Who am I to question the plans of almighty god ? Uh, just one small, practical question. Shelly, Shelly Godfrey... was there ever a woman really called Shelly Godfrey ? Did she ever actually exist, was she ever really here ? Gods will be done.
