dr_gaius_baltar I dont see the hand of god in here. Could I be looking in the wrong place ? Let me see, proteins... yes. Hemoglobins... yes. Divine digits... uh, no. Sorry. Im sure I can find evidence of his divine hand in some of these delightful little samples. After all, there are so fraking many Im sure even I can be relied upon to find god in one of them.
number_six What is it that drives you to blasphemy, Gaius ? A need to tempt fate ?
dr_gaius_baltar Boredom, actually. Indeed, every waking hour is spent in what some might say has become my own personal religion, the church of the mystic Cylon detector.
number_six Well... are you finished ?
number_six If you would give yourself over to gods will, youd find peace in his love like I have.
dr_gaius_baltar Can you help me with the zipper, Im having a bit of trouble—
number_six He has a plan for us.
dr_gaius_baltar How do you know its a he.
number_six There is only one true god.
dr_gaius_baltar Really ? You, uh, you running a glitch in the program or something ? Because you say the same thing over and over again. Now, Ive accepted your god and all that. Cant we reboot the hard drive ?
number_six Hes not my god, he is god.
dr_gaius_baltar Yeah, your god, my god, everyones god-- hes big enough for all of us, isnt he ? Now, please, please, I mean... cant we do something a little more... elevating ?
number_six Its important you form a personal relationship with god. only you can give yourself over to his eternal love.
dr_gaius_baltar Oh, for gods sake ! I cant take this any more !
number_six Im trying to save your immortal soul, Gaius.
dr_gaius_baltar No, what you are doing, darling, is boring me to death with your superstitious drivel, your-- your metaphysical nonsense. Which, to be fair to you, actually appeals to the half-educated dullards that make up most of human society but which, I hasten to add, no rational, intelligent free-thinking human being truly believes. Which leads me to the inescapable conclusion that Cylons are, in the final-- that Cylons are, in the final analysis little more than toasters... with great-looking legs. Its my fantasy, see if I care. Ill, dream up someone new, maybe. Brunette, maybe. really ? Maybe we can dispense with the foreplay, get right down to—
officer_anastasia_dualla What did you say ?
dr_gaius_baltar That, um... that was nothing. I was just talking to myself. I talk to myself. Hang me.
officer_anastasia_dualla The commander would like to see you in the c-I-c, doctor.
dr_gaius_baltar Ah, there you are. Very nice. Blouse could open up a button or two—
number_six Excuse me ?
dr_gaius_baltar Just a thought-- you wanted to see me, commander ?
admiral_william_adama Miss Godfrey has brought some very disturbing accusations to my attention. I think you should have the chance to answer them in person.
dr_gaius_baltar All right, thank you, and um... she is...
colonel_saul_tigh Shes standing right there.
number_six Im right here.
dr_gaius_baltar Yeah, of course you are.
lt_felix_gaeta Doctor... this is Miss Godfrey.
dr_gaius_baltar All of you can see her. You can all see her !
colonel_saul_tigh Shes standing right next to you.
admiral_william_adama Something wrong ?
dr_gaius_baltar No, um...
Litmus_Flashback_#6#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode07 Dont make me angry, Gaius.
33_Flashback_#6#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode07 Id say you have a serious problem.
Miniseries_Flashback_#6#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode07 Get down.
dr_gaius_baltar Um, yes, maybe I, uh... youll have to forgive me, Miss Godfrey, Im very pleased, if slightly puzzled, to make your acquaintance—
number_six Dont touch me, you traitor.
dr_gaius_baltar Is she talking to me ? Are you talking to me ?
number_six Youre the one who let the Cylons into the defense mainframe. You betrayed your entire race. Youre the man responsible for the holocaust and Im here to see that youre exposed and sentenced to death as the traitor you really are.
admiral_william_adama Doctor... Miss Godfrey has made some startling accusations.
dr_gaius_baltar Ive never seen this woman before in my life.
number_six Im not surprised you dont remember me, I was just a lowly systems analyst at the defense ministry. Dr. Amarak was my associate.
colonel_saul_tigh She says you sold out the human race. That you let the Cylons into our defense plans.
number_six Doctor Amarak told me he had evidence that Dr. Baltar was involved in the sneak attack. He was trying to reach the president and give her that information when he was killed.
dr_gaius_baltar He told you that, did he ?
number_six Yes, as a matter of fact.
dr_gaius_baltar Well, its a pity hes no longer with us. How convenient that we only have your word for that.
number_six Theres also this.
dr_gaius_baltar Yeah ? What the fraks that ?
number_six He gave me this, for safekeeping.
admiral_william_adama Its I.D. Coded. Colonial defense ministry.
number_six Dr. Amarak gave the disk to me before he died.
dr_gaius_baltar What, as opposed to after he died ?
number_six Amarak gave the disc to me for safekeeping. on the disc is a photo. It was captured from the security camera in the defense mainframe on Caprica. It shows the doctor entering the mainframe without permission the day before the attack.
dr_gaius_baltar Nothing criminal about that.
number_six As you can see, the man in the photo is carrying an explosive device.
dr_gaius_baltar Sorry, hes what ? Hes... I definitely never did that.
number_six Just before the Cylon attack, the entire defense mainframe was destroyed by this device.
dr_gaius_baltar Honestly, that is not me. I wasnt there, its somebody else. Look, its not me, Im not the man in the photograph !
admiral_william_adama I see a man, same height, same build but thats a long way from proof, Miss Godfrey.
dr_gaius_baltar Thank you, Commander. Now, if were quite done with this charade, Im a very busy—
number_six I agree, Commander, but look here. In the faceplate of the computer terminal theres a reflection of the mans face.
colonel_saul_tigh I cant tell anything from that.
dr_gaius_baltar Thank you, Colonel Tigh.
number_six With the right equipment the image could be enlarged and sharpened. We could see his face.
lt_felix_gaeta Um, enlarging the image is no problem but, uh, sharpening it...
dr_gaius_baltar Take forever.
lt_felix_gaeta It would take at least a day, sir.
admiral_william_adama Mr. Gaeta, let me know as soon as you have an image.
lt_felix_gaeta Yes, sir.
admiral_william_adama Im gonna suspend all work on the Cylon detector.
dr_gaius_baltar What ?
admiral_william_adama As well as your security privileges.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Starbucks notes on the Cylon raider are a mess. She said the engine power-up sequence began by squeezing something that looks like a red ligament with blue veins on the right side coming out of a sack of gooey fluid, shaped like a dog.
chief_galen_tyrol Are you kidding me ? This whole thing is a bunch of veins and ligaments and sacks of goo.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Squeeze the ligament with your hand while you slide your weight on your left hip, into the lymphatic sack.
chief_galen_tyrol Well, thats just stupid !
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Oh... afternoon, sir.
colonel_saul_tigh Specialist. Chiefs inside ?
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Yeah.
colonel_saul_tigh Chief ?
chief_galen_tyrol Ow, gods-- yes, sir ?
colonel_saul_tigh Hows it coming in there ?
chief_galen_tyrol Uh... Im getting there, sir. Havent quite figured out all the tricks but Im getting there.
cpt_lee_adama Come on, Starbuck, you can do it. Ahh, that smarts. Yeah, that smarts, but I dont care.
captain_kara_thrace You dont care.
cpt_lee_adama I dont care, because your pain is my entertainment. Your crutches of death, sir. Use them wisely.
captain_kara_thrace Shut up.
dr_cottle Its gonna hurt like hell but its supposed to.
captain_kara_thrace Thanks, doc.
cpt_lee_adama No pain, no gain. No cliche left unturned as Kara Thrace returns to the world of the walking, can she do it, or will she fall on her ass ?
captain_kara_thrace I swear to the gods, Im gonna beat the crap out of both of you as soon as I get better... no, I cant.
cpt_lee_adama Yes, you can, you did it.
captain_kara_thrace I cant, I cant... I cant.
dr_cottle Youre not gonna get better lying on your back.
captain_kara_thrace Oh, frak off.
cpt_lee_adama Just take a break for five minutes, well try again.
captain_kara_thrace I dont want to do it again, I want a pill, now, please.
dr_cottle Sorry, were weaning you off the magic pills, starting today. And besides, I need em for myself.
captain_kara_thrace You son of a bitch.
president_laura_roslin I am finding this whole thing hard to fathom, doctor.
dr_gaius_baltar Oh, thank you, Madam President. I cant tell you how much that means to me. Um, look, I was wondering, is there any chance that, uh, while this investigation is going on, I could come back to the colonial one because Ive, uh, Ive left some of my things there.
president_laura_roslin No, Im sorry, Doctor. You have been put on a no-fly list. Security.
dr_gaius_baltar Madam President, I need to get off Galactica, I need to get away from this Shelly Godfrey woman in particular, shes got it in for me.
dr_gaius_baltar Where are you ?
dr_gaius_baltar Madam president, I have reason to believe... that she may be... a Cylon. Madam president ?
billy_keikeya Madam president ?
dr_gaius_baltar Hello... hello ?
billy_keikeya Get on the wireless, get Doc Cottle over here now, the Presidents collapsed.
dr_gaius_baltar Madam president ? Hello ?
playa_palacios Billy, is she alive ?
billy_keikeya Yes, the president is alive. I told you, shes conscious, she is resting—
billy_keikeya Shes receiving treatment.
Reporter#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode07 What kind of treatment ?
billy_keikeya Asked and answered. We dont know, we think its the stomach flu—
dr_cottle How many of these did you take, young lady ? one... ? Two... ? Two. Three. Three times the dosage. Must work three times as fast, then, right ? Everybody wants to be their own doctor. You are lucky that you didnt lapse into a coma. You cant cure cancer by overdose.
billy_keikeya Storys all over the fleet, I am so sorry.
president_laura_roslin Its okay.
billy_keikeya It seemed like an emergency, I wasnt even thinking that anyone might be picking up the transmission.
president_laura_roslin Were all new at this, its okay. Thing to do now is get me on my feet and in front of the press before the end of the day.
dr_cottle I could give you a shot, but you wouldnt like the side effects.
president_laura_roslin Just... do it.
dr_cottle You know, a time is going to come when you are not going to be able to hide what youre going through. Its not that kind of a shot.
admiral_william_adama Thank you. Baltars correct... about the convenience of it all. Amarak just happens to bring you the key piece of evidence just before he dies...
number_six Something was going on. He was almost paranoid. Kept saying that the olympic carrier had been infiltrated by the Cylons. He wanted me to take some things off the ship for safekeeping.
admiral_william_adama Why did he give it to you ?
number_six We were friends. Friends. I loved him. I loved him very much. There are times when I just feel so alone now. Times when I just want so much to be held again. You understand that, dont you ?
admiral_william_adama Of course.
number_six There must be times when... when you feel alone. When the thought of another body next to yours seems like something out of a dream.
lt_sharon_valerii Ughnn...
captain_karl_agathon Come on, come on. Sharon, get up, come on.
Officer#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode07 Excuse me.
dr_gaius_baltar Lieutenant... is that you ?
lt_felix_gaeta Doctor ?
dr_gaius_baltar Well, isnt this a coincidence ? So, um, how you doing ?
lt_felix_gaeta Um, Im—
dr_gaius_baltar Youre busy, I know and I dont want to distract you, please, dont let me interrupt you.
dr_gaius_baltar You still there ?
lt_felix_gaeta Yup.
dr_gaius_baltar Look, I know this is not a good time but it occurs to me that I never really told you how invaluable your assistance has been to me over past few weeks.
lt_felix_gaeta Thank you, Doctor, uh, you have no idea how much that means to me.
dr_gaius_baltar Not at all... not at all. So, hows it going over there ?
lt_felix_gaeta Uh...
dr_gaius_baltar In the lab, that is. Im talking about the photograph.
lt_felix_gaeta Right, right, its um... coming along quite quickly, actually. A few more hours to go, yeah.
dr_gaius_baltar Has it ever occurred to you that the photograph, the disc itself, could be a fake ?
lt_felix_gaeta Ive already authenticated the disc.
dr_gaius_baltar You have and obviously youre quite good, but there are many ways around security. Now, listen, if I could join you in the lab, for just... for just two minutes of your time, I could show you—
lt_felix_gaeta I really dont think that thats possible.
dr_gaius_baltar Gaeta, listen to me, nobody would need to know, it would just be you and me. Just you and me. I know... for gods sake, Gaeta, my life is on the line. My reputation is at stake.
lt_felix_gaeta Yeah, so is mine, doctor, I really—
dr_gaius_baltar Shh, shhhh... someones coming, someones coming. Where-- where you going ? You forgot to wash your hands !
number_six What the hell do you—
dr_gaius_baltar I want answers, and I want them now and I am not interested in playing any more of your stupid games.
number_six Have you lost your mind ?
dr_gaius_baltar I dont know, thats an interesting question, one I pose to myself on a regular basis. Now, tell me, whos really in the photograph ?
number_six You are !
dr_gaius_baltar I didnt plant any bomb, anywhere, at any time and you know that.
number_six I dont know anything of the sort. Now, if youll excuse me.
dr_gaius_baltar All right, lets entertain the notion, just for a moment that you are not the woman that I see everywhere. You are not shelly Godfrey, either. Youre a fake, youre just a copy. Another Cylon copy.
number_six Get... out.
dr_gaius_baltar Struck a nerve, have I ? Which I find rather impossible to believe ! You think this is over ? This is not over ! You have not heard the last ! No more Mr. Nice Gaius !
chief_galen_tyrol unbelievable... frak it !
lt_sharon_valerii Ahem... uh, not a good time ?
chief_galen_tyrol No, its fine.
lt_sharon_valerii Guess youre having problems ?
chief_galen_tyrol I just, I cant get this thing to work. Ive been over it and over it and over it and over and... nothing ! I have no idea how Starbuck got this thing to move, much less fly.
lt_sharon_valerii Its not really a thing, you know ? Its probably a Cylon itself. More of an animal, maybe, than the human models. Maybe they genetically design it to perform a task. To be a fighter. You cant treat it like a thing and expect it to respond. You have to treat it like... a pet. But... at least, thats my guess.
chief_galen_tyrol Your guess ?
lt_sharon_valerii Yeah, thats right, my guess. There something else you wanna say ?
chief_galen_tyrol No. Lieutenant...
colonel_saul_tigh I heard you were supposed to be up on your feet by now.
captain_kara_thrace You heard wrong.
colonel_saul_tigh Well, I figured you wouldnt bounce back so fast.
captain_kara_thrace Is there something you wanted, or did you just drop by to torment me, sir ?
colonel_saul_tigh Nah, the chief wanted me to kick your ass out of bed so you could help figure out that raider of yours but, clearly, you still need the rest.
colonel_saul_tigh So take your time, no rush.
captain_kara_thrace Do you actually think that reverse psychology crap is gonna work on me ?
colonel_saul_tigh I really dont care what you think, lieutenant. All I know is that every day you spend in that bed is another day that I have my opinion of you confirmed. As you were.
dr_gaius_baltar And I am convinced, in fact, that she is a Cylon agent. In my opinion, she should be locked up before she can do any more damage.
dr_gaius_baltar Where are you ? Youre having a little fun, eh ? Are you enjoying messing around with my life ?
admiral_william_adama Do you have any evidence to support this charge ?
dr_gaius_baltar Work on the Cylon detector is nearly complete. With a few tweaks here and there, Ill have a test regime up and running. All I need is a tissue sample from this woman for analysis.
dr_gaius_baltar I thought we had something. Something... special.
admiral_william_adama I cant allow you access to your equipment.
dr_gaius_baltar All right. But, under instruction, I could show lt. Gaeta how to prepare the samples, its not difficult.
admiral_william_adama Let me be frank with you, doctor. If your pictures on that photograph, every piece of equipment in your laboratory will be dismantled and quarantined and every person that youve met will be questioned and investigated.
dr_gaius_baltar I love you. There, Ive said it. Isnt that what youve been dying to hear ? Well, I am willing to make that commitment to you right now.
dr_gaius_baltar The president believes Im innocent.
admiral_william_adama The president hopes youre innocent. And so do I. Because if youre not, then youve made fools of both of us. And I dont like to be made a fool of.
dr_gaius_baltar And I dont like to be accused of participating in the genocide of the human race, based solely on the word of a woman whom I have already indicated to you may well be a Cylon agent.
dr_gaius_baltar Im willing to do anything, anything at all. only, I need your help.
dr_gaius_baltar I did not conspire with the Cylons. I am an innocent man, who is being convicted in the court of public opinion without trial.
officer_anastasia_dualla Fire, all hands report to damage control stations, fire—
Guard#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode07 Got a fire, lets go !
officer_anastasia_dualla No fires reported anywhere on the ship, Commander.
admiral_william_adama Exact location of the alarm ?
officer_anastasia_dualla D-wing corridor where it intersects c-wing.
admiral_william_adama Thats the lab.
dr_gaius_baltar Erase, erase, erase... yes... yes.
admiral_william_adama Put it down ! Put it down. All right, move in. Take him to the brig.
Guard#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode07 Yes, commander.
dr_gaius_baltar I would-- I would like to speak to my attorney. Cant I speak to my attorney ? I need some representation here, its not what it looks like... shes got it in for me, that Shelly Godfrey !
cpt_lee_adama Hey.
captain_kara_thrace Shut up... all of you. Not one single word from any of you, okay ? What seems to be the problem ?
chief_galen_tyrol Well, your new boyfriends a bit of a jerk, sir.
captain_kara_thrace Its a girl.
chief_galen_tyrol Well, if you dont mind her goo on your face, shes all yours, sir.
captain_kara_thrace Okay...
chief_galen_tyrol She likes the warm light.
captain_kara_thrace Makes the touch easier, right ? Maybe... okay. Mmmm... this is stupid this is stupid... this is stupid !
chief_galen_tyrol Its worth a try, sir. And it did fly for you once. Hasnt made so much as a grunt since. Maybe... uh, take her for a ride.
captain_kara_thrace Ride it ?
chief_galen_tyrol Treat it like a horse.
captain_kara_thrace Okay... a horse, a horse, a horse. Why not a goat ? I mean, thats good, right ? Think of it as a goat. Okay, whatever... come on, boy, giddyup. Come on, come on. Okay, come on-- oh-oh, okay, youre kidding. Chief... Chief !
chief_galen_tyrol Dont shoot anything.
president_laura_roslin Doctor.
dr_gaius_baltar Madam president.
president_laura_roslin Im so sorry.
dr_gaius_baltar Thank you. You are here to free me, right ? To bring this travesty to a close, because... you know Im innocent.
president_laura_roslin Just tell me, so I understand because I want to understand why. Why you did it.
dr_gaius_baltar I didnt do it. It wasnt me. Im being framed !
president_laura_roslin Why would she do that ?
dr_gaius_baltar Because shes a Cylon.
president_laura_roslin Shes a Cylon.
dr_gaius_baltar You are going to have to believe me.
president_laura_roslin I wanna believe you. I wanna believe that I havent made such a profound error in judgment in trusting you, in asking your advice. But heres where we are, doctor. If anyone can be a Cylon, and its hard to tell us apart then we only have one thing left to trust. Our instincts, our feelings. And the moment they told me it was your face in the photo I knew I believed it. I believe you were involved in the attack... somehow. I feel it.
dr_gaius_baltar Youll forgive me, madam president, if I dont wish to be executed based solely on your gut feeling.
president_laura_roslin May the gods have mercy on your soul.
captain_karl_agathon Call it.
lt_sharon_valerii Heads.
captain_karl_agathon Heads, you win. You sleep, I watch.
lt_sharon_valerii No, youre the one who needs sleep.
captain_karl_agathon I couldnt sleep if I had to listen to Tyrol read the flight manual.
lt_sharon_valerii Okay.
captain_karl_agathon Truth is, if something happened to you I wouldnt know how to deal with it.
lt_sharon_valerii I feel the same way.
captain_karl_agathon Back on the ship, I, uh... look, I knew what was going on. I mean, between you and the Chief.
lt_sharon_valerii I think everybody did.
captain_karl_agathon And I respected it, your feelings, his, but... I would have given anything to be him. Hey, Im not trying to put you on the spot, here. I dont wanna step into what you two have. You feel the way you feel and I have to respect that—
Capirca_Boomer_and_Helo#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode07 Ohhh !
dr_gaius_baltar I know we havent spoken before, and I dont wish to offend. Please... please. Dear god. And I now acknowledge that you are the one true god. Deliver me from this evil and I will... I will devote the rest of what is left of my wretched life to doing good, and... uh... to carrying out your divine will is what I want to do. To carrying out your divine will. I dont know what to do. Grant me grace, grant me forgiveness.
number_six Shhh... shhh... Im here now, Im here. All will be well. It will be as god wants it to be. Shhh...
lt_felix_gaeta Open the door.
dr_gaius_baltar Wait... I havent even had a trial yet. No, no, wait, its a lie, its a lie !
lt_felix_gaeta Doctor, its all right.
dr_gaius_baltar Its a lie !
lt_felix_gaeta The photograph was a fake.
dr_gaius_baltar What ?
lt_felix_gaeta It was almost seamless but, your face, the man, the reflection... it was all a fake.
dr_gaius_baltar Well, of course it was a fake. Id never wear a shirt like that. How did you, uh...
lt_felix_gaeta I went back, I re-ran all the security checks. This time I found markers which, uh, pointed to photo manipulation. They werent apparent until the photo was fully resolved.
dr_gaius_baltar You re-ran the security checks. Thank you. Thank you.
lt_felix_gaeta I just knew that you could never have anything to do with that attack. I mean, youre not that kind of man. Uh, it was really nothing, you know, doctor. once the photos were fully resolved, it was almost too easy, like she wanted to be found out.
admiral_william_adama How did she get off of the ship ?
colonel_saul_tigh Got me, theres been no ships coming or going—
admiral_william_adama I gave you an order.
colonel_saul_tigh I had two marines tailing her, they say they went around a corner and she was gone.
officer_anastasia_dualla Every ship in the fleet has reported in, sir, theres no sign of her.
admiral_william_adama Thats unacceptable. She was here, she was right here. This woman existed, she didnt just vanish. Have them check again.
officer_anastasia_dualla Every ship ?
admiral_william_adama Every ship, including this one. She didnt just vanish.
number_six Youre a hero. Youre even more popular and powerful than ever before. Youve had your trial by fire, so now they truly believe in you. Hard for anyone to accuse you of treason again.
dr_gaius_baltar Was that the plan all along ? Build me up in the public mind by first tearing me down ? Right. Who am I to question the plans of almighty god ? Uh, just one small, practical question. Shelly, Shelly Godfrey... was there ever a woman really called Shelly Godfrey ? Did she ever actually exist, was she ever really here ? Gods will be done.
