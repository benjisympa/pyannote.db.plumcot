Leoben Cylon... Cylon! Cylon!
Leoben Laura.
Roslin Yes?
Billy Madam President, are you okay in there?
Roslin Im fine, Im just, its the side effects from the Chamalla. You know that thing they say, Whats worse, the cancer or the cure? What do you need?
Billy Uh, you have an urgent call from the captain of the Geminon Traveler.
Roslin Can I call him back?
Billy He says he found a Cylon onboard.
Roslin They found him in the starboard storage compartment. Looks like hed been camped there for days.
Adama Theyre sure its a Cylon?
Roslin The captain identified him by one of the photos we sent out. Hes another copy of the man you knew as Leoben Conroy.
Apollo Where is it now?
Roslin Aboard the Geminon Traveler locked in a storeroom, under guard.
Adama Isolate that ship.
Apollo Order the C.A.P. To fly escort around the Geminon Traveler and not to approach any other ship in the fleet.
Dualla Aye, sir. Kat, Galactica...
Adama Ill send a team over to destroy it immediately.
Roslin I want this man interrogated first.
Adama First of all, its not a him, its an it. Second, anything it says cannot be trusted. Best thing to do is to destroy it immediately.
Roslin Id like to hear what this thing has to say, it might be important.
Adama Madam President, Ive dealt with this model before. Itll fill your head with double-talk and half-baked philosophy and confuse you.
Roslin Then send someone who wont be easily confused, thats an order, Commander. I want him interrogated.
Adama Order understood.
Starbuck You really think itll give me something?
Adama No... President disagrees.
Starbuck Well, you need me to go, Ill shower up and go.
Adama Hows this coming?
Starbuck We, uh, got the entire avionics package figured out - fire control, navigation, and I think that I am zeroing in on her F.T.L. Drive.
Adama I did this in a hurry about three weeks ago. Its an after-action report on Leoben. Its a very clever machine. Manipulative, cunning. The only problem with Leoben isnt that he lies, thatd be too easy. Its that he mixes lies with truth. Just remember, hes gonna try to get into your head.
Starbuck Aw, mom always said there was nothing in there anyway.
Adama Just be careful. He has an agenda. Its a goal you wont understand until later. Your job is to make sure he doesnt achieve the goal.
Starbuck Yes, sir.
Starbuck Credits
Tyrol Lieutenant. Whats up?
Boomer Nothing. Just wanted to see if what I told you the other day helped at all.
Tyrol Yeah, actually, it did. You do treat this thing more like an animal than a machine and it actually works. Whered you come up with that, anyway? Just pop into your head?
Boomer Im a Cylon.
Tyrol You know, thats not even funny.
Boomer If I could prove that I wasnt, would that make a difference? You know, between us?
Pilot Geminon Traveler/raptor seven-one-niner, inbound. Lt. Thrace aboard, permission to dock.
Man Roger, seven-one-niner, permission granted.
Captain Really does look like a person.
Starbuck Yeah.
Captain Must be all full of wires inside.
Starbuck Nah, you cut em open theres blood, guts, the whole thing. Its sweating.
Captain Well, Ill be. Look at that. Gods, they go through a lot of trouble to imitate people. Why do you think they do that?
Starbuck I dont care why. But the fact that these things sweat... now, thats interesting.
Starbuck Sleeping?
Leoben Praying.
Starbuck I dont think the gods answer the prayers of toasters.
Leoben God answers everyones prayers.
Starbuck How many Cylons are there in the fleet?
Leoben We havent been properly introduced. Im Leoben.
Starbuck How many Cylons are there in the fleet?
Leoben I have no idea. Whats your name?
Starbuck How long have you been hiding aboard this ship?
Leoben Am I not allowed to know your name?
Starbuck Why were you hiding aboard this ship?
Leoben I had a mission to perform. Listen, its a small thing can you just tell me who you are?
Starbuck Tell me about your mission and Ill think about it.
Leoben My mission was to conduct sabotage.
Starbuck What kind of sabotage?
Leoben God, you stink. Can we get some air in here? Between you and the humidity...
Starbuck I am not here to play games with you. You said you wanted to cooperate. Either start talking or we are done.
Leoben Okay. But... I really wanna know your name.
Starbuck Open.
Leoben Are you Lt. Starbuck? Yes, you are. I knew it... I was right, I was right. I saw it, Ive seen it...
Starbuck Happy now?
Leoben It all makes sense now, doesnt it? Now we can talk, now we can talk about a lot of things.
Starbuck Like what?
Leoben I planted a nuclear warhead aboard one of your ships. Its set to go off at 18:30 hours.
Starbuck Where?
Leoben Not ready to give that up yet.
Starbuck Youre lying, theres no warhead.
Leoben You cant take the chance, Starbuck. Your military training dictates you take it to your masters and let them decide.
Starbuck Maybe my training wasnt so good. Maybe I push you out the airlock and tell em you never said a word.
Leoben Now whos lying? These things happen for a reason, dont they? Im looking forward to spending a little bit more time with you, Starbuck we have a lot to talk about! Its gonna be fun.
Adama Put the R.A.D. Team on alert immediately - Dee! - And sweep Galactica for any kind of radiological devices.
Tigh Right.
Adama Contact all the captains in the fleet. Tell them to do radiological sweeps of their ships but emphasize this is just a precaution. I dont wanna alarm anyone until we know for sure.
Dualla Yes, sir.
Roslin Well, well know for sure in 8 hours and 40 minutes. Lt. Thrace, did he say anything else?
Starbuck No. Well, he uh-- he guessed my callsign. Seemed really happy when he found out who I was.
Adama Hes playing with your mind. Hes been stowed away for weeks aboard the fleet. 50 ways he could have heard the word Starbuck on a wireless set.
Starbuck Thats what I figured, sir.
Roslin Any idea what he wants, Lieutenant?
Starbuck Not yet. Says hes looking forward to spending time with me, though.
Adama Dont take any chances, Starbuck.
Starbuck Yes, sir.
Leoben You believe in the gods, dont you? Lords of Kobol and all that?
Starbuck Why should I tell you?
Leoben Come on, its not a trick question, I just wanna see how much I got right. So you pray to Artemis and Aphrodite?
Starbuck Wheres the warhead?
Leoben I was right. See, our faiths are similar but I look to one God, not to many.
Starbuck I dont give a damn what you believe.
Leoben To know the face of God is to know madness. I see the universe. I see the patterns. I see the foreshadowing that precedes every moment of every day. Its all there, I see it and you dont. And I have a surprise for you. I have something to tell you about the future.
Starbuck Is that so?
Leoben It is. But we have to see this through to the end. What is the most basic article of faith? This is not all that we are. See, the difference between you and me is, I know what that means and you dont. I know that Im more than this body, more than this consciousness. A part of me swims in the stream, but in truth, Im standing on the shore; the current never takes me downstream.
Starbuck This is worse than Galactica and I didnt think that was possible. What was that, swimmin in streams or something?
Leoben You mind?
Starbuck Mm.
Leoben Thank you. Starving, havent eaten in days.
Starbuck Kinda bad programming, isnt it? I mean, why bother with hunger?
Leoben Part of being human.
Starbuck Youre not human. Hows your lunch?
Leoben You know how it is. When youre starving, anything tastes good.
Leoben Oh!
Starbuck Did that hurt?
Leoben Yeah, it hurt.
Starbuck Machines shouldnt feel pain. Shouldnt bleed, shouldnt sweat.
Leoben Sweat, thats funny, thats good.
Starbuck See, now, a smart Cylon would turn off the ol pain software about now. But I dont think youre so smart.
Leoben Maybe Ill turn it off and you wont even know.
Starbuck Hmm. Heres your dilemma, turn off the pain, you feel better but that makes you a machine, not a person. You see, human beings cant turn off their pain. Human beings have to suffer and cry and scream and endure because they have no choice. So the only way you can avoid the pain you are about to receive is by telling me exactly what I wanna know. Just like a human would.
Leoben I knew this about you. Youre everything I thought you would be. But it wont work, I wont tell you anything.
Starbuck Maybe not. But then youll know, deep down, that I beat you. That a human being beat you. And that you are truly no greater than we are. Youre just a bunch of machines, after all.
Leoben Let the games begin.
Six Hi. Ah, look what the cat dragged in.
Baltar Lt. Valerii... its an unexpected visit. You look wonderful.
Boomer I need your help.
Baltar Anything I can do. Anything at all.
Six Wonder why they call her Boomer?
Boomer I heard youre working on a test to tell the difference between Cylons and humans?
Six Bingo.
Baltar I cant really talk about that, at the moment. You wouldnt help settle a bet for me, would you? Now, why do they call you boomer?
Boomer If youre working on a Cylon detector, do you think I could be in the first batch? You know, to be tested?
Six Whats her rush?
Baltar Whats your rush? Im not sure itd be appropriate to show favoritism if, indeed, Im working on anything at all.
Boomer I saved your life back on Caprica. My co-pilot gave up a seat for you. And I brought you back to Galactica, to safety. You wouldnt even be here if it wasnt for me. You owe me.
Six She shoots, she scores.
Baltar I suppose theres some small truth to that.
Boomer So can you test me or not?
Six I think you should do it. Results will be quite intriguing.
Baltar The technology for Cylon detection is not quite ready for full-scale implementation. But I could use a beta test subject.
Six Sharons late.
Doral Half an hour. I notice youre calling her Sharon now.
Six Yeah, well, I choose to think of her as one of them.
Doral Because you dislike her?
Six Because in the scheme of things, we are as we do. She acts like one of em, thinks like them... she is one of them.
Doral But shes one of us. It would be best to remember that.
Boomer We had sex.
Doral Congratulations.
Six Does he love you?
Boomer I think so.
Six Has he said it?
Boomer Not directly.
Six Then youre just guessing.
Doral Stay in your current location. Were setting up a cabin for you nearby, food, water, electricity, all the comforts.
Six Shouldnt be too hard to convince him to stay and start a life together. If not, kill him. Can you handle that?
Boomer Helo... Helo !
Helo Hey, hey, whats going on?
Boomer We gotta go, now. I saw the Cylons, theyre headed this way. We gotta travel fast, even faster than before.
Helo Why? Whats different?
Boomer Everything. Just trust me.
Helo I do.
Starbuck Now, if you were human, youd be just about ready to start offering up some false information about the location of the nuke. Some tiny thing that might get you a reward and maybe spare you a few minutes of this. But then I keep forgetting, youre not human. Youre a machine.
Leoben I am more than you could ever imagine. I am God.
Starbuck Im sorry, youre god? Wow... nice to meet ya. Thats good, thats good. Well give you a couple of minutes for that.
Leoben Its funny, isnt it? Were all God, Starbuck, all of us. I see the love that binds all living things together.
Starbuck Love? You dont even know what the word means.
Leoben I know that God loved you more than all other living creatures and you repaid his divine love with sin, with hate, corruption, evil. So then he decided to create the Cylons.
Starbuck The gods had nothing to do with it. We created you... us. It was a stupid, fraked-up decision and we have paid for it. You slaughtered my entire civilization! That is sin! That is evil, and you are evil.
Leoben Am I? I see the truths that float past you in the stream.
Starbuck You got a real thing about rivers and streams, dont you? I think we should indulge you in your obsession.
Leoben Do you realize I could kill you before they came back in the room? I could get to my feet, rip your skull from your spinal column, crash through that door, kill the guard in less time than its taking me to describe it to you?
Starbuck Then why dont you?
Leoben Its not the time. I have a surprise for you.
Starbuck You fraked up, pal. Now the gloves come off.
Tigh Combat, Col. Tigh.
Adama Hows the search going for the nuke?
Tigh Nothing so far.
Adama How much time remaining?
Tigh Two hours, nine minutes.
Adama Spread out the fleet. No ship more than 500 clicks from any other ship. If theres a nuke, lets limit the damage.
Tigh Aye, sir.
Adama No.
Starbuck Do it. Leave him.
Guard Sir?
Starbuck Tell me where the warhead is. Otherwise youre gonna drown in that bucket.
Leoben I cant drown, I cant die.
Starbuck Right, Commander Adama mentioned that how, if your body dies, your consciousness is downloaded or transferred into another body or something like that?
Leoben No, exactly like that.
Starbuck But, you see, Ive been thinking. Why is a Cylon willing to talk at all? Why does he care if we destroy his body? Wont he just transfer away and laugh at all of us and our stupid human ideas? Tell me where the warhead is.
Leoben This is not your path, Starbuck. You have a different destiny.
Starbuck Dont interrupt me. You see, Im gonna dazzle you with my poor human brain. You see, I think that youre afraid. Youre afraid that were a long way from home. What if you dont transfer all the way back? What if, when you die here, you really die? Its your chance to find out if youre really god or just a bunch of circuits with a bad haircut.
Leoben Im not afraid of dying.
Starbuck Somebodys programmed you with a fairy tale of god and streams and life ever after but, somewhere in that hard drive that you call a brain is a beeping message: Error, error, does not compute. I dont have a soul, I have software. If I die, Im gone.
Leoben I have a soul. I see patterns. I know you, youre damaged. You were born to a woman who believes that suffering was good for the soul, so you suffered. Life is a testament to pain, injuries, accidents. Some inflicted upon others, some inflicted upon yourself. Surrounds you like a bubble but its not... real its just-- thats just something she put into your head. Its something that you wanna believe cause it means that youre the problem, not the world that you live in. You wanna believe it because... it means that youre bad luck. Like a cancer that needs to be removed. Because you hear her voice every day and you want her to be right.
Starbuck Start again.
Baltar Now, we just pop this in the slot and wait for the result. Green, youre a normal human being. Red, youre an evil Cylon. Should take a couple of minutes. So, uh, tell me, are you from Aerilon? Slight trace of an accent there...
Boomer What? Uh, no-- Troy.
Baltar Troy. Troy-- tell me, why is that familiar?
Boomer Mining settlement? The accident.
Baltar The explosion, right. That was tragic. Your family...
Boomer Died with the rest.
Baltar Im very sorry.
Six Its a lie. Congratulations, Doctor, youve just uncovered your very first Cylon. Now heres an interesting moment in the life of Gaius Baltar. What will he do?
Boomer Is everything okay?
Baltar Yeah, yeah... Im just interpolating the results.
Six Question is, what will she do if you expose her? Thank you, or kill you?
Boomer I thought it was just green or red.
Baltar Well, its a little more complicated than that, actually.
Six She probably doesnt know. Probably thinks shes just another little girl from Troy whose entire background vanished in a mysterious accident. Should be interesting to see how she responds when you tell her the truth. Im guessing her Cylon side will take over and break your neck before you can give away her secret. Lets find out.
Baltar Congratulations, its green! Its very bright green. Youre not Cylon!
Boomer Really?
Baltar 100% human and-- and very, very bright green, as well.
Boomer For a second I was... worried what you were gonna say.
Baltar Were you?
Boomer Yeah.
Baltar Well-- well, theres nothing to be worried about anymore. Yeah, you couldnt be more human if you tried.
Boomer Well, thanks.
Baltar Any time.
Leoben I have something to tell you.
Roslin How long before this supposed bomb goes off?
Billy Less than an hour.
Roslin I want you to get me a shuttle, Im going to the Geminon Traveler, I want to see the Cylon myself.
Billy Madam President, you need to recon--
Roslin Dont even start. I dont wanna discuss this, Ive made my decision.
Billy Not until I get you a security detail.
Starbuck Enough! For fraks sake, let him breathe. Youre sick. Youre not a person, youre a machine thats enjoying its own pain.
Leoben All this has happened before, and all of it will happen again.
Starbuck Dont quote scripture. You dont have the right to use those words.
Leoben You kneel before idols and ask for guidance and you cant see that your destinys already been written. Each of us plays a role, each time a different role. Maybe the last time, I was the interrogator and you were the prisoner. The players change, the story remains the same. And this time... this time, your role is to deliver my soul unto God. Do it for me. Its your destiny, and mine. And I told you I had a surprise for you. Are you ready? Youre gonna find Kobol, birthplace of us all. Kobol will lead you to Earth. This is my gift to you, Kara.
Roslin What the hell is going on here?
Roslin What exactly is it that you are doing here?
Starbuck Its a machine, sir. Theres no limit to the tactics I can use.
Roslin And wheres the warhead?
Starbuck I dont know.
Roslin You dont know. Youve spent the last eight hours torturing this man... this machine, whatever it is. And you dont have a single piece of information to show for it.
Starbuck He thinks he can see the future. Says he knows our destiny, our fate. He says were gonna find Kobol and that its gonna lead us to Earth.
Roslin Clean him up, theres not much time.
Starbuck Yes, sir.
Roslin Do you know who I am?
Leoben Yes.
Roslin I apologize for what youve been through. Take his restraints off. Do it.
Leoben Thank you.
Roslin I can do more. I can guarantee your safety, I can order your release. We are running out of time, we have only four minutes left until your bomb goes off. Ive come here to tell you that this conflict between our peoples does not have to continue. It can stop right here with us. We have to trust each other. Trust me. I think you know you can. Tell me what I need to know and you will live.
Leoben The warhead doesnt exist. I made it up. The lieutenant was right, I was too far out. I didnt wanna die, so when I got caught I made up a story to buy some time.
Roslin I see. Thank you for the truth.
Leoben Thank you, Madam President. Dont be too hard on Kara, she was just doing her job, the military... they teach you to dehumanize people.
Roslin Ill take that into consideration. No! Stand down!
Leoben Laura, I have something to tell you. Adama is a Cylon.
Starbuck Are you all right?
Roslin Im fine. The bomb?
Starbuck Nothing.
Roslin Put him out the airlock.
Starbuck What? You cant do that, not after he told you the truth.
Roslin Yes, I can. And I will. Lieutenant, look at me. Youve lost perspective. During the time Ive allowed him to remain alive and captive on this ship, he has caused our entire fleet to spread out, defenseless. He puts insidious ideas in our minds, more lethal than any warhead. He creates fear. But youre right, he is a machine and you dont keep a deadly machine around when it kills your people and threatens your future, you get rid of it.
Starbuck Hes not afraid to die. Hes just afraid that his soul wont make it to god.
Starbuck Lords of Kobol, hear my prayer. I dont know if he had a soul or not but, if he did, take care of it.
Adama Hell of a risk you took today.
Roslin Something I had to do.
Adama Care to tell me why?
Roslin President Adar once said that the interesting thing about being a president is that you dont have to explain yourself to anyone.
Adama Something wrong?
Roslin No... nothing at all.
