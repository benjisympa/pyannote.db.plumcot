leoben_conoy Cylon... Cylon! Cylon!
leoben_conoy Laura.
president_laura_roslin Yes?
billy_keikeya Madam President, are you okay in there?
president_laura_roslin Im fine, Im just, its the side effects from the Chamalla. You know that thing they say, Whats worse, the cancer or the cure? What do you need?
billy_keikeya Uh, you have an urgent call from the captain of the Geminon Traveler.
president_laura_roslin Can I call him back?
billy_keikeya He says he found a Cylon onboard.
president_laura_roslin They found him in the starboard storage compartment. Looks like hed been camped there for days.
admiral_william_adama Theyre sure its a Cylon?
president_laura_roslin The captain identified him by one of the photos we sent out. Hes another copy of the man you knew as Leoben Conroy.
cpt_lee_adama Where is it now?
president_laura_roslin Aboard the Geminon Traveler locked in a storeroom, under guard.
admiral_william_adama Isolate that ship.
cpt_lee_adama Order the C.A.P. To fly escort around the Geminon Traveler and not to approach any other ship in the fleet.
officer_anastasia_dualla Aye, sir. Kat, Galactica...
admiral_william_adama Ill send a team over to destroy it immediately.
president_laura_roslin I want this man interrogated first.
admiral_william_adama First of all, its not a him, its an it. Second, anything it says cannot be trusted. Best thing to do is to destroy it immediately.
president_laura_roslin Id like to hear what this thing has to say, it might be important.
admiral_william_adama Madam President, Ive dealt with this model before. Itll fill your head with double-talk and half-baked philosophy and confuse you.
president_laura_roslin Then send someone who wont be easily confused, thats an order, Commander. I want him interrogated.
admiral_william_adama Order understood.
captain_kara_thrace You really think itll give me something?
admiral_william_adama No... President disagrees.
captain_kara_thrace Well, you need me to go, Ill shower up and go.
admiral_william_adama Hows this coming?
captain_kara_thrace We, uh, got the entire avionics package figured out - fire control, navigation, and I think that I am zeroing in on her F.T.L. Drive.
admiral_william_adama I did this in a hurry about three weeks ago. Its an after-action report on Leoben. Its a very clever machine. Manipulative, cunning. The only problem with Leoben isnt that he lies, thatd be too easy. Its that he mixes lies with truth. Just remember, hes gonna try to get into your head.
captain_kara_thrace Aw, mom always said there was nothing in there anyway.
admiral_william_adama Just be careful. He has an agenda. Its a goal you wont understand until later. Your job is to make sure he doesnt achieve the goal.
captain_kara_thrace Yes, sir.
captain_kara_thrace Credits
chief_galen_tyrol Lieutenant. Whats up?
lt_sharon_valerii Nothing. Just wanted to see if what I told you the other day helped at all.
chief_galen_tyrol Yeah, actually, it did. You do treat this thing more like an animal than a machine and it actually works. Whered you come up with that, anyway? Just pop into your head?
lt_sharon_valerii Im a Cylon.
chief_galen_tyrol You know, thats not even funny.
lt_sharon_valerii If I could prove that I wasnt, would that make a difference? You know, between us?
Pilot#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode08 Geminon Traveler/raptor seven-one-niner, inbound. Lt. Thrace aboard, permission to dock.
Man#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode08 Roger, seven-one-niner, permission granted.
Captain#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode08 Really does look like a person.
captain_kara_thrace Yeah.
Captain#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode08 Must be all full of wires inside.
captain_kara_thrace Nah, you cut em open theres blood, guts, the whole thing. Its sweating.
Captain#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode08 Well, Ill be. Look at that. Gods, they go through a lot of trouble to imitate people. Why do you think they do that?
captain_kara_thrace I dont care why. But the fact that these things sweat... now, thats interesting.
captain_kara_thrace Sleeping?
leoben_conoy Praying.
captain_kara_thrace I dont think the gods answer the prayers of toasters.
leoben_conoy God answers everyones prayers.
captain_kara_thrace How many Cylons are there in the fleet?
leoben_conoy We havent been properly introduced. Im Leoben.
captain_kara_thrace How many Cylons are there in the fleet?
leoben_conoy I have no idea. Whats your name?
captain_kara_thrace How long have you been hiding aboard this ship?
leoben_conoy Am I not allowed to know your name?
captain_kara_thrace Why were you hiding aboard this ship?
leoben_conoy I had a mission to perform. Listen, its a small thing can you just tell me who you are?
captain_kara_thrace Tell me about your mission and Ill think about it.
leoben_conoy My mission was to conduct sabotage.
captain_kara_thrace What kind of sabotage?
leoben_conoy God, you stink. Can we get some air in here? Between you and the humidity...
captain_kara_thrace I am not here to play games with you. You said you wanted to cooperate. Either start talking or we are done.
leoben_conoy Okay. But... I really wanna know your name.
captain_kara_thrace Open.
leoben_conoy Are you Lt. Starbuck? Yes, you are. I knew it... I was right, I was right. I saw it, Ive seen it...
captain_kara_thrace Happy now?
leoben_conoy It all makes sense now, doesnt it? Now we can talk, now we can talk about a lot of things.
captain_kara_thrace Like what?
leoben_conoy I planted a nuclear warhead aboard one of your ships. Its set to go off at 18:30 hours.
captain_kara_thrace Where?
leoben_conoy Not ready to give that up yet.
captain_kara_thrace Youre lying, theres no warhead.
leoben_conoy You cant take the chance, Starbuck. Your military training dictates you take it to your masters and let them decide.
captain_kara_thrace Maybe my training wasnt so good. Maybe I push you out the airlock and tell em you never said a word.
leoben_conoy Now whos lying? These things happen for a reason, dont they? Im looking forward to spending a little bit more time with you, Starbuck we have a lot to talk about! Its gonna be fun.
admiral_william_adama Put the R.A.D. Team on alert immediately - Dee! - And sweep Galactica for any kind of radiological devices.
colonel_saul_tigh Right.
admiral_william_adama Contact all the captains in the fleet. Tell them to do radiological sweeps of their ships but emphasize this is just a precaution. I dont wanna alarm anyone until we know for sure.
officer_anastasia_dualla Yes, sir.
president_laura_roslin Well, well know for sure in 8 hours and 40 minutes. Lt. Thrace, did he say anything else?
captain_kara_thrace No. Well, he uh-- he guessed my callsign. Seemed really happy when he found out who I was.
admiral_william_adama Hes playing with your mind. Hes been stowed away for weeks aboard the fleet. 50 ways he could have heard the word Starbuck on a wireless set.
captain_kara_thrace Thats what I figured, sir.
president_laura_roslin Any idea what he wants, Lieutenant?
captain_kara_thrace Not yet. Says hes looking forward to spending time with me, though.
admiral_william_adama Dont take any chances, Starbuck.
captain_kara_thrace Yes, sir.
leoben_conoy You believe in the gods, dont you? Lords of Kobol and all that?
captain_kara_thrace Why should I tell you?
leoben_conoy Come on, its not a trick question, I just wanna see how much I got right. So you pray to Artemis and Aphrodite?
captain_kara_thrace Wheres the warhead?
leoben_conoy I was right. See, our faiths are similar but I look to one God, not to many.
captain_kara_thrace I dont give a damn what you believe.
leoben_conoy To know the face of God is to know madness. I see the universe. I see the patterns. I see the foreshadowing that precedes every moment of every day. Its all there, I see it and you dont. And I have a surprise for you. I have something to tell you about the future.
captain_kara_thrace Is that so?
leoben_conoy It is. But we have to see this through to the end. What is the most basic article of faith? This is not all that we are. See, the difference between you and me is, I know what that means and you dont. I know that Im more than this body, more than this consciousness. A part of me swims in the stream, but in truth, Im standing on the shore; the current never takes me downstream.
captain_kara_thrace This is worse than Galactica and I didnt think that was possible. What was that, swimmin in streams or something?
leoben_conoy You mind?
captain_kara_thrace Mm.
leoben_conoy Thank you. Starving, havent eaten in days.
captain_kara_thrace Kinda bad programming, isnt it? I mean, why bother with hunger?
leoben_conoy Part of being human.
captain_kara_thrace Youre not human. Hows your lunch?
leoben_conoy You know how it is. When youre starving, anything tastes good.
leoben_conoy Oh!
captain_kara_thrace Did that hurt?
leoben_conoy Yeah, it hurt.
captain_kara_thrace Machines shouldnt feel pain. Shouldnt bleed, shouldnt sweat.
leoben_conoy Sweat, thats funny, thats good.
captain_kara_thrace See, now, a smart Cylon would turn off the ol pain software about now. But I dont think youre so smart.
leoben_conoy Maybe Ill turn it off and you wont even know.
captain_kara_thrace Hmm. Heres your dilemma, turn off the pain, you feel better but that makes you a machine, not a person. You see, human beings cant turn off their pain. Human beings have to suffer and cry and scream and endure because they have no choice. So the only way you can avoid the pain you are about to receive is by telling me exactly what I wanna know. Just like a human would.
leoben_conoy I knew this about you. Youre everything I thought you would be. But it wont work, I wont tell you anything.
captain_kara_thrace Maybe not. But then youll know, deep down, that I beat you. That a human being beat you. And that you are truly no greater than we are. Youre just a bunch of machines, after all.
leoben_conoy Let the games begin.
number_six Hi. Ah, look what the cat dragged in.
dr_gaius_baltar Lt. Valerii... its an unexpected visit. You look wonderful.
lt_sharon_valerii I need your help.
dr_gaius_baltar Anything I can do. Anything at all.
number_six Wonder why they call her Boomer?
lt_sharon_valerii I heard youre working on a test to tell the difference between Cylons and humans?
number_six Bingo.
dr_gaius_baltar I cant really talk about that, at the moment. You wouldnt help settle a bet for me, would you? Now, why do they call you boomer?
lt_sharon_valerii If youre working on a Cylon detector, do you think I could be in the first batch? You know, to be tested?
number_six Whats her rush?
dr_gaius_baltar Whats your rush? Im not sure itd be appropriate to show favoritism if, indeed, Im working on anything at all.
lt_sharon_valerii I saved your life back on Caprica. My co-pilot gave up a seat for you. And I brought you back to Galactica, to safety. You wouldnt even be here if it wasnt for me. You owe me.
number_six She shoots, she scores.
dr_gaius_baltar I suppose theres some small truth to that.
lt_sharon_valerii So can you test me or not?
number_six I think you should do it. Results will be quite intriguing.
dr_gaius_baltar The technology for Cylon detection is not quite ready for full-scale implementation. But I could use a beta test subject.
number_six Sharons late.
aaron_doral Half an hour. I notice youre calling her Sharon now.
number_six Yeah, well, I choose to think of her as one of them.
aaron_doral Because you dislike her?
number_six Because in the scheme of things, we are as we do. She acts like one of em, thinks like them... she is one of them.
aaron_doral But shes one of us. It would be best to remember that.
lt_sharon_valerii We had sex.
aaron_doral Congratulations.
number_six Does he love you?
lt_sharon_valerii I think so.
number_six Has he said it?
lt_sharon_valerii Not directly.
number_six Then youre just guessing.
aaron_doral Stay in your current location. Were setting up a cabin for you nearby, food, water, electricity, all the comforts.
number_six Shouldnt be too hard to convince him to stay and start a life together. If not, kill him. Can you handle that?
lt_sharon_valerii Helo... Helo !
captain_karl_agathon Hey, hey, whats going on?
lt_sharon_valerii We gotta go, now. I saw the Cylons, theyre headed this way. We gotta travel fast, even faster than before.
captain_karl_agathon Why? Whats different?
lt_sharon_valerii Everything. Just trust me.
captain_karl_agathon I do.
captain_kara_thrace Now, if you were human, youd be just about ready to start offering up some false information about the location of the nuke. Some tiny thing that might get you a reward and maybe spare you a few minutes of this. But then I keep forgetting, youre not human. Youre a machine.
leoben_conoy I am more than you could ever imagine. I am God.
captain_kara_thrace Im sorry, youre god? Wow... nice to meet ya. Thats good, thats good. Well give you a couple of minutes for that.
leoben_conoy Its funny, isnt it? Were all God, Starbuck, all of us. I see the love that binds all living things together.
captain_kara_thrace Love? You dont even know what the word means.
leoben_conoy I know that God loved you more than all other living creatures and you repaid his divine love with sin, with hate, corruption, evil. So then he decided to create the Cylons.
captain_kara_thrace The gods had nothing to do with it. We created you... us. It was a stupid, fraked-up decision and we have paid for it. You slaughtered my entire civilization! That is sin! That is evil, and you are evil.
leoben_conoy Am I? I see the truths that float past you in the stream.
captain_kara_thrace You got a real thing about rivers and streams, dont you? I think we should indulge you in your obsession.
leoben_conoy Do you realize I could kill you before they came back in the room? I could get to my feet, rip your skull from your spinal column, crash through that door, kill the guard in less time than its taking me to describe it to you?
captain_kara_thrace Then why dont you?
leoben_conoy Its not the time. I have a surprise for you.
captain_kara_thrace You fraked up, pal. Now the gloves come off.
colonel_saul_tigh Combat, Col. Tigh.
admiral_william_adama Hows the search going for the nuke?
colonel_saul_tigh Nothing so far.
admiral_william_adama How much time remaining?
colonel_saul_tigh Two hours, nine minutes.
admiral_william_adama Spread out the fleet. No ship more than 500 clicks from any other ship. If theres a nuke, lets limit the damage.
colonel_saul_tigh Aye, sir.
admiral_william_adama No.
captain_kara_thrace Do it. Leave him.
Guard#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode08 Sir?
captain_kara_thrace Tell me where the warhead is. Otherwise youre gonna drown in that bucket.
leoben_conoy I cant drown, I cant die.
captain_kara_thrace Right, Commander Adama mentioned that how, if your body dies, your consciousness is downloaded or transferred into another body or something like that?
leoben_conoy No, exactly like that.
captain_kara_thrace But, you see, Ive been thinking. Why is a Cylon willing to talk at all? Why does he care if we destroy his body? Wont he just transfer away and laugh at all of us and our stupid human ideas? Tell me where the warhead is.
leoben_conoy This is not your path, Starbuck. You have a different destiny.
captain_kara_thrace Dont interrupt me. You see, Im gonna dazzle you with my poor human brain. You see, I think that youre afraid. Youre afraid that were a long way from home. What if you dont transfer all the way back? What if, when you die here, you really die? Its your chance to find out if youre really god or just a bunch of circuits with a bad haircut.
leoben_conoy Im not afraid of dying.
captain_kara_thrace Somebodys programmed you with a fairy tale of god and streams and life ever after but, somewhere in that hard drive that you call a brain is a beeping message: Error, error, does not compute. I dont have a soul, I have software. If I die, Im gone.
leoben_conoy I have a soul. I see patterns. I know you, youre damaged. You were born to a woman who believes that suffering was good for the soul, so you suffered. Life is a testament to pain, injuries, accidents. Some inflicted upon others, some inflicted upon yourself. Surrounds you like a bubble but its not... real its just-- thats just something she put into your head. Its something that you wanna believe cause it means that youre the problem, not the world that you live in. You wanna believe it because... it means that youre bad luck. Like a cancer that needs to be removed. Because you hear her voice every day and you want her to be right.
captain_kara_thrace Start again.
dr_gaius_baltar Now, we just pop this in the slot and wait for the result. Green, youre a normal human being. Red, youre an evil Cylon. Should take a couple of minutes. So, uh, tell me, are you from Aerilon? Slight trace of an accent there...
lt_sharon_valerii What? Uh, no-- Troy.
dr_gaius_baltar Troy. Troy-- tell me, why is that familiar?
lt_sharon_valerii Mining settlement? The accident.
dr_gaius_baltar The explosion, right. That was tragic. Your family...
lt_sharon_valerii Died with the rest.
dr_gaius_baltar Im very sorry.
number_six Its a lie. Congratulations, Doctor, youve just uncovered your very first Cylon. Now heres an interesting moment in the life of Gaius Baltar. What will he do?
lt_sharon_valerii Is everything okay?
dr_gaius_baltar Yeah, yeah... Im just interpolating the results.
number_six Question is, what will she do if you expose her? Thank you, or kill you?
lt_sharon_valerii I thought it was just green or red.
dr_gaius_baltar Well, its a little more complicated than that, actually.
number_six She probably doesnt know. Probably thinks shes just another little girl from Troy whose entire background vanished in a mysterious accident. Should be interesting to see how she responds when you tell her the truth. Im guessing her Cylon side will take over and break your neck before you can give away her secret. Lets find out.
dr_gaius_baltar Congratulations, its green! Its very bright green. Youre not Cylon!
lt_sharon_valerii Really?
dr_gaius_baltar 100% human and-- and very, very bright green, as well.
lt_sharon_valerii For a second I was... worried what you were gonna say.
dr_gaius_baltar Were you?
lt_sharon_valerii Yeah.
dr_gaius_baltar Well-- well, theres nothing to be worried about anymore. Yeah, you couldnt be more human if you tried.
lt_sharon_valerii Well, thanks.
dr_gaius_baltar Any time.
leoben_conoy I have something to tell you.
president_laura_roslin How long before this supposed bomb goes off?
billy_keikeya Less than an hour.
president_laura_roslin I want you to get me a shuttle, Im going to the Geminon Traveler, I want to see the Cylon myself.
billy_keikeya Madam President, you need to recon--
president_laura_roslin Dont even start. I dont wanna discuss this, Ive made my decision.
billy_keikeya Not until I get you a security detail.
captain_kara_thrace Enough! For fraks sake, let him breathe. Youre sick. Youre not a person, youre a machine thats enjoying its own pain.
leoben_conoy All this has happened before, and all of it will happen again.
captain_kara_thrace Dont quote scripture. You dont have the right to use those words.
leoben_conoy You kneel before idols and ask for guidance and you cant see that your destinys already been written. Each of us plays a role, each time a different role. Maybe the last time, I was the interrogator and you were the prisoner. The players change, the story remains the same. And this time... this time, your role is to deliver my soul unto God. Do it for me. Its your destiny, and mine. And I told you I had a surprise for you. Are you ready? Youre gonna find Kobol, birthplace of us all. Kobol will lead you to Earth. This is my gift to you, Kara.
president_laura_roslin What the hell is going on here?
president_laura_roslin What exactly is it that you are doing here?
captain_kara_thrace Its a machine, sir. Theres no limit to the tactics I can use.
president_laura_roslin And wheres the warhead?
captain_kara_thrace I dont know.
president_laura_roslin You dont know. Youve spent the last eight hours torturing this man... this machine, whatever it is. And you dont have a single piece of information to show for it.
captain_kara_thrace He thinks he can see the future. Says he knows our destiny, our fate. He says were gonna find Kobol and that its gonna lead us to Earth.
president_laura_roslin Clean him up, theres not much time.
captain_kara_thrace Yes, sir.
president_laura_roslin Do you know who I am?
leoben_conoy Yes.
president_laura_roslin I apologize for what youve been through. Take his restraints off. Do it.
leoben_conoy Thank you.
president_laura_roslin I can do more. I can guarantee your safety, I can order your release. We are running out of time, we have only four minutes left until your bomb goes off. Ive come here to tell you that this conflict between our peoples does not have to continue. It can stop right here with us. We have to trust each other. Trust me. I think you know you can. Tell me what I need to know and you will live.
leoben_conoy The warhead doesnt exist. I made it up. The lieutenant was right, I was too far out. I didnt wanna die, so when I got caught I made up a story to buy some time.
president_laura_roslin I see. Thank you for the truth.
leoben_conoy Thank you, Madam President. Dont be too hard on Kara, she was just doing her job, the military... they teach you to dehumanize people.
president_laura_roslin Ill take that into consideration. No! Stand down!
leoben_conoy Laura, I have something to tell you. Adama is a Cylon.
captain_kara_thrace Are you all right?
president_laura_roslin Im fine. The bomb?
captain_kara_thrace Nothing.
president_laura_roslin Put him out the airlock.
captain_kara_thrace What? You cant do that, not after he told you the truth.
president_laura_roslin Yes, I can. And I will. Lieutenant, look at me. Youve lost perspective. During the time Ive allowed him to remain alive and captive on this ship, he has caused our entire fleet to spread out, defenseless. He puts insidious ideas in our minds, more lethal than any warhead. He creates fear. But youre right, he is a machine and you dont keep a deadly machine around when it kills your people and threatens your future, you get rid of it.
captain_kara_thrace Hes not afraid to die. Hes just afraid that his soul wont make it to god.
captain_kara_thrace Lords of Kobol, hear my prayer. I dont know if he had a soul or not but, if he did, take care of it.
admiral_william_adama Hell of a risk you took today.
president_laura_roslin Something I had to do.
admiral_william_adama Care to tell me why?
president_laura_roslin President Adar once said that the interesting thing about being a president is that you dont have to explain yourself to anyone.
admiral_william_adama Something wrong?
president_laura_roslin No... nothing at all.
