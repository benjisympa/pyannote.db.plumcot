Gaeta Commander? Heres Doctor Baltars report. And the President is waiting for you up in the core.
Adama Thank you.
Adama Clear the deck. Madame President, we are the proud owners of the universes first bona fide Cylon detector.
Roslin Well, that is great news.
Adama Yeah.
Roslin So, when do we begin?
Adama Doctor Baltar would like to start widespread testing as soon as possible, but there are some serious limitations. He can only do one person at a time and verification takes hours.
Roslin So, whos going to go first?
Adama Oh, the tests, right. Well, I think people in sensitive positions should go first.
Roslin I completely agree. How about you?
Adama Excuse me?
Roslin If youre a Cylon, Id like to know.
Adama If Im a Cylon, youre really screwed.
Roslin Seriously. I do think that you should go first. Show everyone in the fleet that they can trust the people at the top.
Adama Then maybe you should go first. All right. Ill go first.
Roslin I think thats good. I do.
Pilot Break on my mark.
Billy Whoa... do they always do that?
Dualla No, theyre just showing off. They know Im in here.
Billy Oh?
Dualla Well, you date a special assistant to the President word gets out.
Billy So this is officially a date?
Dualla Jurys still out.
Officer Observation deck, you have two minutes remaining.
Dualla You could pull rank. You could tell them youre on special business for the President of the Colonies.
Billy Your boss pulls more weight around here than mine. You just tell them Adama wants you to—
Dualla Yeah? What? Wants me to what?
Billy I lost my train of thought.
Dualla Mm-hmm.
Billy How is he these days, by the way?
Dualla The old man? Hes fine, I guess.
Billy You guess?
Dualla Been acting kind of funny lately. Seems distracted or something. Hes been making all these weird calls from his quarters you know, super-secret.
Billy Its probably a security thing.
Dualla He doesnt want me to log the calls, though. No trace file, nothing.
Billy This just started?
Dualla A few days ago. Billy Keikeya... are you pumping me for information about the old man?
Officer Times up!
Billy No... of course not.
Dualla You are, you are. Youre a spy, thats what you are.
Billy Im just asking a couple of questions.
Dualla Well, I hope you like the answers. Because theyre the last ones... youre gonna get for a while.
Roslin Whatd you find out?
Billy Dualla couldnt put her finger on it, but yeah. She said hes been acting differently.
Roslin I could see that myself, he was distracted and unfocused. What else?
Billy Some scrambled wireless calls he didnt want logged. She didnt know who he called or why. But none of this is damning evidence. The calls could be security related, and his odd behavior could be stress, pure and simple. Exhaustion, paranoia—
Roslin Youre right, it could be any of those things. But what if its not?
Billy Madame President, with all due respect, I cannot believe that were actually entertaining the idea that Commander Adama has been somehow... replaced by a Cylon duplicate.
Roslin Oh, my gods, Billy, I hope youre right.
Baltar Is suicide really a sin?
#6 A mortal one, Im afraid. But its not that bad, is it, Gaius?
Baltar 47,905 people in the fleet. Theres 47,905 blood samples. 11 hours to test each one for Cylon indicators. Well, thatll take a while. 21,956 days.
#6 60.1534 years.
Baltar Well, now, lets figure in a few hours for sleep here and there. Well call that an even 61, shall we? Sure. Id prefer to kill myself. Commander Adama... are you a Cylon? Tune in tomorrow.
#6 Oh, its hard being a genius. Yes. There should be some perks.
Baltar Yes.
Starbuck Whats up, doc?
Baltar Lieutenant Thrace. Its good to see you, Im just... Im just keeping up with the old exercises. That should, uh, that should do me-- do me for today. Oh-- oh, I feel a lot better. Um, what brings you to the lab at this time of the night?
Starbuck Its the middle of the afternoon.
Baltar Yeah, of course it is, crazy workload. I totally, totally lose track of time. So, what can I do for you?
Starbuck You can zip up your fly.
Baltar So, uh...
Starbuck My blood test.
#6 Youre right about one thing, Gaius. There is something very intriguing about her.
Baltar Very. Good, very good.
Gaeta Dradis contact! Cylon raider bearing 738 carom 005!
Dualla Galactica/Apollo. Cylon raider bearing 738 carom 005.
Gaeta Action stations. Action stations. Set condition one throughout the ship. Repeat this is not a drill!
Dualla Close in and destroy, acknowledge?
Apollo Were on it, Galactica. Jumped right in front of us... his mistake!
Tigh How many?
Gaeta Single raider, looks like a recon patrol. Apollo and Beehive already has them in their sight.
Tigh Wheres the old man?
Dualla Hes not aboard, sir.
Tigh Not aboard- where the hell is he?
Dualla He left in a raptor about an hour ago, no flight plan.
Tigh No flight plan?
Apollo Thats it, Beehive. You set them up, Ill knock them down. I winged him! Looks like I got his weapons system. He-- he jumped! Repeat, he jumped away before we could zero him out.
Tigh Damn it. Hes probably giving away our position to every Cylon base ship right now. Where the hell is the old man? Order the fleet to execute emergency jump procedures! Everyone rendezvous at the standby coordinates.
Gaeta Contact! Single raider... bearing, 881 carom 247.
Dualla Apollo/Galactica. Cylon raider detected at 881 carom 24—
Apollo Wait, I see him, I see him! Its the same raider.
Tigh What?
Apollo Yeah, its the same raider. I can see the damage from before. Its behaving erratically. He jumped away again!
Gaeta Contact. Single raider same telltales. Its like hes flying around in circles.
Tigh Wounded bird cant fly home.
Apollo Galactica/Apollo. Weve got him on dradis but hes pretty far out there. Itll take us about three minutes to close into weapons range.
Tigh No! This is our perfect chance to get some intell. Order Apollo to close with the raider, but do not engage. Put a raptor in the air. As long as that things flopping around out there, tell them I want to suck in every electronic signal it makes.
Dualla Yes, sir. Colonel, Commander Adamas raptor is requesting permission to enter the landing pattern.
Tigh Permission granted. Stand-down to condition two. Mr. Gaeta, you have the deck.
Adama Permission to come aboard, sir.
Tigh Granted. Mind telling me where the hell youve been?
Adama Colonel Tigh, allow me to present your wife.
Tigh Ellen!
Helo Fraking noise! I dont get it. Ive blown away centurions before and theyve never sent an entire army after me.
Caprica_Boomer Theyre after me.
Helo Why you?
Caprica_Boomer While they were holding me, I overheard some things.
Helo What?
Helo Delphi? Fraking bastards!
Caprica_Boomer Its the best place to try to grab a ship and try to get off this fraking planet.
Baltar Doctor Gaius Baltar, department of Cylon detection. How may I direct your call?
Roslin Youre in a good mood.
Baltar Madame President... Im-- Im sorry, I was expecting someone else. We havent spoken in ages.
Roslin Doctor, I would like you to call me the moment Commander Adamas test is complete, will you do that?
Baltar Commander Adama canceled his test a short time ago.
Roslin Why?
Baltar I dont know, um, he gave me another sample and said it had priority.
Roslin Whose?
Baltar Ill just check. Some woman called Ellen. No surname, he dropped it off and left. Is there a problem?
Roslin Doctor Baltar, I would like you to resume testing Commander Adamas blood sample immediately. Thank you.
Tigh I cant believe youre alive.
Ellen I cant believe it myself. Saul, I dont remember the last few weeks. Its weeks, right?
Tigh Right. Youve been on the Rising Star all this time?
Ellen I guess so. The last thing I remember is being on Picon. I was at the airport, buying a ticket home, and hearing something about the Cylons. And then, just dreams, mostly dreams. Until a couple of days ago. They told me I was-- I was knocked out when the Cylons attacked the airport and someone just picked me up, and put me on the last flight out. Some savior, I dont even know who.
Tigh Its okay, its all right. Its all right, youre here now.
Starbuck Looks like weve found a treasure chest. I mean, one of the major issues weve been having with the raider we captured is trying to figure out the faster light drive. This winter bird is jumping all over the place out there.
Tyrol Yeah, and every time it jumps, it gives us more data we can use. But the question remains, whats it doing out there in the first place, and how long can they keep it up?
Adama The moment you have your F.T.L. Data, give me an update.
Tyrol Yes sir.
Adama Lets not let this thing linger out there longer than we have to.
Tyrol Yes, sir.
Apollo You wanted to see me, sir?
Adama Stay on it.
Starbuck Yes, sir.
Adama Do you have dinner plans?
Apollo What?
Adama Come on.
Ellen I never thought Id see your face again.
Tigh Me neither.
Ellen The things I said before, the things I did—
Tigh Shh-- in the past, all in the past.
Ellen Start over?
Tigh Start over. I have—
Ellen Forget it.
Tigh I cant, I cant... I cant, Im on duty. X.O. Now? Understood. Uh, all right, tell her Im on my way.
Ellen Girlfriend?
Tigh Official business.
Ellen Feels like old times.
Tigh Id explain, but—
Ellen Its classified.
Tigh Ill be back as soon as I can.
Ellen Hey... Ill be here, waiting.
Tigh As soon as I can.
Tigh You wanna be very, very careful with what you just said. You are talking about a man I owe my life to many times over. I know these are uncertain times and this has been a difficult transition for you.
Roslin Excuse me, Colonel. I do appreciate how difficult this is for you to hear, believe me. But I would advise you right now not to say anything that you will regret. I need to know if you have seen anything suspicious about his recent behavior.
Tigh No.
Roslin What about the fact that he left the Galactica without telling anyone where he was going or when he would return and at that very moment, a Cylon raider jumped into view and started acting strangely?
Tigh I know exactly where he was.
Roslin You do?
Tigh He was picking up my wife.
Roslin Your wife?
Tigh It turns out shes been unconscious aboard the Rising Star ever since the attack.
Roslin Oh, my gods. Thats fantastic, its amazing.
Tigh Yes, it is. When Ellen stepped off that shuttle, I thought I was going to pass out.
Roslin Ellen? Your wifes name is Ellen?
Tigh Yes, it is... Ellen. Ellen Tigh.
Roslin Id very much like to meet your wife, colonel.
Tigh Ellen?
Ellen Did you shut the door?
Tigh I already did.
Ellen Surprise!
Tigh Ambrosia, where did you get this?
Ellen I have my ways. I thought it might be just the thing for a little celebration.
Tigh We need to talk.
Ellen First things first. There. Starting over.
Tigh Starting over. Im technically still on duty.
Ellen Oh, I think they can do without you for a day.
Tigh It doesnt really work that way. To starting over. Yes, just a little more.
Ellen Sure, theres a lot of whining and complaining, like you would expect. But the people I talked to are mostly hopeful and optimistic.
Roslin Thats good to hear.
Ellen Mmm... well, there are a few people who still might wonder if a kindergarten teacher is really the right person to be President but its just a tiny, tiny minority.
Roslin Wonderful, wonderful.
Ellen Everyone is so truly, truly grateful to all of you on Galactica. You-- you literally are our saviors.
Tigh Oh, were just doing our jobs, thats all.
Ellen You are so modest. Hes always been that way. ooh! Lee... could I trouble you for a little bit more of this lovely ambrosia?
Apollo Sure.
Ellen Thank you, dear. Bill, you must be so proud of your sons. Lee here has grown into such a handsome man. I can only imagine what Zak must look like now. You are the spitting image of your mother, and I bet Zak takes just after his daddy.
Adama Zak passed away a couple of years ago.
Ellen Im sorry. Tragic, the death of a child. Theres been so much death, so much pain... sometimes, its completely overwhelming. But Im sure he was a beautiful boy.
Adama The captain of the Rising Star was a little puzzled as to how you got on board his ship.
Ellen Oh, I know. I know some thoughtful soul just rescued me from an almost certain death and put me on the last flight out of Picon!
Roslin How lucky for us all.
Tigh It is, indeed.
Adama The strange thing is, no one can recall giving you any medical assistance until about a week ago.
Ellen Oh, I know! I know. Its a miracle Im alive!
Apollo Ahem, uh... I think Id better clear some of these, uh, dishes.
Ellen You are so sweet.
Tigh Very good. My compliments to the chef.
Ellen So, Bill, now, the question on everyones mind and I do mean everyone—
Ellen Its okay. Is... wheres earth and when do we get there?
Adama Yeah, thats classified information.
Ellen Oh... that word again!
Tigh Ellen, leave the man alone.
Ellen Well, come on, if there are no privileges of being an X.O.S wife, then whats the point? I mean, Bill, were all family here. Come on...
Adama The need for secrecy is paramount, Ellen.
Roslin Oh, Im sorry. Perhaps you dont know that the Cylons look like us, now.
Ellen Oh, that, yes... yes, I knew that.
Roslin Its recent news. Most people just found out a few days ago.
Ellen A thing like that would travel fast, right?
Adama Any one of us can be a Cylon.
Ellen Boo!
Ellen Did you see the looks on their faces? You are too easy.
Adama Thank you so much for coming. Its been a wonderful evening.
Tigh Thought it would never end.
Ellen Oh... I seem to have lost one of my shoes.
Apollo I think its right here.
Ellen Thank you.
Apollo Here you are.
Adama You look very, very happy.
Tigh Thats because I am very, very happy.
Ellen Thank you... um-- oop!
Apollo Well, it was, uh, it was nice to see you again.
Apollo Oh, the pleasures all mine. Hope to see you soon.
Apollo Im sure you will.
Ellen Whoa...! Oh, wait, hang on, hang on, hang on... Bill, lovely evening.
Tigh Ive got her.
Adama Be careful.
Roslin You actually think that woman is a Cylon?
Apollo Well, if shes not, then were all in a lot of trouble.
Adama The scuttlebutt was that she slept with more than half the fleet while Saul was in space.
Adama Blindly. Ellen used to encourage the worst instincts in this guy. Bring out the self-destructive streak in him.
Helo Sharon... stop, I cant keep up!
Caprica_Boomer Helo... Helo, come on! Come on, you can do it! Please, you have to get up! Right there, right there. turn your light off. Come on, we gotta find another way outta here. Were going! Why arent you running?
Helo You keep going and going, you never get tired.
Caprica_Boomer Its adrenaline! Im not gonna die here, and Im not gonna let you die here, either! Okay, lets go!
Tigh Don’t you worry, I’ll get us home.
Ellen Oh, yeah, right! Just like Bills getting us to earth.
Tigh Dont start on bill.
Ellen Ugh... what are you-- he doesnt have the slightest idea where Earth is!
Tigh You dont have to yell it through the hall.
Ellen Bill Adama doesnt know where earth is!
Baltar Colonel?
Tigh Doctor.
Ellen Woo!
Baltar Actually, I-- I dont believe Ive had the pleasure. Im Doctor Gaius—
Ellen Baltar. I know exactly who you are. And the pleasures all mine.
#6 Something here, isnt there?
Ellen Youre still holding my hand...
Baltar Thats funny, I thought you were still holding onto mine.
Tigh Im watching you, both of you.
#6 And you should be watching her.
Ellen Care to join us for a nightcap, Doctor?
Baltar Id love to—
Gaeta_on_intercom Doctor Baltar, please report to the lab. The Commander is waiting for you.
Baltar But I cant. Another time, perhaps?
Ellen Count on it. Ta-ta! Oh, Saulie, are you-- are you jealous?
Tigh You said we were starting over.
Ellen We are, sweetheart, we are. That was just a little bit of harmless flirting.
Tigh No.
Ellen Mmm. You should know something.
Tigh What?
Ellen In the middle of dinner... Bill put his hand on my leg.
Tigh Ellen, Im not falling for this.
Ellen Did you know he came to see me on the Rising Star? What? Hed come into my room, Id pretend to be asleep and hed sit by the side of my bed. And then hed touch me—
Tigh Why are you doing this? Youre lying.
Ellen I am not! He was on that ship! And Im gonna prove it. Come on!
Baltar Look, its not magic, its science. If you want my result, youre gonna have to wait a while.
Adama I gave you her sample this morning.
Baltar I have started and stopped the test twice already now so Im running a little behind.
Adama Twice?
Roslin My fault... long story.
Adama Your fault?
Baltar Yes, I probably shouldnt have mentioned that.
Roslin No, you probably shouldnt have.
Adama Did you tell him to stop Ellens tests?
Roslin Yes, I did.
Adama Why?
Roslin Well, I had some concerns.
Adama About what?
Roslin In all honesty, I think its fair to say that your behavior recently has been odd.
Adama My behavior? What, do you think Im a Cylon? Me?
Roslin You cant deny that youve been making these-- what are they called... off-log calls? These mysterious trips off the ship.
Adama Where did you hear that? Have you been spying on me, on my own ship!
Baltar Ladies and gentlemen, please, please. Were in a laboratory. There are hazardous chemical compounds everywhere. That-- thats a thermo-nuclear bomb, for fraks sake.
Apollo What-- what do you mean, unlogged-- mysterious trips... whats going on?
Adama I had to go to the Rising Star and I didnt want Tigh to know about it.
Roslin Why not?
Adama Because whether or not his wife is a Cylon, shes nothing but trouble and I wanted to keep her away from him as long as I could.
Apollo Well, then, why did you bring her on board the ship?
Adama Because shes his wife! I couldnt refuse her access to her own husband without causing suspicion. Besides, I wanted her close to me.
Ellen I told you! I told you he wanted me.
Baltar Oh, lovely.
Tigh What the hells going on? You have been secretly visiting my wife?
Adama No! Yes-- but its complicated.
Ellen I told you. Hes been after me for years!
Adama What?
Ellen Now, boys, boys, dont fight over little ol me.
Roslin Ellen, be quiet!
Ellen No, you dont tell me—
Apollo I think we should all just take a deep, deep breath.
Adama I was afraid that she might be a Cylon. So I brought her blood over here and had it tested.
Roslin Thats why you cancelled your test?
Adama Howd you know about that?
Roslin You didnt tell me he was testing my wife.
Adama You met with the President?
Roslin Yes. She thought you might be a Cylon.
Adama I know.
Gaeta_on_intercom Attention, pass the word to the Commander the X.O. And the C.A.G. Commander Adama, Colonel Tigh, Captain Adama please report to C.I.C.
Adama Mr. Gaeta.
Gaeta The raider smoothed out its flight plan about two minutes ago.
Apollo It seems to be under control.
Adama Yeah, but hes not jumping for home.
Gaeta No, sir, he isnt.
Tigh Has our reconnaissance detected any outgoing communications since it straightened out its flight pattern?
Gaeta Yes, sir, but its likely its just another distress signal.
Tigh Launch the alert fighters.
Apollo This is the C.A.G., Launch alert fighters.
Starbuck Sir, I hate to tell you this but, I think its been playing with us the entire time just waiting to see how wed react.
Adama Playing with us?
Starbuck Yeah.
Adama Order the flight leader to destroy the target.
Gaeta Yes, sir.
Hotdog Whoa... Galactica/Hotdog, the raider just took off! He doesnt look injured to me.
Beehive Hes heading back towards the fleet.
Starbuck Theyre not gonna catch him.
Gaeta Action stations, action stations. Set condition one throughout the ship. This is not a drill.
Apollo He doesnt have any weapons.
Starbuck Hes on a suicide run.
Adama Did you launch the alert fighters?
Apollo It was the X.O.S call.
Tigh I had a hunch.
Adama Good call.
Tigh one question—
Adama Because I was worried.
Tigh That she might be a Cylon.
Adama And if she wasnt. I know how you feel about her, Saul. Shes been a negative force in your life and Im sorry about that but its the truth.
Tigh Maybe she was, everything was different then. She was different, I was different.
Adama Ive just grown accustomed to seeing you without the cup in your hand.
Tigh So I had a couple of drinks tonight, I was celebrating, I think I deserved—
Adama Yes, you did. Launching those fighters on a hunch... saved our ship.
Tigh Just doing my job.
Adama You do your job good. Thats why I need you, Saul. That, and that were friends. And I dont want anything to come between that, not even Ellen.
Tigh It wont.
Doral Theyve searched every street, every building... they slipped through, how is that possible?
#6 She thinks she loves him now, that she cant live without him. Her passion is making her more resourceful.
Doral It bothers you, doesnt it?
#6 Well get them in the end.
Doral No, it bothers you that youve never experienced it.
#6 You saw the way Helo was when we took her away? He was pathetic.
Doral I cant help wondering what it would be like to feel that intensely. Even in his anguish, he seemed... so alive.
Baltar Green. Green, everyone. Mrs. Tigh is definitely human.
Adama No hard feelings I hope, Ellen.
Ellen I completely understand. But lets be sure and test you next.
Baltar Doctor? My pleasure. My job.
Ellen You dont wanna frak with me, Bill. Try to remember that.
Adama Dont frak with me either, Ellen.
#6 If only they knew that everyone passes these days.
Baltar Well, its so much simpler that way. No muss, no fuss.
#6 So... what did her test really say?
Baltar Ill never tell.
