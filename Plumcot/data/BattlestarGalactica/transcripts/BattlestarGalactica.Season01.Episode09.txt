lt_felix_gaeta Commander? Heres Doctor Baltars report. And the President is waiting for you up in the core.
admiral_william_adama Thank you.
admiral_william_adama Clear the deck. Madame President, we are the proud owners of the universes first bona fide Cylon detector.
president_laura_roslin Well, that is great news.
admiral_william_adama Yeah.
president_laura_roslin So, when do we begin?
admiral_william_adama Doctor Baltar would like to start widespread testing as soon as possible, but there are some serious limitations. He can only do one person at a time and verification takes hours.
president_laura_roslin So, whos going to go first?
admiral_william_adama Oh, the tests, right. Well, I think people in sensitive positions should go first.
president_laura_roslin I completely agree. How about you?
admiral_william_adama Excuse me?
president_laura_roslin If youre a Cylon, Id like to know.
admiral_william_adama If Im a Cylon, youre really screwed.
president_laura_roslin Seriously. I do think that you should go first. Show everyone in the fleet that they can trust the people at the top.
admiral_william_adama Then maybe you should go first. All right. Ill go first.
president_laura_roslin I think thats good. I do.
Pilot#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode09 Break on my mark.
billy_keikeya Whoa... do they always do that?
officer_anastasia_dualla No, theyre just showing off. They know Im in here.
billy_keikeya Oh?
officer_anastasia_dualla Well, you date a special assistant to the President word gets out.
billy_keikeya So this is officially a date?
officer_anastasia_dualla Jurys still out.
Officer#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode09 Observation deck, you have two minutes remaining.
officer_anastasia_dualla You could pull rank. You could tell them youre on special business for the President of the Colonies.
billy_keikeya Your boss pulls more weight around here than mine. You just tell them Adama wants you to—
officer_anastasia_dualla Yeah? What? Wants me to what?
billy_keikeya I lost my train of thought.
officer_anastasia_dualla Mm-hmm.
billy_keikeya How is he these days, by the way?
officer_anastasia_dualla The old man? Hes fine, I guess.
billy_keikeya You guess?
officer_anastasia_dualla Been acting kind of funny lately. Seems distracted or something. Hes been making all these weird calls from his quarters you know, super-secret.
billy_keikeya Its probably a security thing.
officer_anastasia_dualla He doesnt want me to log the calls, though. No trace file, nothing.
billy_keikeya This just started?
officer_anastasia_dualla A few days ago. Billy Keikeya... are you pumping me for information about the old man?
Officer#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode09 Times up!
billy_keikeya No... of course not.
officer_anastasia_dualla You are, you are. Youre a spy, thats what you are.
billy_keikeya Im just asking a couple of questions.
officer_anastasia_dualla Well, I hope you like the answers. Because theyre the last ones... youre gonna get for a while.
president_laura_roslin Whatd you find out?
billy_keikeya Dualla couldnt put her finger on it, but yeah. She said hes been acting differently.
president_laura_roslin I could see that myself, he was distracted and unfocused. What else?
billy_keikeya Some scrambled wireless calls he didnt want logged. She didnt know who he called or why. But none of this is damning evidence. The calls could be security related, and his odd behavior could be stress, pure and simple. Exhaustion, paranoia—
president_laura_roslin Youre right, it could be any of those things. But what if its not?
billy_keikeya Madame President, with all due respect, I cannot believe that were actually entertaining the idea that Commander Adama has been somehow... replaced by a Cylon duplicate.
president_laura_roslin Oh, my gods, Billy, I hope youre right.
dr_gaius_baltar Is suicide really a sin?
number_six A mortal one, Im afraid. But its not that bad, is it, Gaius?
dr_gaius_baltar 47,905 people in the fleet. Theres 47,905 blood samples. 11 hours to test each one for Cylon indicators. Well, thatll take a while. 21,956 days.
number_six 60.1534 years.
dr_gaius_baltar Well, now, lets figure in a few hours for sleep here and there. Well call that an even 61, shall we? Sure. Id prefer to kill myself. Commander Adama... are you a Cylon? Tune in tomorrow.
number_six Oh, its hard being a genius. Yes. There should be some perks.
dr_gaius_baltar Yes.
captain_kara_thrace Whats up, doc?
dr_gaius_baltar Lieutenant Thrace. Its good to see you, Im just... Im just keeping up with the old exercises. That should, uh, that should do me-- do me for today. Oh-- oh, I feel a lot better. Um, what brings you to the lab at this time of the night?
captain_kara_thrace Its the middle of the afternoon.
dr_gaius_baltar Yeah, of course it is, crazy workload. I totally, totally lose track of time. So, what can I do for you?
captain_kara_thrace You can zip up your fly.
dr_gaius_baltar So, uh...
captain_kara_thrace My blood test.
number_six Youre right about one thing, Gaius. There is something very intriguing about her.
dr_gaius_baltar Very. Good, very good.
lt_felix_gaeta Dradis contact! Cylon raider bearing 738 carom 005!
officer_anastasia_dualla Galactica/Apollo. Cylon raider bearing 738 carom 005.
lt_felix_gaeta Action stations. Action stations. Set condition one throughout the ship. Repeat this is not a drill!
officer_anastasia_dualla Close in and destroy, acknowledge?
cpt_lee_adama Were on it, Galactica. Jumped right in front of us... his mistake!
colonel_saul_tigh How many?
lt_felix_gaeta Single raider, looks like a recon patrol. Apollo and Beehive already has them in their sight.
colonel_saul_tigh Wheres the old man?
officer_anastasia_dualla Hes not aboard, sir.
colonel_saul_tigh Not aboard- where the hell is he?
officer_anastasia_dualla He left in a raptor about an hour ago, no flight plan.
colonel_saul_tigh No flight plan?
cpt_lee_adama Thats it, Beehive. You set them up, Ill knock them down. I winged him! Looks like I got his weapons system. He-- he jumped! Repeat, he jumped away before we could zero him out.
colonel_saul_tigh Damn it. Hes probably giving away our position to every Cylon base ship right now. Where the hell is the old man? Order the fleet to execute emergency jump procedures! Everyone rendezvous at the standby coordinates.
lt_felix_gaeta Contact! Single raider... bearing, 881 carom 247.
officer_anastasia_dualla Apollo/Galactica. Cylon raider detected at 881 carom 24—
cpt_lee_adama Wait, I see him, I see him! Its the same raider.
colonel_saul_tigh What?
cpt_lee_adama Yeah, its the same raider. I can see the damage from before. Its behaving erratically. He jumped away again!
lt_felix_gaeta Contact. Single raider same telltales. Its like hes flying around in circles.
colonel_saul_tigh Wounded bird cant fly home.
cpt_lee_adama Galactica/Apollo. Weve got him on dradis but hes pretty far out there. Itll take us about three minutes to close into weapons range.
colonel_saul_tigh No! This is our perfect chance to get some intell. Order Apollo to close with the raider, but do not engage. Put a raptor in the air. As long as that things flopping around out there, tell them I want to suck in every electronic signal it makes.
officer_anastasia_dualla Yes, sir. Colonel, Commander Adamas raptor is requesting permission to enter the landing pattern.
colonel_saul_tigh Permission granted. Stand-down to condition two. Mr. Gaeta, you have the deck.
admiral_william_adama Permission to come aboard, sir.
colonel_saul_tigh Granted. Mind telling me where the hell youve been?
admiral_william_adama Colonel Tigh, allow me to present your wife.
colonel_saul_tigh Ellen!
captain_karl_agathon Fraking noise! I dont get it. Ive blown away centurions before and theyve never sent an entire army after me.
lt_sharon_valerii Theyre after me.
captain_karl_agathon Why you?
lt_sharon_valerii While they were holding me, I overheard some things.
captain_karl_agathon What?
captain_karl_agathon Delphi? Fraking bastards!
lt_sharon_valerii Its the best place to try to grab a ship and try to get off this fraking planet.
dr_gaius_baltar Doctor Gaius Baltar, department of Cylon detection. How may I direct your call?
president_laura_roslin Youre in a good mood.
dr_gaius_baltar Madame President... Im-- Im sorry, I was expecting someone else. We havent spoken in ages.
president_laura_roslin Doctor, I would like you to call me the moment Commander Adamas test is complete, will you do that?
dr_gaius_baltar Commander Adama canceled his test a short time ago.
president_laura_roslin Why?
dr_gaius_baltar I dont know, um, he gave me another sample and said it had priority.
president_laura_roslin Whose?
dr_gaius_baltar Ill just check. Some woman called Ellen. No surname, he dropped it off and left. Is there a problem?
president_laura_roslin Doctor Baltar, I would like you to resume testing Commander Adamas blood sample immediately. Thank you.
colonel_saul_tigh I cant believe youre alive.
ellen_tigh I cant believe it myself. Saul, I dont remember the last few weeks. Its weeks, right?
colonel_saul_tigh Right. Youve been on the Rising Star all this time?
ellen_tigh I guess so. The last thing I remember is being on Picon. I was at the airport, buying a ticket home, and hearing something about the Cylons. And then, just dreams, mostly dreams. Until a couple of days ago. They told me I was-- I was knocked out when the Cylons attacked the airport and someone just picked me up, and put me on the last flight out. Some savior, I dont even know who.
colonel_saul_tigh Its okay, its all right. Its all right, youre here now.
captain_kara_thrace Looks like weve found a treasure chest. I mean, one of the major issues weve been having with the raider we captured is trying to figure out the faster light drive. This winter bird is jumping all over the place out there.
chief_galen_tyrol Yeah, and every time it jumps, it gives us more data we can use. But the question remains, whats it doing out there in the first place, and how long can they keep it up?
admiral_william_adama The moment you have your F.T.L. Data, give me an update.
chief_galen_tyrol Yes sir.
admiral_william_adama Lets not let this thing linger out there longer than we have to.
chief_galen_tyrol Yes, sir.
cpt_lee_adama You wanted to see me, sir?
admiral_william_adama Stay on it.
captain_kara_thrace Yes, sir.
admiral_william_adama Do you have dinner plans?
cpt_lee_adama What?
admiral_william_adama Come on.
ellen_tigh I never thought Id see your face again.
colonel_saul_tigh Me neither.
ellen_tigh The things I said before, the things I did—
colonel_saul_tigh Shh-- in the past, all in the past.
ellen_tigh Start over?
colonel_saul_tigh Start over. I have—
ellen_tigh Forget it.
colonel_saul_tigh I cant, I cant... I cant, Im on duty. X.O. Now? Understood. Uh, all right, tell her Im on my way.
ellen_tigh Girlfriend?
colonel_saul_tigh Official business.
ellen_tigh Feels like old times.
colonel_saul_tigh Id explain, but—
ellen_tigh Its classified.
colonel_saul_tigh Ill be back as soon as I can.
ellen_tigh Hey... Ill be here, waiting.
colonel_saul_tigh As soon as I can.
colonel_saul_tigh You wanna be very, very careful with what you just said. You are talking about a man I owe my life to many times over. I know these are uncertain times and this has been a difficult transition for you.
president_laura_roslin Excuse me, Colonel. I do appreciate how difficult this is for you to hear, believe me. But I would advise you right now not to say anything that you will regret. I need to know if you have seen anything suspicious about his recent behavior.
colonel_saul_tigh No.
president_laura_roslin What about the fact that he left the Galactica without telling anyone where he was going or when he would return and at that very moment, a Cylon raider jumped into view and started acting strangely?
colonel_saul_tigh I know exactly where he was.
president_laura_roslin You do?
colonel_saul_tigh He was picking up my wife.
president_laura_roslin Your wife?
colonel_saul_tigh It turns out shes been unconscious aboard the Rising Star ever since the attack.
president_laura_roslin Oh, my gods. Thats fantastic, its amazing.
colonel_saul_tigh Yes, it is. When Ellen stepped off that shuttle, I thought I was going to pass out.
president_laura_roslin Ellen? Your wifes name is Ellen?
colonel_saul_tigh Yes, it is... Ellen. Ellen Tigh.
president_laura_roslin Id very much like to meet your wife, colonel.
colonel_saul_tigh Ellen?
ellen_tigh Did you shut the door?
colonel_saul_tigh I already did.
ellen_tigh Surprise!
colonel_saul_tigh Ambrosia, where did you get this?
ellen_tigh I have my ways. I thought it might be just the thing for a little celebration.
colonel_saul_tigh We need to talk.
ellen_tigh First things first. There. Starting over.
colonel_saul_tigh Starting over. Im technically still on duty.
ellen_tigh Oh, I think they can do without you for a day.
colonel_saul_tigh It doesnt really work that way. To starting over. Yes, just a little more.
ellen_tigh Sure, theres a lot of whining and complaining, like you would expect. But the people I talked to are mostly hopeful and optimistic.
president_laura_roslin Thats good to hear.
ellen_tigh Mmm... well, there are a few people who still might wonder if a kindergarten teacher is really the right person to be President but its just a tiny, tiny minority.
president_laura_roslin Wonderful, wonderful.
ellen_tigh Everyone is so truly, truly grateful to all of you on Galactica. You-- you literally are our saviors.
colonel_saul_tigh Oh, were just doing our jobs, thats all.
ellen_tigh You are so modest. Hes always been that way. ooh! Lee... could I trouble you for a little bit more of this lovely ambrosia?
cpt_lee_adama Sure.
ellen_tigh Thank you, dear. Bill, you must be so proud of your sons. Lee here has grown into such a handsome man. I can only imagine what Zak must look like now. You are the spitting image of your mother, and I bet Zak takes just after his daddy.
admiral_william_adama Zak passed away a couple of years ago.
ellen_tigh Im sorry. Tragic, the death of a child. Theres been so much death, so much pain... sometimes, its completely overwhelming. But Im sure he was a beautiful boy.
admiral_william_adama The captain of the Rising Star was a little puzzled as to how you got on board his ship.
ellen_tigh Oh, I know. I know some thoughtful soul just rescued me from an almost certain death and put me on the last flight out of Picon!
president_laura_roslin How lucky for us all.
colonel_saul_tigh It is, indeed.
admiral_william_adama The strange thing is, no one can recall giving you any medical assistance until about a week ago.
ellen_tigh Oh, I know! I know. Its a miracle Im alive!
cpt_lee_adama Ahem, uh... I think Id better clear some of these, uh, dishes.
ellen_tigh You are so sweet.
colonel_saul_tigh Very good. My compliments to the chef.
ellen_tigh So, Bill, now, the question on everyones mind and I do mean everyone—
ellen_tigh Its okay. Is... wheres earth and when do we get there?
admiral_william_adama Yeah, thats classified information.
ellen_tigh Oh... that word again!
colonel_saul_tigh Ellen, leave the man alone.
ellen_tigh Well, come on, if there are no privileges of being an X.O.S wife, then whats the point? I mean, Bill, were all family here. Come on...
admiral_william_adama The need for secrecy is paramount, Ellen.
president_laura_roslin Oh, Im sorry. Perhaps you dont know that the Cylons look like us, now.
ellen_tigh Oh, that, yes... yes, I knew that.
president_laura_roslin Its recent news. Most people just found out a few days ago.
ellen_tigh A thing like that would travel fast, right?
admiral_william_adama Any one of us can be a Cylon.
ellen_tigh Boo!
ellen_tigh Did you see the looks on their faces? You are too easy.
admiral_william_adama Thank you so much for coming. Its been a wonderful evening.
colonel_saul_tigh Thought it would never end.
ellen_tigh Oh... I seem to have lost one of my shoes.
cpt_lee_adama I think its right here.
ellen_tigh Thank you.
cpt_lee_adama Here you are.
admiral_william_adama You look very, very happy.
colonel_saul_tigh Thats because I am very, very happy.
ellen_tigh Thank you... um-- oop!
cpt_lee_adama Well, it was, uh, it was nice to see you again.
cpt_lee_adama Oh, the pleasures all mine. Hope to see you soon.
cpt_lee_adama Im sure you will.
ellen_tigh Whoa...! Oh, wait, hang on, hang on, hang on... Bill, lovely evening.
colonel_saul_tigh Ive got her.
admiral_william_adama Be careful.
president_laura_roslin You actually think that woman is a Cylon?
cpt_lee_adama Well, if shes not, then were all in a lot of trouble.
admiral_william_adama The scuttlebutt was that she slept with more than half the fleet while Saul was in space.
admiral_william_adama Blindly. Ellen used to encourage the worst instincts in this guy. Bring out the self-destructive streak in him.
captain_karl_agathon Sharon... stop, I cant keep up!
lt_sharon_valerii Helo... Helo, come on! Come on, you can do it! Please, you have to get up! Right there, right there. turn your light off. Come on, we gotta find another way outta here. Were going! Why arent you running?
captain_karl_agathon You keep going and going, you never get tired.
lt_sharon_valerii Its adrenaline! Im not gonna die here, and Im not gonna let you die here, either! Okay, lets go!
colonel_saul_tigh Don’t you worry, I’ll get us home.
ellen_tigh Oh, yeah, right! Just like Bills getting us to earth.
colonel_saul_tigh Dont start on bill.
ellen_tigh Ugh... what are you-- he doesnt have the slightest idea where Earth is!
colonel_saul_tigh You dont have to yell it through the hall.
ellen_tigh Bill Adama doesnt know where earth is!
dr_gaius_baltar Colonel?
colonel_saul_tigh Doctor.
ellen_tigh Woo!
dr_gaius_baltar Actually, I-- I dont believe Ive had the pleasure. Im Doctor Gaius—
ellen_tigh Baltar. I know exactly who you are. And the pleasures all mine.
number_six Something here, isnt there?
ellen_tigh Youre still holding my hand...
dr_gaius_baltar Thats funny, I thought you were still holding onto mine.
colonel_saul_tigh Im watching you, both of you.
number_six And you should be watching her.
ellen_tigh Care to join us for a nightcap, Doctor?
dr_gaius_baltar Id love to—
Gaeta_on_intercom#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode09 Doctor Baltar, please report to the lab. The Commander is waiting for you.
dr_gaius_baltar But I cant. Another time, perhaps?
ellen_tigh Count on it. Ta-ta! Oh, Saulie, are you-- are you jealous?
colonel_saul_tigh You said we were starting over.
ellen_tigh We are, sweetheart, we are. That was just a little bit of harmless flirting.
colonel_saul_tigh No.
ellen_tigh Mmm. You should know something.
colonel_saul_tigh What?
ellen_tigh In the middle of dinner... Bill put his hand on my leg.
colonel_saul_tigh Ellen, Im not falling for this.
ellen_tigh Did you know he came to see me on the Rising Star? What? Hed come into my room, Id pretend to be asleep and hed sit by the side of my bed. And then hed touch me—
colonel_saul_tigh Why are you doing this? Youre lying.
ellen_tigh I am not! He was on that ship! And Im gonna prove it. Come on!
dr_gaius_baltar Look, its not magic, its science. If you want my result, youre gonna have to wait a while.
admiral_william_adama I gave you her sample this morning.
dr_gaius_baltar I have started and stopped the test twice already now so Im running a little behind.
admiral_william_adama Twice?
president_laura_roslin My fault... long story.
admiral_william_adama Your fault?
dr_gaius_baltar Yes, I probably shouldnt have mentioned that.
president_laura_roslin No, you probably shouldnt have.
admiral_william_adama Did you tell him to stop Ellens tests?
president_laura_roslin Yes, I did.
admiral_william_adama Why?
president_laura_roslin Well, I had some concerns.
admiral_william_adama About what?
president_laura_roslin In all honesty, I think its fair to say that your behavior recently has been odd.
admiral_william_adama My behavior? What, do you think Im a Cylon? Me?
president_laura_roslin You cant deny that youve been making these-- what are they called... off-log calls? These mysterious trips off the ship.
admiral_william_adama Where did you hear that? Have you been spying on me, on my own ship!
dr_gaius_baltar Ladies and gentlemen, please, please. Were in a laboratory. There are hazardous chemical compounds everywhere. That-- thats a thermo-nuclear bomb, for fraks sake.
cpt_lee_adama What-- what do you mean, unlogged-- mysterious trips... whats going on?
admiral_william_adama I had to go to the Rising Star and I didnt want Tigh to know about it.
president_laura_roslin Why not?
admiral_william_adama Because whether or not his wife is a Cylon, shes nothing but trouble and I wanted to keep her away from him as long as I could.
cpt_lee_adama Well, then, why did you bring her on board the ship?
admiral_william_adama Because shes his wife! I couldnt refuse her access to her own husband without causing suspicion. Besides, I wanted her close to me.
ellen_tigh I told you! I told you he wanted me.
dr_gaius_baltar Oh, lovely.
colonel_saul_tigh What the hells going on? You have been secretly visiting my wife?
admiral_william_adama No! Yes-- but its complicated.
ellen_tigh I told you. Hes been after me for years!
admiral_william_adama What?
ellen_tigh Now, boys, boys, dont fight over little ol me.
president_laura_roslin Ellen, be quiet!
ellen_tigh No, you dont tell me—
cpt_lee_adama I think we should all just take a deep, deep breath.
admiral_william_adama I was afraid that she might be a Cylon. So I brought her blood over here and had it tested.
president_laura_roslin Thats why you cancelled your test?
admiral_william_adama Howd you know about that?
president_laura_roslin You didnt tell me he was testing my wife.
admiral_william_adama You met with the President?
president_laura_roslin Yes. She thought you might be a Cylon.
admiral_william_adama I know.
Gaeta_on_intercom#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode09 Attention, pass the word to the Commander the X.O. And the C.A.G. Commander Adama, Colonel Tigh, Captain Adama please report to C.I.C.
admiral_william_adama Mr. Gaeta.
lt_felix_gaeta The raider smoothed out its flight plan about two minutes ago.
cpt_lee_adama It seems to be under control.
admiral_william_adama Yeah, but hes not jumping for home.
lt_felix_gaeta No, sir, he isnt.
colonel_saul_tigh Has our reconnaissance detected any outgoing communications since it straightened out its flight pattern?
lt_felix_gaeta Yes, sir, but its likely its just another distress signal.
colonel_saul_tigh Launch the alert fighters.
cpt_lee_adama This is the C.A.G., Launch alert fighters.
captain_kara_thrace Sir, I hate to tell you this but, I think its been playing with us the entire time just waiting to see how wed react.
admiral_william_adama Playing with us?
captain_kara_thrace Yeah.
admiral_william_adama Order the flight leader to destroy the target.
lt_felix_gaeta Yes, sir.
Hotdog#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode09 Whoa... Galactica/Hotdog, the raider just took off! He doesnt look injured to me.
Beehive#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode09 Hes heading back towards the fleet.
captain_kara_thrace Theyre not gonna catch him.
lt_felix_gaeta Action stations, action stations. Set condition one throughout the ship. This is not a drill.
cpt_lee_adama He doesnt have any weapons.
captain_kara_thrace Hes on a suicide run.
admiral_william_adama Did you launch the alert fighters?
cpt_lee_adama It was the X.O.S call.
colonel_saul_tigh I had a hunch.
admiral_william_adama Good call.
colonel_saul_tigh one question—
admiral_william_adama Because I was worried.
colonel_saul_tigh That she might be a Cylon.
admiral_william_adama And if she wasnt. I know how you feel about her, Saul. Shes been a negative force in your life and Im sorry about that but its the truth.
colonel_saul_tigh Maybe she was, everything was different then. She was different, I was different.
admiral_william_adama Ive just grown accustomed to seeing you without the cup in your hand.
colonel_saul_tigh So I had a couple of drinks tonight, I was celebrating, I think I deserved—
admiral_william_adama Yes, you did. Launching those fighters on a hunch... saved our ship.
colonel_saul_tigh Just doing my job.
admiral_william_adama You do your job good. Thats why I need you, Saul. That, and that were friends. And I dont want anything to come between that, not even Ellen.
colonel_saul_tigh It wont.
aaron_doral Theyve searched every street, every building... they slipped through, how is that possible?
number_six She thinks she loves him now, that she cant live without him. Her passion is making her more resourceful.
aaron_doral It bothers you, doesnt it?
number_six Well get them in the end.
aaron_doral No, it bothers you that youve never experienced it.
number_six You saw the way Helo was when we took her away? He was pathetic.
aaron_doral I cant help wondering what it would be like to feel that intensely. Even in his anguish, he seemed... so alive.
dr_gaius_baltar Green. Green, everyone. Mrs. Tigh is definitely human.
admiral_william_adama No hard feelings I hope, Ellen.
ellen_tigh I completely understand. But lets be sure and test you next.
dr_gaius_baltar Doctor? My pleasure. My job.
ellen_tigh You dont wanna frak with me, Bill. Try to remember that.
admiral_william_adama Dont frak with me either, Ellen.
number_six If only they knew that everyone passes these days.
dr_gaius_baltar Well, its so much simpler that way. No muss, no fuss.
number_six So... what did her test really say?
dr_gaius_baltar Ill never tell.
