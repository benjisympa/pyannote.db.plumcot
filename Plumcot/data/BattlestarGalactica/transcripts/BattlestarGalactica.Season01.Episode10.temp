Roslin I can assure you, the fuel shortage is our number one priority. Galactica has ships scouring the nearby star systems and we can anticipate they will soon find tylium. Hamilton.
Hamilton Madam President, tylium ore is extremely rare. If we dont find any, how long before the fleet runs out of fuel?
Roslin That all depends on how well we conserve.
Playa Isnt it a fact, Madam President that we only have enough for two more jumps?
Roslin Yes, that is correct.
Playa Do we have a contingency plan if we run out of tylium?
Roslin If-- if that were to happen, we would use our last fuel to jump to the nearest planetary system.
Playa And pray were lucky enough to find a habitable planet. snakes- hissing
Playa Madam President, without fuel to take even the most basic evasive maneuver--
Roslin No-- uh..
Playa Wouldnt we be like ducks in a Cylon shooting gallery?
Roslin Yes, we would.
Roslin Im-- Im sorry. Uh, that is all for now.
Crashdown Commencing sweep 87 of asteroid field.
Boomer Any luck?
Crashdown How many times you gonna ask me that, Boomer?
Boomer Well, until you find some tylium ore. Or dont you want to be a hero to Ensign Davis, hmm?
Boomer Oh, you havent noticed how she always sits next to you in the mess? Hows it going, Crash? Giggling Oh, youre so cute.
Crashdown Damn it, theres so much debris in this system, the dradis is useless, this is gonna take 100 years.
Boomer Yeah, I heard about how you found water, how you saved the whole fleet...
Crashdown Come on! Jackpot, Boomer! That asteroid dead ahead is a mountain of tylium!
Boomer Holy!
Crashdown Check it!
Boomer Ahh, thank the gods! Were heroes! Yea!
Crashdown Were heroes? Never fails-- great, Boomer the second that I score, the bus driver jumps in and takes the credit.
Boomer Okay, so, whos the one that we suggested--
Crashdown What, what?
Boomer The Cylons. The rocks crawling with them.
Crashdown We are well and truly fraked. The only tylium within 12 light-years and we gotta kiss it goodbye.
Boomer Yeah, along with our asses if we dont get out of here, fast.
Tigh It figures the Cylons would be sitting on the only source of fuel within our reach.
Gaeta Yeah, still staking out every water hole in the desert.
Tigh Only this time its a lake with enough tylium to last us a couple years.
Apollo This must be some kind of conveyor belt, to get the ore from the mine, here into this cracking plant here.
Gaeta A refinery, this far from their homeworld?
Apollo Why not? They need fuel as much as we do.
Gaeta Now theyve got it.
Tigh And enough firepower to keep it.
Apollo All right, so we forget this asteroid, find another source.
Tigh You can bet your ass the Cylons will be guarding that one too. Apollo: So we send the raptors out farther, 10, 15 jumps. Find a source they havent reached yet.
Tigh And use up all our fuel doing it. How are we gonna get our refinery ship--
Adama We take the tylium from the Cylons.
Tigh With all respect, this is hardly the time to attack a superior force.
Adama This is exactly the time. We know where they are, they dont know where we are. Catch them with their pants down.
Apollo If we fail?
Tigh End of game.
Adama So we dont fail.
Starbuck When the missile gets close enough, youll be pulling maybe seven gs but to catch you, the bastards gonna have to pile on 40 to 60. Its guidance system cant hack it, and itll miss... most of the time.
Chuckles Exactly how often is most of the time.
Starbuck It depends on your judgment and how well you pray. Attention on deck!
Adama As you were. Lt. Thrace, can I have a word?
Starbuck Of course. Take five, guys. Whats up?
Adama How they doing?
Starbuck Wobbly as newborn colts but, uh, theyre getting stronger.
Adama Thats good.
Starbuck Mm.
Adama Got a job for you.
Starbuck Rumor mill has it that youre planning an op.
Adama Rumor mills right, for a change. Captain Adama and Col. Tigh are working up a plan now and I need some serious out-of-the-box thinking.
Starbuck Out of the box is where I live.
Roslin Ive been taking chamalla for a medical condition.
Elosha So what have you seen?
Roslin It started out as dreams of the Cylon that we had executed but I had the dreams before we captured him. The images were...
Elosha Prescient?
Roslin Uncanny. And now Im seeing things while Im awake.
Elosha What kind of things?
Roslin Snakes, there were snakes crawling all over my podium during the press conference.
Elosha How many?
Roslin About a dozen.
Elosha Youre kidding me, right? You read Pythia and now youre having me on.
Roslin No. Who is Pythia?
Elosha One of the oracles, in the sacred scrolls. 3,600 years ago, Pythia wrote about the exile and the rebirth of a human race. And the lords anointed a leader to guide the caravan of the heavens to their new homeland and unto the leader they gave a vision of serpents, numbering two and ten, as a sign of things to come.
Roslin Pythia wrote that?
Elosha She also wrote that the leader suffered a wasting disease and would not live to enter the new land. But youre not dying... are you?
Apollo And that will allow the attack force to wipe out these installations here. Now, if we do it right, there will not be any Cylon survivors. And the asteroid will be ours.
Adama What do you think, Starbuck?
Starbuck Its a textbook-perfect plan. Which is why it wont work.
Tigh Of course, we bow to your vast experience in strategic planning. Refresh my memory, what year was it that you graduated from war college?
Starbuck Whats the matter, Colonel, married life not all you expected?
Adama Thats enough, both of you. Were not gonna win this one by the book. I let Starbuck in here because shes not weighed down by conventional thinking. All due respect, gentlemen, were not as crazy as she is. Okay, so what would you do differently?
Starbuck To start, jumping Galactica in behind the planetoid to hide it from the Cylon base is an obvious move.
Apollo You think theyll be covering their blind spot with recon patrols.
Starbuck I would, if I were them. What we need to do is make their patrols part of our plan. You know, make their tactics work for us. Heres what I would do...
Starbuck At position code deacon, well need three civilian freighter ships to use as decoys.
Roslin Which means those passengers will have to relocated, to other ships that are already overcrowded.
Adama Yes, if you approve.
Starbuck The decoy ships will jump into the enemy star system at extreme radar range from the Cylon asteroid. Galactica will jump here, close enough to launch its vipers at the base.
Apollo As soon as the decoy freighters arrive in the system, theyll break wireless silence. Theyll be posing as a mine fleet coming after the tylium and pretend to be unaware of the Cylon presence.
Starbuck The Cylons will hear the messages and send a force of raiders after them. This will leave the base relatively undefended. Well have raptors prepositioned to keep an eye on the Cylons. When the Cylons move towards the decoys, Galacticas vipers will come in from behind and obliterate the base.
Apollo Without the base theyll be unable to rearm, refuel...
Starbuck Well mop them up and then well take the tylium.
Roslin What happens to the crews on the civilian decoy ships?
Apollo Theyll keep their F.T.L. Drives spooled up and just jump clear, first sign of trouble.
Roslin How many casualties do we anticipate?
Tigh Itll cost us.
Roslin If you succeed, whats to prevent the Cylons from coming back with reinforcements?
Adama Nothing. But if we get a chance to knock out that base, itll buy us some time.
Roslin Why?
Adama If you keep running from a schoolyard bully, he keeps on chasing you but the moment you turn around and stop and you punch him really hard in a sensitive spot, hell think twice about coming back again.
Roslin So its either this or run out of fuel and be annihilated.
Adama Sometimes you have to roll the hard six.
Roslin Well, the freighters are yours. Good hunting, everyone.
Adama Operation starts in 48 hours.
Tigh This is our target.
Baltar Cylon base.
Tigh Youre the Cylon expert. We need to destroy their military facilities.
Baltar Without harming the tylium ore under the surface.
Tigh Exactly.
Starbuck A nuke would destroy the Cylons.
Baltar But the radiation would render the ore inert. Unusable. I see your dilemma. Well, youre in luck, you know. Refined tylium contains tremendous enthalpy to the order of half a billion megajoules per kilo. If subjected to the right heat and compression, say, from a conventional warhead, you should get a suitably devastating explosion without the radioactive fallout. All we have to do is hit the right spot. Specifically, you need to hit the staging tanks for the refined tylium precursor. Its a lot more unstable than the fuel itself.
Starbuck And where would they be?
Baltar I need your advice on this one.
#6 Im flattered, Gaius, but I dont know the first thing about tylium refineries.
Baltar Neither do I. Oh, come on, you must have an inkling where I should tell them to bomb.
#6 No, but god does.
Baltar Oh, good. I suppose god doesnt want me to destroy the base, because... hes the Cylon god, right?
#6 God doesnt take sides. He only wants your love. Open your heart to him and hell show you the way.
Baltar Be a lot simpler if you came out and told me.
#6 You must remember to surrender your ego. Remain humble.
Baltar If you ask me, god could do with cleaning his ears out. Then he might hear what I have to say.
#6 Relax your neck.
Baltar Why, what are you gonna do?
#6 I said relax.
Baltar All right, but please dont--
Starbuck Where would the staging tanks be, doctor?
Baltar Uh... uh... there, right there. Hit any one of them and the place will go up like a three-kiloton bomb.
#6 Well done. So forceful, so decisive... delivered with such elan.
Baltar He didnt speak to me. God didnt speak to me. So I was totally lying. I just picked that spot at random.
#6 He doesnt always speak in words, Gaius.
Baltar So the fate of the entire human race depends upon my wild guess.
Officer Attention on deck!
Adama As you were. Hows the knee, Starbuck?
Starbuck Itll be ready. Im not missing this party.
Adama Apollos leading the strike force, youre gonna have to sit this one out.
Starbuck Im the best pilot that you have.
Adama Not right now. Combat, you gotta pull six, seven gS. Doc says your knee wont take it.
Starbuck Well, then hes wrong.
Adama Is he? A viper thruster pedal... requires this much force... to activate.
Adama Now youre on your attack run. You launch your missiles. So you gotta jam that pedal... into the firewall and hold a six g turn... for ten seconds or you die. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six five, four-- This was only three gs, Starbuck, not six. Im sorry, its a tough one but youre staying home.
Starbuck Keep your ingress low and fast. Use the terrain to stay hidden til the last second. Make sure you give the flak suppression unit enough time so that they can weaken defenses.
Apollo You dont think Im up to this.
Starbuck Of course I do, youll be fine.
Apollo Look, youre worried that Im not gonna pull it out of the fire with some high-risk retina-detaching move, the way Starbuck would. Well, Kara, Im sorry youre not suiting up. Because, believe me, everyone will feel so much better, me included, if you were riding along with us. But this isnt an ego trip, this is my job. And dont think for one moment that I will not get it done.
Starbuck I hope so, cause weve got one shot. Dont frak it up by overthinking.
Helo Nice thing about being on the run after a nuclear war, nobody left to complain if we hide out in their barn or raid their pantry while youre on your way to steal a ship and get off the planet. Its odd, isnt it?
Caprica_Boomer What?
Helo That we havent seen a single living human being since the one you shot, when you rescued me. I mean, were still alive, why nobody else?
Caprica_Boomer Probably holed up in their fallout shelters or something.
Helo Two ways out, and a lovely view. What could be better?
Caprica_Boomer A feather bed and a silk comforter?
Helo You hungry? I dont know, what do we got? Peanut butter... baked beans, corn. How about some chili?
Helo A simple no would do. Sharon, have you been taking your anti-radiation meds?
Caprica_Boomer Think it was those cold beans we had this afternoon.
Helo You okay now?
Caprica_Boomer Yeah.
Helo How far you figure to Delphi?
Caprica_Boomer Eight, maybe ten days if we move fast. If we start early, we can be there in no time.
Adama Cant sleep? I couldnt either before a big op. Mark two... good ship. Got me out of a lot of tough scrapes. Got something for you. Belonged to your grandfather. My mom bought it for him when he was in law school. See the engraving on it?
Apollo Yeah, I can barely make it out, but...
Adama He was a better father than I was. Dad used to carry that into court cases, claimed he never lost, unless he left it behind.
Apollo So youre worried too.
Adama About what?
Apollo You know, sometimes it feels like the whole ship thinks, uh, Starbuck would do better.
Adama I dont.
Apollo How can you be so sure?
Adama Cause youre my son. Get some rest, youre gonna need it.
Apollo Dad... Ill bring it back.
Adama You better, or Ill kick your ass. Its a good lighter.
Helo Sharon-- Sharon, wake up. What the frak? You killed her!
Caprica_Boomer Let me see. We gotta go, right now.
Helo Wait a minute, I saw her on my lap, I saw her blood spill on my lap.
Caprica_Boomer Lets move, mister.
Helo What the hell is going on?
Caprica_Boomer I dont know, well figure it out later.
Gaeta Jump complete, sir. Dradis reports nothing but hash, just as we expected. Cant see a thing. We are now within launch range of the Cylon base.
Freighter_Pilot_#1 Carrier constellation, jump complete on station, point deacon. Initiate search pattern delta.
Freighter_Pilot_#2 Ore flight bravo, delta, wilco.
Freighter_Pilot_#3 Ore flight nebula, delta initiated.
Adama Balls in play. You can bet they heard that. Now theyll try to locate the decoys.
Roslin And when they do?
Adama If they take the bait, all hell breaks loose.
Roslin Until then?
Adama We wait.
Boomer Galactica, Boomer. Tally, 90+ headed deacon, speed: 250. Crashdown: The Cylons have seen the freighter. Theyre en route to intercept.
Adama They took the bait. Mr. Gaeta, launch strike force one. Gaeta: Aye, sir. D, launch strike force one.
Dualla Attention: Pilots, man your planes. Pilots, man your planes.
Starbuck How hard did they bite?
Adama Boomers report said 90+. Theyve launched most of their fighter force.
Launch_Officer Give them hell, sir. Firing...
Gaeta Our attack force is away.
Starbuck I just hope that Lee can...
Adama Lee isnt the problem. You should take a good look at yourself. I had to go through the same transition. When youre in the cockpit, youre in control. Its hard to give it up.
Starbuck It would just be a lot easier if I was flying with them.
Adama All you can do now is wait and hope you didnt make any mistakes.
Starbuck I never wanted this kind of responsibility.
Adama The Cylons never asked us what we wanted. Welcome to the big leagues.
Crashdown Galactica, Crashdown, tally 50+ on an intercept course. Repeat, 50+ inbound.
Baltar Whats that mean?
Starbuck It means that a Cylon patrol spotted our attack force. The base sent out 50 more raiders, to intercept.
Baltar 50 raiders? That means were outnumbered now, 5:1?
Roslin Werent the decoys supposed to take care of that?
Adama Cylons are too smart for that.
Starbuck Frak.
Dualla Estimated time to strike intercept, two minutes.
Fireball Fireball, multiple bandits, left, ten high. Range 40, weapons free, committing.
Hotdog Hotdog, visual tally, press.
Fireball Hotdog, break right!
Hotdog Fireball, your six!
Fireball Im hit, Im hit! Cant eject!
Deadbolt Deadbolt, Spinner, two bandits closing in, right five.
Fireball No joy, no joy. Aaahh!
Hotdog Galactica, Hotdog. Heavily engaged, mission outcome doubtful.
Baltar This sounds fraking awful.
Starbuck Theyre getting cut to pieces out there.
Spinner Deadbolt, break vertical, now, now, now!
Deadbolt Damn it, take the shot, get him off me...!
Adama Mr. Gaeta, abort strike one.
Dualla Strike one, Galactica, return to base. Repeat, abort your mission and return to base.
Stubbs Galactica, Stubbs. Cylon strike force is turning away from beacon and inbound to Galactica.
Roslin Cylons heard our transmission recall, didnt they?
Baltar Does that mean the first wave of raiders is ignoring the decoys and is... is coming after us?
Adama Thats exactly what it means.
Baltar So when are we going to launch the reserve vipers to defend Galactica?
Adama There are no reserve vipers. Everything is on the board already. Now we play for all the marbles. Starbuck, its your plan.
Starbuck Mr. Gaeta, will you please tell D to get on the scrambler and inform Apollo the back door is open?
Gaeta Aye, lieutenant. D, please send a scrambler to Captain Apollo. Message reads, the back door is open.
Dualla Apollo, Galactica, back door is open. Back door is open. Godspeed, Apollo.
Rolsin Lt. Thrace, why didnt you tell me we had another attack force hidden in the freighters?
Starbuck We, uh--
Adama It was my decision. I routinely restrict tactical details to those who need to know. Old habits die hard.
Roslin So you still might pull this off.
Adama If Dr. Baltars target information is correct.
Starbuck And whether we get blown to pieces by those Cylon raiders heading toward us right now.
Adama Speaking of which, Im needed in C-I-C.
Apollo Initial point in five seconds. Flak suppression unit cleared hot. Okay, lets do this.
Starbuck Come on, Lee, its all on you.
Apollo Incoming, incoming! Weapons free, by the numbers, people.
Racetrack Target acquired, tone and lock, firing....
Kat Tone and lock, firing....
Kat Whats got into these fraking missiles?
Starbuck Come on!
Racetrack Theyre jamming the guidance systems.
Apollo Strike-two, Apollo, then we get close enough that we dont need the guidance systems. We have to blow this thing manually.
Chuckles Wilco, Apollo, rolling in.
Racetrack Chuckles... chuckles!
Chuckles Oh, frak...
Racetrack chuckles bought it, hes going down--
Kat Now theyve got our attack axis zeroed in. Theres no way to fraking get close.
Starbuck Frak... theres gotta be.
Apollo Weve gotta get out of this flak. Lets get down below the deck, down where the target is. Ive got an idea. Im gonna take a closer look.
Dualla Commander on deck!
Adama As you were.
Tigh First wave of Cylons will be on us in three minutes.
Adama Notify the strike-one vipers that they can stop running and blast those bastards to hell.
Dualla Yes, sir.
Deadbolt Engaging Cylon fighters.
Hotdog Target acquired, tone and lock.
Apollo Oh, no, dont do this, Lee... the conveyor tunnels clear, Im going through it.
Kat Youre out of your fraking mind, apollo.
Starbuck Whats going on?
Gaeta Captain Apollos flying into the conveyor tunnel, hoping itll lead him to the refinery.
Baltar Has he goneraving mad? Theres no way to ensure it does anything of the kind.
Apollo Come on, keep it together, Lee, keep it together, keep it-- oh, lords. Okay, Im through the tunnel. They cant get firing solution on me. There you are. Okay... Ive got you, Ive got you, Ive got you, Ive got you... Ahh, Galactica, Apollo. Mission... accomplished.
Apollo You can tell Dr. Baltar he was right on the money. Its one hell of a fireworks show. And theres plenty of ore for us back in the canyon, once this place is history.
Gaeta Congratulations, Doctor, it worked!
Baltar It did. It worked.
Roslin Oh...!
Starbuck Sorry, Madam President, Im sorry.
Roslin No need to apologize, Lieutenant. Thanks to you, we have enough fuel to last us a few years.
Dualla Commander, strike one reports inbound Cylons are bugging out request permission to go after them, sir.
Adama Tell our people to pursue and destroy.
Dualla Affirmative. Strike one... tear em up.
Starbuck Apollo, you magnificent bastard, that was one hell of a piece of flying and I couldnt have done it better myself.
Apollo Im sorry, I didnt hear you.
Starbuck I said that I couldnt have done it better myself.
Apollo Well, thank you.
Starbuck Hmm. I had my doubts.
Apollo So did I.
Starbuck Mmm.
Apollo I wasnt sure that crazy-ass plan of yours could even possibly work.
Starbuck Mmm. You deserve this.
Ensign_Davis Crash!
#6 Have you read the Pythian prophecy, Gaius?
Baltar Not since the sixth grade. I cant say ancient history is my favorite subject.
#6 You should have paid closer attention, hmm?
Baltar To what?
#6 All of this has happened before. All of this will happen again.
Baltar Everyone knows that verse. What are you getting at?
#6 Remember this one? Led by serpents numbering two and ten.
Baltar The vipers... theyre the serpents.
#6 Theres a later verse, Gaius, you should read it. Though the outcome favored the few, it led to a confrontation at the home of the gods.
Baltar Are you telling me that god guided my finger to that target for some... arcane scriptural purpose?
#6 You are part of gods plan, gaius.
Baltar So god wanted me to destroy the Cylon base.
#6 You did well. You gave yourself over to him.
Baltar Yes, suppose I did. Yes, theres-- theres really no other logical explanation for it. I was--
#6 Am...
Baltar I am an instrument of god.
