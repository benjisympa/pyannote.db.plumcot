president_laura_roslin I can assure you, the fuel shortage is our number one priority. Galactica has ships scouring the nearby star systems and we can anticipate they will soon find tylium. Hamilton.
Hamilton#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode10 Madam President, tylium ore is extremely rare. If we dont find any, how long before the fleet runs out of fuel?
president_laura_roslin That all depends on how well we conserve.
playa_palacios Isnt it a fact, Madam President that we only have enough for two more jumps?
president_laura_roslin Yes, that is correct.
playa_palacios Do we have a contingency plan if we run out of tylium?
president_laura_roslin If-- if that were to happen, we would use our last fuel to jump to the nearest planetary system.
playa_palacios And pray were lucky enough to find a habitable planet. snakes- hissing
playa_palacios Madam President, without fuel to take even the most basic evasive maneuver--
president_laura_roslin No-- uh..
playa_palacios Wouldnt we be like ducks in a Cylon shooting gallery?
president_laura_roslin Yes, we would.
president_laura_roslin Im-- Im sorry. Uh, that is all for now.
crashdown Commencing sweep 87 of asteroid field.
lt_sharon_valerii Any luck?
crashdown How many times you gonna ask me that, Boomer?
lt_sharon_valerii Well, until you find some tylium ore. Or dont you want to be a hero to Ensign Davis, hmm?
lt_sharon_valerii Oh, you havent noticed how she always sits next to you in the mess? Hows it going, Crash? Giggling Oh, youre so cute.
crashdown Damn it, theres so much debris in this system, the dradis is useless, this is gonna take 100 years.
lt_sharon_valerii Yeah, I heard about how you found water, how you saved the whole fleet...
crashdown Come on! Jackpot, Boomer! That asteroid dead ahead is a mountain of tylium!
lt_sharon_valerii Holy!
crashdown Check it!
lt_sharon_valerii Ahh, thank the gods! Were heroes! Yea!
crashdown Were heroes? Never fails-- great, Boomer the second that I score, the bus driver jumps in and takes the credit.
lt_sharon_valerii Okay, so, whos the one that we suggested--
crashdown What, what?
lt_sharon_valerii The Cylons. The rocks crawling with them.
crashdown We are well and truly fraked. The only tylium within 12 light-years and we gotta kiss it goodbye.
lt_sharon_valerii Yeah, along with our asses if we dont get out of here, fast.
colonel_saul_tigh It figures the Cylons would be sitting on the only source of fuel within our reach.
lt_felix_gaeta Yeah, still staking out every water hole in the desert.
colonel_saul_tigh Only this time its a lake with enough tylium to last us a couple years.
cpt_lee_adama This must be some kind of conveyor belt, to get the ore from the mine, here into this cracking plant here.
lt_felix_gaeta A refinery, this far from their homeworld?
cpt_lee_adama Why not? They need fuel as much as we do.
lt_felix_gaeta Now theyve got it.
colonel_saul_tigh And enough firepower to keep it.
cpt_lee_adama All right, so we forget this asteroid, find another source.
colonel_saul_tigh You can bet your ass the Cylons will be guarding that one too. Apollo: So we send the raptors out farther, 10, 15 jumps. Find a source they havent reached yet.
colonel_saul_tigh And use up all our fuel doing it. How are we gonna get our refinery ship--
admiral_william_adama We take the tylium from the Cylons.
colonel_saul_tigh With all respect, this is hardly the time to attack a superior force.
admiral_william_adama This is exactly the time. We know where they are, they dont know where we are. Catch them with their pants down.
cpt_lee_adama If we fail?
colonel_saul_tigh End of game.
admiral_william_adama So we dont fail.
captain_kara_thrace When the missile gets close enough, youll be pulling maybe seven gs but to catch you, the bastards gonna have to pile on 40 to 60. Its guidance system cant hack it, and itll miss... most of the time.
chuckles Exactly how often is most of the time.
captain_kara_thrace It depends on your judgment and how well you pray. Attention on deck!
admiral_william_adama As you were. Lt. Thrace, can I have a word?
captain_kara_thrace Of course. Take five, guys. Whats up?
admiral_william_adama How they doing?
captain_kara_thrace Wobbly as newborn colts but, uh, theyre getting stronger.
admiral_william_adama Thats good.
captain_kara_thrace Mm.
admiral_william_adama Got a job for you.
captain_kara_thrace Rumor mill has it that youre planning an op.
admiral_william_adama Rumor mills right, for a change. Captain Adama and Col. Tigh are working up a plan now and I need some serious out-of-the-box thinking.
captain_kara_thrace Out of the box is where I live.
president_laura_roslin Ive been taking chamalla for a medical condition.
elosha So what have you seen?
president_laura_roslin It started out as dreams of the Cylon that we had executed but I had the dreams before we captured him. The images were...
elosha Prescient?
president_laura_roslin Uncanny. And now Im seeing things while Im awake.
elosha What kind of things?
president_laura_roslin Snakes, there were snakes crawling all over my podium during the press conference.
elosha How many?
president_laura_roslin About a dozen.
elosha Youre kidding me, right? You read Pythia and now youre having me on.
president_laura_roslin No. Who is Pythia?
elosha One of the oracles, in the sacred scrolls. 3,600 years ago, Pythia wrote about the exile and the rebirth of a human race. And the lords anointed a leader to guide the caravan of the heavens to their new homeland and unto the leader they gave a vision of serpents, numbering two and ten, as a sign of things to come.
president_laura_roslin Pythia wrote that?
elosha She also wrote that the leader suffered a wasting disease and would not live to enter the new land. But youre not dying... are you?
cpt_lee_adama And that will allow the attack force to wipe out these installations here. Now, if we do it right, there will not be any Cylon survivors. And the asteroid will be ours.
admiral_william_adama What do you think, Starbuck?
captain_kara_thrace Its a textbook-perfect plan. Which is why it wont work.
colonel_saul_tigh Of course, we bow to your vast experience in strategic planning. Refresh my memory, what year was it that you graduated from war college?
captain_kara_thrace Whats the matter, Colonel, married life not all you expected?
admiral_william_adama Thats enough, both of you. Were not gonna win this one by the book. I let Starbuck in here because shes not weighed down by conventional thinking. All due respect, gentlemen, were not as crazy as she is. Okay, so what would you do differently?
captain_kara_thrace To start, jumping Galactica in behind the planetoid to hide it from the Cylon base is an obvious move.
cpt_lee_adama You think theyll be covering their blind spot with recon patrols.
captain_kara_thrace I would, if I were them. What we need to do is make their patrols part of our plan. You know, make their tactics work for us. Heres what I would do...
captain_kara_thrace At position code deacon, well need three civilian freighter ships to use as decoys.
president_laura_roslin Which means those passengers will have to relocated, to other ships that are already overcrowded.
admiral_william_adama Yes, if you approve.
captain_kara_thrace The decoy ships will jump into the enemy star system at extreme radar range from the Cylon asteroid. Galactica will jump here, close enough to launch its vipers at the base.
cpt_lee_adama As soon as the decoy freighters arrive in the system, theyll break wireless silence. Theyll be posing as a mine fleet coming after the tylium and pretend to be unaware of the Cylon presence.
captain_kara_thrace The Cylons will hear the messages and send a force of raiders after them. This will leave the base relatively undefended. Well have raptors prepositioned to keep an eye on the Cylons. When the Cylons move towards the decoys, Galacticas vipers will come in from behind and obliterate the base.
cpt_lee_adama Without the base theyll be unable to rearm, refuel...
captain_kara_thrace Well mop them up and then well take the tylium.
president_laura_roslin What happens to the crews on the civilian decoy ships?
cpt_lee_adama Theyll keep their F.T.L. Drives spooled up and just jump clear, first sign of trouble.
president_laura_roslin How many casualties do we anticipate?
colonel_saul_tigh Itll cost us.
president_laura_roslin If you succeed, whats to prevent the Cylons from coming back with reinforcements?
admiral_william_adama Nothing. But if we get a chance to knock out that base, itll buy us some time.
president_laura_roslin Why?
admiral_william_adama If you keep running from a schoolyard bully, he keeps on chasing you but the moment you turn around and stop and you punch him really hard in a sensitive spot, hell think twice about coming back again.
president_laura_roslin So its either this or run out of fuel and be annihilated.
admiral_william_adama Sometimes you have to roll the hard six.
president_laura_roslin Well, the freighters are yours. Good hunting, everyone.
admiral_william_adama Operation starts in 48 hours.
colonel_saul_tigh This is our target.
dr_gaius_baltar Cylon base.
colonel_saul_tigh Youre the Cylon expert. We need to destroy their military facilities.
dr_gaius_baltar Without harming the tylium ore under the surface.
colonel_saul_tigh Exactly.
captain_kara_thrace A nuke would destroy the Cylons.
dr_gaius_baltar But the radiation would render the ore inert. Unusable. I see your dilemma. Well, youre in luck, you know. Refined tylium contains tremendous enthalpy to the order of half a billion megajoules per kilo. If subjected to the right heat and compression, say, from a conventional warhead, you should get a suitably devastating explosion without the radioactive fallout. All we have to do is hit the right spot. Specifically, you need to hit the staging tanks for the refined tylium precursor. Its a lot more unstable than the fuel itself.
captain_kara_thrace And where would they be?
dr_gaius_baltar I need your advice on this one.
number_six Im flattered, Gaius, but I dont know the first thing about tylium refineries.
dr_gaius_baltar Neither do I. Oh, come on, you must have an inkling where I should tell them to bomb.
number_six No, but god does.
dr_gaius_baltar Oh, good. I suppose god doesnt want me to destroy the base, because... hes the Cylon god, right?
number_six God doesnt take sides. He only wants your love. Open your heart to him and hell show you the way.
dr_gaius_baltar Be a lot simpler if you came out and told me.
number_six You must remember to surrender your ego. Remain humble.
dr_gaius_baltar If you ask me, god could do with cleaning his ears out. Then he might hear what I have to say.
number_six Relax your neck.
dr_gaius_baltar Why, what are you gonna do?
number_six I said relax.
dr_gaius_baltar All right, but please dont--
captain_kara_thrace Where would the staging tanks be, doctor?
dr_gaius_baltar Uh... uh... there, right there. Hit any one of them and the place will go up like a three-kiloton bomb.
number_six Well done. So forceful, so decisive... delivered with such elan.
dr_gaius_baltar He didnt speak to me. God didnt speak to me. So I was totally lying. I just picked that spot at random.
number_six He doesnt always speak in words, Gaius.
dr_gaius_baltar So the fate of the entire human race depends upon my wild guess.
Officer#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode10 Attention on deck!
admiral_william_adama As you were. Hows the knee, Starbuck?
captain_kara_thrace Itll be ready. Im not missing this party.
admiral_william_adama Apollos leading the strike force, youre gonna have to sit this one out.
captain_kara_thrace Im the best pilot that you have.
admiral_william_adama Not right now. Combat, you gotta pull six, seven gS. Doc says your knee wont take it.
captain_kara_thrace Well, then hes wrong.
admiral_william_adama Is he? A viper thruster pedal... requires this much force... to activate.
admiral_william_adama Now youre on your attack run. You launch your missiles. So you gotta jam that pedal... into the firewall and hold a six g turn... for ten seconds or you die. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six five, four-- This was only three gs, Starbuck, not six. Im sorry, its a tough one but youre staying home.
captain_kara_thrace Keep your ingress low and fast. Use the terrain to stay hidden til the last second. Make sure you give the flak suppression unit enough time so that they can weaken defenses.
cpt_lee_adama You dont think Im up to this.
captain_kara_thrace Of course I do, youll be fine.
cpt_lee_adama Look, youre worried that Im not gonna pull it out of the fire with some high-risk retina-detaching move, the way Starbuck would. Well, Kara, Im sorry youre not suiting up. Because, believe me, everyone will feel so much better, me included, if you were riding along with us. But this isnt an ego trip, this is my job. And dont think for one moment that I will not get it done.
captain_kara_thrace I hope so, cause weve got one shot. Dont frak it up by overthinking.
captain_karl_agathon Nice thing about being on the run after a nuclear war, nobody left to complain if we hide out in their barn or raid their pantry while youre on your way to steal a ship and get off the planet. Its odd, isnt it?
lt_sharon_valerii What?
captain_karl_agathon That we havent seen a single living human being since the one you shot, when you rescued me. I mean, were still alive, why nobody else?
lt_sharon_valerii Probably holed up in their fallout shelters or something.
captain_karl_agathon Two ways out, and a lovely view. What could be better?
lt_sharon_valerii A feather bed and a silk comforter?
captain_karl_agathon You hungry? I dont know, what do we got? Peanut butter... baked beans, corn. How about some chili?
captain_karl_agathon A simple no would do. Sharon, have you been taking your anti-radiation meds?
lt_sharon_valerii Think it was those cold beans we had this afternoon.
captain_karl_agathon You okay now?
lt_sharon_valerii Yeah.
captain_karl_agathon How far you figure to Delphi?
lt_sharon_valerii Eight, maybe ten days if we move fast. If we start early, we can be there in no time.
admiral_william_adama Cant sleep? I couldnt either before a big op. Mark two... good ship. Got me out of a lot of tough scrapes. Got something for you. Belonged to your grandfather. My mom bought it for him when he was in law school. See the engraving on it?
cpt_lee_adama Yeah, I can barely make it out, but...
admiral_william_adama He was a better father than I was. Dad used to carry that into court cases, claimed he never lost, unless he left it behind.
cpt_lee_adama So youre worried too.
admiral_william_adama About what?
cpt_lee_adama You know, sometimes it feels like the whole ship thinks, uh, Starbuck would do better.
admiral_william_adama I dont.
cpt_lee_adama How can you be so sure?
admiral_william_adama Cause youre my son. Get some rest, youre gonna need it.
cpt_lee_adama Dad... Ill bring it back.
admiral_william_adama You better, or Ill kick your ass. Its a good lighter.
captain_karl_agathon Sharon-- Sharon, wake up. What the frak? You killed her!
lt_sharon_valerii Let me see. We gotta go, right now.
captain_karl_agathon Wait a minute, I saw her on my lap, I saw her blood spill on my lap.
lt_sharon_valerii Lets move, mister.
captain_karl_agathon What the hell is going on?
lt_sharon_valerii I dont know, well figure it out later.
lt_felix_gaeta Jump complete, sir. Dradis reports nothing but hash, just as we expected. Cant see a thing. We are now within launch range of the Cylon base.
Freighter_Pilot_#1#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode10 Carrier constellation, jump complete on station, point deacon. Initiate search pattern delta.
Freighter_Pilot_#2#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode10 Ore flight bravo, delta, wilco.
Freighter_Pilot_#3#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode10 Ore flight nebula, delta initiated.
admiral_william_adama Balls in play. You can bet they heard that. Now theyll try to locate the decoys.
president_laura_roslin And when they do?
admiral_william_adama If they take the bait, all hell breaks loose.
president_laura_roslin Until then?
admiral_william_adama We wait.
lt_sharon_valerii Galactica, Boomer. Tally, 90+ headed deacon, speed: 250. Crashdown: The Cylons have seen the freighter. Theyre en route to intercept.
admiral_william_adama They took the bait. Mr. Gaeta, launch strike force one. Gaeta: Aye, sir. D, launch strike force one.
officer_anastasia_dualla Attention: Pilots, man your planes. Pilots, man your planes.
captain_kara_thrace How hard did they bite?
admiral_william_adama Boomers report said 90+. Theyve launched most of their fighter force.
Launch_Officer#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode10 Give them hell, sir. Firing...
lt_felix_gaeta Our attack force is away.
captain_kara_thrace I just hope that Lee can...
admiral_william_adama Lee isnt the problem. You should take a good look at yourself. I had to go through the same transition. When youre in the cockpit, youre in control. Its hard to give it up.
captain_kara_thrace It would just be a lot easier if I was flying with them.
admiral_william_adama All you can do now is wait and hope you didnt make any mistakes.
captain_kara_thrace I never wanted this kind of responsibility.
admiral_william_adama The Cylons never asked us what we wanted. Welcome to the big leagues.
crashdown Galactica, Crashdown, tally 50+ on an intercept course. Repeat, 50+ inbound.
dr_gaius_baltar Whats that mean?
captain_kara_thrace It means that a Cylon patrol spotted our attack force. The base sent out 50 more raiders, to intercept.
dr_gaius_baltar 50 raiders? That means were outnumbered now, 5:1?
president_laura_roslin Werent the decoys supposed to take care of that?
admiral_william_adama Cylons are too smart for that.
captain_kara_thrace Frak.
officer_anastasia_dualla Estimated time to strike intercept, two minutes.
fireball Fireball, multiple bandits, left, ten high. Range 40, weapons free, committing.
lt_brendan_constanza Hotdog, visual tally, press.
fireball Hotdog, break right!
lt_brendan_constanza Fireball, your six!
fireball Im hit, Im hit! Cant eject!
Deadbolt#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode10 Deadbolt, Spinner, two bandits closing in, right five.
fireball No joy, no joy. Aaahh!
lt_brendan_constanza Galactica, Hotdog. Heavily engaged, mission outcome doubtful.
dr_gaius_baltar This sounds fraking awful.
captain_kara_thrace Theyre getting cut to pieces out there.
Spinner#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode10 Deadbolt, break vertical, now, now, now!
Deadbolt#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode10 Damn it, take the shot, get him off me...!
admiral_william_adama Mr. Gaeta, abort strike one.
officer_anastasia_dualla Strike one, Galactica, return to base. Repeat, abort your mission and return to base.
Stubbs#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode10 Galactica, Stubbs. Cylon strike force is turning away from beacon and inbound to Galactica.
president_laura_roslin Cylons heard our transmission recall, didnt they?
dr_gaius_baltar Does that mean the first wave of raiders is ignoring the decoys and is... is coming after us?
admiral_william_adama Thats exactly what it means.
dr_gaius_baltar So when are we going to launch the reserve vipers to defend Galactica?
admiral_william_adama There are no reserve vipers. Everything is on the board already. Now we play for all the marbles. Starbuck, its your plan.
captain_kara_thrace Mr. Gaeta, will you please tell D to get on the scrambler and inform Apollo the back door is open?
lt_felix_gaeta Aye, lieutenant. D, please send a scrambler to Captain Apollo. Message reads, the back door is open.
officer_anastasia_dualla Apollo, Galactica, back door is open. Back door is open. Godspeed, Apollo.
Rolsin#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode10 Lt. Thrace, why didnt you tell me we had another attack force hidden in the freighters?
captain_kara_thrace We, uh--
admiral_william_adama It was my decision. I routinely restrict tactical details to those who need to know. Old habits die hard.
president_laura_roslin So you still might pull this off.
admiral_william_adama If Dr. Baltars target information is correct.
captain_kara_thrace And whether we get blown to pieces by those Cylon raiders heading toward us right now.
admiral_william_adama Speaking of which, Im needed in C-I-C.
cpt_lee_adama Initial point in five seconds. Flak suppression unit cleared hot. Okay, lets do this.
captain_kara_thrace Come on, Lee, its all on you.
cpt_lee_adama Incoming, incoming! Weapons free, by the numbers, people.
Racetrack#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode10 Target acquired, tone and lock, firing....
louanne_katraine Tone and lock, firing....
louanne_katraine Whats got into these fraking missiles?
captain_kara_thrace Come on!
Racetrack#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode10 Theyre jamming the guidance systems.
cpt_lee_adama Strike-two, Apollo, then we get close enough that we dont need the guidance systems. We have to blow this thing manually.
chuckles Wilco, Apollo, rolling in.
Racetrack#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode10 Chuckles... chuckles!
chuckles Oh, frak...
Racetrack#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode10 chuckles bought it, hes going down--
louanne_katraine Now theyve got our attack axis zeroed in. Theres no way to fraking get close.
captain_kara_thrace Frak... theres gotta be.
cpt_lee_adama Weve gotta get out of this flak. Lets get down below the deck, down where the target is. Ive got an idea. Im gonna take a closer look.
officer_anastasia_dualla Commander on deck!
admiral_william_adama As you were.
colonel_saul_tigh First wave of Cylons will be on us in three minutes.
admiral_william_adama Notify the strike-one vipers that they can stop running and blast those bastards to hell.
officer_anastasia_dualla Yes, sir.
Deadbolt#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode10 Engaging Cylon fighters.
lt_brendan_constanza Target acquired, tone and lock.
cpt_lee_adama Oh, no, dont do this, Lee... the conveyor tunnels clear, Im going through it.
louanne_katraine Youre out of your fraking mind, apollo.
captain_kara_thrace Whats going on?
lt_felix_gaeta Captain Apollos flying into the conveyor tunnel, hoping itll lead him to the refinery.
dr_gaius_baltar Has he goneraving mad? Theres no way to ensure it does anything of the kind.
cpt_lee_adama Come on, keep it together, Lee, keep it together, keep it-- oh, lords. Okay, Im through the tunnel. They cant get firing solution on me. There you are. Okay... Ive got you, Ive got you, Ive got you, Ive got you... Ahh, Galactica, Apollo. Mission... accomplished.
cpt_lee_adama You can tell Dr. Baltar he was right on the money. Its one hell of a fireworks show. And theres plenty of ore for us back in the canyon, once this place is history.
lt_felix_gaeta Congratulations, Doctor, it worked!
dr_gaius_baltar It did. It worked.
president_laura_roslin Oh...!
captain_kara_thrace Sorry, Madam President, Im sorry.
president_laura_roslin No need to apologize, Lieutenant. Thanks to you, we have enough fuel to last us a few years.
officer_anastasia_dualla Commander, strike one reports inbound Cylons are bugging out request permission to go after them, sir.
admiral_william_adama Tell our people to pursue and destroy.
officer_anastasia_dualla Affirmative. Strike one... tear em up.
captain_kara_thrace Apollo, you magnificent bastard, that was one hell of a piece of flying and I couldnt have done it better myself.
cpt_lee_adama Im sorry, I didnt hear you.
captain_kara_thrace I said that I couldnt have done it better myself.
cpt_lee_adama Well, thank you.
captain_kara_thrace Hmm. I had my doubts.
cpt_lee_adama So did I.
captain_kara_thrace Mmm.
cpt_lee_adama I wasnt sure that crazy-ass plan of yours could even possibly work.
captain_kara_thrace Mmm. You deserve this.
ensign_davis Crash!
number_six Have you read the Pythian prophecy, Gaius?
dr_gaius_baltar Not since the sixth grade. I cant say ancient history is my favorite subject.
number_six You should have paid closer attention, hmm?
dr_gaius_baltar To what?
number_six All of this has happened before. All of this will happen again.
dr_gaius_baltar Everyone knows that verse. What are you getting at?
number_six Remember this one? Led by serpents numbering two and ten.
dr_gaius_baltar The vipers... theyre the serpents.
number_six Theres a later verse, Gaius, you should read it. Though the outcome favored the few, it led to a confrontation at the home of the gods.
dr_gaius_baltar Are you telling me that god guided my finger to that target for some... arcane scriptural purpose?
number_six You are part of gods plan, gaius.
dr_gaius_baltar So god wanted me to destroy the Cylon base.
number_six You did well. You gave yourself over to him.
dr_gaius_baltar Yes, suppose I did. Yes, theres-- theres really no other logical explanation for it. I was--
number_six Am...
dr_gaius_baltar I am an instrument of god.
