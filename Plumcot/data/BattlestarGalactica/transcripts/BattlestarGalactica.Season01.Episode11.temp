Radio_Engineer Got it? Test, test... there.
McManus We on?
Radio_Engineer Frak, were on, go, go!
McManus Live, from Cloud 9, the most luxurious cruise ship in the fleet, its the Colonial Gang. Its a new talk show that brings you the inside scoop on the fleets movers and shakers. Im James McManus, formerly of the Caprica Times. With me are two of the only remaining legitimate journalists left in the universe. Playa Palacios, veteran commentator for the Picon Star Tribune, welcome. And my wing man, Sekou Hamilton, former editor of the Aerilon Gazette. As most people probably know, Cloud 9 was damaged during the Cylon attack and had to be evacuated. With repairs now complete, President Roslin has picked it as the site for an historic gathering. Its the first meeting of the interim Quorum of Twelve, which will coincide with Colonial Day, the 52nd Anniversary of the signing of the Articles of Colonization. Playa, why dont you weigh in?
Playa Laura Roslin should be applauded for restoring the system of checks and balances—
McManus Give me a fraking break! Every delegate shes chosen so far has been a Roslin cronie. Its a puppet Quorum, okay, that will rubber stamp every edict this power-mad schoolteacher will try—
Hamilton How can you say that, when half the Quorum hasnt even been selected yet?
McManus I predict, every last one will be a Roslin lackey, handpicked by the power behind the throne, Presidential advisor, Wallace Gray. Dont you see it? Gray orchestrated this whole publicity stunt—
Playa Come on, Jim. Wallace Gray is no prince of darkness.
McManus I disagree!
Hamilton Hes helped Roslin regulate the internal economy, make sure vital food and medical supplies were fairly distributed—
McManus He is a fatuous gasbag, whos made a fortune through kickback deals that members of this Quorum have profited from. Now as we speak survivors—
Roslin Freedom of the press...
Gray Madame President, the fatuous gasbag would like five minutes of your time.
Roslin Wally! Mm-wah! How does it feel to be a celebrity?
Gray Well, I love it, theyll probably be calling me a fascist next.
Roslin No, Im the fascist, you stick with being the gasbag.
Billy Madame President. Excuse me, Madame President, youre gonna wanna hear this.
McManus ... Sagittaron have chosen the delegate for the interim Quorum of Twelve. Who would have guessed it? Tom Zarek. Now that of course being hotly debated…
Roslin Oh, my gods.
Billy Hes got quite a following out there.
Roslin Oh, I should have seen this coming.
Gray Hes a terrorist, who are they kidding?
McManus …would call a ruthless terrorist.
Hamilton Tom Zarek incited a prison riot that resulted in kidnapping, attempted rape...
Gray He blew up a government building and now hes gonna sit on the Quorum of Twelve.
McManus Wrong wrong, he was a victim of the government held on trumped up charges…
Billy Yes? Just a moment.
Roslin Commander Adama. Why am I not surprised? Hello, Commander.
Adama Are you listening to this?
Roslin Indeed.
Adama We cant allow a terrorist to sit in government. Roslin: My hands are tied. I dont wanna turn him into a martyr. Sagittaron law allows a prisoner to regain his citizenship once he has served his time.
Adama Tom Zarek represents a danger to the entire fleet. I can bar him from traveling to Cloud 9 on that basis alone.
Roslin I perfectly understand the threat Tom Zarek represents, but the last thing I need is for you to start acting like my own personal goon squad. We need to let this play out. Thank you.
Mcmanus Hold onto your shorts, folks. Another stunning development. Were getting a live feed from the Astral Queen, Tom Zarek is about to make a statement.
Zarek Citizens of the Twelve colonies, I am humbled and moved by this great honor. I will be a voice for those who have gone too long unheard by a government that serves only the privileged and the powerful. That turns a blind eye to the needs of the weak and the poor. But Roslin and her confederates will no longer be able to ignore us. People of the fleet, look up. The winds of change are blowing. A new era is about to dawn.
Starbuck Hey, Doc.
Baltar Lieutenant Thrace. To what do I owe this honor?
Starbuck Our shuttle leaves for Cloud 9 at 05:12 Tomorrow, dont be late.
Baltar Our shuttle?
#6 A surprise getaway, just the two of you?
Starbuck Im gonna be handling your security.
Baltar Please-- please dont touch that, thank you. Security for what?
Starbuck You havent heard? Its all over talk wireless.
Baltar When would I have the chance to listen to the talk wireless? I have 60 years of work in front of me. Anyway, talk wireless is just an excuse, really for low-brow rabble-rousing.
Stabruck Youve been selected as Capricas delegate to the Quorum of Twelve.
Baltar Me? Is this some kind of joke?
Starbuck Guess you got the super-genius vote. No accounting for taste.
#6 Congratulations, Doctor!
Baltar Thank you, um... politics is the only thing more boring than blood samples. All those interminable speeches, all that dreary pomp!
#6 Parties full of young women, drawn to men of power.
Baltar But when the people call, you must serve.
Apollo Ahh, I cant remember the last time I felt the sunlight on my face. It sure feels good, almost like the real thing.
Starbuck They could have done a better job with the horizon, though. Securitys gonna be a bitch. A thousand different places for a sniper to hide. How many people are we dealing with again?
Apollo Oh, 500-plus. Each colony is sending a delegation of leading citizens.
Starbuck Great... herds of lookie-loos, any one of whom could be a Cylon.
Apollo But toasters arent our only problem. Dont you pay any attention to the politics?
Starbuck No.
Apollo A lot of unrest out there.
Starbuck So why is Roslin insisting on letting so many people come?
Apollo Well, I guess she thinks its important for them to be able to observe how their government works.
Starbuck So, basically, shes already running for re-election?
Apollo No... Kara— Kara, get off, give me that!
Guard Thank you, sir, enjoy your day.
Playa The atmosphere is electric, as Quorum members arrive with their delegations. Im outside the Cloud 9 ballroom where the reception of the new Quorum of Twelve is about to take place, but the question on everyones mind is, will President Roslin actually shake the hand of the man many still regard as a terrorist, or will she snub him and by extension, all people of Sagittaron?
Tigh Colonel Tigh and, uh, my wife, Ellen.
Ellen Welcome aboard.
Tigh kill me now... Colonel Tigh.
Apollo Starbuck, Apollo, Zareks here.
Starbuck Copy. Dont worry, this guys mine the second he makes a wrong move.
Apollo Yeah, well, youll have to beat me to him.
Man Murderer! You dont belong here, Zarek, go back—
Grimes What did you say? Hes not a murderer, hes a freedom fighter, all right?
Apollo Excuse me. May I see your security pass, sir?
Grimes Yeah, no problem. Im a citizen of Sagittaron, Ive got every legal right to be here.
Apollo Your rights dont extend to roughing people up. Lay a hand on anyone else, and youll be getting to know Galacticas brig. Well, everythings in order, enjoy your stay on Cloud 9.
Grimes Oh, I will.
Zarek Tom Zarek.
Tigh Colonel Tigh. Battlestar Galactica.
Zarek I see.
Tigh My wife.
Zarek Does she have a name?
Ellen Ellen.
Zarek Call me Tom, I dont like to stand on ceremony.
Ellen Im the same way, all this pretension makes me sick.
Tigh Youre holding up the line.
Zarek Thank you for making me feel welcome, Ellen.
Ellen I hope to see you again.
Tigh Why did you do that?
Ellen To get our picture on the front page of every half-baked newsletter and photo service in the fleet.
Tigh I dont need my picture taken with a terrorist.
Ellen Oh, wake up, Saul, look at these cameras. Roslins the past and Zareks the future, a blind man can see that.
Zarek Madame President.
Roslin Mister Zarek.
Zarek Hmm, if I were to offer you my hand in friendship, would you take it?
Rolsin Well, theres only one way to find out.
Zarek That was nicely played.
Roslin Thank you.
Zarek Just remember, Im not your enemy, Madame President.
Roslin ...And I know todays agenda is rather large, but I think that if youll look at the scheduled meetings youll see that they concern issues vital to the fleet. In some cases, existing policies regarding matters such as the distribution of medical supplies, need only a review of...
#6 Youre missing an intriguing opportunity. Playas not wearing any underwear.
Baltar Oh, dont be absurd. Really?
#6 Shes been eyeing you all afternoon.
Baltar Well, shes only human. Youre not jealous?
#6 Love isnt about sex, Gaius.
Baltar Theres an enlightened point of view.
#6 Ive been thinking. And as far as Im concerned, you can have any woman you want. But always remember... I have your heart.
Baltar Yes, of course you do.
#6 I can always rip it out of your chest if I need to.
Roslin So if there are no objections, the chair will entertain motions to accept todays agenda as proposed.
Zarek I have an objection.
Roslin The chair recognizes Sagittaron.
Zarek All of the items on your agenda are important, I agree. Ration distribution, education, medical services all very, very important but Im frankly shocked to discover the most critical issue of all is nowhere to be found.
Roslin Really? Well, perhaps Mr. Zarek could enlighten us.
Zarek The election of a Vice President. If, gods forbid, anything should happen to you, Madame President we have no designated successor. The civilian branch of our government would be paralyzed, leaving the door wide open for a military dictatorship. Sagittaron moves that the first item on the Quorums agenda should be nominations for Vice-President.
#6 Second.
Baltar Hmm?
#6 Second!
Baltar Second! Caprica seconds, for various reasons which are far too obvious and numerous to go into right now. But certainly, I think we can all agree that itd be a good idea to have a successor.
Roslin The motion has been moved and seconded. All those in favor of opening nominations for the Vice presidency, say aye.
Roslin The ayes have it, the floor is now open for nominations. The chair recognizes Virgon.
Bagot There is only one man here who is willing to work for the betterment of the people in this fleet. When I asked for his help, he sent a crew to fix the air filtration system on my ship and hell, they were finished and they were gone while I was still waiting for the Presidents office to return my call. I nominate Tom Zarek.
Zarek Thank you.
Roslin Is there a second?
Porter Geminon seconds the nomination.
Roslin The nomination of Tom Zarek for the Vice Presidency has been accepted. The chair will remain open for 72 hours, for nominations. This session is now adjourned.
Roslin Thomas Zarek is not going to be my Vice President.
Billy Six months until the Presidential election, we could have hand-picked a candidate.
Gray You know, it didnt shock me when Bagot nominated him. But Porter, that was surprising.
Roslin Not really, the Geminon ships use more water per capita than any other ships in the fleet. She wanted more rations, I said no.
Gray Well, Zarek may have made some new friends in the last few weeks, but there are still plenty of people out there who hate him.
Apollo Dont underestimate Zarek. Hes charismatic and knows which buttons to push. And frankly, Madame President, I am concerned about the security aboard Cloud 9.
Roslin I want you leaning forward on this, Captain. If they so much as sneeze, theyd better have a handkerchief.
Apollo Understood.
Roslin We need a candidate. Someone who will quickly win the delegates support.
Billy An established name.
Gray Im not a politician.
Roslin But you know how to get things done. You have kept this fleet functioning all this time.
Gray No. Thanks, but...
Roslin I cannot allow Tom Zarek to be one heartbeat away from the presidency, Wally. I need you.
Gray Youve got me, Madame President.
Playa How can we reassure people that youre looking out for their interests, as opposed to the rehabilitation of Tom Zarek?
Zarek Thats a great question, Playa. This is how I see it, were facing a situation so unique, so specific, that I believe we need not only new leadership but a whole new way of thinking.
Hamilton Like blowing up a building or two.
Zarek If things werent so serious, Id say that was funny. Look, theres no economy. Theres no market, no industry, no capital. Money is worthless. And yet, were all held hostage by the idea of the way things used to be. Look where we are. This man wakes up every morning, tugs on his boots and goes to work in this garden. Why, because its his job? What job? He labors, but he gets no benefit! And hes not the only one. Many of us are just still going through the motions of our old lives. The lawyers still act like lawyers but they have no clients! Businessmen still act like businessmen but have no business! President Roslin and her policies are all about holding onto a fantasy! If we wanna survive, we need to completely restructure our lives. We need to think about the community of citizens. The group, not the individual. We need to completely free ourselves of the past, and operate as a collective.
McManus Well there you have it ladies and gentleman a very powerful statement from Vice Presidential candidate Tom Zarek…
Apollo Youre not interested in the citizens, you just want power. Turn that crap off.
Grimes Yeah, I was listening to that broadcast.
Apollo You again. Thats a shame.
Grimes Yeah, well, they all wanna hear Mr. Zarek speak too, dont you, buddy? See, he wants to hear Mr. Zarek. How about you? You wanna hear what Mr. Zarek has to say?
Valance No, I dont mind one way or the other.
Grimes Well, I take that as a yes, so turn it on, now.
Apollo Leave it.
Grimes Mr. Zarek is a representative of the people, and we are the people.
Apollo Well, youre people, sort of.
Grimes No, I dont like your tone, fly boy. So, why dont you just move along out of here and go enjoy the imitation weather?
Apollo Id be happy to, after you leave. Which is now.
Grimes Okay. I dont want no trouble.
Apollo Aah!
Starbuck What the hell?
Starbuck Theres a gun!
Apollo Starbuck, Starbuck!
Starbuck Incoming!
Apollo Are you looking for this?
Helo The Telamon Buildings still standing. Thats Delphi, all right. Now, all we have to do is wait until dark... infiltrate the most heavily fortified military hub on this planet, hope the Cylons havent completely wasted the spaceport, steal a ship, locate Galactica and fly to her without getting shot to hell.
Caprica_Boomer Is that all? Well, I guess we can relax until dark. Might as well make ourselves comfortable. You hungry?
Helo No, not right now. Your stomachs feeling better.
Caprica_Boomer Im starving.
Helo Ive been trying to make sense out of the two women we saw with the Cylons.
Caprica_Boomer And?
Helo I cant fathom why anybody would wanna help the toasters. And they just happened to be twins? Thats too weird.
Caprica_Boomer You got a better explanation?
Helo You think the Cylons could be messing with human D.N.A.? Cloning people or something?
Caprica_Boomer Could be.
Helo That would explain how they took us by surprise. They had these replicated humans infiltrating the colonies laying the groundwork for a surprise attack.
Caprica_Boomer You know, if they were human clones that means theyre capable of-- of complex emotions, maybe even love. Maybe they were misguided in the way they were indoctrinated, but—
Helo Whatever they are, theyre not human. No human could do the things that theyve done. Killed billions of innocent people. Theyve gotta be fraking Cylons, just like the rest of them.
Starbuck Why do you have a summit itinerary? Why circle every public appearance by President Roslin?
Valance Its not mine!
Starbuck So, what, some stranger wandered down the hall, picked the lock to your room and just left it there?
Apollo A False bottom, with anechoic coating to absorb x-rays? Ceramic stealth gun!
Starbuck You sure went through a lot of trouble to get that weapon onboard.
Valance I carry a lot of money, I need protection.
Apollo Right... the moneys worthless. Your friend Zarek pointed that out!
Valance I dont even know Zarek.
Starbuck Your pal, Grimes says different. He gave you up.
Valance Youre-- youre bluffing. You havent got anything.
Apollo But we dont need anything, Valance. Cause this isnt a trial. This is just you and us in this room.
Starbuck Like Zarek pointed out, were living in a whole new world. Theres no due process. This is your courtroom.
Apollo And that would make us... your executioners.
Starbuck So you might wanna cooperate. Or else youre going out an airlock. Cause thats what we do to traitors.
Valance Look, I, uh... I just came over here for the booze and the food, thats it.
Apollo You know what? Frak you!
Apollo We put all the heat on Valance that we could and we still cant tie him to Zarek.
Roslin I know Zareks behind this, keep working on Valance.
Apollo We will, but to be safe, I think you should send the entire Sagittaron delegation back to their ships.
Roslin Cant do that, it violates their civil rights plays right into Zareks hands.
Apollo But he could still have another shooter on Cloud 9 and if Zarek wins the vote, hes more than capable of ordering your assassination and ascending to the presidency.
Roslin Zareks not going to win, because Im not going to let him. Meanwhile, youre gonna keep Zarek under surveillance. Youre gonna tap his phones, youre gonna bug his room. If you find anything that remotely connects Zarek to Valance, shut him down.
Gray The domestic policies that weve been talking about over the last little while, such as employment and housing and education and capitol and....
Billy Latest vote count is seven for Gray, five for Zarek.
Roslin Were slipping, he was four an hour ago. Zarek must be making promises.
Billy Picon flipped.
Roslin Youve gotta hold our colonies until the vote Tomorrow.
Gray You now hold that plan in your hands. on page 33 of my mission statement, I lay out a 16-point educational program that the President and I have developed. Individuals with four year college degrees will be elidgable to apply for teachers creditentials, and will work…
Apollo Hi, howre you doing? Remember me? We got Valance and youre next.
Zarek Can I get you something?
Ellen So you work here now?
Zarek Why should I ask the bartender to get me a drink? Whats in it for him?
Ellen A big tip.
Zarek What would he spend it on?
Ellen So, you worried about Wallace Gray? I hear hes ahead in the vote count.
Zarek Whatever the people want is fine by me.
Ellen Everyone has an agenda. I know I do.
Zarek And what would that be?
Ellen Same as yours, Tom. Me, myself and... oh, I.
Zarek You are clearly a well-connected, well-informed woman.
Ellen Wife of the X.O., For whatever thats worth.
Zarek Quite a bit, now and in the future.
Ellen Thats what Im interested in, Tom. Its my place. And my husbands place in the future.
Zarek Okay... Im looking for a friend of mine. His name is Valance.
Starbuck How the hell did this happen?
Apollo We gotta get to the President
McManus We’re here with Dr. Gaius , representative of Caprica. Doctor , I have one question. Is President Roslins political career terminal, or is there hope of resuscitating it?
Baltar Laura Roslins political career is very much alive and to underestimate her would be a very serious mistake.
#6 You missed the limelight, dont you, Gaius?
Baltar Yes, I have.
McManus You have what, Dr. ?
Baltar Nothing-- you were saying?
McManus Yes, so you seriously believe that this schoolteacher is able to handle the job of Presidency?
Starbuck His wrists were slashed with broken glass from the room.
Billy So was it suicide, or was it murder?
Roslin It wasnt suicide, Zarek had him killed.
Apollo If only we could prove that.
Tigh Howd they get past the marine guards?
Apollo Through the vent.
Baltar ... I think all of us have had teachers who have made a profound impact on our lives. History-- history is full of examples of leaders, um, who have come from the most humble beginnings and have risen to meet the challenge posed by cataclysmic events.
Billy How many people knew where Valance was being held?
Starbuck Just the people in this room, plus two marines.
Baltar ... Laura Roslin and the tough decisions that she has to make every day. Especially if youre someone like Tom Zarek, whos never shouldered any real responsibility, in your life. To be fair to Tom, how could he? Hes been in prison for the last 20 years. Um, now hes had a drastic personality makeover. Hes posing like he is the savior to all your ills. I think you all have a short memory, really...
Tigh Well, someone talked. Now, we have no assassin, no evidence of a plot. No check on Zarek, no nothing.
Apollo If he can get to Valance, he can get to anyone. Madame President, he will definitely try and take a shot at you now.
Roslin Only if he wins the vote.
Apollo Madame President, I still worry the vote may be turning against you.
Roslin Yes, it is. But Im going to win this thing. And Tom Zarek is going back to his prison ship where he belongs. But first, I have two very unpleasant duties to perform. I need a shuttle to Cloud 9.
Gray What am I supposed to say?
Roslin Health reasons.
Gray Right, fine, health reasons. You know, all of those years, I watched you. Working with Adar, you were always so quiet, so polite. So dignified. I never thought youd fit in with the bare knuckle, backstabbing politicians. I guess I was wrong.
Guard All clear.
Roslin Dr. , are you in here?
Baltar Um, Madame President?
Roslin I heard you on the wireless. You were very articulate, quite engaging.
Baltar Oh, thank you. Thats very encouraging. Yeah, Im just trying to do my bit, you know. As the elected representative for Caprica. And besides, Im, um-- Im beginning to get a real feel for politics.
Roslin So I take it youre not voting for Mr. Zarek?
Baltar Any man who uses their intelligence and resources to blow up a building doesnt get my vote, no. No, Im voting for your man, Gray. Hes really gray--t. Hes great-- he is great, which is why hes got my vote.
Roslin Unfortunately, Mr. Gray dropped out of the race.
Baltar Well, then who do you want me to vote for?
Roslin I was thinking you.
Baltar Me? Look, um—
Roslin Doctor, lets cut to the chase. You are a very popular man these days. I would be fortunate to have your intellect and your popularity right by my side.
Baltar Well, under those circumstances, I accept. Thank you, Madame President.
Roslin Thank you.
Playa Wow! What are you gonna do now?
Baltar Now... now, Im gonna give you an exclusive. After you.
Starbuck So what are we supposed to do? Sit on our hands and watch her get killed?
Apollo Zareks too smart to take another shot at the President during the summit. If he wins the vote, he can take her out later when everyones forgotten about Valance. Just bide his time to find a better opportunity.
Starbuck Thats great.
Apollo Anyway, she says shes not gonna lose the vote.
Starbuck She says a lot of things.
Apollo Dont you think you should wash that?
Starbuck I did.
Apollo Like when, a month ago?
Starbuck Do you have a problem with my hygiene?
Apollo You have hygiene?
Starbuck I clean up good sometimes, all right?
Apollo Well, let me know when its one of those times.
Roslin Tauron... Gaius .
McManus The surprises just keep on coming. A number of the Quorum delegates have now shifted their support to the scientific genius, a man who is credited with saving the fleet on numerous occasion.
Playa At this point, Jim, it is anyones guess as to who is going to win. But my money is on Gaius-- uh, Dr. .
Roslin Aquaria... Thomas Zarek. Aerilon... Tom Zarek.
Playa The vote is now 6-5, in favor of Tom Zarek. The next vote will determine our new Vice President. If Zarek gets it, he wins. In the event of a tie, the President will cast the deciding vote.
Roslin Citizens, I give you your new Vice President, Doctor Gaius !
#6 The perks of power, Mr. Vice President. Were going to do great things together.
Baltar Good, its difficult to fathom I, uh-- I never aspired to power.
#6 Of course you didnt, Gaius but someone had to step up.
Baltar Yeah, well, after what Laura told me—
#6 Laura?
Baltar Yeah, were like on first name basis now. Now, I think, uh, the people-- the people need me, excuse us.
Apollo So, um, that bum knee of yours is looking pretty good. And the other ones not too bad either.
Starbuck Lee, if you wanna ask me to dance, just ask.
Apollo You wanna dance?
Starbuck Me in a dress is a once in a lifetime opportunity.
Zarek Madame President.
Roslin Mister Zarek. Oh, dont worry, I wont be kissing you today.
Zarek Thats a shame. I shaved very closely in anticipation of being smacked by you. That was very nicely played. Again. But theres still a Presidential election in six months. Ill see you then.
Roslin I have no doubt.
Zarek Oh, one thing you should know. I didnt kill Valance. I wonder who did.
Adama Madame President, good evening.
Roslin I thought you hated these things.
Adama Its colonial day, where else would I be? Im a patriot.
Roslin You really are, arent you?
Adama Doctor ... interesting choice.
Roslin I figured, the devil you know.
Adama Politics. As exciting as war, definitely as dangerous.
Roslin Though in war, you only get killed once. In politics, it can happen over and over.
Adama Youre still standing.
Roslin So are you.
Adama And I can dance!
Ellen I have a surprise for you.
Tigh Uh-oh, should I be worried?
Ellen not unless you consider a day in a luxury suite aboard the Rising Star as something to be worried about.
Tigh What? How did you swing that?
Ellen I have my ways. What you need to do is figure out a way to get slave-driving Bill to give you the day off. And while youre there, you might wanna talk to a few people about your future.
Tigh What?
Ellen Later, my love, it can all wait until later.
Helo Any second, now.
Helo You dont have to say anything, I know. Were gonna make it, Sharon. Okay... go, go, go!
Helo Sharon?
Caprica_Boomer Helo! Helo... Helo!
