Radio_Engineer#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode11 Got it? Test, test... there.
james_mcmanus We on?
Radio_Engineer#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode11 Frak, were on, go, go!
james_mcmanus Live, from Cloud 9, the most luxurious cruise ship in the fleet, its the Colonial Gang. Its a new talk show that brings you the inside scoop on the fleets movers and shakers. Im James McManus, formerly of the Caprica Times. With me are two of the only remaining legitimate journalists left in the universe. Playa Palacios, veteran commentator for the Picon Star Tribune, welcome. And my wing man, Sekou Hamilton, former editor of the Aerilon Gazette. As most people probably know, Cloud 9 was damaged during the Cylon attack and had to be evacuated. With repairs now complete, President Roslin has picked it as the site for an historic gathering. Its the first meeting of the interim Quorum of Twelve, which will coincide with Colonial Day, the 52nd Anniversary of the signing of the Articles of Colonization. Playa, why dont you weigh in?
playa_palacios Laura Roslin should be applauded for restoring the system of checks and balances—
james_mcmanus Give me a fraking break! Every delegate shes chosen so far has been a Roslin cronie. Its a puppet Quorum, okay, that will rubber stamp every edict this power-mad schoolteacher will try—
sekou_hamilton How can you say that, when half the Quorum hasnt even been selected yet?
james_mcmanus I predict, every last one will be a Roslin lackey, handpicked by the power behind the throne, Presidential advisor, Wallace Gray. Dont you see it? Gray orchestrated this whole publicity stunt—
playa_palacios Come on, Jim. Wallace Gray is no prince of darkness.
james_mcmanus I disagree!
sekou_hamilton Hes helped Roslin regulate the internal economy, make sure vital food and medical supplies were fairly distributed—
james_mcmanus He is a fatuous gasbag, whos made a fortune through kickback deals that members of this Quorum have profited from. Now as we speak survivors—
president_laura_roslin Freedom of the press...
wallace_gray Madame President, the fatuous gasbag would like five minutes of your time.
president_laura_roslin Wally! Mm-wah! How does it feel to be a celebrity?
wallace_gray Well, I love it, theyll probably be calling me a fascist next.
president_laura_roslin No, Im the fascist, you stick with being the gasbag.
billy_keikeya Madame President. Excuse me, Madame President, youre gonna wanna hear this.
james_mcmanus ... Sagittaron have chosen the delegate for the interim Quorum of Twelve. Who would have guessed it? Tom Zarek. Now that of course being hotly debated…
president_laura_roslin Oh, my gods.
billy_keikeya Hes got quite a following out there.
president_laura_roslin Oh, I should have seen this coming.
wallace_gray Hes a terrorist, who are they kidding?
james_mcmanus …would call a ruthless terrorist.
sekou_hamilton Tom Zarek incited a prison riot that resulted in kidnapping, attempted rape...
wallace_gray He blew up a government building and now hes gonna sit on the Quorum of Twelve.
james_mcmanus Wrong wrong, he was a victim of the government held on trumped up charges…
billy_keikeya Yes? Just a moment.
president_laura_roslin Commander Adama. Why am I not surprised? Hello, Commander.
admiral_william_adama Are you listening to this?
president_laura_roslin Indeed.
admiral_william_adama We cant allow a terrorist to sit in government. Roslin: My hands are tied. I dont wanna turn him into a martyr. Sagittaron law allows a prisoner to regain his citizenship once he has served his time.
admiral_william_adama Tom Zarek represents a danger to the entire fleet. I can bar him from traveling to Cloud 9 on that basis alone.
president_laura_roslin I perfectly understand the threat Tom Zarek represents, but the last thing I need is for you to start acting like my own personal goon squad. We need to let this play out. Thank you.
james_mcmanus Hold onto your shorts, folks. Another stunning development. Were getting a live feed from the Astral Queen, Tom Zarek is about to make a statement.
tom_zarek Citizens of the Twelve colonies, I am humbled and moved by this great honor. I will be a voice for those who have gone too long unheard by a government that serves only the privileged and the powerful. That turns a blind eye to the needs of the weak and the poor. But Roslin and her confederates will no longer be able to ignore us. People of the fleet, look up. The winds of change are blowing. A new era is about to dawn.
captain_kara_thrace Hey, Doc.
dr_gaius_baltar Lieutenant Thrace. To what do I owe this honor?
captain_kara_thrace Our shuttle leaves for Cloud 9 at 05:12 Tomorrow, dont be late.
dr_gaius_baltar Our shuttle?
number_six A surprise getaway, just the two of you?
captain_kara_thrace Im gonna be handling your security.
dr_gaius_baltar Please-- please dont touch that, thank you. Security for what?
captain_kara_thrace You havent heard? Its all over talk wireless.
dr_gaius_baltar When would I have the chance to listen to the talk wireless? I have 60 years of work in front of me. Anyway, talk wireless is just an excuse, really for low-brow rabble-rousing.
captain_kara_thrace Youve been selected as Capricas delegate to the Quorum of Twelve.
dr_gaius_baltar Me? Is this some kind of joke?
captain_kara_thrace Guess you got the super-genius vote. No accounting for taste.
number_six Congratulations, Doctor!
dr_gaius_baltar Thank you, um... politics is the only thing more boring than blood samples. All those interminable speeches, all that dreary pomp!
number_six Parties full of young women, drawn to men of power.
dr_gaius_baltar But when the people call, you must serve.
cpt_lee_adama Ahh, I cant remember the last time I felt the sunlight on my face. It sure feels good, almost like the real thing.
captain_kara_thrace They could have done a better job with the horizon, though. Securitys gonna be a bitch. A thousand different places for a sniper to hide. How many people are we dealing with again?
cpt_lee_adama Oh, 500-plus. Each colony is sending a delegation of leading citizens.
captain_kara_thrace Great... herds of lookie-loos, any one of whom could be a Cylon.
cpt_lee_adama But toasters arent our only problem. Dont you pay any attention to the politics?
captain_kara_thrace No.
cpt_lee_adama A lot of unrest out there.
captain_kara_thrace So why is Roslin insisting on letting so many people come?
cpt_lee_adama Well, I guess she thinks its important for them to be able to observe how their government works.
captain_kara_thrace So, basically, shes already running for re-election?
cpt_lee_adama No... Kara— Kara, get off, give me that!
Guard#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode11 Thank you, sir, enjoy your day.
playa_palacios The atmosphere is electric, as Quorum members arrive with their delegations. Im outside the Cloud 9 ballroom where the reception of the new Quorum of Twelve is about to take place, but the question on everyones mind is, will President Roslin actually shake the hand of the man many still regard as a terrorist, or will she snub him and by extension, all people of Sagittaron?
colonel_saul_tigh Colonel Tigh and, uh, my wife, Ellen.
ellen_tigh Welcome aboard.
colonel_saul_tigh kill me now... Colonel Tigh.
cpt_lee_adama Starbuck, Apollo, Zareks here.
captain_kara_thrace Copy. Dont worry, this guys mine the second he makes a wrong move.
cpt_lee_adama Yeah, well, youll have to beat me to him.
Man#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode11 Murderer! You dont belong here, Zarek, go back—
grimes What did you say? Hes not a murderer, hes a freedom fighter, all right?
cpt_lee_adama Excuse me. May I see your security pass, sir?
grimes Yeah, no problem. Im a citizen of Sagittaron, Ive got every legal right to be here.
cpt_lee_adama Your rights dont extend to roughing people up. Lay a hand on anyone else, and youll be getting to know Galacticas brig. Well, everythings in order, enjoy your stay on Cloud 9.
grimes Oh, I will.
tom_zarek Tom Zarek.
colonel_saul_tigh Colonel Tigh. Battlestar Galactica.
tom_zarek I see.
colonel_saul_tigh My wife.
tom_zarek Does she have a name?
ellen_tigh Ellen.
tom_zarek Call me Tom, I dont like to stand on ceremony.
ellen_tigh Im the same way, all this pretension makes me sick.
colonel_saul_tigh Youre holding up the line.
tom_zarek Thank you for making me feel welcome, Ellen.
ellen_tigh I hope to see you again.
colonel_saul_tigh Why did you do that?
ellen_tigh To get our picture on the front page of every half-baked newsletter and photo service in the fleet.
colonel_saul_tigh I dont need my picture taken with a terrorist.
ellen_tigh Oh, wake up, Saul, look at these cameras. Roslins the past and Zareks the future, a blind man can see that.
tom_zarek Madame President.
president_laura_roslin Mister Zarek.
tom_zarek Hmm, if I were to offer you my hand in friendship, would you take it?
president_laura_roslin Well, theres only one way to find out.
tom_zarek That was nicely played.
president_laura_roslin Thank you.
tom_zarek Just remember, Im not your enemy, Madame President.
president_laura_roslin ...And I know todays agenda is rather large, but I think that if youll look at the scheduled meetings youll see that they concern issues vital to the fleet. In some cases, existing policies regarding matters such as the distribution of medical supplies, need only a review of...
number_six Youre missing an intriguing opportunity. Playas not wearing any underwear.
dr_gaius_baltar Oh, dont be absurd. Really?
number_six Shes been eyeing you all afternoon.
dr_gaius_baltar Well, shes only human. Youre not jealous?
number_six Love isnt about sex, Gaius.
dr_gaius_baltar Theres an enlightened point of view.
number_six Ive been thinking. And as far as Im concerned, you can have any woman you want. But always remember... I have your heart.
dr_gaius_baltar Yes, of course you do.
number_six I can always rip it out of your chest if I need to.
president_laura_roslin So if there are no objections, the chair will entertain motions to accept todays agenda as proposed.
tom_zarek I have an objection.
president_laura_roslin The chair recognizes Sagittaron.
tom_zarek All of the items on your agenda are important, I agree. Ration distribution, education, medical services all very, very important but Im frankly shocked to discover the most critical issue of all is nowhere to be found.
president_laura_roslin Really? Well, perhaps Mr. Zarek could enlighten us.
tom_zarek The election of a Vice President. If, gods forbid, anything should happen to you, Madame President we have no designated successor. The civilian branch of our government would be paralyzed, leaving the door wide open for a military dictatorship. Sagittaron moves that the first item on the Quorums agenda should be nominations for Vice-President.
number_six Second.
dr_gaius_baltar Hmm?
number_six Second!
dr_gaius_baltar Second! Caprica seconds, for various reasons which are far too obvious and numerous to go into right now. But certainly, I think we can all agree that itd be a good idea to have a successor.
president_laura_roslin The motion has been moved and seconded. All those in favor of opening nominations for the Vice presidency, say aye.
president_laura_roslin The ayes have it, the floor is now open for nominations. The chair recognizes Virgon.
marshall_bagot There is only one man here who is willing to work for the betterment of the people in this fleet. When I asked for his help, he sent a crew to fix the air filtration system on my ship and hell, they were finished and they were gone while I was still waiting for the Presidents office to return my call. I nominate Tom Zarek.
tom_zarek Thank you.
president_laura_roslin Is there a second?
Porter#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode11 Geminon seconds the nomination.
president_laura_roslin The nomination of Tom Zarek for the Vice Presidency has been accepted. The chair will remain open for 72 hours, for nominations. This session is now adjourned.
president_laura_roslin Thomas Zarek is not going to be my Vice President.
billy_keikeya Six months until the Presidential election, we could have hand-picked a candidate.
wallace_gray You know, it didnt shock me when Bagot nominated him. But Porter, that was surprising.
president_laura_roslin Not really, the Geminon ships use more water per capita than any other ships in the fleet. She wanted more rations, I said no.
wallace_gray Well, Zarek may have made some new friends in the last few weeks, but there are still plenty of people out there who hate him.
cpt_lee_adama Dont underestimate Zarek. Hes charismatic and knows which buttons to push. And frankly, Madame President, I am concerned about the security aboard Cloud 9.
president_laura_roslin I want you leaning forward on this, Captain. If they so much as sneeze, theyd better have a handkerchief.
cpt_lee_adama Understood.
president_laura_roslin We need a candidate. Someone who will quickly win the delegates support.
billy_keikeya An established name.
wallace_gray Im not a politician.
president_laura_roslin But you know how to get things done. You have kept this fleet functioning all this time.
wallace_gray No. Thanks, but...
president_laura_roslin I cannot allow Tom Zarek to be one heartbeat away from the presidency, Wally. I need you.
wallace_gray Youve got me, Madame President.
playa_palacios How can we reassure people that youre looking out for their interests, as opposed to the rehabilitation of Tom Zarek?
tom_zarek Thats a great question, Playa. This is how I see it, were facing a situation so unique, so specific, that I believe we need not only new leadership but a whole new way of thinking.
sekou_hamilton Like blowing up a building or two.
tom_zarek If things werent so serious, Id say that was funny. Look, theres no economy. Theres no market, no industry, no capital. Money is worthless. And yet, were all held hostage by the idea of the way things used to be. Look where we are. This man wakes up every morning, tugs on his boots and goes to work in this garden. Why, because its his job? What job? He labors, but he gets no benefit! And hes not the only one. Many of us are just still going through the motions of our old lives. The lawyers still act like lawyers but they have no clients! Businessmen still act like businessmen but have no business! President Roslin and her policies are all about holding onto a fantasy! If we wanna survive, we need to completely restructure our lives. We need to think about the community of citizens. The group, not the individual. We need to completely free ourselves of the past, and operate as a collective.
james_mcmanus Well there you have it ladies and gentleman a very powerful statement from Vice Presidential candidate Tom Zarek…
cpt_lee_adama Youre not interested in the citizens, you just want power. Turn that crap off.
grimes Yeah, I was listening to that broadcast.
cpt_lee_adama You again. Thats a shame.
grimes Yeah, well, they all wanna hear Mr. Zarek speak too, dont you, buddy? See, he wants to hear Mr. Zarek. How about you? You wanna hear what Mr. Zarek has to say?
valance No, I dont mind one way or the other.
grimes Well, I take that as a yes, so turn it on, now.
cpt_lee_adama Leave it.
grimes Mr. Zarek is a representative of the people, and we are the people.
cpt_lee_adama Well, youre people, sort of.
grimes No, I dont like your tone, fly boy. So, why dont you just move along out of here and go enjoy the imitation weather?
cpt_lee_adama Id be happy to, after you leave. Which is now.
grimes Okay. I dont want no trouble.
cpt_lee_adama Aah!
captain_kara_thrace What the hell?
captain_kara_thrace Theres a gun!
cpt_lee_adama Starbuck, Starbuck!
captain_kara_thrace Incoming!
cpt_lee_adama Are you looking for this?
captain_karl_agathon The Telamon Buildings still standing. Thats Delphi, all right. Now, all we have to do is wait until dark... infiltrate the most heavily fortified military hub on this planet, hope the Cylons havent completely wasted the spaceport, steal a ship, locate Galactica and fly to her without getting shot to hell.
lt_sharon_valerii Is that all? Well, I guess we can relax until dark. Might as well make ourselves comfortable. You hungry?
captain_karl_agathon No, not right now. Your stomachs feeling better.
lt_sharon_valerii Im starving.
captain_karl_agathon Ive been trying to make sense out of the two women we saw with the Cylons.
lt_sharon_valerii And?
captain_karl_agathon I cant fathom why anybody would wanna help the toasters. And they just happened to be twins? Thats too weird.
lt_sharon_valerii You got a better explanation?
captain_karl_agathon You think the Cylons could be messing with human D.N.A.? Cloning people or something?
lt_sharon_valerii Could be.
captain_karl_agathon That would explain how they took us by surprise. They had these replicated humans infiltrating the colonies laying the groundwork for a surprise attack.
lt_sharon_valerii You know, if they were human clones that means theyre capable of-- of complex emotions, maybe even love. Maybe they were misguided in the way they were indoctrinated, but—
captain_karl_agathon Whatever they are, theyre not human. No human could do the things that theyve done. Killed billions of innocent people. Theyve gotta be fraking Cylons, just like the rest of them.
captain_kara_thrace Why do you have a summit itinerary? Why circle every public appearance by President Roslin?
valance Its not mine!
captain_kara_thrace So, what, some stranger wandered down the hall, picked the lock to your room and just left it there?
cpt_lee_adama A False bottom, with anechoic coating to absorb x-rays? Ceramic stealth gun!
captain_kara_thrace You sure went through a lot of trouble to get that weapon onboard.
valance I carry a lot of money, I need protection.
cpt_lee_adama Right... the moneys worthless. Your friend Zarek pointed that out!
valance I dont even know Zarek.
captain_kara_thrace Your pal, Grimes says different. He gave you up.
valance Youre-- youre bluffing. You havent got anything.
cpt_lee_adama But we dont need anything, Valance. Cause this isnt a trial. This is just you and us in this room.
captain_kara_thrace Like Zarek pointed out, were living in a whole new world. Theres no due process. This is your courtroom.
cpt_lee_adama And that would make us... your executioners.
captain_kara_thrace So you might wanna cooperate. Or else youre going out an airlock. Cause thats what we do to traitors.
valance Look, I, uh... I just came over here for the booze and the food, thats it.
cpt_lee_adama You know what? Frak you!
cpt_lee_adama We put all the heat on Valance that we could and we still cant tie him to Zarek.
president_laura_roslin I know Zareks behind this, keep working on Valance.
cpt_lee_adama We will, but to be safe, I think you should send the entire Sagittaron delegation back to their ships.
president_laura_roslin Cant do that, it violates their civil rights plays right into Zareks hands.
cpt_lee_adama But he could still have another shooter on Cloud 9 and if Zarek wins the vote, hes more than capable of ordering your assassination and ascending to the presidency.
president_laura_roslin Zareks not going to win, because Im not going to let him. Meanwhile, youre gonna keep Zarek under surveillance. Youre gonna tap his phones, youre gonna bug his room. If you find anything that remotely connects Zarek to Valance, shut him down.
wallace_gray The domestic policies that weve been talking about over the last little while, such as employment and housing and education and capitol and....
billy_keikeya Latest vote count is seven for Gray, five for Zarek.
president_laura_roslin Were slipping, he was four an hour ago. Zarek must be making promises.
billy_keikeya Picon flipped.
president_laura_roslin Youve gotta hold our colonies until the vote Tomorrow.
wallace_gray You now hold that plan in your hands. on page 33 of my mission statement, I lay out a 16-point educational program that the President and I have developed. Individuals with four year college degrees will be elidgable to apply for teachers creditentials, and will work…
cpt_lee_adama Hi, howre you doing? Remember me? We got Valance and youre next.
tom_zarek Can I get you something?
ellen_tigh So you work here now?
tom_zarek Why should I ask the bartender to get me a drink? Whats in it for him?
ellen_tigh A big tip.
tom_zarek What would he spend it on?
ellen_tigh So, you worried about Wallace Gray? I hear hes ahead in the vote count.
tom_zarek Whatever the people want is fine by me.
ellen_tigh Everyone has an agenda. I know I do.
tom_zarek And what would that be?
ellen_tigh Same as yours, Tom. Me, myself and... oh, I.
tom_zarek You are clearly a well-connected, well-informed woman.
ellen_tigh Wife of the X.O., For whatever thats worth.
tom_zarek Quite a bit, now and in the future.
ellen_tigh Thats what Im interested in, Tom. Its my place. And my husbands place in the future.
tom_zarek Okay... Im looking for a friend of mine. His name is Valance.
captain_kara_thrace How the hell did this happen?
cpt_lee_adama We gotta get to the President
james_mcmanus We’re here with Dr. Gaius , representative of Caprica. Doctor , I have one question. Is President Roslins political career terminal, or is there hope of resuscitating it?
dr_gaius_baltar Laura Roslins political career is very much alive and to underestimate her would be a very serious mistake.
number_six You missed the limelight, dont you, Gaius?
dr_gaius_baltar Yes, I have.
james_mcmanus You have what, Dr. ?
dr_gaius_baltar Nothing-- you were saying?
james_mcmanus Yes, so you seriously believe that this schoolteacher is able to handle the job of Presidency?
captain_kara_thrace His wrists were slashed with broken glass from the room.
billy_keikeya So was it suicide, or was it murder?
president_laura_roslin It wasnt suicide, Zarek had him killed.
cpt_lee_adama If only we could prove that.
colonel_saul_tigh Howd they get past the marine guards?
cpt_lee_adama Through the vent.
dr_gaius_baltar ... I think all of us have had teachers who have made a profound impact on our lives. History-- history is full of examples of leaders, um, who have come from the most humble beginnings and have risen to meet the challenge posed by cataclysmic events.
billy_keikeya How many people knew where Valance was being held?
captain_kara_thrace Just the people in this room, plus two marines.
dr_gaius_baltar ... Laura Roslin and the tough decisions that she has to make every day. Especially if youre someone like Tom Zarek, whos never shouldered any real responsibility, in your life. To be fair to Tom, how could he? Hes been in prison for the last 20 years. Um, now hes had a drastic personality makeover. Hes posing like he is the savior to all your ills. I think you all have a short memory, really...
colonel_saul_tigh Well, someone talked. Now, we have no assassin, no evidence of a plot. No check on Zarek, no nothing.
cpt_lee_adama If he can get to Valance, he can get to anyone. Madame President, he will definitely try and take a shot at you now.
president_laura_roslin Only if he wins the vote.
cpt_lee_adama Madame President, I still worry the vote may be turning against you.
president_laura_roslin Yes, it is. But Im going to win this thing. And Tom Zarek is going back to his prison ship where he belongs. But first, I have two very unpleasant duties to perform. I need a shuttle to Cloud 9.
wallace_gray What am I supposed to say?
president_laura_roslin Health reasons.
wallace_gray Right, fine, health reasons. You know, all of those years, I watched you. Working with Adar, you were always so quiet, so polite. So dignified. I never thought youd fit in with the bare knuckle, backstabbing politicians. I guess I was wrong.
Guard#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode11 All clear.
president_laura_roslin Dr. , are you in here?
dr_gaius_baltar Um, Madame President?
president_laura_roslin I heard you on the wireless. You were very articulate, quite engaging.
dr_gaius_baltar Oh, thank you. Thats very encouraging. Yeah, Im just trying to do my bit, you know. As the elected representative for Caprica. And besides, Im, um-- Im beginning to get a real feel for politics.
president_laura_roslin So I take it youre not voting for Mr. Zarek?
dr_gaius_baltar Any man who uses their intelligence and resources to blow up a building doesnt get my vote, no. No, Im voting for your man, Gray. Hes really gray--t. Hes great-- he is great, which is why hes got my vote.
president_laura_roslin Unfortunately, Mr. Gray dropped out of the race.
dr_gaius_baltar Well, then who do you want me to vote for?
president_laura_roslin I was thinking you.
dr_gaius_baltar Me? Look, um—
president_laura_roslin Doctor, lets cut to the chase. You are a very popular man these days. I would be fortunate to have your intellect and your popularity right by my side.
dr_gaius_baltar Well, under those circumstances, I accept. Thank you, Madame President.
president_laura_roslin Thank you.
playa_palacios Wow! What are you gonna do now?
dr_gaius_baltar Now... now, Im gonna give you an exclusive. After you.
captain_kara_thrace So what are we supposed to do? Sit on our hands and watch her get killed?
cpt_lee_adama Zareks too smart to take another shot at the President during the summit. If he wins the vote, he can take her out later when everyones forgotten about Valance. Just bide his time to find a better opportunity.
captain_kara_thrace Thats great.
cpt_lee_adama Anyway, she says shes not gonna lose the vote.
captain_kara_thrace She says a lot of things.
cpt_lee_adama Dont you think you should wash that?
captain_kara_thrace I did.
cpt_lee_adama Like when, a month ago?
captain_kara_thrace Do you have a problem with my hygiene?
cpt_lee_adama You have hygiene?
captain_kara_thrace I clean up good sometimes, all right?
cpt_lee_adama Well, let me know when its one of those times.
president_laura_roslin Tauron... Gaius .
james_mcmanus The surprises just keep on coming. A number of the Quorum delegates have now shifted their support to the scientific genius, a man who is credited with saving the fleet on numerous occasion.
playa_palacios At this point, Jim, it is anyones guess as to who is going to win. But my money is on Gaius-- uh, Dr. .
president_laura_roslin Aquaria... Thomas Zarek. Aerilon... Tom Zarek.
playa_palacios The vote is now 6-5, in favor of Tom Zarek. The next vote will determine our new Vice President. If Zarek gets it, he wins. In the event of a tie, the President will cast the deciding vote.
president_laura_roslin Citizens, I give you your new Vice President, Doctor Gaius !
number_six The perks of power, Mr. Vice President. Were going to do great things together.
dr_gaius_baltar Good, its difficult to fathom I, uh-- I never aspired to power.
number_six Of course you didnt, Gaius but someone had to step up.
dr_gaius_baltar Yeah, well, after what Laura told me—
number_six Laura?
dr_gaius_baltar Yeah, were like on first name basis now. Now, I think, uh, the people-- the people need me, excuse us.
cpt_lee_adama So, um, that bum knee of yours is looking pretty good. And the other ones not too bad either.
captain_kara_thrace Lee, if you wanna ask me to dance, just ask.
cpt_lee_adama You wanna dance?
captain_kara_thrace Me in a dress is a once in a lifetime opportunity.
tom_zarek Madame President.
president_laura_roslin Mister Zarek. Oh, dont worry, I wont be kissing you today.
tom_zarek Thats a shame. I shaved very closely in anticipation of being smacked by you. That was very nicely played. Again. But theres still a Presidential election in six months. Ill see you then.
president_laura_roslin I have no doubt.
tom_zarek Oh, one thing you should know. I didnt kill Valance. I wonder who did.
admiral_william_adama Madame President, good evening.
president_laura_roslin I thought you hated these things.
admiral_william_adama Its colonial day, where else would I be? Im a patriot.
president_laura_roslin You really are, arent you?
admiral_william_adama Doctor ... interesting choice.
president_laura_roslin I figured, the devil you know.
admiral_william_adama Politics. As exciting as war, definitely as dangerous.
president_laura_roslin Though in war, you only get killed once. In politics, it can happen over and over.
admiral_william_adama Youre still standing.
president_laura_roslin So are you.
admiral_william_adama And I can dance!
ellen_tigh I have a surprise for you.
colonel_saul_tigh Uh-oh, should I be worried?
ellen_tigh not unless you consider a day in a luxury suite aboard the Rising Star as something to be worried about.
colonel_saul_tigh What? How did you swing that?
ellen_tigh I have my ways. What you need to do is figure out a way to get slave-driving Bill to give you the day off. And while youre there, you might wanna talk to a few people about your future.
colonel_saul_tigh What?
ellen_tigh Later, my love, it can all wait until later.
captain_karl_agathon Any second, now.
captain_karl_agathon You dont have to say anything, I know. Were gonna make it, Sharon. Okay... go, go, go!
captain_karl_agathon Sharon?
lt_sharon_valerii Helo! Helo... Helo!
