Apollo You all right?
Apollo Adama punches the hell outta Apollo
Adama You all right?
Helo Stop, dont come any closer!
Caprica_Boomer Just do it.
Starbuck Ahh, Lee... ahh, Lee...
Boomer Oh, god...
Dualla Attention: Pass the word for Lt. Valerii. Lt. Valerii, report to the ready room for pre-flight briefing.
Adama you dont lose control.
Apollo Thanks.
Adama No. You gotta lose control. Let your instincts take over.
Apollo I thought we were just sparring.
Adama Thats why you dont win.
Roslin The doctor said I have six months, at the outside. He said the cancers moved into my lymphatic system... aggressively moved in.
Elosha I want you to hear me on this.
Roslin Hmm?
Elosha You made a true believer out of me. Strange as that sounds, considering. And I believe. I know youre the one to lead us to our salvation. You are going to guide us to Earth.
Roslin Then wed better find it soon.
Gaeta Im out.
Apollo Its not your turn.
Gaeta Frankly, I dont care-- no, no, thank you, doctor, I have a launch later. So, crashdown, ensign davis...?
Crashdwon What? Yknow, little bit of this, little bit of that...
Apollo Cmon, you guys always play this slow--
Crashdown Wait, what did you say?
Gaeta Are they real?
Crashdown Dont distract me about the ensign davis...
Apollo Uncanny, uncanny, I know. All right, 20 I call and I raise you another 30.
Baltar You cant compete with me! I always win.
Apollo Well, Im sorry.
#6 Never seen you like this, Gaius. Its disappointing, somehow. Common.
Baltar So sorry to disappoint you. Disappoint you all. 30... and I call it, so.
Gaeta All right, what you got, boys?
Dualla What do we got?
Crashdown Absolutely nothing.
Gaeta Not good, compared to that.
Dualla Oh!
Crashdown Ahh! No! Everytime you win!
Dualla Everytime!
Baltar Sorry, I have to do it, I-- sorry! Very sorry to disappoint you.
Starbuck What, theres a card game and no one told me?
Crashdown Shes back on her feet, ladies and gentlemen!
Starbuck Gaius... how you feeling?
Baltar Good. Mr. Vice President, if you dont mind, Lt. Thrace. Some level of decorum has to be maintained, after all or is it a pirate ship youre running?
Starbuck No, just a Battlestar, sir.
Gaeta Right, lets play.
Baltar Would you like to play? Maybe youd like to sit next to Captain Adama.
Apollo Sure, Kara, why dont you pull up a pew?
Starbuck No, its okay, Lee, I got things to do.
Roslin All right, currency. While bartering will continue for the foreseeable future, we do have a system in place now to take the economy back to a currency-based standard.
#6 Do you love her?
Baltar Did you, um...
Roslin Dr. Baltar... if something should happen to me, it is vital that you comprehend and are familiar with the political structures that are just beginning to fall into place here. Do you understand this?
#6 Answer me!
Baltar Yes, of course, I understand. My answer is no. No, I dont think that I can handle this right now the-- the intricacies of the bureaucracy, I cant get my head around, uh, this, which, with all due respect, Madam President you have spent your entire political career uh, learning to understand. More to the point, how you could think that my head could be turned so quickly by-- by a new thing is, uh, it just-- it astounds me. How did you-- how did you seriously think that I was gonna be able to cope with this kind of responsibility?
#6 I dont believe you.
Roslin Youre a genius, are you not?
Baltar Well, quite frankly, I dont give a flying frak whether you believe me or not, all right? Because Ive had it, I am... Im tired of being pushed and prodded around like Im some kind of toy. Im not your plaything!
#6_and_Roslin Plaything?
Baltar I dont work for you and uh, quite frankly, I dont have to sit any more and take this kind of abuse from either of you! You either-- either in here, either in there, wherever it is, I dont need to take it.
#6 I love you, Gaius.
Baltar Oh, do me a favor...
Roslin I think perhaps, you need a break from this.
Baltar Youre right. We need a break.
Baltar Id like to be alone, if you dont mind. Ahhh!
#6 How can you love her, Gaius? I dont! You cant lie to me, I know everything you know.
Baltar Oh, thats lovely. Oh, thank you. Did you, uh... did you want something in particular this time?
#6 I thought you should know that its not safe to remain on Galactica.
Baltar What are you talking about?
#6 Its a surprise.
Baltar Tell me, what is it? What is it?! Is it a bomb, another cylon bomb, right? Is it an agent? Is a cylon agent about to be activated? Tell me!
Boomer Galactica, this is raptor one, preparing to jump to sector 728. Lets hope we find some supplies out there.
Gaeta Roger that, good hunting out there.
Boomer Crash, count our spinner.
Crashdown F.T.L. Drive spun up and ready... jumping. Five, four, three, two, one.
Crashdown Whoa, baby!
Boomer Frak me! Gaeta, that fraking idiot. She pilots the raptor out of danger
Boomer You cant plan a jump that close to a planet what if we jumped into the damn thing?
Crashdown Oh, that was great, its fine, we made it, were cool. Are you seeing this?
Boomer Yeah.
Crashdown Oceans... continents. Let me at this thing. Okay, atmosphere reads as... nitrogen/oxygen. Looks like enough CO2 for green leafy things, too, Im starting to get excited here, Boomer. Boomer, this could it, this could be the big one this is the little planet that solves all of our problems. Boomer... do you think this is Earth?
Boomer No, its not Earth. Its more important than that.
Caprica_Boomer Doesnt really work as well as before, huh? You know, I do get cold. There are some things you should know, Helo.
Helo Dont call me that. Youre not even Sharon, youre not even human. So dont start acting like you know me, because you dont!
Caprica_Boomer But I am Sharon and thats part of what you need to understand.
Helo Sharon was a friend of mine. Whatever twisted thing you are, you are not Sharon, you got that? The only thing I want from you is a way off this fraked-up world, thats it!
Apollo Going hunting?
Starbuck Im adding a gunnery run to the jump test tomorrow, see if our boy here can shoot anything with our ammo.
Apollo So its a boy now.
Starbuck Changed my mind.
Apollo You ever wonder why everyone calls it a she but to you its a he?
Starbuck Its fascinating, Lee, you should write a paper.
Apollo Well, its not really my scene. Im not as smart as, say, um, Dr. Baltar. How is the Vice President, by the way?
Starbuck I dont know, havent seen him.
Apollo So hes a love em and leave em kinda guy, I guess.
Starbuck I guess.
Apollo Ships that just pass in the night.
Starbuck Yup.
Apollo Didnt mean a thing?
Starbuck Nope.
Apollo Just bored, something to do. So fraking the vice President of the colonies just seemed like a great way to waste some time.
Starbuck You want something from me?
Apollo Not a thing.
Starbuck Cause I dont owe you anything.
Apollo No, you dont owe me anything cause Im just a C.A.G. And youre just a pilot.
Starbuck Right.
Apollo Pilot who cant keep her pants on.
Starbuck Right.
Apollo Oh, it is just like old times, Kara. Like when you got drunk and you couldnt keep your hands off that major from wherever--
Apollo Whyd you do it, Kara? Just tell me why.
Starbuck Cause Im a screw-up, Lee, try and keep that in mind.
Billy So commander Adama is sending out another raptor to conduct an aerial survey of this planet. Uh, it appears to have suffered some sort of a calamity, but it could actually be inhabitable. The aerial survey shows evidence of at least one city on the surface. It was obviously abandoned a long time ago.
Roslin How old are the ruins?
Billy Uh, well, we wont know for sure until they send a ground team but the initial estimates have it, uh, on the order of approximately 2,000 years.
Elosha Thats around the time the 13 tribes first left Kobol.
Roslin Let me see. Ruins, what ruins? This is an inhabited city. Look at the buildings.
Elosha Buildings?
Roslin Look...
Elosha What did you see? Tell me, Laura.
Roslin A dome-like structure with six roads leading out of it, like spokes. With something around it like columns, like a forum like the forum on Caprica, actually.
Elosha The forum and the opera house in the city of the gods. on Kobol. This planet is Kobol.
Billy Kobol, like... Kobol?
Elosha Birthplace of mankind. Where the gods and men lived in paradise until the exodus of the 13 tribes.
Billy Madam President, whats going on?
Roslin Its real. The scriptures, the myths, the prophecies, theyre all real.
Elosha So say we all.
Baltar Hello, lieutenant?
Boomer Hey, doc.
Baltar This is a bad time, right?
Boomer No, uh, Im just cleaning my gun. Whats going on?
Baltar Well, I was gonna ask you the same question. Actually, I was looking for Lt. Thrace but, uh... sometimes its good to talk these things over.
#6 Deep down she knows shes a cylon. But her conscious mind wont accept it.
Boomer Sometimes I have these dark thoughts.
Baltar What kind of dark thoughts?
#6 Her model is weak. Always has been. But, in the end, shell carry out her mission.
Baltar I dont know. But Im afraid Im gonna hurt someone. Feel like I have to be stopped.
#6 She cant be stopped, shes a cylon. You cant help her, Gaius. But you could probably sleep with her. Thats what you want, right?
Baltar Im not sure what-- sometimes, uh, we must embrace that which opens up for us.
Boomer Embrace?
Baltar Life can be a curse, as well as a blessing. You will believe me when I tell you, there are far worse things than death, in this world.
Boomer So youre saying--
Baltar No, no, no, uh... what I say is meaningless. Listen to your heart. Embrace that which you know to be the right decision.
Adama You might be right, this may be Kobol. I think we should seriously consider permanent settlement on this planet.
Roslin The scriptures tell us that Kobol points the way to Earth.
Adama Organize a ground survey team, three raptors. I want a complete survey of the ruins immediately.
Apollo Yes, sir.
#6 You should go. Remember what I said, Gaius. You dont wanna be here when it happens.
Baltar When what happens-- what would happen if I go? Uh, in fact, I think Im going to volunteer for the survey party.
Adama Your presence wont be necessary, Doctor, thank you.
Baltar I am the vice President of the colonies, elected in my own right and I feel that my presence on the planet will be necessary, Commander. As your chief science advisor, Im expected to analyze all of the samples the team bring back and quite frankly, itll be far more efficient if I can gather the samples by myself. Unless you have any objection, Madam President.
Roslin No objections, thank you. We need to talk.
Adama Sure.
Tyrol You okay?
Boomer What do you think?
Tyrol I think its hard to imagine that you forgot to check the chamber.
Boomer I didnt forget.
Tyrol Sharon... whats going on? I know things havent been so great lately but--
Boomer I wake up in the morning and I wonder who I am. I wake up and wonder if Im gonna hurt someone.
Tyrol Sharon, you need help.
Boomer Not from you, you made that clear. Im on my own.
Tyrol No, youre not.
Boomer Thanks for coming out, Chief. Youre dismissed.
Roslin So, according to the scriptures, if we had the Arrow of Apollo we could take it down to Kobol and we could use it to open the tomb of Athena and find our way to Earth.
Adama I didnt know you were that religious.
Roslin Neither did I. Something wrong with that?
Adama No. Its just new. There is no Earth, you understand that.
Roslin It would seem that we were wrong. Commander, just because you and I dont know where it is doesnt mean it doesnt exist.
Adama Madam President, Im not trying to mock your faith, so please understand me. These stories about Kobol, gods, the Arrow of Apollo... theyre just stories, legends, myths. Dont let it blind you to the reality that we face.
Roslin Reality is that the cylon raider has been successfully jump-tested. Reality is that cylon technology obviously outstrips our own, and reality is, there is a good chance the raider can jump all the way back to Caprica and retrieve that arrow and find our way to Earth, the real Earth.
Adama The raiders a military asset. Im not gonna use it to go chasing some mythical arrow. Im sorry.
Raptor_2_Pilot I say we find Kobol, we count our blessings and stay there.
Raptor_3_Pilot Yeah, but the sacred scrolls tell us that this could guide us to Earth, right, l-t?
Raptor_1_pilot Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, cut the chatter. Raptors two and three, on me...
Crashdown F.L.T. Spun up and ready.
Tyrol Cally, hold onto your lunch.
Crashdown Jump in ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one... jump complete, gentlemen.
Raptor_3_ECO Bring the nose down, we should see the planet directly ahead.
Raptor_3_Pilot What the hell is that? Oh, my gods!
Crashdown Theyre everywhere--
Tyrol Get us out of here!
Crashdown Cmon, we got a fire in the turbine!
Raptor_1_Pilot Shutting it down!
Baltar Pilot down, pilot down!
Crashdown Out of the way, cmon doc out of the way!
Crashdown everybody, hang on... hang on, hang on!
Tyrol Can you jump us out?
Crashdown No, F.T.L. Drives been hit.
Tyrol Socinus, get on the horn now and tell raptor two to jump back to Galactica! Like, right now! Get us out of here!
Socinus Raptor two, Raptor two... you are ordered to jump back to Galactica, over. You are ordered to jump back to Galactica!
Gaeta Whenever theyre within a certain proximity to one another, they send off a short I.F.F. Burst. Essentially, theyre cylon transponders programmed to identify themselves as any other cylon transponder.
Tigh Damn nice work, lieutenant.
Adama Thats very good. Now that we know what they are, I wanna test one in the raider.
Dualla Dradis contact, Raptor 275, sir.
Tigh Back early.
Adama Somethings wrong.
Tyrol What the hell are you doing?!
Baltar Oh, god!
Crashdown Hang on, hang on...
Baltar oh, my god... god, god, god, god...
Tyrol Look!
Crashdown Everybody hit the deck!
Crashdown I cant see!
Tyrol Pull it up, pull it up!
Tyrol Watch the hill! Watch it!
Crashdown Thanks Cheif! Wooooo!!!
Roslin How many did we lose?
Apollo Ten souls aboard aptor three. Raptor one, last visual contact was seen under powered flight, heading toward the surface. Adama: We need a way to take out the baseship before we can attempt a rescue.
Tigh Starbucks already working on a plan using the captured raider to get a nuke into the baseship.
Roslin The raider?
Apollo When-- when did this happen?
Tigh About ten minutes ago. She said shes working on the details and will have a report at 14:00.
Adama Go talk to Starbuck right away.
Apollo My pleasure.
Adama And report back to me.
Apollo Yes, sir.
Billy Is there something I should be worried about, Madam President?
Roslin Why do you ask that?
Billy That look on your face.
Roslin Not now.
Starbuck Hey, guys, take that out. I know the chief said we need it but I dont need it--
Apollo Lt. Thrace, atten-tion. Lt. Thrace, I gave you a command you will obey it. Atten... tion! You do not take your harebrained ideas to the X.O. Without going through me first, do you understand?
Starbuck Yes, sir.
Apollo At ease, so whats the plan?
Starbuck Im putting an autopilot in the raider. Jump him to the baseship, engage the autopilot, punch out get picked up by a raptor. The raider heads to the baseship. Picks up the transponder, allows the raider to approach, nuke goes off. Boom, sir.
Apollo Might work. Might get you killed.
Starbuck Would you miss me, sir?
Apollo I need every pilot I have. Even the screw-ups.
Starbuck Captain... Im really sorry.
Billy If you do this, it could threaten everything that weve accomplished. It will probably bring down the government and you dont have a right to risk that for a...
Roslin Go on.
Billy For a drug-induced vision of prophecy.
Roslin I am well aware of that. But it would seem that the gods have a different plan. Would you please get me Lt. Thrace?
Billy Can I get you some more water?
Roslin Yes, thanks.
Starbuck You cant be serious.
Roslin All of this has happened before and all of this will happen again. The cylon you interrogated, he quoted that bit of scripture. He also said that we would find Kobol and Kobol would show us the way, did he not?
Starbuck Yes, he did.
Roslin Well, we have found Kobol. Do you believe in the gods, Lieutenant?
Starbuck Not that its any of your business, but, yes, I believe.
Roslin Lieutenant, Im not trying to put you on the defensive, I just-- I would like you to think this through with me. If you believe in the gods, then you believe in the cycle of time, that we are all playing our parts in a story that is told again, and again, and again, throughout eternity.
Starbuck Thats the way I was raised. But that doesnt mean that my part in the story is to go off on some crazy-ass mission against orders.
Roslin May I tell you the part of the story that it would seem, I am playing? I am dying.
Starbuck What?
Roslin I have terminal breast cancer. I have six months at the outside to live and Ive only told three people so I would appreciate it if you kept it to yourself.
Starbuck Of course. Are you saying that youre--
Roslin The scriptures tell us that a dying leader led humanity to the promised land. If you go back to Caprica and bring me the arrow, I will show us the way.
Starbuck This is crazy.
Roslin You keep using that word. It is crazy, perhaps. But it doesnt mean it isnt true. And it may be our only chance, our only chance to find Earth.
Starbuck The old man is our last chance to find Earth. He knows where it is, he said so, you were there. The location is a secret but he is going to take us there.
Roslin Commander Adama has no idea where Earth is. He never did, he made it up in order to give people hope.
Starbuck Youre lying.
Roslin Go ask him.
Starbuck I will.
Starbuck Im gonna need one more in-flight test for the autopilot and nav systems before we jump for Kobol.
Adama Right.
Starbuck Can I ask you a question, boss?
Adama Shoot.
Starbuck How much longer til we reach Earth?
Adama Its hard to say.
Starbuck You got a guess?
Adama You know I dont like to guess.
Starbuck We getting closer?
Adama Im sure we are. Good luck on the next test.
Starbuck Apollo/Starbuck, Im ready over here.
Apollo Okay, Starbuck, the board is green.
Starbuck Copy that. Powering up for the autopilot test. This is Starbuck, request permission to speak with Galactica actual.
Dualla Starbuck wants to speak to you, sir. Shes-- shes on a scrambled channel.
Adama Go ahead.
Starbuck I believed you, believed in Earth.
Adama What are you doing, starbuck?
Starbuck Bringing home the cat, sir.
Adama We can talk about this.
Starbuck No, I dont think so.
Adama I want you to, remember one thing. I do not regret anything that I did. Be sure that whatever youre gonna do, you dont regret it later, do you understand me?
Starbuck I guess well find out.
Gaeta Commander, shes spinning up the raiders F.T.L. Drive.
Tigh What? This is an autopilot test, what the hell is she doing?
Apollo What are you doing, Kara?
Apollo Galactica/Apollo, she just jumped away. Repeat, Starbuck and the raider just jumped away.
Tigh She wasnt scheduled for a jump test. Where the hell did she go?
Adama Home.
