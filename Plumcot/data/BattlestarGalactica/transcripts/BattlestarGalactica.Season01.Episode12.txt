cpt_lee_adama You all right?
cpt_lee_adama Adama punches the hell outta Apollo
admiral_william_adama You all right?
captain_karl_agathon Stop, dont come any closer!
lt_sharon_valerii Just do it.
captain_kara_thrace Ahh, Lee... ahh, Lee...
lt_sharon_valerii Oh, god...
officer_anastasia_dualla Attention: Pass the word for Lt. Valerii. Lt. Valerii, report to the ready room for pre-flight briefing.
admiral_william_adama you dont lose control.
cpt_lee_adama Thanks.
admiral_william_adama No. You gotta lose control. Let your instincts take over.
cpt_lee_adama I thought we were just sparring.
admiral_william_adama Thats why you dont win.
president_laura_roslin The doctor said I have six months, at the outside. He said the cancers moved into my lymphatic system... aggressively moved in.
elosha I want you to hear me on this.
president_laura_roslin Hmm?
elosha You made a true believer out of me. Strange as that sounds, considering. And I believe. I know youre the one to lead us to our salvation. You are going to guide us to Earth.
president_laura_roslin Then wed better find it soon.
lt_felix_gaeta Im out.
cpt_lee_adama Its not your turn.
lt_felix_gaeta Frankly, I dont care-- no, no, thank you, doctor, I have a launch later. So, crashdown, ensign davis...?
Crashdwon#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode12 What? Yknow, little bit of this, little bit of that...
cpt_lee_adama Cmon, you guys always play this slow--
crashdown Wait, what did you say?
lt_felix_gaeta Are they real?
crashdown Dont distract me about the ensign davis...
cpt_lee_adama Uncanny, uncanny, I know. All right, 20 I call and I raise you another 30.
dr_gaius_baltar You cant compete with me! I always win.
cpt_lee_adama Well, Im sorry.
number_six Never seen you like this, Gaius. Its disappointing, somehow. Common.
dr_gaius_baltar So sorry to disappoint you. Disappoint you all. 30... and I call it, so.
lt_felix_gaeta All right, what you got, boys?
officer_anastasia_dualla What do we got?
crashdown Absolutely nothing.
lt_felix_gaeta Not good, compared to that.
officer_anastasia_dualla Oh!
crashdown Ahh! No! Everytime you win!
officer_anastasia_dualla Everytime!
dr_gaius_baltar Sorry, I have to do it, I-- sorry! Very sorry to disappoint you.
captain_kara_thrace What, theres a card game and no one told me?
crashdown Shes back on her feet, ladies and gentlemen!
captain_kara_thrace Gaius... how you feeling?
dr_gaius_baltar Good. Mr. Vice President, if you dont mind, Lt. Thrace. Some level of decorum has to be maintained, after all or is it a pirate ship youre running?
captain_kara_thrace No, just a Battlestar, sir.
lt_felix_gaeta Right, lets play.
dr_gaius_baltar Would you like to play? Maybe youd like to sit next to Captain Adama.
cpt_lee_adama Sure, Kara, why dont you pull up a pew?
captain_kara_thrace No, its okay, Lee, I got things to do.
president_laura_roslin All right, currency. While bartering will continue for the foreseeable future, we do have a system in place now to take the economy back to a currency-based standard.
number_six Do you love her?
dr_gaius_baltar Did you, um...
president_laura_roslin Dr. Baltar... if something should happen to me, it is vital that you comprehend and are familiar with the political structures that are just beginning to fall into place here. Do you understand this?
number_six Answer me!
dr_gaius_baltar Yes, of course, I understand. My answer is no. No, I dont think that I can handle this right now the-- the intricacies of the bureaucracy, I cant get my head around, uh, this, which, with all due respect, Madam President you have spent your entire political career uh, learning to understand. More to the point, how you could think that my head could be turned so quickly by-- by a new thing is, uh, it just-- it astounds me. How did you-- how did you seriously think that I was gonna be able to cope with this kind of responsibility?
number_six I dont believe you.
president_laura_roslin Youre a genius, are you not?
dr_gaius_baltar Well, quite frankly, I dont give a flying frak whether you believe me or not, all right? Because Ive had it, I am... Im tired of being pushed and prodded around like Im some kind of toy. Im not your plaything!
#6_and_Roslin#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode12 Plaything?
dr_gaius_baltar I dont work for you and uh, quite frankly, I dont have to sit any more and take this kind of abuse from either of you! You either-- either in here, either in there, wherever it is, I dont need to take it.
number_six I love you, Gaius.
dr_gaius_baltar Oh, do me a favor...
president_laura_roslin I think perhaps, you need a break from this.
dr_gaius_baltar Youre right. We need a break.
dr_gaius_baltar Id like to be alone, if you dont mind. Ahhh!
number_six How can you love her, Gaius? I dont! You cant lie to me, I know everything you know.
dr_gaius_baltar Oh, thats lovely. Oh, thank you. Did you, uh... did you want something in particular this time?
number_six I thought you should know that its not safe to remain on Galactica.
dr_gaius_baltar What are you talking about?
number_six Its a surprise.
dr_gaius_baltar Tell me, what is it? What is it?! Is it a bomb, another cylon bomb, right? Is it an agent? Is a cylon agent about to be activated? Tell me!
lt_sharon_valerii Galactica, this is raptor one, preparing to jump to sector 728. Lets hope we find some supplies out there.
lt_felix_gaeta Roger that, good hunting out there.
lt_sharon_valerii Crash, count our spinner.
crashdown F.T.L. Drive spun up and ready... jumping. Five, four, three, two, one.
crashdown Whoa, baby!
lt_sharon_valerii Frak me! Gaeta, that fraking idiot. She pilots the raptor out of danger
lt_sharon_valerii You cant plan a jump that close to a planet what if we jumped into the damn thing?
crashdown Oh, that was great, its fine, we made it, were cool. Are you seeing this?
lt_sharon_valerii Yeah.
crashdown Oceans... continents. Let me at this thing. Okay, atmosphere reads as... nitrogen/oxygen. Looks like enough CO2 for green leafy things, too, Im starting to get excited here, Boomer. Boomer, this could it, this could be the big one this is the little planet that solves all of our problems. Boomer... do you think this is Earth?
lt_sharon_valerii No, its not Earth. Its more important than that.
lt_sharon_valerii Doesnt really work as well as before, huh? You know, I do get cold. There are some things you should know, Helo.
captain_karl_agathon Dont call me that. Youre not even Sharon, youre not even human. So dont start acting like you know me, because you dont!
lt_sharon_valerii But I am Sharon and thats part of what you need to understand.
captain_karl_agathon Sharon was a friend of mine. Whatever twisted thing you are, you are not Sharon, you got that? The only thing I want from you is a way off this fraked-up world, thats it!
cpt_lee_adama Going hunting?
captain_kara_thrace Im adding a gunnery run to the jump test tomorrow, see if our boy here can shoot anything with our ammo.
cpt_lee_adama So its a boy now.
captain_kara_thrace Changed my mind.
cpt_lee_adama You ever wonder why everyone calls it a she but to you its a he?
captain_kara_thrace Its fascinating, Lee, you should write a paper.
cpt_lee_adama Well, its not really my scene. Im not as smart as, say, um, Dr. Baltar. How is the Vice President, by the way?
captain_kara_thrace I dont know, havent seen him.
cpt_lee_adama So hes a love em and leave em kinda guy, I guess.
captain_kara_thrace I guess.
cpt_lee_adama Ships that just pass in the night.
captain_kara_thrace Yup.
cpt_lee_adama Didnt mean a thing?
captain_kara_thrace Nope.
cpt_lee_adama Just bored, something to do. So fraking the vice President of the colonies just seemed like a great way to waste some time.
captain_kara_thrace You want something from me?
cpt_lee_adama Not a thing.
captain_kara_thrace Cause I dont owe you anything.
cpt_lee_adama No, you dont owe me anything cause Im just a C.A.G. And youre just a pilot.
captain_kara_thrace Right.
cpt_lee_adama Pilot who cant keep her pants on.
captain_kara_thrace Right.
cpt_lee_adama Oh, it is just like old times, Kara. Like when you got drunk and you couldnt keep your hands off that major from wherever--
cpt_lee_adama Whyd you do it, Kara? Just tell me why.
captain_kara_thrace Cause Im a screw-up, Lee, try and keep that in mind.
billy_keikeya So commander Adama is sending out another raptor to conduct an aerial survey of this planet. Uh, it appears to have suffered some sort of a calamity, but it could actually be inhabitable. The aerial survey shows evidence of at least one city on the surface. It was obviously abandoned a long time ago.
president_laura_roslin How old are the ruins?
billy_keikeya Uh, well, we wont know for sure until they send a ground team but the initial estimates have it, uh, on the order of approximately 2,000 years.
elosha Thats around the time the 13 tribes first left Kobol.
president_laura_roslin Let me see. Ruins, what ruins? This is an inhabited city. Look at the buildings.
elosha Buildings?
president_laura_roslin Look...
elosha What did you see? Tell me, Laura.
president_laura_roslin A dome-like structure with six roads leading out of it, like spokes. With something around it like columns, like a forum like the forum on Caprica, actually.
elosha The forum and the opera house in the city of the gods. on Kobol. This planet is Kobol.
billy_keikeya Kobol, like... Kobol?
elosha Birthplace of mankind. Where the gods and men lived in paradise until the exodus of the 13 tribes.
billy_keikeya Madam President, whats going on?
president_laura_roslin Its real. The scriptures, the myths, the prophecies, theyre all real.
elosha So say we all.
dr_gaius_baltar Hello, lieutenant?
lt_sharon_valerii Hey, doc.
dr_gaius_baltar This is a bad time, right?
lt_sharon_valerii No, uh, Im just cleaning my gun. Whats going on?
dr_gaius_baltar Well, I was gonna ask you the same question. Actually, I was looking for Lt. Thrace but, uh... sometimes its good to talk these things over.
number_six Deep down she knows shes a cylon. But her conscious mind wont accept it.
lt_sharon_valerii Sometimes I have these dark thoughts.
dr_gaius_baltar What kind of dark thoughts?
number_six Her model is weak. Always has been. But, in the end, shell carry out her mission.
dr_gaius_baltar I dont know. But Im afraid Im gonna hurt someone. Feel like I have to be stopped.
number_six She cant be stopped, shes a cylon. You cant help her, Gaius. But you could probably sleep with her. Thats what you want, right?
dr_gaius_baltar Im not sure what-- sometimes, uh, we must embrace that which opens up for us.
lt_sharon_valerii Embrace?
dr_gaius_baltar Life can be a curse, as well as a blessing. You will believe me when I tell you, there are far worse things than death, in this world.
lt_sharon_valerii So youre saying--
dr_gaius_baltar No, no, no, uh... what I say is meaningless. Listen to your heart. Embrace that which you know to be the right decision.
admiral_william_adama You might be right, this may be Kobol. I think we should seriously consider permanent settlement on this planet.
president_laura_roslin The scriptures tell us that Kobol points the way to Earth.
admiral_william_adama Organize a ground survey team, three raptors. I want a complete survey of the ruins immediately.
cpt_lee_adama Yes, sir.
number_six You should go. Remember what I said, Gaius. You dont wanna be here when it happens.
dr_gaius_baltar When what happens-- what would happen if I go? Uh, in fact, I think Im going to volunteer for the survey party.
admiral_william_adama Your presence wont be necessary, Doctor, thank you.
dr_gaius_baltar I am the vice President of the colonies, elected in my own right and I feel that my presence on the planet will be necessary, Commander. As your chief science advisor, Im expected to analyze all of the samples the team bring back and quite frankly, itll be far more efficient if I can gather the samples by myself. Unless you have any objection, Madam President.
president_laura_roslin No objections, thank you. We need to talk.
admiral_william_adama Sure.
chief_galen_tyrol You okay?
lt_sharon_valerii What do you think?
chief_galen_tyrol I think its hard to imagine that you forgot to check the chamber.
lt_sharon_valerii I didnt forget.
chief_galen_tyrol Sharon... whats going on? I know things havent been so great lately but--
lt_sharon_valerii I wake up in the morning and I wonder who I am. I wake up and wonder if Im gonna hurt someone.
chief_galen_tyrol Sharon, you need help.
lt_sharon_valerii Not from you, you made that clear. Im on my own.
chief_galen_tyrol No, youre not.
lt_sharon_valerii Thanks for coming out, Chief. Youre dismissed.
president_laura_roslin So, according to the scriptures, if we had the Arrow of Apollo we could take it down to Kobol and we could use it to open the tomb of Athena and find our way to Earth.
admiral_william_adama I didnt know you were that religious.
president_laura_roslin Neither did I. Something wrong with that?
admiral_william_adama No. Its just new. There is no Earth, you understand that.
president_laura_roslin It would seem that we were wrong. Commander, just because you and I dont know where it is doesnt mean it doesnt exist.
admiral_william_adama Madam President, Im not trying to mock your faith, so please understand me. These stories about Kobol, gods, the Arrow of Apollo... theyre just stories, legends, myths. Dont let it blind you to the reality that we face.
president_laura_roslin Reality is that the cylon raider has been successfully jump-tested. Reality is that cylon technology obviously outstrips our own, and reality is, there is a good chance the raider can jump all the way back to Caprica and retrieve that arrow and find our way to Earth, the real Earth.
admiral_william_adama The raiders a military asset. Im not gonna use it to go chasing some mythical arrow. Im sorry.
Raptor_2_Pilot#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode12 I say we find Kobol, we count our blessings and stay there.
Raptor_3_Pilot#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode12 Yeah, but the sacred scrolls tell us that this could guide us to Earth, right, l-t?
Raptor_1_pilot#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode12 Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, cut the chatter. Raptors two and three, on me...
crashdown F.L.T. Spun up and ready.
chief_galen_tyrol Cally, hold onto your lunch.
crashdown Jump in ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one... jump complete, gentlemen.
Raptor_3_ECO#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode12 Bring the nose down, we should see the planet directly ahead.
Raptor_3_Pilot#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode12 What the hell is that? Oh, my gods!
crashdown Theyre everywhere--
chief_galen_tyrol Get us out of here!
crashdown Cmon, we got a fire in the turbine!
Raptor_1_Pilot#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode12 Shutting it down!
dr_gaius_baltar Pilot down, pilot down!
crashdown Out of the way, cmon doc out of the way!
crashdown everybody, hang on... hang on, hang on!
chief_galen_tyrol Can you jump us out?
crashdown No, F.T.L. Drives been hit.
chief_galen_tyrol Socinus, get on the horn now and tell raptor two to jump back to Galactica! Like, right now! Get us out of here!
crewman_specialist_socinus Raptor two, Raptor two... you are ordered to jump back to Galactica, over. You are ordered to jump back to Galactica!
lt_felix_gaeta Whenever theyre within a certain proximity to one another, they send off a short I.F.F. Burst. Essentially, theyre cylon transponders programmed to identify themselves as any other cylon transponder.
colonel_saul_tigh Damn nice work, lieutenant.
admiral_william_adama Thats very good. Now that we know what they are, I wanna test one in the raider.
officer_anastasia_dualla Dradis contact, Raptor 275, sir.
colonel_saul_tigh Back early.
admiral_william_adama Somethings wrong.
chief_galen_tyrol What the hell are you doing?!
dr_gaius_baltar Oh, god!
crashdown Hang on, hang on...
dr_gaius_baltar oh, my god... god, god, god, god...
chief_galen_tyrol Look!
crashdown Everybody hit the deck!
crashdown I cant see!
chief_galen_tyrol Pull it up, pull it up!
chief_galen_tyrol Watch the hill! Watch it!
crashdown Thanks Cheif! Wooooo!!!
president_laura_roslin How many did we lose?
cpt_lee_adama Ten souls aboard aptor three. Raptor one, last visual contact was seen under powered flight, heading toward the surface. Adama: We need a way to take out the baseship before we can attempt a rescue.
colonel_saul_tigh Starbucks already working on a plan using the captured raider to get a nuke into the baseship.
president_laura_roslin The raider?
cpt_lee_adama When-- when did this happen?
colonel_saul_tigh About ten minutes ago. She said shes working on the details and will have a report at 14:00.
admiral_william_adama Go talk to Starbuck right away.
cpt_lee_adama My pleasure.
admiral_william_adama And report back to me.
cpt_lee_adama Yes, sir.
billy_keikeya Is there something I should be worried about, Madam President?
president_laura_roslin Why do you ask that?
billy_keikeya That look on your face.
president_laura_roslin Not now.
captain_kara_thrace Hey, guys, take that out. I know the chief said we need it but I dont need it--
cpt_lee_adama Lt. Thrace, atten-tion. Lt. Thrace, I gave you a command you will obey it. Atten... tion! You do not take your harebrained ideas to the X.O. Without going through me first, do you understand?
captain_kara_thrace Yes, sir.
cpt_lee_adama At ease, so whats the plan?
captain_kara_thrace Im putting an autopilot in the raider. Jump him to the baseship, engage the autopilot, punch out get picked up by a raptor. The raider heads to the baseship. Picks up the transponder, allows the raider to approach, nuke goes off. Boom, sir.
cpt_lee_adama Might work. Might get you killed.
captain_kara_thrace Would you miss me, sir?
cpt_lee_adama I need every pilot I have. Even the screw-ups.
captain_kara_thrace Captain... Im really sorry.
billy_keikeya If you do this, it could threaten everything that weve accomplished. It will probably bring down the government and you dont have a right to risk that for a...
president_laura_roslin Go on.
billy_keikeya For a drug-induced vision of prophecy.
president_laura_roslin I am well aware of that. But it would seem that the gods have a different plan. Would you please get me Lt. Thrace?
billy_keikeya Can I get you some more water?
president_laura_roslin Yes, thanks.
captain_kara_thrace You cant be serious.
president_laura_roslin All of this has happened before and all of this will happen again. The cylon you interrogated, he quoted that bit of scripture. He also said that we would find Kobol and Kobol would show us the way, did he not?
captain_kara_thrace Yes, he did.
president_laura_roslin Well, we have found Kobol. Do you believe in the gods, Lieutenant?
captain_kara_thrace Not that its any of your business, but, yes, I believe.
president_laura_roslin Lieutenant, Im not trying to put you on the defensive, I just-- I would like you to think this through with me. If you believe in the gods, then you believe in the cycle of time, that we are all playing our parts in a story that is told again, and again, and again, throughout eternity.
captain_kara_thrace Thats the way I was raised. But that doesnt mean that my part in the story is to go off on some crazy-ass mission against orders.
president_laura_roslin May I tell you the part of the story that it would seem, I am playing? I am dying.
captain_kara_thrace What?
president_laura_roslin I have terminal breast cancer. I have six months at the outside to live and Ive only told three people so I would appreciate it if you kept it to yourself.
captain_kara_thrace Of course. Are you saying that youre--
president_laura_roslin The scriptures tell us that a dying leader led humanity to the promised land. If you go back to Caprica and bring me the arrow, I will show us the way.
captain_kara_thrace This is crazy.
president_laura_roslin You keep using that word. It is crazy, perhaps. But it doesnt mean it isnt true. And it may be our only chance, our only chance to find Earth.
captain_kara_thrace The old man is our last chance to find Earth. He knows where it is, he said so, you were there. The location is a secret but he is going to take us there.
president_laura_roslin Commander Adama has no idea where Earth is. He never did, he made it up in order to give people hope.
captain_kara_thrace Youre lying.
president_laura_roslin Go ask him.
captain_kara_thrace I will.
captain_kara_thrace Im gonna need one more in-flight test for the autopilot and nav systems before we jump for Kobol.
admiral_william_adama Right.
captain_kara_thrace Can I ask you a question, boss?
admiral_william_adama Shoot.
captain_kara_thrace How much longer til we reach Earth?
admiral_william_adama Its hard to say.
captain_kara_thrace You got a guess?
admiral_william_adama You know I dont like to guess.
captain_kara_thrace We getting closer?
admiral_william_adama Im sure we are. Good luck on the next test.
captain_kara_thrace Apollo/Starbuck, Im ready over here.
cpt_lee_adama Okay, Starbuck, the board is green.
captain_kara_thrace Copy that. Powering up for the autopilot test. This is Starbuck, request permission to speak with Galactica actual.
officer_anastasia_dualla Starbuck wants to speak to you, sir. Shes-- shes on a scrambled channel.
admiral_william_adama Go ahead.
captain_kara_thrace I believed you, believed in Earth.
admiral_william_adama What are you doing, starbuck?
captain_kara_thrace Bringing home the cat, sir.
admiral_william_adama We can talk about this.
captain_kara_thrace No, I dont think so.
admiral_william_adama I want you to, remember one thing. I do not regret anything that I did. Be sure that whatever youre gonna do, you dont regret it later, do you understand me?
captain_kara_thrace I guess well find out.
lt_felix_gaeta Commander, shes spinning up the raiders F.T.L. Drive.
colonel_saul_tigh What? This is an autopilot test, what the hell is she doing?
cpt_lee_adama What are you doing, Kara?
cpt_lee_adama Galactica/Apollo, she just jumped away. Repeat, Starbuck and the raider just jumped away.
colonel_saul_tigh She wasnt scheduled for a jump test. Where the hell did she go?
admiral_william_adama Home.
