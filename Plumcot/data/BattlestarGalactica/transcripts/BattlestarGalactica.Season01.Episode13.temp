Crashdown Everyone! Come on! Come on, move!
Tyrol Everybody up! Cally, up, up, move!
Crashdown Come on, go, go, go! Come on, move! Out, come on!
Tyrol Get them out of the chairs, drag them out!
Crashdown Come on! I got him, I got him!
Tyrol Oh, for gods sakes...
Crashdown I got his legs, I got his legs!
Tyrol I got him! Try it on your shoulder, on your shoulder.
Crashdown Aahh! Doc! Doc, come on, Doc!
Baltar Crash!
Crashdown Doc!
Baltar Crash!
Crashdown Come on, Doc! Doc! Doc!
#6 Take my hand. Gaius, take my hand.
Crashdown Hey, hey, come on, wake up! Stay with me, we gotta go! Stay with me, Doc, come on!  Get down! Get down!
Tyrol Stay down, you guys, stay down, stay down! L.T. You okay? I think thats both tanks. Lets see what we got, get them now!
Selix Aah...
Cally You all right?
Tyrol Get the supplies before they burn up-- go, go!
Cally Right away.
Selix Both tanks, gas is gone, its all gone.
Helo Its a museum, so what?
Caprica_Boomer Its more than that. Its the home of the Arrow of Apollo.
Helo What the hell is that?
Caprica_Boomer You never liked history. Come on, Helo, its supposed to be the only clue as to the location of Earth.
Helo Earth? What are you talking about? Whos going to Earth? It doesnt even exist. Im trying to get back to Galactica. What I need from you is a way off this planet and a way back to my ship, and if you dont do that, Im gonna blow your head off.
Caprica_Boomer Why dont you just shut up for a change? Youre only alive because Ive kept you alive. If it wasnt for me, youd be dead by now. So, whether you like it or not, Im your only hope of getting off this planet. So, if I were you, I would take that tough guy attitude of yours and shove it up your ass. We cant move around the city during daylight. So we hole up and wait til dark.
Tigh Unbelievable. Shes crossed the line before but this is so far beyond the pale--
Adama She wouldnt have done this on her own, she was coerced.
Tigh No one coerces Starbuck. Believe me, Ive tried.
Roslin Commander? I have the President on the line.
Adama Bear witness, put on your headset. Madam President, moments ago, Lt. Thrace took the Cylon raider on an unscheduled and unauthorized, jump.
Roslin Yes.
Adama Do you have any knowledge of this incident?
Roslin Lets save some time here, Commander the question you really want to ask me is whether or not I asked Lt. Thrace to take the raider to Caprica. And the answer to your question is yes.
Adama You and I talked about this.
Roslin Yes, we had.
Adama We both decided it was a military decision.
Roslin My responsibility as President is, first and foremost, to protect and preserve this fleet and its future. In the end, that outweighs any other consideration. It has to.
Adama By taking the raider, youve placed our people on the surface of Kobol in direct danger.
Roslin Im very aware of the danger our men and women are in on Kobol. I am also deeply aware of the danger this civilization will be in if I ignore the pursuit of this arrow.
Adama Im going to have to ask you for your resignation, Madam President.
Roslin No.
Adama Then Im terminating your presidency, as of this moment.
Roslin Commander Adama, I will exercise the authority of  this office until I am unable to do so, so if you want to stage a coup youre gonna have to come over here and arrest me.
Adama I dont want any blood shed.
Roslin Of course you dont, neither do I. Neither does the press. Theyre here, by the way.
Adama the press...
Roslin Theyre recording every minute.
Adama Order the cap to isolate Colonial one. Mr. Gaeta.
Gaeta Sir.
Adama Jam any transmissions in or out of Colonial one immediately.
Gaeta Yes, sir.
Adama Prepare a strike team. As long as shes President, shes dangerous and if she can turn Starbuck against us, shes capable of anything.
Tigh Yes, sir.
Adama Shes bluffing.
Tigh Lets hope so. Theres also a Cylon baseship out there to deal with.
Adama Leave that to me.
Roslin This government survived a Cylon attack, it will survive William Adama. I think hes bluffing. But just in case, we need to be prepared.
Apollo I know their security detail, they will defend that ship. Well have to take her down compartment by compartment.
Adama Mr. Gaeta.
Gaeta Sir?
Adama Am I correct in assuming that I have two Cylon transponders left?
Gaeta Yes, sir, but only one of them is fully functional.
Adama One will do. Now I need a pilot.
Boomer Sir.
Adama As you were. How you feeling?
Boomer It looks worse than it is, sir.
Adama Things are moving very quickly and I need every pilot.
Boomer Im ready, sir.
Adama I have a very special mission for you and I wont kid around. Its high risk, extremely high risk. Understand. I need you to light-jump to Kobol and take care of this basestar. Were placing a Cylon transponder aboard your raptor. In theory, it should allow you to approach the basestar without getting fired upon.
Boomer But well still be IDd as colonial raptors once were in visual range.
Adama For all they know, you could be two Cylon agents returning with a captured raptor. once youre inside the defense perimeter, I need you to make them think you wanna dock. You have to fire your nuke into the loading bay, then jump back home immediately. Do you understand?
Boomer I understand. I can do it, sir, I know I can.
Adama You have to.
Boomer Yes, sir.
Starbuck Oh, this doesnt look good. Please tell me this was not all for nothing.
Starbuck Oh, Im good. I am really good. Im home. Im home. okay, Gaeta. Please tell me that youre right about this transponder thing.
Helo Stop! Stop that.
Caprica_Boomer Im nervous.
Helo Like anything scares you.
Caprica_Boomer Things scare me, Helo, I have feelings.
Helo You-- you have software.
Caprica_Boomer I dont know if you can hear this or not, Helo, but what we had between us was important. It was very important.
Helo Why?
Caprica_Boomer Because it was the next step. Because it brings us closer to god.
Helo Dont mock the gods, okay? Its a human belief, Im human, theyre our gods.
Caprica_Boomer But, beyond that, I just want you to know that I genuinely feel something for you.
Helo I dont care. I dont love you. I loved what I thought was you.
Caprica_Boomer Helo, I think theres something else that you should know. Im pregnant.
Apollo Galactica/Apollo. We have visual I.D. on Colonial one.
Adama Tell Apollo hes clear to begin the assault. Contact us when he has soft seal on the hull.
Dualla Aye, sir. Commander... Boomer and Racetrack are in the air, ready for their jump to Kobol.
Adama Put them through down here. Boomer, Galactica Actual. Just wanted to say good luck, good hunting and I have complete faith in the both of you.
Boomer Thank you, actual. We wont let you down. Racetrack, start the jump clock.
Racetrack Clock is running.
Apollo Galactica/Apollo, we have soft seal.
Roslin I know Commander Adama and Im counting on the fact that when push comes to shove, hes the kind of man who will not want bloodshed. Nevertheless, this may not be the safest place. Billy, how many civilians are in the cargo hold?
Billy 176.
Roslin There is room in the cargo hold and I implore you to find refuge there with the other civilians, this is my choice. This is my choice. You do not have to come with me.
Billy We stand with our President. Yes?  Right. Security Commander reports sounds of someone cutting through the hull.
Dualla The raptors are cutting through the hull, sir.
Adama Get the President on the line.
Racetrack You think this thing is working?
Boomer Were about to find out.
Boomer I guess so. Yeah...
Crashdown How we doin on that?
Selix Its not responding, sir.
Crashdown Are you even trained to use this thing? Hows he doin, Chief?
Tyrol not doin so good. I dont know if his lungs are burned, or what.
Crashdown Well, hes a tough kid, hes gonna-- hes gonna pull through. Get those wounds looked at, Chief.
Tyrol Yeah. Lieutenant... shouldnt we be moving out? I mean... do you have a plan for tactical deployment, or...
Crashdown Plan for tactical deployment, Chief? Get to the high ground, itll be our best chance of being seen by a search party.
Tyrol High grounds also our best chance of being seen by the Cylons. Theyre flying around, sir, they might land troops before we get rescued.
Crashdown Thats true.
Tyrol Yeah. Sir, if I may suggest that we take cover, on the ground? Maybe somewhere where we wont be seen from the air?
Crashdown Okay, yeah, Chief, thats... carry on, Chief.
Boomer Launch the nuke and prepare to jump. What?
Racetrack The bomb release is jammed, I cant free it.
Boomer we can dock inside the ship.
Racetrack Excuse me?
Boomer They think were Cylons, theyll let us dock. We can release the bomb manually and drop the nuke inside the ship itself. Itll work.
Racetrack Oh, my gods...
Tyrol Targ, Selix, can I get a hand up here, please?
Selix Yes, sir.
Tyrol Cally, hows he doin?
Cally Not good, sir.
Tyrol Get a blanket on him, keep him warm.
#6 How are you?
Baltar Alive. You saved me. You saved my life.
#6 Care to return the favor?
Baltar You in need of saving?
#6 You wondered why you were chosen? Why god chose you, above all other humans to survive and serve his purpose? Nows the time to find out why.
Elosha Lords of Kobol, hear our prayer. Bring us out of the darkness and into the light. Give us the strength to show mercy...
Billy President says she will not yield.
Dualla The President says she will not yield.
Billy Come on, D, tell me hes not actually gonna do this.
Dualla Tell me shes not gonna make him do it.
Elosha ... Redeem our hearts, that they may find peace in the midst of war--
Dualla Whats going on, Billy?
Billy Theyre-- theyre in.
Roslin Quickly...
Dualla Billy... Billy? Sir... theyre in.
#6 Pretty, isnt it?
Starbuck Ugh!
#6 Hello, Lieutenant. Something I can help you with?
Boomer Im setting her down... open the hatch. Ill release the bomb. Keep the engines warm and ready for takeoff the second I get back.
Racetrack Yes, sir.
Boomer Close the hatch after me. If Im not back in five minutes, just go.
Racetrack You got it.
#6 Welcome back to Caprica, lieutenant. Like what weve done with the place?
Starbuck Ugh!

Roslin Then why dont you get off my ship, Colonel?
Tigh Im placing you under arrest.
Apollo No... no, were not doing this.
Tigh Im in command here, Captain.
Apollo Colonel, this is wrong!
Tigh Youre relieved, fall back! Madam President--
Apollo Men, lay down your weapons.
Tigh Have you lost your frakin mind?
Apollo Colonel, tell these marines to fall back.
Tigh This is mutiny, you know that.
Apollo Yes, I do. But you can tell my father that Im listening to my instincts and my instincts tell me that we cannot sacrifice our democracy just because the President makes a bad decision.
Roslin Put your guns down.
Apollo Madam... Madam President, stand back.
Roslin Put your gun down, Captain. I will not have blood shed, neither your men nor my people on the Colonial one. Put your gun down, all of you. Please,put your gun down. Lets go.
Marine_1 Secure those weapons.
Marine_2 Lets go, captain.
Roslin Lets go.
Naked_Boomer_1 Youre confused and scared... but its okay.
Boomer Im not a Cylon. Im sharon valerii, I was born on troy. My parents were katherine and abraham valerii.
Naked_Boomer_2 You cant fight destiny, sharon.
Naked_Boomer_3 It catches up with you...
Naked_Boomer_4 no matter what you do.
Naked_Boomer_5 Dont worry about us.
Naked_Boomer_6 Well see you again.
Naked_Boomer_7 We love you, sharon.
Naked_Boomer_8 And we always will.
Racetrack Boomer!
Boomer Come on, lets go!
Racetrack What the hell took you  so--
Boomer Go, go, go...!
Racetrack Wheres your helmet?
Boomer Close the hatch. Dont turn around!
Tigh He put his weapon right to my head. Said to tell you he was following his instincts, whatever the hell that means.
Adama Bring him here.
Tigh What about Roslin?
Adama We put her in the brig.
Gaeta Dradis contacts... Its Boomer and Racetrack, sir.
Adama Put them on the speakers.
Boomer Galactica/Boomer. Mission accomplished. Repeat, mission accomplished. The basestar is history.
Adama theres some good news. Bring em home, D.
Dualla Its great to hear your voice, boomer. Come on home.
Helo Okay, okay, come here. Okay. I cant believe it. You are like the last person  I expected to see.
Starbuck I could say the same thing about you.
Helo You okay?
Helo ahhh...
Starbuck Oh, I missed you.
Helo Hey, I...
Starbuck Shes a Cylon!
Helo No, no, no! You cant, you cant... shes pregnant.
Baltar I know this place.
#6 Of course you do. Go inside.
Baltar I dont understand.
#6 Life has a melody, gaius. A rhythm of notes that become your existence once played in harmony with gods plan. Its time to do your part and realize your destiny.
Baltar Which is what, exactly?
#6 You are the guardian and protector of the new generation of gods children. The first member of our family will be with us soon, Gaius. Its time to make your choice.
Baltar But I dont understand what youre talking about. Really, I dont understand--
#6 Come... see the face of the shape of things to come. Isnt she beautiful, Gaius?

Racetrack Thank you, sir.
Boomer Thank you, sir.
Adama Thank you--
