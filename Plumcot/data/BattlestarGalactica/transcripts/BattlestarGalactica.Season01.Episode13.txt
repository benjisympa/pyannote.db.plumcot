captain_karl_agathon Its a museum, so what?
lt_sharon_valerii Its more than that. Its the home of the Arrow of Apollo.
captain_karl_agathon What the hell is that?
lt_sharon_valerii You never liked history. Come on, Helo, its supposed to be the only clue as to the location of Earth.
captain_karl_agathon Earth? What are you talking about? Whos going to Earth? It doesnt even exist. Im trying to get back to Galactica. What I need from you is a way off this planet and a way back to my ship, and if you dont do that, Im gonna blow your head off.
lt_sharon_valerii Why dont you just shut up for a change? Youre only alive because Ive kept you alive. If it wasnt for me, youd be dead by now. So, whether you like it or not, Im your only hope of getting off this planet. So, if I were you, I would take that tough guy attitude of yours and shove it up your ass. We cant move around the city during daylight. So we hole up and wait til dark.
colonel_saul_tigh Unbelievable. Shes crossed the line before but this is so far beyond the pale--
admiral_william_adama She wouldnt have done this on her own, she was coerced.
colonel_saul_tigh No one coerces Starbuck. Believe me, Ive tried.
president_laura_roslin Commander? I have the President on the line.
admiral_william_adama Bear witness, put on your headset. Madam President, moments ago, Lt. Thrace took the Cylon raider on an unscheduled and unauthorized, jump.
president_laura_roslin Yes.
admiral_william_adama Do you have any knowledge of this incident?
president_laura_roslin Lets save some time here, Commander the question you really want to ask me is whether or not I asked Lt. Thrace to take the raider to Caprica. And the answer to your question is yes.
admiral_william_adama You and I talked about this.
president_laura_roslin Yes, we had.
admiral_william_adama We both decided it was a military decision.
president_laura_roslin My responsibility as President is, first and foremost, to protect and preserve this fleet and its future. In the end, that outweighs any other consideration. It has to.
admiral_william_adama By taking the raider, youve placed our people on the surface of Kobol in direct danger.
president_laura_roslin Im very aware of the danger our men and women are in on Kobol. I am also deeply aware of the danger this civilization will be in if I ignore the pursuit of this arrow.
admiral_william_adama Im going to have to ask you for your resignation, Madam President.
president_laura_roslin No.
admiral_william_adama Then Im terminating your presidency, as of this moment.
president_laura_roslin Commander Adama, I will exercise the authority of this office until I am unable to do so, so if you want to stage a coup youre gonna have to come over here and arrest me.
admiral_william_adama I dont want any blood shed.
president_laura_roslin Of course you dont, neither do I. Neither does the press. Theyre here, by the way.
admiral_william_adama the press...
president_laura_roslin Theyre recording every minute.
admiral_william_adama Order the cap to isolate Colonial one. Mr. Gaeta.
lt_felix_gaeta Sir.
admiral_william_adama Jam any transmissions in or out of Colonial one immediately.
lt_felix_gaeta Yes, sir.
admiral_william_adama Prepare a strike team. As long as shes President, shes dangerous and if she can turn Starbuck against us, shes capable of anything.
colonel_saul_tigh Yes, sir.
admiral_william_adama Shes bluffing.
colonel_saul_tigh Lets hope so. Theres also a Cylon baseship out there to deal with.
admiral_william_adama Leave that to me.
president_laura_roslin This government survived a Cylon attack, it will survive William Adama. I think hes bluffing. But just in case, we need to be prepared.
cpt_lee_adama I know their security detail, they will defend that ship. Well have to take her down compartment by compartment.
admiral_william_adama Mr. Gaeta.
lt_felix_gaeta Sir?
admiral_william_adama Am I correct in assuming that I have two Cylon transponders left?
lt_felix_gaeta Yes, sir, but only one of them is fully functional.
admiral_william_adama One will do. Now I need a pilot.
lt_sharon_valerii Sir.
admiral_william_adama As you were. How you feeling?
lt_sharon_valerii It looks worse than it is, sir.
admiral_william_adama Things are moving very quickly and I need every pilot.
lt_sharon_valerii Im ready, sir.
admiral_william_adama I have a very special mission for you and I wont kid around. Its high risk, extremely high risk. Understand. I need you to light-jump to Kobol and take care of this basestar. Were placing a Cylon transponder aboard your raptor. In theory, it should allow you to approach the basestar without getting fired upon.
lt_sharon_valerii But well still be IDd as colonial raptors once were in visual range.
admiral_william_adama For all they know, you could be two Cylon agents returning with a captured raptor. once youre inside the defense perimeter, I need you to make them think you wanna dock. You have to fire your nuke into the loading bay, then jump back home immediately. Do you understand?
lt_sharon_valerii I understand. I can do it, sir, I know I can.
admiral_william_adama You have to.
lt_sharon_valerii Yes, sir.
captain_kara_thrace Oh, this doesnt look good. Please tell me this was not all for nothing.
captain_kara_thrace Oh, Im good. I am really good. Im home. Im home. okay, Gaeta. Please tell me that youre right about this transponder thing.
captain_karl_agathon Stop! Stop that.
lt_sharon_valerii Im nervous.
captain_karl_agathon Like anything scares you.
lt_sharon_valerii Things scare me, Helo, I have feelings.
captain_karl_agathon You-- you have software.
lt_sharon_valerii I dont know if you can hear this or not, Helo, but what we had between us was important. It was very important.
captain_karl_agathon Why?
lt_sharon_valerii Because it was the next step. Because it brings us closer to god.
captain_karl_agathon Dont mock the gods, okay? Its a human belief, Im human, theyre our gods.
lt_sharon_valerii But, beyond that, I just want you to know that I genuinely feel something for you.
captain_karl_agathon I dont care. I dont love you. I loved what I thought was you.
lt_sharon_valerii Helo, I think theres something else that you should know. Im pregnant.
cpt_lee_adama Galactica/Apollo. We have visual I.D. on Colonial one.
admiral_william_adama Tell Apollo hes clear to begin the assault. Contact us when he has soft seal on the hull.
officer_anastasia_dualla Aye, sir. Commander... Boomer and Racetrack are in the air, ready for their jump to Kobol.
admiral_william_adama Put them through down here. Boomer, Galactica Actual. Just wanted to say good luck, good hunting and I have complete faith in the both of you.
lt_sharon_valerii Thank you, actual. We wont let you down. Racetrack, start the jump clock.
racetrack Clock is running.
cpt_lee_adama Galactica/Apollo, we have soft seal.
president_laura_roslin I know Commander Adama and Im counting on the fact that when push comes to shove, hes the kind of man who will not want bloodshed. Nevertheless, this may not be the safest place. Billy, how many civilians are in the cargo hold?
billy_keikeya 176.
president_laura_roslin There is room in the cargo hold and I implore you to find refuge there with the other civilians, this is my choice. This is my choice. You do not have to come with me.
billy_keikeya We stand with our President. Yes? Right. Security Commander reports sounds of someone cutting through the hull.
officer_anastasia_dualla The raptors are cutting through the hull, sir.
admiral_william_adama Get the President on the line.
racetrack You think this thing is working?
lt_sharon_valerii Were about to find out.
lt_sharon_valerii I guess so. Yeah...
crashdown How we doin on that?
ensign_diana_seelix Its not responding, sir.
crashdown Are you even trained to use this thing? Hows he doin, Chief?
chief_galen_tyrol not doin so good. I dont know if his lungs are burned, or what.
crashdown Well, hes a tough kid, hes gonna-- hes gonna pull through. Get those wounds looked at, Chief.
chief_galen_tyrol Yeah. Lieutenant... shouldnt we be moving out? I mean... do you have a plan for tactical deployment, or...
crashdown Plan for tactical deployment, Chief? Get to the high ground, itll be our best chance of being seen by a search party.
chief_galen_tyrol High grounds also our best chance of being seen by the Cylons. Theyre flying around, sir, they might land troops before we get rescued.
crashdown Thats true.
chief_galen_tyrol Yeah. Sir, if I may suggest that we take cover, on the ground? Maybe somewhere where we wont be seen from the air?
crashdown Okay, yeah, Chief, thats... carry on, Chief.
lt_sharon_valerii Launch the nuke and prepare to jump. What?
racetrack The bomb release is jammed, I cant free it.
lt_sharon_valerii we can dock inside the ship.
racetrack Excuse me?
lt_sharon_valerii They think were Cylons, theyll let us dock. We can release the bomb manually and drop the nuke inside the ship itself. Itll work.
racetrack Oh, my gods...
chief_galen_tyrol Targ, Selix, can I get a hand up here, please?
ensign_diana_seelix Yes, sir.
chief_galen_tyrol Cally, hows he doin?
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Not good, sir.
chief_galen_tyrol Get a blanket on him, keep him warm.
number_six How are you?
dr_gaius_baltar Alive. You saved me. You saved my life.
number_six Care to return the favor?
dr_gaius_baltar You in need of saving?
number_six You wondered why you were chosen? Why god chose you, above all other humans to survive and serve his purpose? Nows the time to find out why.
elosha Lords of Kobol, hear our prayer. Bring us out of the darkness and into the light. Give us the strength to show mercy...
billy_keikeya President says she will not yield.
officer_anastasia_dualla The President says she will not yield.
billy_keikeya Come on, D, tell me hes not actually gonna do this.
officer_anastasia_dualla Tell me shes not gonna make him do it.
elosha ... Redeem our hearts, that they may find peace in the midst of war--
