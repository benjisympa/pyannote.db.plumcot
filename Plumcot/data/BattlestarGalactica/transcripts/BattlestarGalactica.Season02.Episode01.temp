Apollo Where are the medics? Wheres Doc Cottle?
Ishay Off ship, on rounds in the fleet, sir. Stand clear!
Fisher Sgt. Fisher reporting, sir.
Tigh Its gonna be okay. Okay.
Adama Im your new shipmate. Bill adama.
Tigh Saul Tigh.
Medic H-hes gonna be okay.
Ishay Okay, weve got tension pneumo. Im gonna stick him and release the pressure.
Medic Hes gonna be okay.
Boomer Whats going on? What happened?
Tigh Sergeant of the guard, secure that thing in the brig.
Fischer Aye, sir. Hollis, Wenzler, lets go. Lets go!
Boomer Ah! No! Wait!
Ishay Okay, hes breathing! Lets get him down to sickbay, RFN.
Kelly What the hell?
Gaeta Valeriis shot the old man.
Kelly What?
Ishay Three, one, two...
Gaeta She must be a Cylon, Colonels in command. You are second.
Ishay Make a hole!
Fischer As you were, Captain.
Apollo Like hell!
Tigh Secure Captain Adama! Put him in the brig.
Apollo Colonel! Colonel Tigh! Hes my father! Colonel!
Kelly Colonel. Could this be a prelude to a Cylon attack?
Tigh How would they know where we are?
Racetrack Valerii couldve told them, sir.
Tigh What? How?
Racetrack When we aboard the base star, she left the raptor for a few minutes and came back without her helmet.  She mightve told the Cylons everything. Our position, defenses...
Kelly Colonel, the toasters have knocked out our CO. This has gotta be part of a bigger plan. I recommend we execute jump to urgency standby coordinates.
Dualla Colonel, Ive located Doc Cottle. Hes aboard the rising star.
Gaeta Dradis! Signal of contact, Cylon base star bearing 4-8-7 carom 0-1-5.
Kelly Sir, we cant stay here. Sir.
Adama So whats your plan here? Personally, I tend  to go with what you know. Til something better turns up.
Kelly Sir!
Tigh Dee, alert the fleet. We are making an immediate jump to the emergency coordinates.
Dualla Sir, Doc Cottle is still 15 minutes away.
Tigh Hell have to rejoin us on the other side of the jump.
Gaeta Sir! What about our people on the surface of Kobol?
Tigh If theyre still alive, theyll have to wait.
Gaeta Ftl?
Dualla Go!
Gaeta Nav-con?
Dualla Go! Galactica to all vessels. Prepare to make immediate ftl jump to escape coordinates alpha. I say again, escape coordinates alpha. Clock will start on my mark. Mark.
Roslin Captain, what have they done to you? Whats going on?
Apollo My fathers been shot.
Roslin What?
Apollo Someone get this frakkin thing off me, please?
Guard Im not authorized to do that.
Apollo Im behind the frakkin bars!
Roslin Captain. How bad is your father?
Apollo Bad. Two bullets in the chest.
Roslin Is Dr. Cottle with him?
Apollo No, Doc Cottles not on board.
Dualla Attention, Galactica. Fleet is away. Stand by to jump in five, four, three, two, one-- jump.     Gaeta: Jump completed.
Tigh Report. Report!
Gaeta Dradis is empty, no contacts.
Tigh No contacts? Where is the fleet? Dee!
Dualla Checking all channels. No colonial signals. Theyre gone, sir.
#6 Isnt she beautiful, Gaius?
Baltar I dont think I have ever been touched  so deeply in my entire life.
#6 Youre going to make a wonderful father.
Baltar Speaking metaphorically, of course.
#6 And literally. Shes our child, gaius. Our little girl.
Baltar What?
#6 Do you want to hold her?
Baltar Mm...yes. Yes, of course I do.   But shes not real. Any more than, uh... any of this is. Real.
#6 Shes real.
Baltar She is?
#6 She may not be with you yet, but she will be. Soon.
Baltar Im having a little difficulty-- Im trying to understand, I want to understand. I--
Baltar You are the mother.
#6 And youre the father.
Baltar Am I the father?
Cally Excuse me?
Baltar Dream, Im, been clearly having a dream...
Cally Were moving out, sir. Get up. And if you wouldnt mind carrying something this time, thatd be great.
Sellix This is serisone, it should help you breathe a little easier.
Tyrol Here, just take it easy. Youll be feeling better in a few minutes.
Sellix Excuse me, sir. Weve got to get you up.
Socinus It hurt.
Sellix I know.
Baltar If you dont mind my asking, where are we going, Crashdown?
Crashdown Tree line. We can hide, still see the crash site in case Galactica sends a rescue party.
Baltar Galactica will be sending a rescue party.
Tyrol Everybody down!
Cally what was that?
Sellix That Cylons?
Crashdown Maybe. Seelix, grab the ammo. Staggered formation, Ill take point. Chief, youre bringing up the rear. Be ready to tell the private, people.
Tyrol El-tee? I think we should double-check the supplies before we bug out.
Crashdown Sorry, Chief, we dont have the time. If thats an aircraft turbine, theyre gonna be on us any moment.
Tyrol El-tee, we gotta make sure we have everything!
Crashdown We dont have the time, Chief!
Tyrol Damn it. Gods Damn it!
Ellen Whats going on, saul? Wheres the fleet?
Tigh We dont know, they jumped to another location.
Ellen Youve got blood on your pants. Why would they do that?
Tigh Every watch we update our emergency jump calculations with new star fixes to compensate for inertial drift, and then we transmit them to the rest of the fleet. This time ours were updated, but theirs werent. Gaeta was supposed to transmit them to the rest of the fleet.
Ellen So its Gaetas fault.
Tigh Oh, the kid was overwhelmed. He had his hands full.
Ellen If you say so. It sounds like a pretty big screw-up to me...
Tigh I should have checked before I gave the order to jump!
Ellen This doesnt sound like you, saul. You dont let people slide. You bust their ass.  Now, if Bill doesnt make it--
Tigh Hell make it.
Ellen If he doesnt, this will be your ship, your command. All Im saying is you need...
Tigh This is Bill Adamas ship.
Tigh This is his command. His orders are still the word of the gods on this ship. Just so were clear. This will be Adamas command until the day he dies. And we are not going to let him die. So say we all.
Tigh As you were. So how do we find the fleet?
Kelly If we jump back to our original coordinates, our nav computers can use those star fixes to generate a best fit solution, given the fleets current position.
Tigh The Cylons are waiting for us back there. How long will that take to calculate once we get back there?
Gaeta If we shut down all our functions, 12 hours.
Tigh Theres no way we can hold off a Cylon base star for 12 hours.
Roslin We have got to jump back. We cant stay here. Lieutenant thrace wont be able to find us once she retrieves the arrow from caprica.
Billy If she retrieves the arrow.
Roslin Shell retrieve the arrow. Captain, youve got to get reinstated. Youve got to get back to CIC. Gotta denounce me, disavow me, do whatever you need to do. Colonel Tigh cannot relocate this fleet on his own without your father.
Apollo Tighs not letting me out of here. I put a gun to his head. He wont forget that anytime soon.
Roslin I am so sorry that I got you into this, Captain.
Apollo No, dont apologize. I knew what I was doing. But I didnt do it for you. I did it for... well, actually, I did it for... nothing, turns out.
Roslin Thats not true. You took a stand.
Apollo And now look at us.
Crashdown Watch your foot. Everyone take five.
Sellix Give me the med kit. Wheres the med kit?
Tyrol How you doing? Hey, how you doing, buddy?
Socinus Good. Just listening to the birds.
Tyrol Ill be damned. I dont remember the last time I heard birds.
Tyrol Take it easy, okay?
Sellix Damn it.
Crashdown What is it?
Sellix Were out of serisone.
Crashdown Its all right, Ill get the other med kit.
Tarn What other med kit?
Crashdown Oh, dont frakkin tell me. We pulled two med kits from the ship. I told you to keep an eye on both of them.
Tarn I only saw the one, sir.
Crashdown There were two.
Tarn Im sorry, sir, but I dont remember you telling me...
Crashdown Well, I did!
Sellix Sir, his lungs are filling up with fluid. If he doesnt get more serisone soon, hes not gonna make it.
Crashdown Okay, Tarn. You forgot the med kit, so youre gonna have to go back and get it. Take a rifle, three clips of ammo, and a canteen.
Tarn What?
Crashdown Move.
Tyrol Cally, come here. Watch the rear. El-tee. You cant send him alone.
Crashdown You questioning my orders, Chief?
Tyrol No, Im just pointing out a flaw in your plan. Doesnt need to be any bigger than that. Cally and I can go with him.
Crashdown All right, fine, but would you look out for Cally?
Tryol Cally, give me the rifle. We three go. Leave that, leave your backpack. Sidearms out. Tarn, youre bringing up the rear in the middle, shh. Eyes and ears.
Caprica_Boomer Her consciousness  is being downloaded into another body right now.  And when she wakes up, shell tell them  exactly where we are.
Helo Shes right, we cant stay here.
Strabuck Shes right, huh? Sharon the Cylon is right. Its all just, listen to Sharon the Cylon. Do whatever she says. Cause thats a good idea.
Helo Hey, Kara, she helped me get this far.
Strabuck Okay, I get it. I get it, Helo. You and I go way back, so I get it. All right, I remember how you felt about her, but that is not the real Sharon. That is some cheap knock-off copy.
Caprica_Boomer Im not a copy. Im Sharon. I remember the first day I met you, Starbuck. You were puking your guts out in the head because youd eaten bad oysters on...
Starbuck Dont do that.
Helo Hey!
Strabuck I dont like it and I dont like you. So the best thing you can do is just keep your damn mouth shut.
Helo Starbuck. Put it down, for gods sakes.
Strabuck What do you want from me, Helo? Shes a Cylon. Youve been had. Weve been had. So what, Im just supposed to be nice to her? Because she says shes pregnant? Get out of the way.
Helo No.
Strabuck Carl, do not think that I will not--
Helo Im not gonna let you kill her! Okay? Shes carrying my child.
Strabuck My gods, men are so painfully stupid sometimes! How do you know that?
Helo I know, all right? She is not lying.
Strabuck They lie about everything, Helo, their entire existence is a lie. Theyre not human, Helo. Theyre machines. You cant have a baby with a machine. I dont know what to tell you. Okay?
Helo But I believe her. I-its hard to describe. Weve been together a long time. I mean, I know what she is, but she is not like the others. She is not.
Strabuck No, no, no, no, no! Bitch took my ride.
Tigh Hows he doing?
Ishay Well, the bullets tore up his spleen. His blood pressure is way down. Somebody needs to get in there and stop the bleeding, or well lose him.
Adama So whats your plan?
Tigh Dont really have one.
Adama Im getting back into the cockpit. Im getting back into my fleet. And I want you to come with me, Saul.
Tigh You really believe that we can get back in the fleet?
Adama Yeah, I do. Yeah, I do.
Ishay How long til Doc Cotters  aboard?
Tigh I dont know. Its gonna be a while.
Ishay He doesnt have  much time, sir.
Tigh Youre gonna have to go in yourself.
Ishay Me? Im just a medic.
Tigh Today youre a doctor.
Guard Colonel.
Tigh Open cell.
Boomer Hows the Commander?
Tigh Youve bungled the job. If thats what youre asking.
Boomer Then hes alive. Thank the gods.
Tigh How many of our pilots were Cylons?
Boomer I dont know.
Tigh Who gave the order to shoot the old man?
Boomer No one. Just get it over with, you frakkin coward.
Tigh Give me your firearm. Give me your gun!
Guard Yes, sir.
Boomer Just shoot me. Get it over with.
Tyrol Okay, Tarn. Go up, take a look. If its not there, its at the raptor. And well have to move up more.
Tarn I got it, Chief.
Tyrol All right, lets get the hell out of here. Tarn on point. Lets go. Go, go, go, go, go.
Cally This makes no sense. Why am I carrying the med kit when you forgot it?
Tarn Okay, first of all thats el-tees kit. Secondly, Im on point.
Cally Whatever.
Tyrol All right, children, thats enough. Ill tell you what, cally. If it makes you feel any better, Ill put him on hangar deck mop-up duty with you for next week.
Cally Now youre talkin.
Tarn For what? If anybody should have mop duty, its el-tee.
Tyrol Go! Go! Get down! Top of the ridge! Cally, take the rifle and cover me! Suppressive fire. Okay, okay, wait for me. Wait for me, all right?  Go, go, go, go, go. Dont move! Im coming for you, dont move.
Tyrol Jeez! m coming. Give me fire! Cally, go, go!
Cally Theyre dug in, Chief. I cant see them.
Tyrol Cover me! Come on. Come on.  Youll be okay, youre okay.  Youre okay, youre okay. Its okay. Get on my back. Get on my back. Get on me, get on me.
Cally Chief, theyre not following us anymore.
Tyrol Cally, there. There.  I know youre hit, buddy. Its okay, Im gonna check you right now. Im gonna put him here, Cal
Tarn I wanna go home, Chief.
Tyrol I know, I know. Were going home. Were going home, okay? Okay.
Tyrol Sh, sh, sh, sh. Its okay, its okay, its okay, its okay. Stay with me. Hey, hey. Look at me. Look at me. Stay with me, stay with me. Be with me, be with me.  Come on, come on. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Cally Chief. Chief, we gotta go. We gotta go. We gotta go. Chief.
Tyrol Thats it. Thats it, you stupid,  frakked-up crap!
Cally Chief, Socinus needs us now. Come on. Come on. Lets go.
Dualla Not your fault, Lieutenant.Not from where I was standing.
Gaeta I was the O.O.D.
Dualla It was crazy in there, sir. Cant blame yourself.
Gaeta So we jump back to the last coordinates. But we network the ftl computer with a nav, dc, and fire control computers.  Once theyre linked, well only need ten minutes to complete the calculations.
Kelly You cant be serious. The old man would never do this, Colonel. No computer networks on his ship. I acknowledge that, sir. But I can devise a software firewall that will buy us more time.
Kelly Really, youre gonna out-think the Cylons at computer software?
Gaeta Sir, if we dont do this, were never gonna find the fleet.  Certainly not before the commander dies.
Kelly This is still the old mans command. We cant do something hed oppose, especially when it puts the entire ship at risk.
Tigh This is the XO. Begin jump prep. Those are... my orders.
Tigh Ha! Yes! Hes in. The kid is back in the fleet. So, lets have the truth. How did you do it? Howd you get off this frakkin freighter?
Adama Connections. Annes father has a friend on the defense subcommittee.
Tigh So the new wife comes through. Wish I had in-laws with pull.
Adama Gimme a couple of years. Ill have some pull. You watch me. Ill have my own battlestar one day.
Watkins Open up, please.
Apollo All right? You have my parole. When Im on duty, Ill make no attempt to free her or sow insurrection among the crew.
Tigh Pre-flight brief is underway in the ready room.
Apollo Right.
Roslin Good hunting, Captain.
Apollo Thank you, Madam President!
Roslin Colonel, once you find the fleet, Id like to have a word with you.
Tigh Theres nothing to talk about. You went up against the old man and you lost.
Tigh We jump in, we hold off the Cylons. We crunch the numbers. Then we jump out. Thats it. Simple plan. Not so simple to do.
Gaeta Computers have been networked.  My board is green, sir.  All stations report ready to jump.
Tigh That software firewall ready?
Gaeta Best I can make it, sir. Wish Dr. Baltar was here.
Tigh To hell with that. Take your work over that shifty son of a bitch any day.
Dualla Stand by. In five, four, three, two, jump.
Gaeta Jump completed.
Tigh Report?
Gaeta Multiple dradis contacts. Cylon base star and multiple Cylon raiders bearing  4-8-7 carom 2-2-1.
Tigh Lieutenant.
Gaeta Computations underway. Well be able to plot the fleets position in seven minutes.
Flyboy Whoo-hoo! Ha ha ha!  Lets get these psychos!
Racetrack Hey flyboy, you know we got a pool going, right?   See who gets the most kills now that Starbucks awol.
Flyboy Well, we know im gonna clean up.
Apollo Flyboys, shut up and focus. This is not a simulation.
Flyboy Roger that.
Kim His heart stopped!
Ishay Defib, now!
Kim Powers unstable,the battery units are at the aid stations.
Ishay Well, then, get me a knife.
Apollo Weapons free. And open racks. And engage! Okay.
Gaeta Here they come.  Cylons are hacking our network. Attempting to access our gateway.
Tigh Now its a race.
Gaeta First firewall penetrated.
Apollo Sierra Alpha, we got a new bogey.
Hotdog What is that thing?
Apollo I dont know, but whatever it is, its bearing on Galactica. We gotta take it out.
Hotdog Apollo, Hotdog offensive. Three right, five at two.
Tally Tally, Hotdog.  Count on me.
Racetrack Roger that. Im with you, leader.
Guard Will you pray with me? Help us, lords of kobol. Help your prophet Laura guide us to the path of righteousness. That we might--   that we might destroy our enemies. Let us walk the path of righteousness and lift our faces unto your goodness. Help us turn away from the calls of the wicked and show us the knowledge of your certain salvation. We offer this
Gaeta Calculations at 56%. Second firewalls been breached. Frak theyre fast! Third firewall down!
Racetrack Apollo: Approaching Galacticas  flak barrier.  Cylon target within gun range.
Apollo Winged it!
Racetrack Apollo! Were straying into Galacticas engagement zone!
Apollo Im almost there, Im almost there.  Im almost there, come on!
Racetrack Back! Back, back!
Apollo Damn it! I had it!
Dualla Apollo reports impact on the starboard flight pod.
Apollo You got a decompression in the flight pod. No explosion. No fire. Repeat, no fire.
Dualla No fire.
Gaeta Calculations at 80%. Almost there. Theyre through the fourth firewall. one left until theyve accessed our mainframe.
Racetrack Frakker.
Flyboy Whoo! That was mine, that was mine!
Gaeta Come on, come on. We have a solution for the fleets position.
Tigh Break the network.
Gaeta Network is broken! Computers restored to local control.
Tigh Tell the vipers to get back aboard. Were getting awful lucky today. Prepare to jump.
Dualla Vipers aboard, sir.  Stand by. In five, four, three, two... Jump.
Gaeta Jump completed.
Tigh Report?
Geata Uh... multiple contacts round the board. Colonial transponder, sir. We found em!
Tigh Captain Kelly. Lieutenant Gaeta.
Gaeta Sir.
Tigh Dee. Contact the Rising Star. Tell Cottle to get his ass over here A.S.A.P.
Tigh Hell of a job.
Ishay From now on, no more heart massages for me. Im sticking to pills and enemas.  Sir.
Tigh Lets hear it.
Ishay Well, I managed to stop the bleeding. Um, but... hes still critical.
Tigh Docs on his way. Can you hear me, Bill?
Tigh Go away.
Watkins Captain Tigh, Its the shore patrol.  Sergeant watkins, sir.  Open up, please. Major Adamas compliments. He wishes me to inform you youve been reinstated in the colonial fleet. With the rank of Captain.
Tigh Major Adama.
Watkins Welcome back to the fleet, sir.
Tigh Ill be right with you, Sergeant.
Watkins Yes, sir.
Tigh You never should have brought me back in the service. If youd just let me be, Id have died back there in Caprica along with everyone else, and been happier for it. I dont want to command. I never did. Dont you dare die on me now.
