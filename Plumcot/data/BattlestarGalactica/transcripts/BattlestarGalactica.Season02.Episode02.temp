Billy Hey.
Dualla Uh, hey.
Billy Quite a day, huh?
Dualla Yeah.
Billy Um... wow, I... I havent seen you in person since--
Dualla Two weeks ago.
Billy Ive really been thinking about you.
Dualla Thats nice. I gotta go.
Billy Uh, hey, Dee. Dee, hey. Hey. Listen... I know that I havent really made an effort, or it must seem like I really havent made an effort to make this, whatever this is,Â  a priority, but--
Dualla But? But you were too busy helping the President spark a mutiny on my ship? Or, but you wanted to wait until you were desperate and needed a shoulder to cry on before making your move.
Billy I think that was a little uncalled for.
Dualla Yeah...Im sorry. Youre right. I gotta go.
Tigh What the hell?
Ishay Grab the emergency flashlights.
Medic Copy that. Check the ventilator.
Kelly Report status.
Gaeta Lets check subsystems. Lets get emergency power back on.
Hotdog Flyboy!
Flyboy Hotdog!
Hotdog Whoo!
Flyboy Yeah! Way to go, baby.
Kat Aah, yes!
Flyboy Over here, Kat. Come here.
Tigh X-O cydra.
Gaeata Uh, its the virus, sir. I think it must have spawned copies of itself in some other computer systems. Its knocked out main power and auxiliary units. Uh... emergency power just kicked back in.
Flyboy Hey, captain, nice work out there.
Apollo Im not sure what you guys are kissing and hugging about. We screwed up. We let one through.
Flyboy Yes, sir.
Kat whats going on with the lights?
Apollo Im not sure.
Gaeta We still have no idea if we can reach most of the ship.
Tigh What the hell was that?
Gaeta Not sure, sir. Checking.
Jammer Powers out, sir. I think its shipwide. Sound-powered phones the only thing working. Tried to get through to damage control, but the lines are jammed.
Apollo Okay, get the birds tied down, make the ordinance safe. Ill head up to combat, see what the hells going on.
Jammer Sir
Kelly Say again. Sullens reporting the starboard flight pod. Weve been boarded.
Flyboy Okay, look, when I came up on his six, all right, he rotated, so I had to bug out. It was plain, clean, and simple.
Kat Did you see when I turned on that pair chasing me on the port beam?
Flyboy Yeah, saw that. That was sweet.
Kat I rotate, pulled back, hit the brakes and there--bang! Left ones lined up dead center ring. I chatter him, turn back to get his wingman--
Hotdog Holy, frack! Frack!
Apollo Frack! Get outta of here! No, come on!
Kat Go, go, go!
Kat Go!
Apollo come on, come on! Hurry! Get through the hatch! Go! Get up the ladder, go! Get up, get up the ladder! Apollo turns around to see a Centurion coming his way. He shoots at it with no effect. When he runs out of ammo, it appears grimuntil its head explodes. A marine behind the Centurion took it out.
Twinam You all right, Captain?
Apollo Still breathing. I guess thats all right. Kat, Hotdog! You all right?
Hotdog Think so.
Kat Can I get back to you on that?
Apollo Sitrep?
Twinam Weve been boarded, sir. Dont know how many, where they are, where theyre headed.
Bonnington Our standard ammo doesnt even make a dent. Explosive rounds are the only way to take em down.
Apollo How many rounds you got?
Bonnington That was our last one.
Apollo Hotdog. Take this to C.I.C. Give it to Colonel Tigh or the officer in charge.
Hotdog Yes, sir.
Apollo Marines. Lets get toaster shopping.
Twinam All clear sir!
Apollo Kat, on me.
Kat Yes, sir.
Gaeta Galactica to all ships. We have been boarded by a cylon raiding party. Do not approach or attempt to dock with galactica. Keep a safe distance until we have secured the ship. I say again, we have been boarded by a cylon raiding--ah!
Kelly What the hell was that?
Gaeta The cylons jammed the signal.
Kelly Great.
Billy Are those gunshots?
Venner Yeah.
Billy We cant stay in here.
Roslin Open the door.
Venner You know I cant do that, Madame President.
Roslin Corporal Venner, I have no intention of being locked in this cell and shot like a rat in a cage. Open the door!
Roslin Thank you.
Venner Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Apollo Corporal Venner, dont shoot! Its Captain Adama. I have a fire team with me.
Venner Come on in, Captain.
Apollo Watch the companionway.
Twinam Were clear, sir.
Apollo Weve been boarded. This deck is crawling with cylons. Theyre trying to get to the magazines.
Roslin How can we help?
Apollo Stay alive and dont get shot. Leave the cylons to us. Okay, sickbay is the safest spot. Its farthest away from any potential targets, and its designed to function as a disaster shelter in case the ship were lost. Bonnington, sidearm.
Bonnington Sir
Apollo Okay, Billy, you ever handled a weapon before?
Billy Pelt gun from my uncle when I was, like, ten.
Apollo Principles the same. Real ones just make a bigger noise. Madame president.
Roslin No, thank you. I cant.
Apollo Corporal.
Venner Yes?
Apollo Youre in charge of getting her down to sickbay. Take Bonnington as escort. Remember, just head away from the sound of gunfire.
Venner Right.
Roslin What about you?
Apollo Were heading towards the gunfire. Okay, listen up. Theres a small arms locker on causeway bravo, two decks down. Were gonna go get some explosive rounds,and then were heading for the magazines. Twinam--
Twinam Sir.
Apollo You take point.
Roslin Good luck, Captain. May the lords protect you.
Apollo Yeah, you too. Clear?
Kat Clear
Apollo Okay, lets go.
Helo We should probably head out of the city, try to scout one of the outlying airbases. See if we can find a rapter.
Starbuck Thats not exactly what I expected. Thought Id be stepping over decaying corpses in the streets.
Helo Yeah, we saw a few bodies here and there. Not much though. Sharon said that-- cylon sharon said they had troops picking up the bodies. Transporting them to mass incinerators.
Starbuck Your girlfriends from a lovely family. Good people, great values.
Helo Enough, all right. Okay, I was fooled by help she fooled me. You happy now?
Starbuck Its not about making me happy.
Helo Then whats it about? What do you want here? You want me to say Im a fracking idiot, okay. Im a fracking idiot.
Starbuck That make you feel better?
Helo I dont care anymore. Ive been here for months. By myself, on the run. on step ahead of the cylons. With the cylons, I guess, actually. She seemed so real. Like Sharon, you know? Same grin, same laugh. All the little things. I feel in love with a machine. Thats stupid. So just call me an idiot, and lets be done with it.
Starbuck Youre an idiot.
Helo All right?
Starbuck Youre an idiot. But the cylons have a way of making all of us look like idiots.
Helo Kara, what are you doing?
Starbuck Making a pit stop. I got something I gotta pick up.
Helo Hey, we gotta keep going.
Starbuck I got a place here, Helo.
Gaeta The cylon virus spawned itself in our subsystems before we broke the network. I have teams cleaning each subsystem, but itll be at least an hour before we can restore main power.
Tigh Captain?
Kelly What few marines we have are assembling at their checkpoints, but comms spotty.
Tigh Where are the cylons?
Kelly Looks like they split into two forces. one moving forward--
Tigh and one moving aft.
Kelly Yes, sir.
Tigh Ive seen this before. These are their objectives.
Gaeta Secondary damage control and auxiliary fire control, sir.
Tigh If theyre successful, they will override their decompression safeties and vent us all into space. And once were all dead, theyll turn the ships guns on the fleet and wipe it out once and for all.
Adama Dr. Baltar.
Baltar God. How in gods name did you find us?
Adama what do you have there?
Baltar Well, its a child, obviously.
Adama A child. Can I hold it?
Baltar Please.
Adama Is this the shape of things to come?
Baltar Thats my understanding.
Adama only one thing for it then.
Baltar Commander? Please. Commander, where are you going? Come back! Commander! Please.
Baltar Commander! Commander. Commander, please.
Baltar No!
#6 Shh. Shh...
Baltar He killed our baby.
#6 Our baby?
Baltar Adama... I saw him drown the baby. Why would anyone want to drown a baby?
#6 Gaius, the answers all around us. What happened here? Human sacrifice.
#6 Not the fairy tales your scriptures would have you believe.
Baltar I thought kobol was supposed to be a paradise or something. Some place where gods live with the humans in harmony, or--
#6 For a time, perhaps. Then your true nature asserted itself. Your brutality, your depravity, your barbarism.
Baltar So the scriptures are all a lie. Its all just a lie, just a cover-up for all this... savagery.
#6 Exactly. All of this has happened before, Gaius. And all of it will happen again.
Baltar Adama.
#6 Mankinds true nature will always assert itself.
Baltar So he will try and kill our baby.
#6 only if you let him, Gaius. only if you let him.
Apollo Keep your eyes up ahead. Come on. Come on! Okay, go. Go, go, go, go, go.
Apollo Is it clear?
Kat Yeah.
Apollo Is it clear?
Kat Clear.
Apollo Okay. Keypads dead.
Jammer Okay... dont shoot, dont shoot, Im human!
Kat Jammer?
Jammer Yes sir, its me. Its me. Jammer, dont shoot, please. Jammer. Spec 3.
Apollo Collishaw! Watch the hatch. Kat! Whats going on? Find those explosive rounds. What the hell happened here?
Jammer I dont know, sir. I was here in this fort. I just came in here to hide. Cylons everywhere.
Apollo All right, settle down, settle down. Youre gonna be just fine.
Kat Apollo?
Apollo Youre kidding me. Thats it?
Kat Didnt have much to begin with, sir. The other fire teams must have cleaned the locker out right before us.
Apollo Six rounds. There are five of us. Okay, well... each of you guys take one. Ill take the reload.
Jammer Wait, youre not counting me, are you, sir? I mean, Im just-- I mean, Im just a knuckledragger here. I dont know how to fight centurions. I dont know the first thing about fighting centurions!
Apollo Come on. Lets go.
Collishaw Lets do it.
Starbuck You never have your house keys when you need em.
Helo These yours? You paint these, Kara?
Starbuck Yeah.
Helo How the hell did you get power.
Starbuck Batteries. Kept turning off the power. Something about not paying a bill.
Helo That is definitely not you. Refers to a picture
Starbuck Its my dad.
Helo Well, we got one package of noodles. You dont believe in groceries?
Starbuck You know, I never really liked this place anyway. Air conditioning doesnt work in the summer. Heater doesnt work in the winter. The rents a crime.
Helo A-hah.
Starbuck After they attacked, I never... I never pined over any of my old crap. Never missed it. Stupid view of the parking lot. Broken toilet in the bathroom. You know, everyone I know... is fighting to get back what they had. And Im fighting cause I dont know how to do anything else.
Roslin How far to sickbay?
Venner 60 meters.
Dualla She stopped breathing a while ago.
Billy Dee? Ohh my gods Dee. Hey. Are you all right?
Dualla Yeah, I was going to the head.
Billy Oh, my god, youre bleeding.
Dualla Went back to my rack.
Billy Are you shot?
Dualla I forgot something.
Billy Hey. Dee, look at me. Dee, look at me. Dee.
Roslin Try using her rank.
Billy Petty officer Dualla, look at me. Hey.
Dualla Hey. Im glad to see you. Ive been here in the dark a long time.
Roslin Its probably a concussion. Corporal Venner. We need an alternate route to sickbay. Give me your eyes. Look at me. Corporal. We dont want to walk into gunfire. We want to go away from the cylons. Now clear your head. Come on.
Venner We could, we can go in the, all the way on the starboard side. Its a lot farther.
Roslin Good. Starboard.
Gaeta Lieutenant Wallace reports his unit destroyed two centurions at this junction. They trapped a third in the ships laundry. It cant walk, but its still shooting.
Kelly At least weve contained the threat to auxiliary fire control.
Tigh Trust me. Theyre still heading for the aft damage control.
Petty_Officer Lt. Gaeta
Gaeta Sergeant Hadrian reports her units had to halt their advance on deck 10 at frame 69. Sounds cut through the hull ahead of her and the compartments are open to space.
Kelly Smart move. Keeps us from chasin em.
Tigh There is nothing between the last two cylons and the decompression safeties. If you know any prayers, nows the time.
Cally What do you say we take five? How much further, do you think?
Cally Tarn getting shot, it wasnt your fault. You know that, right?Â  Chief? Talk to me, mother-frakker!
Tyrol Mother-frakker?
Cally Socinus better appreciate this.
Tyrol Hes probably lyin in the sun like some gods-damn emperor. Hes an idiot.
Cally I hope hes okay.
Tyrol Hell be fine. Hes a tough kid. We just, gotta get him the medkit. Yeah, we gotta go, Cally.
Baltar Crashdown!
Crashdown Shhh! Where the hell have you been? Where have you been? Doc, where have you been? Answer me.
Baltar I got lost--
Crashdown Doc, you never run off like that. You are under my command. This is a military operation, do you understand me? What I want to hear from you is, yes, sir!
Baltar Yes, sir! Look, Crashdown, I, Im getting a really bad feeling about this place.
Crashdown Oh, yeah, you and me, both, doc.
Tyrol Flash! Flash!
Crashdown Thunder.
Tyrol Go, go, go.
Crashdown Here. Here. Here. Wheres Tarn? What happened?
Tyrol Cylons.
Crashdown Were you followed?
Tyrol No. Hows he doing?
Selix Hes not gonna make it.
Tyrol What? What do you mean? What are you talking about? Weve got the medkit; give him a shot. Give him another shot!
Selix Too late.
Tyrol What do you mean its too late? I got you the medkit. What else do you want? So we go get the medicine you asked for. Tarn--for what? For this! Come on, you gotta do something. You have to do something.
Selix I cant change that hes gonna die, Chief. Its gonna be slow and painful. And we can spare him that. We can spare him that if we give him the morpha from my kit and the one that you brought back.
Tyrol What? No. El-tee? El-tee, come on.
Crashdown Hes your man, Chief.
Tyrol Give it to me. Give it to me. Hey, buddy. Its Chief. How ya doin?
Socinus Whats goin on, Chief?
Tyrol Well, you know. Just listeninto the birds.
Tyrol I, uh... I got a little somethin for the pain. Good news, buddy.
Tyrol We got a rescue party here. The raptor just landed. Were gonna put you on it, take you back to Galactica. Okay?
Socinus Im goin home?
Tyrol Yeah. Youre goin home.
Apollo How are you coming, Jammer?
Jammer That should do it, captain.
Apollo Hey, nice job. You guys, check the deck, check the lockers. Theres gotta be more rounds in here.
Kelly Colonel, its Apollo. Hes on deck 12, abaft frame 8-6. Thats between the cylons and aft damage control.
Tigh Apollo, XO. Sitrep.
Apollo Five armed defectors. We havent seen anything but bodies between here and the hangar deck.
Bonnington Clear.
Venner Okay, from what I can remember, the sickbays about 20 meters through that hatch.
Billy How are you feeling?
Dualla Like Im walking underwater.
Tigh Any marines with you?
Apollo Privates Collishaw, Twinam.
Tigh Take your men and proceed without delay to aft damage control.
Dualla Is that yours?
Billy Oh, uh, yeah. I guess it is now.
Dualla Okay, if youre gonna keep it in your trousers like that... you might want to turn the safety on.
Billy All righty.
Venner Is it stuck?
Bonnington Oh, frak! The hatch wont open. The other sides been de-pressurized.
Roslin All right, Corporal venner, this is your ship. Im just a tourist. Find us another way to sickbay.
Venner Okay, um... okay, we have to head toward aft damage control.
Roslin Aft damage control.
Apollo Aft damage control.
Tigh Thats what theyre after. Lets not waste any more time. You get to aft damage control and get there right frakking now, mister. Get there before the cylons, or we lose the ship. Is that clear?
Apollo Aft damage control rfn. on our way. Apollo out.
Apollo okay, we made it. Twinam and jammer, you take this side. Kat, Collishaw, you take that side. Were gonna need some cover! Lets get this stuff out.
Apollo Wait. Thats nice. Okay, everybody, get down, stay down. Hold your fire until IÂ  give the signal. Remember, you only have one round, so its gotta be a head shot to make a kill. Do you understand? Understood?
Kat Yes, sir.
Marines Yes, sir.
Apollo Kat, kill the flashlight.
Venner Take cover! Take cover!
Apollo Lets go, lets go, lets go! Steady up there, Jammer.
Jammer Yes, sir. Im not really cut out for this, sir.
Apollo Me neither. Sometimes you got to roll a hard six.
Jammer Wh-what does that mean, sir?
Apollo Uh... I dont know. Its something my dad says. Just...dont shoot until I tell ya to. All right. Okay, were in good shape. Theyre coming. But were in good shape. Head shot. Reload. Head shot. Head shot. Reload.Â  Head shot. Reload. Head shot. Okay, theyre coming. Everybody down!
Dualla You want to shoot that, you got to take the safety off.
Billy Damn it!
Apollo Fire!
Jammer Frak!
Venner Hey, hey... are you all right?
Roslin Yes. Im fine.
Jammer We did it! We got em all! They dont look so big now, do they?
Apollo They look big enough.
Dualla Ill, uh, Ill take that.
Billy Yeah.
Venner Have you been shot?
Roslin Uh, no, I dont think so. Yeah, Im fine.
Roslin Oh
Venner The gods must be watching over you.
Starbuck Tired of walking?
Helo Okay.
Helo Thanks.
Billy Hey. How do you feel?
Dualla Better.
Billy I thought you said--
Dualla Forget what I said. And listen to what Im saying. You listening?
Billy Mm-hmm. Im sorry. I, uh-- I didnt hear that. Could you, uh... could you do that one more time?
Dualla Let me be clear. Get the curtain.
Tigh Doc cottles on his way. Hell be here any minute.
Roslin Hes going to be all right. You know that.
Apollo Yeah. Yeah, I-I know that.
Roslin Colonel, I assume theres still a cell out there waiting for me.
Tigh Thats right.
Roslin Corporal venner, Im ready.
Tigh I cant believe you sided with that woman against the old man. I wouldnt do that if you put a gun to my head. And you did. As far as Im concerned, youre not fit to wear a uniform.
Apollo Hmm. Youre right about that part. I am not fit to wear the uniform. Maybe I never was. Then again, neither are you. This isnt my ship. And it sure as hell isnt yours. Its his. And when he wakes up... hell decide what to do with the both of us.
Tigh Thank the gods I didnt have kids.
