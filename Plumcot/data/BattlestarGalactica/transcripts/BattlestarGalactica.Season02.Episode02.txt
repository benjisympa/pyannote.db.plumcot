billy_keikeya Hey.
officer_anastasia_dualla Uh, hey.
billy_keikeya Quite a day, huh?
officer_anastasia_dualla Yeah.
billy_keikeya Um... wow, I... I havent seen you in person since--
officer_anastasia_dualla Two weeks ago.
billy_keikeya Ive really been thinking about you.
officer_anastasia_dualla Thats nice. I gotta go.
billy_keikeya Uh, hey, Dee. Dee, hey. Hey. Listen... I know that I havent really made an effort, or it must seem like I really havent made an effort to make this, whatever this is, a priority, but--
officer_anastasia_dualla But? But you were too busy helping the President spark a mutiny on my ship? Or, but you wanted to wait until you were desperate and needed a shoulder to cry on before making your move.
billy_keikeya I think that was a little uncalled for.
officer_anastasia_dualla Yeah...Im sorry. Youre right. I gotta go.
colonel_saul_tigh What the hell?
medic_layne_ishay Grab the emergency flashlights.
Medic#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode02 Copy that. Check the ventilator.
captain_aaron_kelly Report status.
lt_felix_gaeta Lets check subsystems. Lets get emergency power back on.
lt_brendan_constanza Flyboy!
flyboy Hotdog!
lt_brendan_constanza Whoo!
flyboy Yeah! Way to go, baby.
louanne_katraine Aah, yes!
flyboy Over here, Kat. Come here.
colonel_saul_tigh X-O cydra.
Gaeata#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode02 Uh, its the virus, sir. I think it must have spawned copies of itself in some other computer systems. Its knocked out main power and auxiliary units. Uh... emergency power just kicked back in.
flyboy Hey, captain, nice work out there.
cpt_lee_adama Im not sure what you guys are kissing and hugging about. We screwed up. We let one through.
flyboy Yes, sir.
louanne_katraine whats going on with the lights?
cpt_lee_adama Im not sure.
lt_felix_gaeta We still have no idea if we can reach most of the ship.
colonel_saul_tigh What the hell was that?
lt_felix_gaeta Not sure, sir. Checking.
jammer Powers out, sir. I think its shipwide. Sound-powered phones the only thing working. Tried to get through to damage control, but the lines are jammed.
cpt_lee_adama Okay, get the birds tied down, make the ordinance safe. Ill head up to combat, see what the hells going on.
jammer Sir
captain_aaron_kelly Say again. Sullens reporting the starboard flight pod. Weve been boarded.
flyboy Okay, look, when I came up on his six, all right, he rotated, so I had to bug out. It was plain, clean, and simple.
louanne_katraine Did you see when I turned on that pair chasing me on the port beam?
flyboy Yeah, saw that. That was sweet.
louanne_katraine I rotate, pulled back, hit the brakes and there--bang! Left ones lined up dead center ring. I chatter him, turn back to get his wingman--
lt_brendan_constanza Holy, frack! Frack!
cpt_lee_adama Frack! Get outta of here! No, come on!
louanne_katraine Go, go, go!
louanne_katraine Go!
cpt_lee_adama come on, come on! Hurry! Get through the hatch! Go! Get up the ladder, go! Get up, get up the ladder! Apollo turns around to see a Centurion coming his way. He shoots at it with no effect. When he runs out of ammo, it appears grimuntil its head explodes. A marine behind the Centurion took it out.
twinam You all right, Captain?
cpt_lee_adama Still breathing. I guess thats all right. Kat, Hotdog! You all right?
lt_brendan_constanza Think so.
louanne_katraine Can I get back to you on that?
cpt_lee_adama Sitrep?
twinam Weve been boarded, sir. Dont know how many, where they are, where theyre headed.
bonnington Our standard ammo doesnt even make a dent. Explosive rounds are the only way to take em down.
cpt_lee_adama How many rounds you got?
bonnington That was our last one.
cpt_lee_adama Hotdog. Take this to C.I.C. Give it to Colonel Tigh or the officer in charge.
lt_brendan_constanza Yes, sir.
cpt_lee_adama Marines. Lets get toaster shopping.
twinam All clear sir!
cpt_lee_adama Kat, on me.
louanne_katraine Yes, sir.
lt_felix_gaeta Galactica to all ships. We have been boarded by a cylon raiding party. Do not approach or attempt to dock with galactica. Keep a safe distance until we have secured the ship. I say again, we have been boarded by a cylon raiding--ah!
captain_aaron_kelly What the hell was that?
lt_felix_gaeta The cylons jammed the signal.
captain_aaron_kelly Great.
billy_keikeya Are those gunshots?
cpl_venner Yeah.
billy_keikeya We cant stay in here.
president_laura_roslin Open the door.
cpl_venner You know I cant do that, Madame President.
president_laura_roslin Corporal Venner, I have no intention of being locked in this cell and shot like a rat in a cage. Open the door!
president_laura_roslin Thank you.
cpl_venner Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
cpt_lee_adama Corporal Venner, dont shoot! Its Captain Adama. I have a fire team with me.
cpl_venner Come on in, Captain.
cpt_lee_adama Watch the companionway.
twinam Were clear, sir.
cpt_lee_adama Weve been boarded. This deck is crawling with cylons. Theyre trying to get to the magazines.
president_laura_roslin How can we help?
cpt_lee_adama Stay alive and dont get shot. Leave the cylons to us. Okay, sickbay is the safest spot. Its farthest away from any potential targets, and its designed to function as a disaster shelter in case the ship were lost. Bonnington, sidearm.
bonnington Sir
cpt_lee_adama Okay, Billy, you ever handled a weapon before?
billy_keikeya Pelt gun from my uncle when I was, like, ten.
cpt_lee_adama Principles the same. Real ones just make a bigger noise. Madame president.
president_laura_roslin No, thank you. I cant.
cpt_lee_adama Corporal.
cpl_venner Yes?
cpt_lee_adama Youre in charge of getting her down to sickbay. Take Bonnington as escort. Remember, just head away from the sound of gunfire.
cpl_venner Right.
president_laura_roslin What about you?
cpt_lee_adama Were heading towards the gunfire. Okay, listen up. Theres a small arms locker on causeway bravo, two decks down. Were gonna go get some explosive rounds,and then were heading for the magazines. Twinam--
twinam Sir.
cpt_lee_adama You take point.
president_laura_roslin Good luck, Captain. May the lords protect you.
cpt_lee_adama Yeah, you too. Clear?
louanne_katraine Clear
cpt_lee_adama Okay, lets go.
captain_karl_agathon We should probably head out of the city, try to scout one of the outlying airbases. See if we can find a rapter.
captain_kara_thrace Thats not exactly what I expected. Thought Id be stepping over decaying corpses in the streets.
captain_karl_agathon Yeah, we saw a few bodies here and there. Not much though. Sharon said that-- cylon sharon said they had troops picking up the bodies. Transporting them to mass incinerators.
captain_kara_thrace Your girlfriends from a lovely family. Good people, great values.
captain_karl_agathon Enough, all right. Okay, I was fooled by help she fooled me. You happy now?
captain_kara_thrace Its not about making me happy.
captain_karl_agathon Then whats it about? What do you want here? You want me to say Im a fracking idiot, okay. Im a fracking idiot.
captain_kara_thrace That make you feel better?
captain_karl_agathon I dont care anymore. Ive been here for months. By myself, on the run. on step ahead of the cylons. With the cylons, I guess, actually. She seemed so real. Like Sharon, you know? Same grin, same laugh. All the little things. I feel in love with a machine. Thats stupid. So just call me an idiot, and lets be done with it.
captain_kara_thrace Youre an idiot.
captain_karl_agathon All right?
captain_kara_thrace Youre an idiot. But the cylons have a way of making all of us look like idiots.
captain_karl_agathon Kara, what are you doing?
captain_kara_thrace Making a pit stop. I got something I gotta pick up.
captain_karl_agathon Hey, we gotta keep going.
captain_kara_thrace I got a place here, Helo.
lt_felix_gaeta The cylon virus spawned itself in our subsystems before we broke the network. I have teams cleaning each subsystem, but itll be at least an hour before we can restore main power.
colonel_saul_tigh Captain?
captain_aaron_kelly What few marines we have are assembling at their checkpoints, but comms spotty.
colonel_saul_tigh Where are the cylons?
captain_aaron_kelly Looks like they split into two forces. one moving forward--
colonel_saul_tigh and one moving aft.
captain_aaron_kelly Yes, sir.
colonel_saul_tigh Ive seen this before. These are their objectives.
lt_felix_gaeta Secondary damage control and auxiliary fire control, sir.
colonel_saul_tigh If theyre successful, they will override their decompression safeties and vent us all into space. And once were all dead, theyll turn the ships guns on the fleet and wipe it out once and for all.
admiral_william_adama Dr. Baltar.
dr_gaius_baltar God. How in gods name did you find us?
admiral_william_adama what do you have there?
dr_gaius_baltar Well, its a child, obviously.
admiral_william_adama A child. Can I hold it?
dr_gaius_baltar Please.
admiral_william_adama Is this the shape of things to come?
dr_gaius_baltar Thats my understanding.
admiral_william_adama only one thing for it then.
dr_gaius_baltar Commander? Please. Commander, where are you going? Come back! Commander! Please.
dr_gaius_baltar Commander! Commander. Commander, please.
dr_gaius_baltar No!
number_six Shh. Shh...
dr_gaius_baltar He killed our baby.
number_six Our baby?
dr_gaius_baltar Adama... I saw him drown the baby. Why would anyone want to drown a baby?
number_six Gaius, the answers all around us. What happened here? Human sacrifice.
number_six Not the fairy tales your scriptures would have you believe.
dr_gaius_baltar I thought kobol was supposed to be a paradise or something. Some place where gods live with the humans in harmony, or--
number_six For a time, perhaps. Then your true nature asserted itself. Your brutality, your depravity, your barbarism.
dr_gaius_baltar So the scriptures are all a lie. Its all just a lie, just a cover-up for all this... savagery.
number_six Exactly. All of this has happened before, Gaius. And all of it will happen again.
dr_gaius_baltar Adama.
number_six Mankinds true nature will always assert itself.
dr_gaius_baltar So he will try and kill our baby.
number_six only if you let him, Gaius. only if you let him.
cpt_lee_adama Keep your eyes up ahead. Come on. Come on! Okay, go. Go, go, go, go, go.
cpt_lee_adama Is it clear?

louanne_katraine Jammer?
jammer Yes sir, its me. Its me. Jammer, dont shoot, please. Jammer. Spec 3.
cpt_lee_adama Collishaw! Watch the hatch. Kat! Whats going on? Find those explosive rounds. What the hell happened here?
jammer I dont know, sir. I was here in this fort. I just came in here to hide. Cylons everywhere.
cpt_lee_adama All right, settle down, settle down. Youre gonna be just fine.
louanne_katraine Apollo?
cpt_lee_adama Youre kidding me. Thats it?
louanne_katraine Didnt have much to begin with, sir. The other fire teams must have cleaned the locker out right before us.
cpt_lee_adama Six rounds. There are five of us. Okay, well... each of you guys take one. Ill take the reload.
jammer Wait, youre not counting me, are you, sir? I mean, Im just-- I mean, Im just a knuckledragger here. I dont know how to fight centurions. I dont know the first thing about fighting centurions!
cpt_lee_adama Come on. Lets go.
collishaw Lets do it.
captain_kara_thrace You never have your house keys when you need em.
captain_karl_agathon These yours? You paint these, Kara?
captain_kara_thrace Yeah.
captain_karl_agathon How the hell did you get power.
captain_kara_thrace Batteries. Kept turning off the power. Something about not paying a bill.
captain_karl_agathon That is definitely not you. Refers to a picture
captain_kara_thrace Its my dad.
captain_karl_agathon Well, we got one package of noodles. You dont believe in groceries?
captain_kara_thrace You know, I never really liked this place anyway. Air conditioning doesnt work in the summer. Heater doesnt work in the winter. The rents a crime.
captain_karl_agathon A-hah.
captain_kara_thrace After they attacked, I never... I never pined over any of my old crap. Never missed it. Stupid view of the parking lot. Broken toilet in the bathroom. You know, everyone I know... is fighting to get back what they had. And Im fighting cause I dont know how to do anything else.
president_laura_roslin How far to sickbay?
cpl_venner 60 meters.
officer_anastasia_dualla She stopped breathing a while ago.
billy_keikeya Dee? Ohh my gods Dee. Hey. Are you all right?
officer_anastasia_dualla Yeah, I was going to the head.
billy_keikeya Oh, my god, youre bleeding.
officer_anastasia_dualla Went back to my rack.
billy_keikeya Are you shot?
officer_anastasia_dualla I forgot something.
billy_keikeya Hey. Dee, look at me. Dee, look at me. Dee.
president_laura_roslin Try using her rank.
billy_keikeya Petty officer Dualla, look at me. Hey.
officer_anastasia_dualla Hey. Im glad to see you. Ive been here in the dark a long time.
president_laura_roslin Its probably a concussion. Corporal Venner. We need an alternate route to sickbay. Give me your eyes. Look at me. Corporal. We dont want to walk into gunfire. We want to go away from the cylons. Now clear your head. Come on.
cpl_venner We could, we can go in the, all the way on the starboard side. Its a lot farther.
president_laura_roslin Good. Starboard.
lt_felix_gaeta Lieutenant Wallace reports his unit destroyed two centurions at this junction. They trapped a third in the ships laundry. It cant walk, but its still shooting.
captain_aaron_kelly At least weve contained the threat to auxiliary fire control.
colonel_saul_tigh Trust me. Theyre still heading for the aft damage control.
Petty_Officer#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode02 Lt. Gaeta
lt_felix_gaeta Sergeant Hadrian reports her units had to halt their advance on deck 10 at frame 69. Sounds cut through the hull ahead of her and the compartments are open to space.
captain_aaron_kelly Smart move. Keeps us from chasin em.
colonel_saul_tigh There is nothing between the last two cylons and the decompression safeties. If you know any prayers, nows the time.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson What do you say we take five? How much further, do you think?
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Tarn getting shot, it wasnt your fault. You know that, right? Chief? Talk to me, mother-frakker!
chief_galen_tyrol Mother-frakker?
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Socinus better appreciate this.
chief_galen_tyrol Hes probably lyin in the sun like some gods-damn emperor. Hes an idiot.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson I hope hes okay.

ensign_diana_seelix I cant change that hes gonna die, Chief. Its gonna be slow and painful. And we can spare him that. We can spare him that if we give him the morpha from my kit and the one that you brought back.

colonel_saul_tigh Thats right.
president_laura_roslin Corporal venner, Im ready.
colonel_saul_tigh I cant believe you sided with that woman against the old man. I wouldnt do that if you put a gun to my head. And you did. As far as Im concerned, youre not fit to wear a uniform.
cpt_lee_adama Hmm. Youre right about that part. I am not fit to wear the uniform. Maybe I never was. Then again, neither are you. This isnt my ship. And it sure as hell isnt yours. Its his. And when he wakes up... hell decide what to do with the both of us.
colonel_saul_tigh Thank the gods I didnt have kids.
