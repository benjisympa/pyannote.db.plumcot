Crashdown Lords of Kobol, take these brave men into your arms. Take upon your arms the spirits of our fallen-- takeup in your arms the spirits of our fallen friends so that they may share in the everlasting life that awaits us all beyond the vale of tears. So say we all.
All So say we all.
#6 Nothing awaits them. No eternal life, no damnation. only oblivion.
Baltar Because they havent seen the face of god, I take it.
#6 Because they died here. on Kobol.
Baltar I see.
Tyrol Doc...lets go. Were moving out. Doc, you hear me? Were moving out.
Baltar I did hear you, Chief. I just dont respond to the title Doc. A dock is a platform for loading and unloading material. My title is doctor,or mr. Vice president, if you dont mind.
Tyrol You are loading, are you not? El-tee? El-tee! Crash!
Crashdown Hmm? Oh, yeah, Chief, Ill be right there.
Tyrol No Cylons.
Crashdown You sure?
Tyrol Uh-oh. Wait a minute. Tree line, two oclock.
Crashdown Got em. What are they doing?
Tyrol Looks like theyre dismantling the ship.
Crashdown Why? Why not just use it to fly the hell out of here?
Tyrol I dont know. I cant tell. Theyre...dragging it into the tree line. Its, uh... oh, wait oh minute. Theyre building something.
Crashdown Chief, is that A...
Tyrol A missile. Theyre building a missile battery.
Crashdown Well, at least we know why theyre not chasing us.
Baltar Why? Why arent they chasing us?
Tyrol Because they dont have to. They can just sit back, launch a missile barrage thatll wipe out every living thing in this valley.
Cottle Next time I say im in a hurry, cycle the damn air lock faster. Is this your first day?
Billy Doctor, thank the gods, youre here. The president needs your help.
Cottle Move.
Cottle Okay... lets have some vitals.Like now.
Kim Two bullets, 9mm. This one lacerated the spleen, the other one nicked the aorta. Now, weve removed the spleen, and we thought we repaired the aorta, but--
Ishay Over the past few hours, his B.P.S dropped down again. Its only 80 over 40. And his heart rates creeping into the 130s.
Cottle Well, you missed something. Hes still hemorrhaging somewhere. Were gonna lose him unless we can stop that bleeding. Get me an A.B.G., C.B.C., And coags, and get set up for a rapid sequence intubation.
Tigh Is he gonna make it?
Cottle How should I know? Im not a psychic. Now get the hell out of here.
Cottle It is a mess in here. Looks like the mesenteric artery may have been damaged. 3.7 mac. God damn it, Kim, learn the instruments. I said a 3.7 mac!
Kim Sorry
Cottle Clamp. Clamp!
Ishay Dr. Cottle, his pressures dropping. Its 60 on 30. Heart rates starting to fall. I dont think he can last much longer.
Cottle Just stay focused. Get some more suction in here so I can see what Im doing.
Billy Ahem. Colonel... hows the commander?
Tigh What?
Billy Uh, ahem, hows the Commander?
Tigh Hes still in surgery. Whats on your mind?
Billy Uh, I need some medication for the president.
Tigh Shes not the president anymore. Cottles a little busy right now.
Billy Sir, shes very ill...
Tigh Why arent youin the brig?
Billy Um... because... no one put me in there?
Tigh What the hells all this? Why arent you in the brig?
Apollo Im on duty, sir. Planning the search and rescue mission.
Tigh Search and rescue? For who? We lose a plane, and nobody tells me?!
Apollo For our raptor crew down on the surface of Kobol, sir?
Tigh Simes is senior pilot now. He can plan the sar.
Apollo You asked me to command the air group when Im on duty. And Im on duty. So am I in command... or not?
Tigh Whats the status of the sar, captain?
Apollo Well, we dont know in what area Raptor 3 went down. So the only realistic chance we have of finding her is to hope that herÂ  transponder disaster beacon is still functioning. I intend to take two raptors, one with medical personnel, and make five low level orbits of the planet.
Tigh What about the Cylon base ship that Lieutenant Valerii supposedly destroyed? What if she was lying?
Apollo Racetrack confirmed the destruction of the base ship, and I checked the gun camera footage from the raptors, which verifies it.
Tigh Lieutenant Gaeta, why are you hovering about?
Gaeta Uh, its the press.
Tigh The press?
Gaeta Theyre demanding to know how much longer we plan on holding them, and when they can contact their home ships.
Tigh They demand? Theyre in no position to demand anything. You tell them to shut their yaps. Well get to them in due time.
Dualla Excuse me, Colonel. Shuttle from the Zephyr has just requested permission to enter the landing pattern.
Tigh The zephyr?
Dualla Yes, sir. Evidently the Quorum of Twelve is aboard. Theyre demanding to see you.
Tigh They demand?
Apollo Demanding job, commanding a Battlestar.
Tigh Clear them to land. Put them in the ward room and hold them there until I have time to see them.
Roslin Aah!
Billy Madam president.
Venner Whats wrong with her?
Billy I dont know, but shes clearly sick. You can see that, cant you?
Venner Well, theres nothing I can do.
Billy Madam president...
Roslin Yes?
Billy Can I get you anything while youre in the brig?
Roslin Ohh... ohh... really? No, thank you. Im sorry. Im finding it... hard to think. Its withdrawal.
Billy The chamalla?
Roslin Yes.
Billy Im trying to get you more.
Roslin Go fast.
Cally I count... six missiles being carried into the forest site so far.
Baltar Its all so pointless. We kill them. And they kill us. So we kill more of them. They kill more of us. Whats the point anymore?
#6 You and your...race invented murder. Invented killing for sport, greed, envy. Its mans one true art form.
Baltar Youve done some killing of your own, I think.
#6 Yes, well,were youre children. You taught us well.
Baltar Why does god want to bring a child into this kind of world anyway?
#6 Because, despite everything, despite all of it, he still wants to offer you salvation. Our child will bring that salvation, but only if you accept your role as her father. And her guardian.
Baltar Im not ready for that. All right? Im not a father. Im not a guardian. Im not a moral leader capable of leading anyone. Let alone a baby.
#6 Be a man, Gaius.
Baltar What?
#6 Be a man. Whatever else you are, you are that. The time is coming when youll have to act like one.
Tyrol Wait a minute, wait a minute. El-tee, check this out.
Crashdown What do you got, Chief?
Tyrol 45 degrees east of the launcher. You see that tree stump?
Crashdown What the hell is that?
Tyrol It looks like a dradis dish. At least, the Cylon version of a dradis dish. Its probably salvaged from the nose cone of the ship. Theyre building an anti-aircraft battery.
Cally Anti-aircraft? For what? There are no otheraircraft around here.
Tyrol The Galacticas gonna send a search and rescue team. When they do, thats at least two raptors doing a low pass over the crash site. When those raptors come looking for us, risking their lives to rescue us...
Crashdown Cylons will shoot em down.
Apollo Seven birds down for repairs. Three out on picket duty with the cap.
Dualla Uh, con traffic, sir. Priority messages are on top.
Tigh Cut to the chase, Captain! How long before you launch the sar? Come on, Dee, these are all marked priority.
Dualla Sorry, sir, thats how they came in.
Apollo Im cannibalizing 305 for parts. Should be up in the air in, I dont know, 90 minutes.
Tigh 90minutes?! We got men down on that frakking planet! Get your head in the game. You do your job, or go back to the brig. Are on the members of the Quorum in the ward room?
Dualla All 12, sir.
Tigh Dont suppose you wanna do this for me?
Dualla Never was much for public speaking, sir.
Porter Why have you imprisoned the president?
Bagot So why are we here under guard? Thats what I want to know.
Tigh Laura Roslin suborned mutiny and sedition aboard this ship. She caused a key military asset to be lost at a critical moment! The Commander felt he had no choice but to remove her from power.
Porter Youve said that, several times.
Bagot You dont seem to be listening, Colonel. It does not matter what Adama felt. He had absolutely no authority--
Zarek Adama knew exactly what he was doing. He was paving the way to declare martial law and usher in a military dictatorship. Isnt that right, Colonel?
Tigh I cant speak for the commander. Hes still in surgery.
Zarek Well, you seem to be giving the orders around here. So what exactly are you planning to do? Are you declaring martial law?
Tigh Absolutely not. I know for a fact that the old man hated the very idea of martial law. He believed in freedom and democracy and all that good stuff.
Zarek Well, since this is still a...democracy, and all that good stuff, I move that the quorum demand immediate access to President Roslin.
Bagot Excellent. I second it.
Porter All those in favor.
Porter Motion carries. Colonel, we demand immediate access to the president.
Tigh I will take your demand under advisement.
Ellen Madam president.
Roslin Clearly, and anything that impedes that understanding--
Ellen Madam President.
Roslin I have to consider--
Ellen Laura. Laura.
Roslin Hello.
Ellen Hi. Are you all right? I, uh, just came down to see if there was anything I could do for you. Anything I can get you?
Roslin I would like to have a conversation with my attorney. Could you arrange that?
Ellen Yeah. Yeah, sure, right. Laura, do you know where you are?
Roslin Im in jail.
Ellen Whats my name?
Roslin Have we met? Im... Im sorry. Excuse me. Theres just...a ringing. She curls up into a ball and starts rocking. Excuse me.
Ellen Ringing? Ohh. Right. Okay, then. Take care.
Roslin Ohh! Ohh... oh. Oh, my gods. Ellen Tigh. Ellen?
Crashdown The launcher looks like a simple point-and-shoot. No built-in guidance. Ordnance appear to be standard ship-to-ship missiles. Theyre modifying them for atmospheric flight.
Cally one Cylon sentrywalks the perimeter, stopping at regular intervals.
Baltar The dradis dish that controls the missiles is on the 4.5 kg wavelength, judging by the diameter. Its guarded by two centurions, I think.
Crashdown Im sorry, Doc, did you say it was guarded by two centurions?
Baltar Yes, I did.
Crashdown Okay, is the dradis guarded continuously of intermittently?
Baltar I saw two centurions through the field glasses...continuously, for five minutes. In that time, they didnt leave their post.
Crashdown So theres three toasters near the launcher. Two more out by the dish. Thats a lot of Cylons. You ever handle a weapon?
Baltar Who, me? No. Im not a soldier, Crashdown.
Crashdown Ill try to give you the most simple assignment, but Im gonna need every man.
Tyrol Youre not suggesting we attack the Cylons?
Crashdown We owe it to Socinus and Tarn to tack the frakkers out before they kill anyone else. We have equal numbers. We have theÂ  element of surprise. Therefore, we have the initiative. We can attack at the time and place of our choosing.
Tyrol El-tee, a word... in private.
Baltar Hes crazy. Im not trained for this kind of thing. Ive never fired a gun in my life.
Sellix I havent fired one since basic.
Baltar You?
Cally I just joined to pay for dental school.
Tyrol Basic ground assault was a long time ago. For all of us. Those arent training officers out there. Theyre programmed killing machines.
Crashdown We dont have any choice. Galactica will definitely be sending a search and rescue party. Its just a matter of time. And if we dont take out that launcher--
Tyrol We cant go up against an armed and defended position like that. Theyll wipe us out in the first two minutes.
Crashdown Thats enough! Chief, look, under the circumstances, its important that you keep your cool.
Tyrol I dont believe ive lost my cool.
Crashdown I disagree. Look, I dont want to attack the launcher either, but its our duty. We owe it to the rescue party, and we owe it to Socinus and Tarn.
Tyrol I fail to see what this has to do with Socinus and Tarn.
Crashdown Maybe thats why Im an officer, and youre not. Dismissed.
Crashdown This briefing will outling a plan of attack in five graphs. Graph one: Situation. Our situation is that we are stranded on Kobol with a group of five Cylons who plan to use an AAu to destroy any SAR craft sent to find us. There are no friendly forces present.
Baltar Whats all this graph business?
Tyrol Its a five-paragraph order. Its a basic command tool. Its taught at officer candidate school. Its just not usually used this... literally in the field.
Crashdown Graph four: Execution. We will assault the Cylon launch site from the northwest, using--
Baltar Oh, come on. This is absurd. What, were talking on the Cylon army, are we? Us? Look at us. What, with two rifles and a canteen? Have you lost your mind--?
Tyrol Thats enough, doctor.
Baltar Is it? Look, no disrespect, but why are we always going uphill? Does anybody else think that this plan is frakking nuts? Ill tell you whats fair. This is fair. Well have a show of hands--
Tyrol No! Absolutely not! This is not a democracy! The El-Tees in charge! The El-Tees in charge. No ifs, no ands, no buts. He say we go, we go. Theres no questions...
Baltar Weve already lost two men, Chief! How many more people are we gonna lose?
Tyrol You need to sit down. And shut up right now.
Baltar Nobody tells me to shut up. Im the Vice President--
Tyrol You need to sit down and shut up right now. Baltar cowers and sits down. Your briefing, El-Tee.
Crashdown Thank you, Chief. Graph four. Well approach the Cylon launch site from the northwest, using natural ground cover to mask our approach. Our objective is the command and control console. once we reach this position, Cally, youre gonna flank out to the left, making a feint on the Cylon position. Hopefully drawing their fire long enough for me and Seelix to flank out to the right and get a shot at the console. Tyrol, you and the Vice President will stay at position one, and provide covering fire for both flanking maneuvers.
Roslin I have been given the opportunity to perceive the scriptures more clearly. Anything that impedes that, I have to view as contrary to the survival of the human species. I trust--
Billy This is ridiculous. Look, she obviously needs her medication. I keep trying to tell anyone thatll listen--
Venner Sounds like shes talking about the scrolls of the Prophet Pythia.
Billy I suppose.
Venner Pythia foretold the rise of a leader. A leader who would lead all humanity to salvation. So say the gods.
Roslin Impedes that action...
Billy You seem to know a lot about the scriptures.
Venner Im from Gemenon. We believe in the literal truth of the scriptures.
Roslin Contrary to the survival of the human...
Billy Corporal Venner? Theres a, uh, a drug that priests sometimes use. Its called chamalla extract.
Ellen Guess its happy hour.
Tigh Whats happy about it? The old man is still in surgery. And I got a boatload of politicians and press demanding to see laura Roslin.
Ellen Let em.
Tigh Yeah, right.
Ellen Shes crazy.
Tigh I know.
Ellen No, no. Really, saul. Shes lost it. I just went down to the brig to see her.
Tigh You did?
Ellen Shes...completely nuts. She doesnt even know where she is anymore.
Tigh Youre kidding.
Ellen You should let em see her. The press, the Quorum. All of em. I mean, the little schoolteachers mind has gone bye-bye. And the Vice President is either missing or dead. That leaves you in unchallenged command of this ship. And this fleet.
Tigh Just until the old man gets back on his feet.
Ellen Well, of course.
Apollo Galactica/Apollo, we are preparing to jump to Kobol.
Dualla Roger that, apollo. You are clear to jump. And good hunting.
Apollo Thank you, Galactica. Lets go find our people.
Cally Okay, cock the rifle, click the safety, open the scope. Okay, cock the rifle, click the safety, open the scope.
#6 One of you will turn against the others.
Baltar During the mission?
#6 Yes.
Baltar One of us will betray the others?
#6 Yes.
Baltar During the attack?
#6 Yes.
Baltar But if the attack fails?
#6 Youll die.
Baltar Not me. I am gods instrument.
#6 God turned his back on Kobol. Turned his back on man and the false gods he worshipped. What happens on Kobol is not his will.
Crashdown Saddle up. Its time to junk some toasters.
Tigh Xo.
Tigh Uh, maybe we should tell them to shove their demand up their collective asses, how about that?
Dualla Yes, sir. I need instructions for the sentries. Theyre asking how to respond.
Tigh Tell them that they are going to get to see what has become of their precious president. You tell them that.
Racetrack I got a transponder signal. Definitely Colonial. Trying to establish a lock. Got it. Northern hemisphere. Looks like mountainous terrain. Theres a valley.
Apollo Take us out of orbit. Signal Raptor Two to form up on us.
Crashdown There they are. All three of em, right where theyre supposed to be. All right, people, this is it. Were going in. Cally, move up the tree line to point alpha.
Tyrol Whoa, whoa, whoa. El-tee, theres five Cylons at the launch site.
Crashdown What?
Baltar Somethings wrong, isnt it? Somethings wrong with the plan--
Crashdown Quiet down, Theres nothing wrong. Theres just a couple Cylons that we didnt account for. That makes for seven Cylons. Five here, and two up at the dish. Are you absolutely certain about the two guards at the dish?
Baltar I know what I saw.
Tyrol Maybe there are only five Cylons. They just changed their deployment. They brought the two that were guarding the dish down here. Now the dish is unprotected.
Crashdown Gods, Chief, that dish is, like, almost a click away.
Tyrol So what? Its unprotected. We can go take it out. We dont have to take on the whole Cylon army.
Baltar What the hell was that?
Crashdown Sonic booms.
Tyrol Spacecraft entering the upper atmosphere.
Crashdown Its the SAR mission. Theyre here. They are right up there, Chief. We gotta go. Theres no time for discussion. All right, everyone, move out. Its game time. Were taking these toasters out before they kill any more of us.
Crashdown Cally, I said move.
Cally I cant.
Crashdown What? Thats an order.
Tyrol She doesnt have to. We can just go take out the dish.
Crashdown Cally, you have to move. Cally, this is not a joke. Go. This is not a game, Cally. Go. We have people counting on us. Theyre up there, Cally. Move!
Tyrol Listen to me. We still have time to double back and take out the dish.
Crashdown Shut up for a second. Cally, Cally. Specialist. You have your orders. I need you to go out there and create a distraction now! Move! Move!
Sellix There were only supposed to be three Cylons and now there are five. How are we supposed to take on five Cylons?
Crashdown Frak orders, frak court marshal. Our people are up there. We have to save them. We dont have any time. Move!
Cally I cant do it.
Crashdown I said move!
Cally No!
Tyrol Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey. Put it down. Put it down.
Crashdown Youre going out there, Cally. Youre going out there or Im gonna blow your brains out. Right here, right now.
Tyrol Put it down. Hey, El-Lee. Easy. Take it easy.
Crashdown Im gonna count to three.
Sellix This is crazy. This is crazy!
Crashdown one.
Tyrol Put it down right now.
Seelix Oh, my gods.
Tyrol Listen to me! Drop your weapon.
Crashdown Two. Three.
Tyrol Fall back! Fall back! Go! Go! Go!
Apollo Eta?
Sellix Cally! Oh, Cally! Come on, quick.
Tyrol Aaah! Doc! Gimme the launcher! Gimme the launcher, Doc! Come on!
Racetrack Missiles! Theres a battery down there!
Apollo Evasive! Break, break, break!
Racetrack No lock. No lock! Theyre not locking on us.
Sellix Chief.
Tyrol Stay there! Stay there!
Baltar Cheif! Cheif!
Apollo Youre welcome.
Tigh Viewing time at the zoo.
Zarek Glad to see you hold the president in such high esteem.
Tigh Your days gonna come, laughing boy. Lets go.
Tigh All right, the show is over. Lets give her some privacy. Everybody out. Lets go back to the ward room and well, uh, talk about the business of how we proceed from here.
Roslin Thank you all for coming. I have a statement Id like to make. The attempted military coup against the lawful government of the colonies is illegal, illadvised and clearly doomed to failure. I haev not resigned the Presidency and I will fight this action with everything at my command.
Tigh Shes crazy, shes nuts. She thinks she a prophet or some such nonesense.
Porter Just hold on Colonel let her speak.
Tigh Just ask her, ask her, shell tell you. Just listen to her. What was it, the uhh, the Arrow of Apollo will open the uhh, the Tomb of Artemis. Or some such nonesense.
Roslin Everything Ive done is consistant and logical. We have found Kobol, we have found the city of the gods and when we retrieve the arrow we will open the tomb of Athena and we find the road to Earth.
Porter Madam President, have you read the Scrolls of Pythia?
Roslin Many times, and I humbly believe I am fullfilling the roll of the leader.
Tigh Okay, enough of this nonesense, everyone out.
Zarek Wait a minute, wait a minute. Sarah. You represent Gemenon, you know more about the scrolls and the scriptures than anyone else here, why dont you speak up?
Porter The scrolls tell us that a dying leader will lead us to salvation.
Tigh Shes not dying. Shes crazy.
Roslin I am dying. I have terminal breast cancer. Dr. Cottle will verify the diagnosis. I have a few months to live. And in that time, I willÂ  lead the people to salvation. It is my sole purpose.
Porter Praise be to the gods. Here is our salvation.
Tigh Sergeant of the guard,
Marine Yes sir
Tigh Remove these people from the brig and escort them back to their shuttle.
Marine Yes sir.
Roslin Thank you, Corporal.
Apollo Its a hell of a butchers bill, Chief. How did crashdown die?
Baltar Leading the charge. He gave his life in the-- in the finest tradition of the service.
Tyrol Yeah. He was a hero. To the end.
#6 Im so proud of you Giaus.
Baltar Why? Cause Ive taken a life?
#6 Its what makes you human.
Baltar Is it? Not conscious thought? Not poetry or art or music, literature? Murder. Murder is my heritage. Is that the lesson ImÂ  supposed to pass on to our child?
#6 Shh. Itll be all right, Gaius.
Apollo Okay, Doctor, we gotta go! Doctor, come on! We gotta go.
#6 Ill be your conscience.
Cottle Hell live.
Tigh When will he wake up?
Cottle Knowing him, when he damn well wants to, probably.
Tigh I really frakked things up for you, Bill.
Tigh The events which took place aboard Colonial one are unfortunate. Laura roslins actions in suborning mutiny and sedition among the military could not be tolerated. Therefore commander adama was left with no choice other than to remove her from office. Miss Roslin is now resting comfortably aboard this ship, where she will remain until such time as the commander deems otherwise.
Tigh As it appears obvious that the government cannot function under the current circumstances, I have decided to dissolve the Quorum of Twelve. And as of this moment, I have declared martial law.
Tigh Get those people the hell off my ship.
Marine Yes, sir.
