crashdown Lords of Kobol, take these brave men into your arms. Take upon your arms the spirits of our fallen-- takeup in your arms the spirits of our fallen friends so that they may share in the everlasting life that awaits us all beyond the vale of tears. So say we all.
All#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode03 So say we all.
number_six Nothing awaits them. No eternal life, no damnation. only oblivion.
dr_gaius_baltar Because they havent seen the face of god, I take it.
number_six Because they died here. on Kobol.
dr_gaius_baltar I see.
chief_galen_tyrol Doc...lets go. Were moving out. Doc, you hear me? Were moving out.
dr_gaius_baltar I did hear you, Chief. I just dont respond to the title Doc. A dock is a platform for loading and unloading material. My title is doctor,or mr. Vice president, if you dont mind.
chief_galen_tyrol You are loading, are you not? El-tee? El-tee! Crash!
crashdown Hmm? Oh, yeah, Chief, Ill be right there.
chief_galen_tyrol No Cylons.
crashdown You sure?
chief_galen_tyrol Uh-oh. Wait a minute. Tree line, two oclock.
crashdown Got em. What are they doing?
chief_galen_tyrol Looks like theyre dismantling the ship.
crashdown Why? Why not just use it to fly the hell out of here?
chief_galen_tyrol I dont know. I cant tell. Theyre...dragging it into the tree line. Its, uh... oh, wait oh minute. Theyre building something.
crashdown Chief, is that A...
chief_galen_tyrol A missile. Theyre building a missile battery.
crashdown Well, at least we know why theyre not chasing us.
dr_gaius_baltar Why? Why arent they chasing us?
chief_galen_tyrol Because they dont have to. They can just sit back, launch a missile barrage thatll wipe out every living thing in this valley.
dr_cottle Next time I say im in a hurry, cycle the damn air lock faster. Is this your first day?
billy_keikeya Doctor, thank the gods, youre here. The president needs your help.
dr_cottle Move.
dr_cottle Okay... lets have some vitals.Like now.
paramedic_howard_kim Two bullets, 9mm. This one lacerated the spleen, the other one nicked the aorta. Now, weve removed the spleen, and we thought we repaired the aorta, but--
medic_layne_ishay Over the past few hours, his B.P.S dropped down again. Its only 80 over 40. And his heart rates creeping into the 130s.
dr_cottle Well, you missed something. Hes still hemorrhaging somewhere. Were gonna lose him unless we can stop that bleeding. Get me an A.B.G., C.B.C., And coags, and get set up for a rapid sequence intubation.
colonel_saul_tigh Is he gonna make it?
dr_cottle How should I know? Im not a psychic. Now get the hell out of here.
dr_cottle It is a mess in here. Looks like the mesenteric artery may have been damaged. 3.7 mac. God damn it, Kim, learn the instruments. I said a 3.7 mac!
paramedic_howard_kim Sorry
dr_cottle Clamp. Clamp!
medic_layne_ishay Dr. Cottle, his pressures dropping. Its 60 on 30. Heart rates starting to fall. I dont think he can last much longer.
dr_cottle Just stay focused. Get some more suction in here so I can see what Im doing.
billy_keikeya Ahem. Colonel... hows the commander?
colonel_saul_tigh What?
billy_keikeya Uh, ahem, hows the Commander?
colonel_saul_tigh Hes still in surgery. Whats on your mind?
billy_keikeya Uh, I need some medication for the president.
colonel_saul_tigh Shes not the president anymore. Cottles a little busy right now.
billy_keikeya Sir, shes very ill...
colonel_saul_tigh Why arent youin the brig?
billy_keikeya Um... because... no one put me in there?
colonel_saul_tigh What the hells all this? Why arent you in the brig?
cpt_lee_adama Im on duty, sir. Planning the search and rescue mission.
colonel_saul_tigh Search and rescue? For who? We lose a plane, and nobody tells me?!
cpt_lee_adama For our raptor crew down on the surface of Kobol, sir?
colonel_saul_tigh Simes is senior pilot now. He can plan the sar.
cpt_lee_adama You asked me to command the air group when Im on duty. And Im on duty. So am I in command... or not?
colonel_saul_tigh Whats the status of the sar, captain?
cpt_lee_adama Well, we dont know in what area Raptor 3 went down. So the only realistic chance we have of finding her is to hope that her transponder disaster beacon is still functioning. I intend to take two raptors, one with medical personnel, and make five low level orbits of the planet.
colonel_saul_tigh What about the Cylon base ship that Lieutenant Valerii supposedly destroyed? What if she was lying?
cpt_lee_adama Racetrack confirmed the destruction of the base ship, and I checked the gun camera footage from the raptors, which verifies it.
colonel_saul_tigh Lieutenant Gaeta, why are you hovering about?
lt_felix_gaeta Uh, its the press.
colonel_saul_tigh The press?
lt_felix_gaeta Theyre demanding to know how much longer we plan on holding them, and when they can contact their home ships.
colonel_saul_tigh They demand? Theyre in no position to demand anything. You tell them to shut their yaps. Well get to them in due time.
officer_anastasia_dualla Excuse me, Colonel. Shuttle from the Zephyr has just requested permission to enter the landing pattern.
colonel_saul_tigh The zephyr?
officer_anastasia_dualla Yes, sir. Evidently the Quorum of Twelve is aboard. Theyre demanding to see you.
colonel_saul_tigh They demand?
cpt_lee_adama Demanding job, commanding a Battlestar.
colonel_saul_tigh Clear them to land. Put them in the ward room and hold them there until I have time to see them.
president_laura_roslin Aah!
billy_keikeya Madam president.
cpl_venner Whats wrong with her?
billy_keikeya I dont know, but shes clearly sick. You can see that, cant you?
cpl_venner Well, theres nothing I can do.
billy_keikeya Madam president...
president_laura_roslin Yes?
billy_keikeya Can I get you anything while youre in the brig?
president_laura_roslin Ohh... ohh... really? No, thank you. Im sorry. Im finding it... hard to think. Its withdrawal.
billy_keikeya The chamalla?
president_laura_roslin Yes.
billy_keikeya Im trying to get you more.
president_laura_roslin Go fast.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson I count... six missiles being carried into the forest site so far.
dr_gaius_baltar Its all so pointless. We kill them. And they kill us. So we kill more of them. They kill more of us. Whats the point anymore?
number_six You and your...race invented murder. Invented killing for sport, greed, envy. Its mans one true art form.
dr_gaius_baltar Youve done some killing of your own, I think.
number_six Yes, well,were youre children. You taught us well.
dr_gaius_baltar Why does god want to bring a child into this kind of world anyway?
number_six Because, despite everything, despite all of it, he still wants to offer you salvation. Our child will bring that salvation, but only if you accept your role as her father. And her guardian.
dr_gaius_baltar Im not ready for that. All right? Im not a father. Im not a guardian. Im not a moral leader capable of leading anyone. Let alone a baby.
number_six Be a man, Gaius.
dr_gaius_baltar What?
number_six Be a man. Whatever else you are, you are that. The time is coming when youll have to act like one.
chief_galen_tyrol Wait a minute, wait a minute. El-tee, check this out.
crashdown What do you got, Chief?
chief_galen_tyrol 45 degrees east of the launcher. You see that tree stump?
crashdown What the hell is that?
chief_galen_tyrol It looks like a dradis dish. At least, the Cylon version of a dradis dish. Its probably salvaged from the nose cone of the ship. Theyre building an anti-aircraft battery.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Anti-aircraft? For what? There are no otheraircraft around here.
chief_galen_tyrol The Galacticas gonna send a search and rescue team. When they do, thats at least two raptors doing a low pass over the crash site. When those raptors come looking for us, risking their lives to rescue us...
crashdown Cylons will shoot em down.
cpt_lee_adama Seven birds down for repairs. Three out on picket duty with the cap.
officer_anastasia_dualla Uh, con traffic, sir. Priority messages are on top.
colonel_saul_tigh Cut to the chase, Captain! How long before you launch the sar? Come on, Dee, these are all marked priority.
officer_anastasia_dualla Sorry, sir, thats how they came in.
cpt_lee_adama Im cannibalizing 305 for parts. Should be up in the air in, I dont know, 90 minutes.
colonel_saul_tigh 90minutes?! We got men down on that frakking planet! Get your head in the game. You do your job, or go back to the brig. Are on the members of the Quorum in the ward room?
officer_anastasia_dualla All 12, sir.
colonel_saul_tigh Dont suppose you wanna do this for me?
officer_anastasia_dualla Never was much for public speaking, sir.
sarah_porter Why have you imprisoned the president?
marshall_bagot So why are we here under guard? Thats what I want to know.
colonel_saul_tigh Laura Roslin suborned mutiny and sedition aboard this ship. She caused a key military asset to be lost at a critical moment! The Commander felt he had no choice but to remove her from power.
sarah_porter Youve said that, several times.
marshall_bagot You dont seem to be listening, Colonel. It does not matter what Adama felt. He had absolutely no authority--
tom_zarek Adama knew exactly what he was doing. He was paving the way to declare martial law and usher in a military dictatorship. Isnt that right, Colonel?
colonel_saul_tigh I cant speak for the commander. Hes still in surgery.
tom_zarek Well, you seem to be giving the orders around here. So what exactly are you planning to do? Are you declaring martial law?
colonel_saul_tigh Absolutely not. I know for a fact that the old man hated the very idea of martial law. He believed in freedom and democracy and all that good stuff.
tom_zarek Well, since this is still a...democracy, and all that good stuff, I move that the quorum demand immediate access to President Roslin.
marshall_bagot Excellent. I second it.
sarah_porter All those in favor.
sarah_porter Motion carries. Colonel, we demand immediate access to the president.
colonel_saul_tigh I will take your demand under advisement.
ellen_tigh Madam president.
president_laura_roslin Clearly, and anything that impedes that understanding--
ellen_tigh Madam President.
president_laura_roslin I have to consider--
ellen_tigh Laura. Laura.
president_laura_roslin Hello.
ellen_tigh Hi. Are you all right? I, uh, just came down to see if there was anything I could do for you. Anything I can get you?
president_laura_roslin I would like to have a conversation with my attorney. Could you arrange that?
ellen_tigh Yeah. Yeah, sure, right. Laura, do you know where you are?
president_laura_roslin Im in jail.
ellen_tigh Whats my name?
president_laura_roslin Have we met? Im... Im sorry. Excuse me. Theres just...a ringing. She curls up into a ball and starts rocking. Excuse me.
ellen_tigh Ringing? Ohh. Right. Okay, then. Take care.
president_laura_roslin Ohh! Ohh... oh. Oh, my gods. Ellen Tigh. Ellen?
crashdown The launcher looks like a simple point-and-shoot. No built-in guidance. Ordnance appear to be standard ship-to-ship missiles. Theyre modifying them for atmospheric flight.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson one Cylon sentrywalks the perimeter, stopping at regular intervals.
dr_gaius_baltar The dradis dish that controls the missiles is on the 4.5 kg wavelength, judging by the diameter. Its guarded by two centurions, I think.
crashdown Im sorry, Doc, did you say it was guarded by two centurions?
dr_gaius_baltar Yes, I did.
crashdown Okay, is the dradis guarded continuously of intermittently?
dr_gaius_baltar I saw two centurions through the field glasses...continuously, for five minutes. In that time, they didnt leave their post.
crashdown So theres three toasters near the launcher. Two more out by the dish. Thats a lot of Cylons. You ever handle a weapon?
dr_gaius_baltar Who, me? No. Im not a soldier, Crashdown.
crashdown Ill try to give you the most simple assignment, but Im gonna need every man.
chief_galen_tyrol Youre not suggesting we attack the Cylons?
crashdown We owe it to Socinus and Tarn to tack the frakkers out before they kill anyone else. We have equal numbers. We have the element of surprise. Therefore, we have the initiative. We can attack at the time and place of our choosing.
chief_galen_tyrol El-tee, a word... in private.
dr_gaius_baltar Hes crazy. Im not trained for this kind of thing. Ive never fired a gun in my life.
ensign_diana_seelix I havent fired one since basic.
dr_gaius_baltar You?
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson I just joined to pay for dental school.
chief_galen_tyrol Basic ground assault was a long time ago. For all of us. Those arent training officers out there. Theyre programmed killing machines.
crashdown We dont have any choice. Galactica will definitely be sending a search and rescue party. Its just a matter of time. And if we dont take out that launcher--
chief_galen_tyrol We cant go up against an armed and defended position like that. Theyll wipe us out in the first two minutes.
crashdown Thats enough! Chief, look, under the circumstances, its important that you keep your cool.
chief_galen_tyrol I dont believe ive lost my cool.
crashdown I disagree. Look, I dont want to attack the launcher either, but its our duty. We owe it to the rescue party, and we owe it to Socinus and Tarn.
chief_galen_tyrol I fail to see what this has to do with Socinus and Tarn.
crashdown Maybe thats why Im an officer, and youre not. Dismissed.
crashdown This briefing will outling a plan of attack in five graphs. Graph one: Situation. Our situation is that we are stranded on Kobol with a group of five Cylons who plan to use an AAu to destroy any SAR craft sent to find us. There are no friendly forces present.
dr_gaius_baltar Whats all this graph business?
chief_galen_tyrol Its a five-paragraph order. Its a basic command tool. Its taught at officer candidate school. Its just not usually used this... literally in the field.
crashdown Graph four: Execution. We will assault the Cylon launch site from the northwest, using--
dr_gaius_baltar Oh, come on. This is absurd. What, were talking on the Cylon army, are we? Us? Look at us. What, with two rifles and a canteen? Have you lost your mind--?
chief_galen_tyrol Thats enough, doctor.
dr_gaius_baltar Is it? Look, no disrespect, but why are we always going uphill? Does anybody else think that this plan is frakking nuts? Ill tell you whats fair. This is fair. Well have a show of hands--
chief_galen_tyrol No! Absolutely not! This is not a democracy! The El-Tees in charge! The El-Tees in charge. No ifs, no ands, no buts. He say we go, we go. Theres no questions...
dr_gaius_baltar Weve already lost two men, Chief! How many more people are we gonna lose?
chief_galen_tyrol You need to sit down. And shut up right now.
dr_gaius_baltar Nobody tells me to shut up. Im the Vice President--
chief_galen_tyrol You need to sit down and shut up right now. Baltar cowers and sits down. Your briefing, El-Tee.
crashdown Thank you, Chief. Graph four. Well approach the Cylon launch site from the northwest, using natural ground cover to mask our approach. Our objective is the command and control console. once we reach this position, Cally, youre gonna flank out to the left, making a feint on the Cylon position. Hopefully drawing their fire long enough for me and Seelix to flank out to the right and get a shot at the console. Tyrol, you and the Vice President will stay at position one, and provide covering fire for both flanking maneuvers.
president_laura_roslin I have been given the opportunity to perceive the scriptures more clearly. Anything that impedes that, I have to view as contrary to the survival of the human species. I trust--
billy_keikeya This is ridiculous. Look, she obviously needs her medication. I keep trying to tell anyone thatll listen--
cpl_venner Sounds like shes talking about the scrolls of the Prophet Pythia.
billy_keikeya I suppose.
cpl_venner Pythia foretold the rise of a leader. A leader who would lead all humanity to salvation. So say the gods.
president_laura_roslin Impedes that action...
billy_keikeya You seem to know a lot about the scriptures.
cpl_venner Im from Gemenon. We believe in the literal truth of the scriptures.
president_laura_roslin Contrary to the survival of the human...
billy_keikeya Corporal Venner? Theres a, uh, a drug that priests sometimes use. Its called chamalla extract.
ellen_tigh Guess its happy hour.
colonel_saul_tigh Whats happy about it? The old man is still in surgery. And I got a boatload of politicians and press demanding to see laura Roslin.
ellen_tigh Let em.
colonel_saul_tigh Yeah, right.
ellen_tigh Shes crazy.
colonel_saul_tigh I know.
ellen_tigh No, no. Really, saul. Shes lost it. I just went down to the brig to see her.
colonel_saul_tigh You did?
ellen_tigh Shes...completely nuts. She doesnt even know where she is anymore.
colonel_saul_tigh Youre kidding.
ellen_tigh You should let em see her. The press, the Quorum. All of em. I mean, the little schoolteachers mind has gone bye-bye. And the Vice President is either missing or dead. That leaves you in unchallenged command of this ship. And this fleet.
colonel_saul_tigh Just until the old man gets back on his feet.
ellen_tigh Well, of course.
cpt_lee_adama Galactica/Apollo, we are preparing to jump to Kobol.
officer_anastasia_dualla Roger that, apollo. You are clear to jump. And good hunting.
cpt_lee_adama Thank you, Galactica. Lets go find our people.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Okay, cock the rifle, click the safety, open the scope. Okay, cock the rifle, click the safety, open the scope.
number_six One of you will turn against the others.
dr_gaius_baltar During the mission?
number_six Yes.
dr_gaius_baltar One of us will betray the others?
number_six Yes.
dr_gaius_baltar During the attack?
number_six Yes.
dr_gaius_baltar But if the attack fails?
number_six Youll die.
dr_gaius_baltar Not me. I am gods instrument.
number_six God turned his back on Kobol. Turned his back on man and the false gods he worshipped. What happens on Kobol is not his will.
crashdown Saddle up. Its time to junk some toasters.
colonel_saul_tigh Xo.
colonel_saul_tigh Uh, maybe we should tell them to shove their demand up their collective asses, how about that?
officer_anastasia_dualla Yes, sir. I need instructions for the sentries. Theyre asking how to respond.
colonel_saul_tigh Tell them that they are going to get to see what has become of their precious president. You tell them that.
racetrack I got a transponder signal. Definitely Colonial. Trying to establish a lock. Got it. Northern hemisphere. Looks like mountainous terrain. Theres a valley.
cpt_lee_adama Take us out of orbit. Signal Raptor Two to form up on us.
crashdown There they are. All three of em, right where theyre supposed to be. All right, people, this is it. Were going in. Cally, move up the tree line to point alpha.
chief_galen_tyrol Whoa, whoa, whoa. El-tee, theres five Cylons at the launch site.
crashdown What?
dr_gaius_baltar Somethings wrong, isnt it? Somethings wrong with the plan--
crashdown Quiet down, Theres nothing wrong. Theres just a couple Cylons that we didnt account for. That makes for seven Cylons. Five here, and two up at the dish. Are you absolutely certain about the two guards at the dish?
dr_gaius_baltar I know what I saw.
chief_galen_tyrol Maybe there are only five Cylons. They just changed their deployment. They brought the two that were guarding the dish down here. Now the dish is unprotected.
crashdown Gods, Chief, that dish is, like, almost a click away.
chief_galen_tyrol So what? Its unprotected. We can go take it out. We dont have to take on the whole Cylon army.
dr_gaius_baltar What the hell was that?
crashdown Sonic booms.
chief_galen_tyrol Spacecraft entering the upper atmosphere.
crashdown Its the SAR mission. Theyre here. They are right up there, Chief. We gotta go. Theres no time for discussion. All right, everyone, move out. Its game time. Were taking these toasters out before they kill any more of us.
crashdown Cally, I said move.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson I cant.
crashdown What? Thats an order.
chief_galen_tyrol She doesnt have to. We can just go take out the dish.
crashdown Cally, you have to move. Cally, this is not a joke. Go. This is not a game, Cally. Go. We have people counting on us. Theyre up there, Cally. Move!
chief_galen_tyrol Listen to me. We still have time to double back and take out the dish.
crashdown Shut up for a second. Cally, Cally. Specialist. You have your orders. I need you to go out there and create a distraction now! Move! Move!
ensign_diana_seelix There were only supposed to be three Cylons and now there are five. How are we supposed to take on five Cylons?
crashdown Frak orders, frak court marshal. Our people are up there. We have to save them. We dont have any time. Move!
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson I cant do it.
crashdown I said move!
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson No!
chief_galen_tyrol Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey. Put it down. Put it down.
crashdown Youre going out there, Cally. Youre going out there or Im gonna blow your brains out. Right here, right now.
chief_galen_tyrol Put it down. Hey, El-Lee. Easy. Take it easy.
crashdown Im gonna count to three.
ensign_diana_seelix This is crazy. This is crazy!
crashdown one.
chief_galen_tyrol Put it down right now.
ensign_diana_seelix Oh, my gods.
chief_galen_tyrol Listen to me! Drop your weapon.
crashdown Two. Three.
chief_galen_tyrol Fall back! Fall back! Go! Go! Go!
cpt_lee_adama Eta?
ensign_diana_seelix Cally! Oh, Cally! Come on, quick.
chief_galen_tyrol Aaah! Doc! Gimme the launcher! Gimme the launcher, Doc! Come on!
racetrack Missiles! Theres a battery down there!
cpt_lee_adama Evasive! Break, break, break!
racetrack No lock. No lock! Theyre not locking on us.
ensign_diana_seelix Chief.
chief_galen_tyrol Stay there! Stay there!
dr_gaius_baltar Cheif! Cheif!
cpt_lee_adama Youre welcome.
colonel_saul_tigh Viewing time at the zoo.
tom_zarek Glad to see you hold the president in such high esteem.
colonel_saul_tigh Your days gonna come, laughing boy. Lets go.
colonel_saul_tigh All right, the show is over. Lets give her some privacy. Everybody out. Lets go back to the ward room and well, uh, talk about the business of how we proceed from here.
president_laura_roslin Thank you all for coming. I have a statement Id like to make. The attempted military coup against the lawful government of the colonies is illegal, illadvised and clearly doomed to failure. I haev not resigned the Presidency and I will fight this action with everything at my command.
colonel_saul_tigh Shes crazy, shes nuts. She thinks she a prophet or some such nonesense.
sarah_porter Just hold on Colonel let her speak.
colonel_saul_tigh Just ask her, ask her, shell tell you. Just listen to her. What was it, the uhh, the Arrow of Apollo will open the uhh, the Tomb of Artemis. Or some such nonesense.
president_laura_roslin Everything Ive done is consistant and logical. We have found Kobol, we have found the city of the gods and when we retrieve the arrow we will open the tomb of Athena and we find the road to Earth.
sarah_porter Madam President, have you read the Scrolls of Pythia?
president_laura_roslin Many times, and I humbly believe I am fullfilling the roll of the leader.
colonel_saul_tigh Okay, enough of this nonesense, everyone out.
tom_zarek Wait a minute, wait a minute. Sarah. You represent Gemenon, you know more about the scrolls and the scriptures than anyone else here, why dont you speak up?
sarah_porter The scrolls tell us that a dying leader will lead us to salvation.
colonel_saul_tigh Shes not dying. Shes crazy.
president_laura_roslin I am dying. I have terminal breast cancer. Dr. Cottle will verify the diagnosis. I have a few months to live. And in that time, I will lead the people to salvation. It is my sole purpose.
sarah_porter Praise be to the gods. Here is our salvation.
colonel_saul_tigh Sergeant of the guard,
marine Yes sir
colonel_saul_tigh Remove these people from the brig and escort them back to their shuttle.
marine Yes sir.
president_laura_roslin Thank you, Corporal.
cpt_lee_adama Its a hell of a butchers bill, Chief. How did crashdown die?
dr_gaius_baltar Leading the charge. He gave his life in the-- in the finest tradition of the service.
chief_galen_tyrol Yeah. He was a hero. To the end.
number_six Im so proud of you Giaus.
dr_gaius_baltar Why? Cause Ive taken a life?
number_six Its what makes you human.
dr_gaius_baltar Is it? Not conscious thought? Not poetry or art or music, literature? Murder. Murder is my heritage. Is that the lesson Im supposed to pass on to our child?
number_six Shh. Itll be all right, Gaius.
cpt_lee_adama Okay, Doctor, we gotta go! Doctor, come on! We gotta go.
number_six Ill be your conscience.
dr_cottle Hell live.
colonel_saul_tigh When will he wake up?
dr_cottle Knowing him, when he damn well wants to, probably.
colonel_saul_tigh I really frakked things up for you, Bill.
colonel_saul_tigh The events which took place aboard Colonial one are unfortunate. Laura roslins actions in suborning mutiny and sedition among the military could not be tolerated. Therefore commander adama was left with no choice other than to remove her from office. Miss Roslin is now resting comfortably aboard this ship, where she will remain until such time as the commander deems otherwise.
colonel_saul_tigh As it appears obvious that the government cannot function under the current circumstances, I have decided to dissolve the Quorum of Twelve. And as of this moment, I have declared martial law.
colonel_saul_tigh Get those people the hell off my ship.
marine Yes, sir.
