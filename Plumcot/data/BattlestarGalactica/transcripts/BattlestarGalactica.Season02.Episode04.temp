Tigh Youre sweating.
Tyrol Its hot in here.
Tigh How long have you known Lieutenant Valerii was planning to assassinate Commander Adama?
Tyrol I had no idea she was planning anything of the kind.
Tigh You were frakkin her.
Tyrol I ended that weeks ago, on your orders.
Tigh You covered for her, you lied for her.
Tyrol I admit i used bad judgment.
Tigh You protected her at every turn.
Tyrol Colonel, I had no idea she was a Cylon. Id like to exercise my article 21 rights at this time.
Tigh Oh, Im sure you would. I guess you havent heard. Cylons dont have rights.
Tyrol Cylon? Wait a minute.
Tigh You know what we do with Cylons, Chief?
Tyrol Im not a Cylon.
Tigh Roslin came up with the execution method.
Tyrol Im galen Tyrol!
Tigh She put a Cylon out of the airlock.
Tyrol My father was a priest! My mother was an oracle. Ive served on battlestars since I was 18 years old. The Pegasus, Columbia,  Atlantia, Galactica--
Tigh Dont talk to me like youre a soldier! You are not a soldier!
Tyrol Uhh!
Tigh The old man always had a soft spot for you. Let him decide what to do with you.
Tyrol Colonel, you gotta believe me. I am not a Cylon. Id never do anything to hurt Adama. I love the old man.
Tigh Thats what your girlfriend said. Get him the hell out of here!
Boomer Chief? I thought you were on kobol.
Tyrol Dont. Dont...you...talk to me. Dont come near me. Dont touch me. If you do, I swear... I will kill you.
SueShaun No sign of centurions on the perimeter.
Anders I dont like it. The human toasters dont go anywhere alone.
SueShaun Think theyre bait?
Anders Well, a pair of Cylons dont just drive up here in broad daylight. Not after we hit that convoy last week.
SueShaun Frakkin-A.
Anders All right, screw it. Pass word for everybody to sight in. I wanna blow these Cylons away before they ever knew what hit them.
SueShaun Got it.
Helo Why? You dont know?
Starbuck Youre the navigator.
Helo You were driving.
Starbuck Allright we can head towards Gups Point. Theres an emergency airstrip there.
Helo No. Ive been. I was thinking we could head southwest.
Starbuck Did you hear that?
Helo Drive through a lot of bad neighborhoods?
Starbuck Better safe than sorry.
Helo I hear that.
Starbuck Were sitting ducks down here!
Helo You go, Ill cover!
Starbuck Why me?
Helo Dont start!
Starbuck Fine!
Helo You ready?
Starbuck Yeah.
Helo Go!
Helo Five of them, split up between nine and one. 50 meters.
Starbuck Ready? Go!
Starbuck Didnt see any shiny silver out there. I think were dealing with the human variety.
Helo Hope so--theyre not as tough as mechanicals.
Starbuck They do bleed good, though. You gotta like that.
Helo Lets get out of here! Come on!
Cally They locked the Chief up with boomer. Tigh thinks hes a Cylon.
Baltar I know. Im gonna see the Colonel now. I think he wants me to find a way to clear the Chief. Or...
Cally Or what? Throw him out the airlock like a piece of garbage? If Commander Adama were in charge, this would never happen.
Baltar Yes, but hes not in charge, is he?
Cally No, but Ive known the Chief for years. Hes no toaster.
Baltar He was involved with Lieutenant Valerii, who most certainly is a toaster.
#6 That word is racist. I dont like it.
Cally Sure...hes shown some bad judgment getting involved with her. But that doesnt mean hes a toaster. Youve got to help him.
#6 Say something, gaius. Tell her you wont have racial epithets used in your presence.
Baltar Im very sorry. I was gonna tell the Colonel theres nothing I can do. The Cylon detector I developed doesnt work. Clearly.
Cally No! Youve got to help him.
#6 Your childs gonna be half toaster. How does that make you feel?
Baltar Nothing could make me happier. I just dont know what Id possibly say.  Excuse me.
Cally He helped you! He didnt tell anyone what you did on Kobol. What you did to Crashdown.
Baltar What I did to Crashdown saved your life. Are you blackmailing me?
Cally Help the Chief to help yourself, Doctor.
Baltar Yes, Doctor. Thats what youre best at, isnt it?
Dualla Deck log.
Tigh What the hells the matter with your Cylon detector, Doctor? You gave the assassin a pass.
Baltar Yes, but that was a beta test, a preliminary. Clearly I hadnt perfected my methodology, and she slipped through.
Dualla Fuel report.
Tigh So that the hell are you telling me here? That we are back to square one? That no ones results are definitive? That we have no way of knowing who are the Cylons among us?
Baltar No, Im saying that since Valeriis te-- since the assassins test, Ive developed a new set of protocols which should  eliminate any errors--anomalies-- that cropped up earlier--
Tigh For gods sake--
Baltar If you let me test the Chiefs blood, I might be able to tell once and for all if--
Tigh No if--I want a definitive answer. No more of your weasely techno babble. Hes a Cylon or hes not. So get down there and do something right for a change.
Baltar I am the Vice-President. Legally speaking, if the President is incapacitated, shouldnt I take over her duties--
Tigh Legally speaking, I have declared martial law. That makes you nobody. So...unless you want to join Roslin in the brig, I suggest you get to work.
Baltar Its good to see you, Colonel.
#6 Arent you getting tired of the continual humiliation? The disrespect from mechanics and Colonels alike?
Baltar What do you think?
#6 Maybe its time to do something about it.
Geata Sir.
Tigh What is this?
Geata The fleet captains are reporting protests among the civilians. Demonstrations, petitions, even some civil disobedience. All over the declaration of martial law. Sir, theres more. The Aturian refining vessel has stopped refining tylium. They say if they dont have a voice in the government--
Tigh What?!
Geata Their captain says theyll send fuel once the civilian government has been restored. And three other ships are also refusing to resupply Galactica until the Presidents reinstated.
Apollo And I got a note from combat warning about problems with Tylium resupply. So watch your fuel burn till further notice. Questions.
Pilot Yeah, when, uh, when you coming back to the card game?
Apollo Im afraid when Im off duty Ill be enjoying the intimate surroundings of the brig until...ah, well, until further notice.
Hotdog Come on back. We miss you, Captain.
Pilot We could bring the game to you.
Apollo Somehow I doubt Colonel Tigh would approve.
Pilot Oh come on.
Hotdog Ones going on tomorrow night!
Apollo Hey, all right, all right.
Apollo Hey! Knock it off!
Sgt Morning, sir.
Apollo Sergeant. Shall we?
Apollo Morning, Dee. Fancy meeting you here.
Dualla I was just on my way, sir. Hey, guys.
Sgt Hows it going, Dee?
Dualla Good, thanks.
Apollo Hows my father today?
Dualla Uh, Commander Adamas the same...Captain. Hes sedated. Resting comfortably since the surgery. Trouble brewing in the fleet, though.
Apollo Oh, Im shocked. What kind of trouble?
Dualla Martial law isnt going down too well. Protests, demonstrations. Some ships are even refusing to resupply Galactica.
Apollo And this is the honeymoon period. Whats a dictator to do?
Dualla I, um, I wish... I wish you were in command, sir.
Apollo Dee...
Dualla Hes hitting the bottle. A lot.
Apollo Thank you for the company, Petty Officer Dualla.
Dualla Youre welcome, sir.
Ellen You okay, baby?
Tigh No, Im not okay. My head feels like its gonna roll off my shoulders.
Ellen What are you working on?
Tigh Im trying to figure out how to solve our resupply problem now that half the fleet has gone out on strike.
Ellen You serious?
Tigh Yes, Im serious. I should probably call a summit sit-down with all our ships captains and explain the situation and tell them why I had to declare martial law.
Ellen Screw them. Like you have to explain yourself to them.
Tigh It wouldnt hurt. It would cool things down a little. What?
Ellen Nothing. No, no, no, its... youre the boss. Far be it from me to tell you how to do your job. I know thats one of your issues.
Tigh Just say it.
Ellen I dont know, it just feels kind of... touchy-feely. You know, Lets all sit down and talk about how we feel about martial law. Bill would never do that. But you gotta do what you gotta do. I mean, Bill may never get on his feet again. Honey...honey, you handle this the way you want. Theyll respect that. Eventually.
Tigh This is the XO. Mr. Gaeta, send the following to all ships captains. Message begins: Resupply operations of this ship are not--repeat, not-- optional. All ships to recommence scheduled supply runs immediately. Failure to comply will result in... stern measures. Message ends. You happy now?
Starbuck Ill flake.
Helo Ill draw fire.
Starbuck Can I have a word with you? Were not Cylons.
Anders Right. Youre human. You have a soul. You swim in the stream. We heard it all before.
Helo Hey, colonial fleet. Notice the uniforms?
Anders Yeah, right, weve seen Cylons in uniform before. Were human.
Starbuck Yeah, right. Everyone on caprica is dead.
Anders Youre not.
Starbuck I just got here. I want to hear some names.
Anders Im Anders.
Helo Samuel T. Anders?
Anders Yeah, thats right.
Helo This is Jo-man, Rally, Ten-point. Sue-Shaun, Crip-Key, Morris Fink. Kara, these are the Caprica Buccaneers.
Starbuck Hmm. I dont think so.
SueShaun Give me a ball, little girl. Ill shove it up your ass.
Starbuck Please...try.
Helo Okay, since were all getting along so well, can people stop pointing their guns at us.
Starbuck How does a professional pyramid team survive a nuclear holocaust?
Anders We were in the mountains when the Cylons attacked. High altitude training. Weve been on the run ever since.
Starbuck Doing what?
Anders Raiding military stores for ammo. Anti-radiation meds. And plugging toasters whenever they show up.
Helo Same as us.
Starbuck Okay... how many foul breaks did you have in the playoff against Aerilon?
Anders Youre kidding, right?
Starbuck You either have the answer, or you have a bullet.
Anders Three.
Starbuck Wrong. Four.
Anders Three. Last one was called back on instant replay.
Helo Hes right, starbuck. I lost 20 cubits on that game.
Starbuck Fine. For now. on three.
Anders one.
Starbuck Two.
Anders Three.
Starbuck You know you guys suck, right? Cant shoot, cant pass. Sure as hell cant take the point.
Anders Everyones a critic.
Venner Heres your, uh, medication, Madame President. And a little something from the galley.
Roslin Thank you, Corporal Venner. Chamalla and licorice. Would you like some?
Apollo I hate licorice.
Roslin Me too.
Apollo Its interesting he still calls you Madame President. You still have a lot of supporters out there.
Roslin Something ugly is coming. I can feel it.
Gaeta Sir, refinery captains still not cooperating. And now seven other container ships are refusing to release their supplies. Food, medicine, even coffee.
Tigh Coffee? This is getting ridiculous. Frak this. Its time to get their attention. Im sending in the marines. I want a raptor and an armed marine boarding party for every ship refusing the resupply order.
Gaeta Sir, were stretched pretty thin on manpower. Im not sure we have enough marine non-coms to command that many boarding parties, sir.
tigh Well, pull pilots and deck officers to command the boarding parties if you have to. Tell them to get over there and bring back the supplies. Whatever it takes. Make it happen, lieutenant.
Gaeta Yes, sir.
Hammerhead People, step back, all right?! Were just here for the supplies! Just stay out of the way and no one gets hurt! For the last time, step back!
Hammerhead Step back!
Hammergead Cease fire! Cease fire!
Tigh Four civilian dead. How the frak could this have happened?
Cottle Whatd you expect, genius? You put a pilot in charge of crowd control.
Tigh Palladino! Did you give the order to shoot on that crowd?
Hammergead No, sir, of course not. The crowd surrounded us.
Tigh Were they armed?
Hammergead No, sir, but... you had to be there. They were yelling and screaming at us, and then it got violent. They started throwing things, canisters. Coffee, I think.
Tigh Coffee? You shot people for throwing coffee?
Hammergead The crowd was out of control. They were pressing in on us. My men were getting hurt. Somebody took a shot. I dont know who it was. Then all hell broke loose.
Tigh If ever we needed you, Bill, its right now.
Roslin Troops shooting unarmed civilians. This is a travesty. He has truly stepped over the line. Itll cause an explosion in the fleet. The press will have a field day. The ships would begin to splinter. The Cylons will be able to eliminate us a few ships at a time. Weve got to get out of here now.
Apollo I am right with you.
Roslin Im so glad you said that. I want to take Billy and Elosha with me.
Apollo Of course you do. Ive worked out a way of getting us in the hangar deck. And I can get us a raptor. But were still gonna need clearance to get off the ship. I know how to get that.
Roslin You do?
Apollo Mm-hmm.
Roslin Question is, where do we go once we get off this ship?  Well have to find some place to hide in the fleet while we rally support among the people.
Apollo Ive got an idea about that. Youre not going to like it.
Tigh Im not cut out for this. I never was.
Ellen Dont talk like that, saul. This is your moment.
Tigh Me and bill, side by side, that was the deal. It was never supposed to be me alone.
Ellen Well, like it or not, youre in command, so you better deal with it.
Tigh I dont want to deal with it. I do not want to command. Dont you get it? Jeez, why do I listen to you? What are you talk--
Ellen I never told you to send troops out to that ship.
Tigh No, no, you didnt tell me to send troops anywhere. You just manipulate. You always do. You put the knife in, and you twist it.
Ellen Oh, right, youre going to blame me for your own inadequacy?
Tigh Im not blaming you, Ellen.
Tigh I warned you. Im telling you.
Ellen Get off of--
Ellen I love you so much.
Tigh Shut up, Ellen.
Boomer I guess you really must hate me. I dont know if it makes any difference right now, but Im really sorry you got pulled into this. You know, what we had--
Tyrol Was nothing. Nothing. Youre a machine. Im not.
Boomer Well, whatever I am, I know how I felt.
Tyrol Software doesnt have feelings.
Boomer I never meant to hurt you.
Baltar Id like some privacy, please. Ill be fine, thank you.
Baltar And how are we this evening?
Tyrol What do you want?
Baltar Im here to determine whether youre a Cylon or not. Your arm, please.
Boomer His test doesnt work too well. I mean, he gave me the green light.
Baltar The test works... just fine.
Boomer Chief? Chief?
Baltar I lied to you, Sharon. I covered up your true nature from the rest of the fleet for my own purposes.
Boomer What did you do to him? Hes not breathing.
Baltar No, hes dying right now, Sharon. I can save him if you tell me how many Cylons there are left in the fleet.
Boomer I dont know, but Im not getting a pulse.
Baltar Yes, you do. Now, buried deep down in that thing you call a subconscious you know how many.
Boomer I dont know!
Baltar He doesnt have time for this, Sharon. His organs are shutting down. In ten seconds time, hell experience complete brain stem death. Now how many? Do you love him, sharon? only you can save him! Ten... nine... do you love him? Do you love him, Sharon?
Boomer Eight! There are eight.
Anders All right, lets get these weapons unloaded. Lets go! Hit an armory earlier today, about 18 klicks north. Brought home a lot of toys.
Starbuck What is this place?
Anders Delphi union high school. Toasters dont patrol this area. Its good place to get some shut-eye, a bite to eat.
Helo How many people you have here?
Anders 53, we had almost a hundred before the toasters ambushed us last week-- lets go!
Starbuck More pyramid teams?
Anders Nah, just us C-Bucs. Rest are survivalists, hikers mostly.
Helo How many people you have here? Hows your stock of anti-radiation masks?
Anders Raided a couple of hospitals down in Pilgrim Bay. I figured weve got enough for three months. Lets get you some bunk space, come on.
Starbuck 53, huh? Not exactly an army. A hell of a lot better than the two of us if were going to assault an airbase, steal a heavy raider, and get the frak off this planet.
Roslin Ill just be a moment. Doctor... I need your help. But its illegal, dangerous, and in violation of your oath as an officer.
Cottle Youre a lousy salesman.
Billy Corporal! Corporal Venner. I, uh... I just want to tell you how much the President appreciates all the little things you do for her.
Venner Hey, anything I can do to make things easier for her.
Billy Great. She, um... has a special request.
Dualla If I could just get your signature, sir.
Tigh Why are we closing down Causeway B?
Dualla Integrity testing, sir. Got chewed up pretty bad when the toasters boarded us. And weve been getting some pressure drops in there.
Tigh Tell em to get it fixed.  Dee.
Dualla Oh!
Geata Sorry.
Dualla Lieutenant.
Geata Things are pretty frakked up these days, huh?
Dualla Yeah, things are pretty frakked up most days.
Geata If people are upset, they should go through the proper channels.
Dualla Im not sure I understand what--
Geata I was running some maintenance checks, detected a series of scrambled calls going out over the past few hours. You wouldnt happen to know anything about that, would you?
Dualla No, sir. Off-log calls are against regs.
Geata Hmm... thats right.
Apollo Im sure you wont approve. But I guess thats nothing new. I just want you to know that this, um... this isnt about you and me. Good-bye, dad.
Jammer You gonna help out here or what?
Cally Theyre putting the Chief in there, you know?
Jammer I dont care if they put a giant parakeet in here. Colonel says build a cell, we build a cell.
Cally This isnt right. Hes one of us.
Jammer No, hes one of them. He always was. We just never saw it.
Cally No, hes innocent. She tricked him.
Jammer Wow, such loyalty. Were you frakking him too?
Jammer You want to get pissed at someone, you get pissed at Boomer. Shes the one who put the Chief in the cell here, not us.
Dualla Evening, sir.
Apollo Evening, Dee. Fancy meeting you here. Everything set?
Dualla Roger that. Sorry, captain. Cant chit-chat today.
Apollo Captain! Im having trouble with the ordnance tracking on my raptor, sir. I cant get it to cycle. Oh... change of plans, boys. Instead of getting some rack time, I going to take a minute to do the Lieutenants job for her.
Sgt Yes, sir.
Apollo After you.
Marine Sorry.
Venner Okay, make it look good, but not too good.
Private Hold it!
Roslin Private, do you know who I am? Good. You and I have something in common. We each took an oath to protect and defend the Articles of Colonization. Those articles are under attack, as is our entire democratic way of life. Now, my duty wont let me stand here and allow that to happen. So I intend to go through that hatch and get off this ship.
Apollo Damn it. They should be here by now.
Roslin You can either stand aside, or you can shoot me. Youll have to decide where your duty lies.
Private Madame President...
Apollo Madame President, this way.
Roslin Oh Billy...
Billy Madame President. Im not getting on that ship with you.
Roslin What?
Billy I understand what youre trying to do. But its going to divide the fleet. At the very best, itll create an insurgency against Adama. And at the worst, a civil war. Taking part in that is a line that I wont cross.
Apollo We do not have a lot of time.
Billy I wish you well.
Apollo Dustoff two-seven, checkers green, ready for launch on medical mission. Request clearance.
Roslin Good to see you. You okay?
Elosha I think so. My feet barely touched the ground getting here.
Roslin I know what you mean.
Launch_Officer Dustoff two-seven. Standard port three departure approved. Cleared for launch.
Apollo Standard port three, wilco.
Gaeta Sir. Corporal venner reports the former Presidents missing.
Tigh Missing?
Gaeta Two men down, cells empty.
Tigh Damn it. Alert security. Set condition two! No one on or off the ship!
Gaeta Attention, set condition two throughout the ship. Repeat, set condition two throughout the ship. Sir. Flight log records a raptor departed the ship two minutes ago with Doc Cottle on a medical emergency.
Tigh Medical? Confirm that.
Gaeta Dradis has their transponder bearing 2-8-7 carom 0-0-3. Range 2-7.
Tigh Get the cap on the horn and have them intercept. And get Captain Adama out of the brig.
Dualla Sir, Dr. Cottle is still onboard. He says he was forced to request the raptor at gunpoint by Captain Adama.
Tigh Son of a bitch. Dee, put me through to that raptor.
Gaeta Cap has visual on their target.
Tigh Turn that ship around, Apollo, or Ill order the cap to shoot you down.
Apollo Were not turning back.
Tigh Ill do it. Dont think I wont just because youre the old mans son.
Apollo Then do what you have to do, Galactica. Apollo out.
Tigh Fire across their bow.
Dualla Hotdog, Galactica. Fire across their bow.  Acknowledge.
Hotdog Wilco, galactica.
Dualla Hotdog reports theyre notturning around, sir. Where are they now? Dradis shows them approaching cloud nine.
Gaeta Sir, if they dock, we may lose them. Cloud Nine is one of the busiest transport hubs in the fleet. Shuttles coming and going constantly. If they board one and take off, itll be before we can shut down air traffic.
Hotdog Galactica, Hotdog. Request instructions. Galactica, Hotdog. I need further instructions. Do I fire or not?
Tigh Dee... tell hotdog to hold his fire. Repeat, weapons hold. Do not fire.
Dualla Hotdog, Galactica. Weapons hold. Repeat, do not fire.
Tigh They couldnt have done it on their own. Did anybody notice off-log calls? Scrambled communications?
Gaeta No, sir. Nothing.
Apollo Well, were home free for now.
Zarek Good to see you, Madame President.
Roslin Captain Apollo... what is Mr. Zarek doing here?
Apollo Once Tigh gets over his initial shock, hell send troops out to search for us. If were going to make it, we have to keep on the move. I figured mr. Zarek here is the only one in the fleet with enough shady friends around who can possibly hide us.
Zarek Love the way he puts that.
Roslin Well, Mr. Zarek, it would seem the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
Zarek Call me Tom.
Apollo Our shuttles waiting, maam. We have to hurry.
Anders Wow, is that the best you can do?
Starbuck Nice to know installing a regulation pyramid court was one of the priorities of the resistance.
Anders Well, there are some things one cannot live without.
Starbuck Lets go.
Anders Are you kidding me? Ill wipe the court with you.
Starbuck Yeah, well see about that. I was scouted for the pros. Bum knee took me out of contention.
Anders I see. Is that going to be your excuse when I kick your ass? My poor knee hurts.
Starbuck At least I have an excuse. I cant imagine what yours is going to be.
Anders Nice shot.
Starbuck Thanks.
Tyrol Thanks. Thanks, doc. I appreciate it.
Balar Dont thank me. Thank her.
Tyrol Why, what does she have to do with it?
Balar Everything. Nothing. Love is a strange and wonderful thing, Chief. Youd be happy you experienced it at all. Even if it was with a machine.
Tyrol What are they going to do to her?
Balar Theyre setting up a new holding facility. There will be tests. Mental. Physical.
Tyrol Like shes some kind of lab rat?
Balar Thats the idea.
Ellen This is just great. Bill Adamas little baby boy pulls the wool over your eyes, and you let him get away scot-free. Youre a laughingstock. You didnt want this command. Well, dont worry about it. You wont have it for much longer. All because when push came to shove, you got shoved.
Tigh It was his son.
Adama Saul. Whats happening on my ship? Wait in the corridor. Ellen, can I speak to my XO?
Ellen Of course.
Adama Slowly. Whats happened?
Tigh I frakked things up and good.
Adama How?
Tigh I made some bad calls.
Adama Ive done that.
Tigh Not like these.
Adama You gonna pour us one of those or what?
Tigh Yeah.
Adama Never had much use for people who second-guessed my decisions. Especially if theyve never held a command. They dont understand the pressure. You make a call. It affects the lives of thousands. And you have no one to turn to for back-up.
Tigh Well, you make it look easy.
Adama Well, you know thats a lie now.
Tigh A lot of pieces to pick up.
Adama Then well pick em up together. Wheres my son?
Tyrol No, no, no. No, no, no no. No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. Hey, hey, hey. Sshhh, sshh.
Boomer I love you, chief.
