colonel_saul_tigh Youre sweating.
chief_galen_tyrol Its hot in here.
colonel_saul_tigh How long have you known Lieutenant Valerii was planning to assassinate Commander Adama?
chief_galen_tyrol I had no idea she was planning anything of the kind.
colonel_saul_tigh You were frakkin her.
chief_galen_tyrol I ended that weeks ago, on your orders.
colonel_saul_tigh You covered for her, you lied for her.
chief_galen_tyrol I admit i used bad judgment.
colonel_saul_tigh You protected her at every turn.
chief_galen_tyrol Colonel, I had no idea she was a Cylon. Id like to exercise my article 21 rights at this time.
colonel_saul_tigh Oh, Im sure you would. I guess you havent heard. Cylons dont have rights.
chief_galen_tyrol Cylon? Wait a minute.
colonel_saul_tigh You know what we do with Cylons, Chief?
chief_galen_tyrol Im not a Cylon.
colonel_saul_tigh Roslin came up with the execution method.
chief_galen_tyrol Im galen Tyrol!
colonel_saul_tigh She put a Cylon out of the airlock.
chief_galen_tyrol My father was a priest! My mother was an oracle. Ive served on battlestars since I was 18 years old. The Pegasus, Columbia, Atlantia, Galactica--
colonel_saul_tigh Dont talk to me like youre a soldier! You are not a soldier!
chief_galen_tyrol Uhh!
colonel_saul_tigh The old man always had a soft spot for you. Let him decide what to do with you.
chief_galen_tyrol Colonel, you gotta believe me. I am not a Cylon. Id never do anything to hurt Adama. I love the old man.
colonel_saul_tigh Thats what your girlfriend said. Get him the hell out of here!
lt_sharon_valerii Chief? I thought you were on kobol.
chief_galen_tyrol Dont. Dont...you...talk to me. Dont come near me. Dont touch me. If you do, I swear... I will kill you.
sueshaun No sign of centurions on the perimeter.
samuel_anders I dont like it. The human toasters dont go anywhere alone.
sueshaun Think theyre bait?
samuel_anders Well, a pair of Cylons dont just drive up here in broad daylight. Not after we hit that convoy last week.
sueshaun Frakkin-A.
samuel_anders All right, screw it. Pass word for everybody to sight in. I wanna blow these Cylons away before they ever knew what hit them.
sueshaun Got it.
captain_karl_agathon Why? You dont know?
captain_kara_thrace Youre the navigator.
captain_karl_agathon You were driving.
captain_kara_thrace Allright we can head towards Gups Point. Theres an emergency airstrip there.
captain_karl_agathon No. Ive been. I was thinking we could head southwest.
captain_kara_thrace Did you hear that?
captain_karl_agathon Drive through a lot of bad neighborhoods?
captain_kara_thrace Better safe than sorry.
captain_karl_agathon I hear that.
captain_kara_thrace Were sitting ducks down here!
captain_karl_agathon You go, Ill cover!
captain_kara_thrace Why me?
captain_karl_agathon Dont start!
captain_kara_thrace Fine!
captain_karl_agathon You ready?
captain_kara_thrace Yeah.
captain_karl_agathon Go!
captain_karl_agathon Five of them, split up between nine and one. 50 meters.
captain_kara_thrace Ready? Go!
captain_kara_thrace Didnt see any shiny silver out there. I think were dealing with the human variety.
captain_karl_agathon Hope so--theyre not as tough as mechanicals.
captain_kara_thrace They do bleed good, though. You gotta like that.
captain_karl_agathon Lets get out of here! Come on!
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson They locked the Chief up with boomer. Tigh thinks hes a Cylon.
dr_gaius_baltar I know. Im gonna see the Colonel now. I think he wants me to find a way to clear the Chief. Or...
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Or what? Throw him out the airlock like a piece of garbage? If Commander Adama were in charge, this would never happen.
dr_gaius_baltar Yes, but hes not in charge, is he?
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson No, but Ive known the Chief for years. Hes no toaster.
dr_gaius_baltar He was involved with Lieutenant Valerii, who most certainly is a toaster.
number_six That word is racist. I dont like it.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Sure...hes shown some bad judgment getting involved with her. But that doesnt mean hes a toaster. Youve got to help him.
number_six Say something, gaius. Tell her you wont have racial epithets used in your presence.
dr_gaius_baltar Im very sorry. I was gonna tell the Colonel theres nothing I can do. The Cylon detector I developed doesnt work. Clearly.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson No! Youve got to help him.
number_six Your childs gonna be half toaster. How does that make you feel?
dr_gaius_baltar Nothing could make me happier. I just dont know what Id possibly say. Excuse me.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson He helped you! He didnt tell anyone what you did on Kobol. What you did to Crashdown.
dr_gaius_baltar What I did to Crashdown saved your life. Are you blackmailing me?
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Help the Chief to help yourself, Doctor.
dr_gaius_baltar Yes, Doctor. Thats what youre best at, isnt it?
officer_anastasia_dualla Deck log.
colonel_saul_tigh What the hells the matter with your Cylon detector, Doctor? You gave the assassin a pass.
dr_gaius_baltar Yes, but that was a beta test, a preliminary. Clearly I hadnt perfected my methodology, and she slipped through.
officer_anastasia_dualla Fuel report.
colonel_saul_tigh So that the hell are you telling me here? That we are back to square one? That no ones results are definitive? That we have no way of knowing who are the Cylons among us?
dr_gaius_baltar No, Im saying that since Valeriis te-- since the assassins test, Ive developed a new set of protocols which should eliminate any errors--anomalies-- that cropped up earlier--
colonel_saul_tigh For gods sake--
dr_gaius_baltar If you let me test the Chiefs blood, I might be able to tell once and for all if--
colonel_saul_tigh No if--I want a definitive answer. No more of your weasely techno babble. Hes a Cylon or hes not. So get down there and do something right for a change.
dr_gaius_baltar I am the Vice-President. Legally speaking, if the President is incapacitated, shouldnt I take over her duties--
colonel_saul_tigh Legally speaking, I have declared martial law. That makes you nobody. So...unless you want to join Roslin in the brig, I suggest you get to work.
dr_gaius_baltar Its good to see you, Colonel.
number_six Arent you getting tired of the continual humiliation? The disrespect from mechanics and Colonels alike?
dr_gaius_baltar What do you think?
number_six Maybe its time to do something about it.
lt_felix_gaeta Sir.
colonel_saul_tigh What is this?
lt_felix_gaeta The fleet captains are reporting protests among the civilians. Demonstrations, petitions, even some civil disobedience. All over the declaration of martial law. Sir, theres more. The Aturian refining vessel has stopped refining tylium. They say if they dont have a voice in the government--
colonel_saul_tigh What?!
lt_felix_gaeta Their captain says theyll send fuel once the civilian government has been restored. And three other ships are also refusing to resupply Galactica until the Presidents reinstated.
cpt_lee_adama And I got a note from combat warning about problems with Tylium resupply. So watch your fuel burn till further notice. Questions.
Pilot#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode04 Yeah, when, uh, when you coming back to the card game?
cpt_lee_adama Im afraid when Im off duty Ill be enjoying the intimate surroundings of the brig until...ah, well, until further notice.
lt_brendan_constanza Come on back. We miss you, Captain.
Pilot#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode04 We could bring the game to you.
cpt_lee_adama Somehow I doubt Colonel Tigh would approve.
Pilot#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode04 Oh come on.
lt_brendan_constanza Ones going on tomorrow night!
cpt_lee_adama Hey, all right, all right.
cpt_lee_adama Hey! Knock it off!
sgt_brandy_harder Morning, sir.
cpt_lee_adama Sergeant. Shall we?
cpt_lee_adama Morning, Dee. Fancy meeting you here.
officer_anastasia_dualla I was just on my way, sir. Hey, guys.
sgt_brandy_harder Hows it going, Dee?
officer_anastasia_dualla Good, thanks.
cpt_lee_adama Hows my father today?
officer_anastasia_dualla Uh, Commander Adamas the same...Captain. Hes sedated. Resting comfortably since the surgery. Trouble brewing in the fleet, though.
cpt_lee_adama Oh, Im shocked. What kind of trouble?
officer_anastasia_dualla Martial law isnt going down too well. Protests, demonstrations. Some ships are even refusing to resupply Galactica.
cpt_lee_adama And this is the honeymoon period. Whats a dictator to do?
officer_anastasia_dualla I, um, I wish... I wish you were in command, sir.
cpt_lee_adama Dee...
officer_anastasia_dualla Hes hitting the bottle. A lot.
cpt_lee_adama Thank you for the company, Petty Officer Dualla.
officer_anastasia_dualla Youre welcome, sir.
ellen_tigh You okay, baby?
colonel_saul_tigh No, Im not okay. My head feels like its gonna roll off my shoulders.
ellen_tigh What are you working on?
colonel_saul_tigh Im trying to figure out how to solve our resupply problem now that half the fleet has gone out on strike.
ellen_tigh You serious?
colonel_saul_tigh Yes, Im serious. I should probably call a summit sit-down with all our ships captains and explain the situation and tell them why I had to declare martial law.
ellen_tigh Screw them. Like you have to explain yourself to them.
colonel_saul_tigh It wouldnt hurt. It would cool things down a little. What?
ellen_tigh Nothing. No, no, no, its... youre the boss. Far be it from me to tell you how to do your job. I know thats one of your issues.
colonel_saul_tigh Just say it.
ellen_tigh I dont know, it just feels kind of... touchy-feely. You know, Lets all sit down and talk about how we feel about martial law. Bill would never do that. But you gotta do what you gotta do. I mean, Bill may never get on his feet again. Honey...honey, you handle this the way you want. Theyll respect that. Eventually.
colonel_saul_tigh This is the XO. Mr. Gaeta, send the following to all ships captains. Message begins: Resupply operations of this ship are not--repeat, not-- optional. All ships to recommence scheduled supply runs immediately. Failure to comply will result in... stern measures. Message ends. You happy now?
captain_kara_thrace Ill flake.
captain_karl_agathon Ill draw fire.
captain_kara_thrace Can I have a word with you? Were not Cylons.
samuel_anders Right. Youre human. You have a soul. You swim in the stream. We heard it all before.
captain_karl_agathon Hey, colonial fleet. Notice the uniforms?
samuel_anders Yeah, right, weve seen Cylons in uniform before. Were human.
captain_kara_thrace Yeah, right. Everyone on caprica is dead.
samuel_anders Youre not.
captain_kara_thrace I just got here. I want to hear some names.
samuel_anders Im Anders.
captain_karl_agathon Samuel T. Anders?
samuel_anders Yeah, thats right.
captain_karl_agathon This is Jo-man, Rally, Ten-point. Sue-Shaun, Crip-Key, Morris Fink. Kara, these are the Caprica Buccaneers.
captain_kara_thrace Hmm. I dont think so.
sueshaun Give me a ball, little girl. Ill shove it up your ass.
captain_kara_thrace Please...try.
captain_karl_agathon Okay, since were all getting along so well, can people stop pointing their guns at us.
captain_kara_thrace How does a professional pyramid team survive a nuclear holocaust?
samuel_anders We were in the mountains when the Cylons attacked. High altitude training. Weve been on the run ever since.
captain_kara_thrace Doing what?
samuel_anders Raiding military stores for ammo. Anti-radiation meds. And plugging toasters whenever they show up.
captain_karl_agathon Same as us.
captain_kara_thrace Okay... how many foul breaks did you have in the playoff against Aerilon?
samuel_anders Youre kidding, right?
captain_kara_thrace You either have the answer, or you have a bullet.
samuel_anders Three.
captain_kara_thrace Wrong. Four.
samuel_anders Three. Last one was called back on instant replay.
captain_karl_agathon Hes right, starbuck. I lost 20 cubits on that game.
captain_kara_thrace Fine. For now. on three.
samuel_anders one.
captain_kara_thrace Two.
samuel_anders Three.
captain_kara_thrace You know you guys suck, right? Cant shoot, cant pass. Sure as hell cant take the point.
samuel_anders Everyones a critic.
cpl_venner Heres your, uh, medication, Madame President. And a little something from the galley.
president_laura_roslin Thank you, Corporal Venner. Chamalla and licorice. Would you like some?
cpt_lee_adama I hate licorice.
president_laura_roslin Me too.
cpt_lee_adama Its interesting he still calls you Madame President. You still have a lot of supporters out there.
president_laura_roslin Something ugly is coming. I can feel it.
lt_felix_gaeta Sir, refinery captains still not cooperating. And now seven other container ships are refusing to release their supplies. Food, medicine, even coffee.
colonel_saul_tigh Coffee? This is getting ridiculous. Frak this. Its time to get their attention. Im sending in the marines. I want a raptor and an armed marine boarding party for every ship refusing the resupply order.
lt_felix_gaeta Sir, were stretched pretty thin on manpower. Im not sure we have enough marine non-coms to command that many boarding parties, sir.
ellen_tigh Well, pull pilots and deck officers to command the boarding parties if you have to. Tell them to get over there and bring back the supplies. Whatever it takes. Make it happen, lieutenant.
lt_felix_gaeta Yes, sir.
Hammerhead#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode04 People, step back, all right?! Were just here for the supplies! Just stay out of the way and no one gets hurt! For the last time, step back!
Hammerhead#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode04 Step back!
Hammergead#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode04 Cease fire! Cease fire!
colonel_saul_tigh Four civilian dead. How the frak could this have happened?
dr_cottle Whatd you expect, genius? You put a pilot in charge of crowd control.
colonel_saul_tigh Palladino! Did you give the order to shoot on that crowd?
Hammergead#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode04 No, sir, of course not. The crowd surrounded us.
colonel_saul_tigh Were they armed?
Hammergead#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode04 No, sir, but... you had to be there. They were yelling and screaming at us, and then it got violent. They started throwing things, canisters. Coffee, I think.
colonel_saul_tigh Coffee? You shot people for throwing coffee?
Hammergead#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode04 The crowd was out of control. They were pressing in on us. My men were getting hurt. Somebody took a shot. I dont know who it was. Then all hell broke loose.
colonel_saul_tigh If ever we needed you, Bill, its right now.
president_laura_roslin Troops shooting unarmed civilians. This is a travesty. He has truly stepped over the line. Itll cause an explosion in the fleet. The press will have a field day. The ships would begin to splinter. The Cylons will be able to eliminate us a few ships at a time. Weve got to get out of here now.
cpt_lee_adama I am right with you.
president_laura_roslin Im so glad you said that. I want to take Billy and Elosha with me.
cpt_lee_adama Of course you do. Ive worked out a way of getting us in the hangar deck. And I can get us a raptor. But were still gonna need clearance to get off the ship. I know how to get that.
president_laura_roslin You do?
cpt_lee_adama Mm-hmm.
president_laura_roslin Question is, where do we go once we get off this ship? Well have to find some place to hide in the fleet while we rally support among the people.
cpt_lee_adama Ive got an idea about that. Youre not going to like it.
colonel_saul_tigh Im not cut out for this. I never was.
ellen_tigh Dont talk like that, saul. This is your moment.
colonel_saul_tigh Me and bill, side by side, that was the deal. It was never supposed to be me alone.
ellen_tigh Well, like it or not, youre in command, so you better deal with it.
colonel_saul_tigh I dont want to deal with it. I do not want to command. Dont you get it? Jeez, why do I listen to you? What are you talk--
ellen_tigh I never told you to send troops out to that ship.
colonel_saul_tigh No, no, you didnt tell me to send troops anywhere. You just manipulate. You always do. You put the knife in, and you twist it.
ellen_tigh Oh, right, youre going to blame me for your own inadequacy?
colonel_saul_tigh Im not blaming you, Ellen.
colonel_saul_tigh I warned you. Im telling you.
ellen_tigh Get off of--
ellen_tigh I love you so much.
colonel_saul_tigh Shut up, Ellen.
lt_sharon_valerii I guess you really must hate me. I dont know if it makes any difference right now, but Im really sorry you got pulled into this. You know, what we had--
chief_galen_tyrol Was nothing. Nothing. Youre a machine. Im not.
lt_sharon_valerii Well, whatever I am, I know how I felt.
chief_galen_tyrol Software doesnt have feelings.
lt_sharon_valerii I never meant to hurt you.
dr_gaius_baltar Id like some privacy, please. Ill be fine, thank you.
dr_gaius_baltar And how are we this evening?
chief_galen_tyrol What do you want?
dr_gaius_baltar Im here to determine whether youre a Cylon or not. Your arm, please.
lt_sharon_valerii His test doesnt work too well. I mean, he gave me the green light.
dr_gaius_baltar The test works... just fine.
lt_sharon_valerii Chief? Chief?
dr_gaius_baltar I lied to you, Sharon. I covered up your true nature from the rest of the fleet for my own purposes.
lt_sharon_valerii What did you do to him? Hes not breathing.
dr_gaius_baltar No, hes dying right now, Sharon. I can save him if you tell me how many Cylons there are left in the fleet.
lt_sharon_valerii I dont know, but Im not getting a pulse.
dr_gaius_baltar Yes, you do. Now, buried deep down in that thing you call a subconscious you know how many.
lt_sharon_valerii I dont know!
dr_gaius_baltar He doesnt have time for this, Sharon. His organs are shutting down. In ten seconds time, hell experience complete brain stem death. Now how many? Do you love him, sharon? only you can save him! Ten... nine... do you love him? Do you love him, Sharon?
lt_sharon_valerii Eight! There are eight.
samuel_anders All right, lets get these weapons unloaded. Lets go! Hit an armory earlier today, about 18 klicks north. Brought home a lot of toys.
captain_kara_thrace What is this place?
samuel_anders Delphi union high school. Toasters dont patrol this area. Its good place to get some shut-eye, a bite to eat.
captain_karl_agathon How many people you have here?
samuel_anders 53, we had almost a hundred before the toasters ambushed us last week-- lets go!
captain_kara_thrace More pyramid teams?
samuel_anders Nah, just us C-Bucs. Rest are survivalists, hikers mostly.
captain_karl_agathon How many people you have here? Hows your stock of anti-radiation masks?
samuel_anders Raided a couple of hospitals down in Pilgrim Bay. I figured weve got enough for three months. Lets get you some bunk space, come on.
captain_kara_thrace 53, huh? Not exactly an army. A hell of a lot better than the two of us if were going to assault an airbase, steal a heavy raider, and get the frak off this planet.
president_laura_roslin Ill just be a moment. Doctor... I need your help. But its illegal, dangerous, and in violation of your oath as an officer.
dr_cottle Youre a lousy salesman.
billy_keikeya Corporal! Corporal Venner. I, uh... I just want to tell you how much the President appreciates all the little things you do for her.
cpl_venner Hey, anything I can do to make things easier for her.
billy_keikeya Great. She, um... has a special request.
officer_anastasia_dualla If I could just get your signature, sir.
colonel_saul_tigh Why are we closing down Causeway B?
officer_anastasia_dualla Integrity testing, sir. Got chewed up pretty bad when the toasters boarded us. And weve been getting some pressure drops in there.
colonel_saul_tigh Tell em to get it fixed. Dee.
officer_anastasia_dualla Oh!
lt_felix_gaeta Sorry.
officer_anastasia_dualla Lieutenant.
lt_felix_gaeta Things are pretty frakked up these days, huh?
officer_anastasia_dualla Yeah, things are pretty frakked up most days.
lt_felix_gaeta If people are upset, they should go through the proper channels.
officer_anastasia_dualla Im not sure I understand what--
lt_felix_gaeta I was running some maintenance checks, detected a series of scrambled calls going out over the past few hours. You wouldnt happen to know anything about that, would you?
officer_anastasia_dualla No, sir. Off-log calls are against regs.
lt_felix_gaeta Hmm... thats right.
cpt_lee_adama Im sure you wont approve. But I guess thats nothing new. I just want you to know that this, um... this isnt about you and me. Good-bye, dad.
jammer You gonna help out here or what?
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Theyre putting the Chief in there, you know?
jammer I dont care if they put a giant parakeet in here. Colonel says build a cell, we build a cell.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson This isnt right. Hes one of us.
jammer No, hes one of them. He always was. We just never saw it.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson No, hes innocent. She tricked him.
jammer Wow, such loyalty. Were you frakking him too?
jammer You want to get pissed at someone, you get pissed at Boomer. Shes the one who put the Chief in the cell here, not us.
officer_anastasia_dualla Evening, sir.
cpt_lee_adama Evening, Dee. Fancy meeting you here. Everything set?
officer_anastasia_dualla Roger that. Sorry, captain. Cant chit-chat today.
cpt_lee_adama Captain! Im having trouble with the ordnance tracking on my raptor, sir. I cant get it to cycle. Oh... change of plans, boys. Instead of getting some rack time, I going to take a minute to do the Lieutenants job for her.
sgt_brandy_harder Yes, sir.
cpt_lee_adama After you.
marine_sergeant Sorry.
cpl_venner Okay, make it look good, but not too good.
Private#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode04 Hold it!
president_laura_roslin Private, do you know who I am? Good. You and I have something in common. We each took an oath to protect and defend the Articles of Colonization. Those articles are under attack, as is our entire democratic way of life. Now, my duty wont let me stand here and allow that to happen. So I intend to go through that hatch and get off this ship.
cpt_lee_adama Damn it. They should be here by now.
president_laura_roslin You can either stand aside, or you can shoot me. Youll have to decide where your duty lies.
Private#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode04 Madame President...
cpt_lee_adama Madame President, this way.
president_laura_roslin Oh Billy...
billy_keikeya Madame President. Im not getting on that ship with you.
president_laura_roslin What?
billy_keikeya I understand what youre trying to do. But its going to divide the fleet. At the very best, itll create an insurgency against Adama. And at the worst, a civil war. Taking part in that is a line that I wont cross.
cpt_lee_adama We do not have a lot of time.
billy_keikeya I wish you well.
cpt_lee_adama Dustoff two-seven, checkers green, ready for launch on medical mission. Request clearance.
president_laura_roslin Good to see you. You okay?
elosha I think so. My feet barely touched the ground getting here.
president_laura_roslin I know what you mean.
Launch_Officer#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode04 Dustoff two-seven. Standard port three departure approved. Cleared for launch.
cpt_lee_adama Standard port three, wilco.
lt_felix_gaeta Sir. Corporal venner reports the former Presidents missing.
colonel_saul_tigh Missing?
lt_felix_gaeta Two men down, cells empty.
colonel_saul_tigh Damn it. Alert security. Set condition two! No one on or off the ship!
lt_felix_gaeta Attention, set condition two throughout the ship. Repeat, set condition two throughout the ship. Sir. Flight log records a raptor departed the ship two minutes ago with Doc Cottle on a medical emergency.
colonel_saul_tigh Medical? Confirm that.
lt_felix_gaeta Dradis has their transponder bearing 2-8-7 carom 0-0-3. Range 2-7.
colonel_saul_tigh Get the cap on the horn and have them intercept. And get Captain Adama out of the brig.
officer_anastasia_dualla Sir, Dr. Cottle is still onboard. He says he was forced to request the raptor at gunpoint by Captain Adama.
colonel_saul_tigh Son of a bitch. Dee, put me through to that raptor.
lt_felix_gaeta Cap has visual on their target.
colonel_saul_tigh Turn that ship around, Apollo, or Ill order the cap to shoot you down.
cpt_lee_adama Were not turning back.
colonel_saul_tigh Ill do it. Dont think I wont just because youre the old mans son.
cpt_lee_adama Then do what you have to do, Galactica. Apollo out.
colonel_saul_tigh Fire across their bow.
officer_anastasia_dualla Hotdog, Galactica. Fire across their bow. Acknowledge.
lt_brendan_constanza Wilco, galactica.
officer_anastasia_dualla Hotdog reports theyre notturning around, sir. Where are they now? Dradis shows them approaching cloud nine.
lt_felix_gaeta Sir, if they dock, we may lose them. Cloud Nine is one of the busiest transport hubs in the fleet. Shuttles coming and going constantly. If they board one and take off, itll be before we can shut down air traffic.
lt_brendan_constanza Galactica, Hotdog. Request instructions. Galactica, Hotdog. I need further instructions. Do I fire or not?
colonel_saul_tigh Dee... tell hotdog to hold his fire. Repeat, weapons hold. Do not fire.
officer_anastasia_dualla Hotdog, Galactica. Weapons hold. Repeat, do not fire.
colonel_saul_tigh They couldnt have done it on their own. Did anybody notice off-log calls? Scrambled communications?
lt_felix_gaeta No, sir. Nothing.
cpt_lee_adama Well, were home free for now.
tom_zarek Good to see you, Madame President.
president_laura_roslin Captain Apollo... what is Mr. Zarek doing here?
cpt_lee_adama Once Tigh gets over his initial shock, hell send troops out to search for us. If were going to make it, we have to keep on the move. I figured mr. Zarek here is the only one in the fleet with enough shady friends around who can possibly hide us.
tom_zarek Love the way he puts that.
president_laura_roslin Well, Mr. Zarek, it would seem the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
tom_zarek Call me Tom.
cpt_lee_adama Our shuttles waiting, maam. We have to hurry.
samuel_anders Wow, is that the best you can do?
captain_kara_thrace Nice to know installing a regulation pyramid court was one of the priorities of the resistance.
samuel_anders Well, there are some things one cannot live without.
captain_kara_thrace Lets go.
samuel_anders Are you kidding me? Ill wipe the court with you.
captain_kara_thrace Yeah, well see about that. I was scouted for the pros. Bum knee took me out of contention.
samuel_anders I see. Is that going to be your excuse when I kick your ass? My poor knee hurts.
captain_kara_thrace At least I have an excuse. I cant imagine what yours is going to be.
samuel_anders Nice shot.
captain_kara_thrace Thanks.
chief_galen_tyrol Thanks. Thanks, doc. I appreciate it.
dr_gaius_baltar Dont thank me. Thank her.
chief_galen_tyrol Why, what does she have to do with it?
dr_gaius_baltar Everything. Nothing. Love is a strange and wonderful thing, Chief. Youd be happy you experienced it at all. Even if it was with a machine.
chief_galen_tyrol What are they going to do to her?
dr_gaius_baltar Theyre setting up a new holding facility. There will be tests. Mental. Physical.
chief_galen_tyrol Like shes some kind of lab rat?
dr_gaius_baltar Thats the idea.
ellen_tigh This is just great. Bill Adamas little baby boy pulls the wool over your eyes, and you let him get away scot-free. Youre a laughingstock. You didnt want this command. Well, dont worry about it. You wont have it for much longer. All because when push came to shove, you got shoved.
colonel_saul_tigh It was his son.
