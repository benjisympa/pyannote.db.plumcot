samuel_anders You’ve been awake for an hour. So what are you going to do if you can’t make it back to your ship?
captain_kara_thrace I’m getting back.
samuel_anders Well, I know we where able to take your sorry ass by surprise.
captain_kara_thrace Frak you.
samuel_anders Nice. But the truth is…We really don’t know what the hell were doing. A lot of our tactics and stuff we just saw in the movies. We could use some professional advice.
captain_kara_thrace You want some advice? You are on the loosing end of this fight. Give it up before you all die. Head further up in the mountains above the ambient radiation and just hole up.
samuel_anders And what? Wait to die?
captain_kara_thrace As soon as I get back to Galactica I’ll send a rescue party.
samuel_anders Yeah, right.
captain_kara_thrace If I say I’m gonna do something, I do it.
samuel_anders You always such a bitch in the morning?
captain_kara_thrace Count on it.
samuel_anders My kind of woman.
captain_kara_thrace We have a mission to accomplish.
samuel_anders So what?
captain_kara_thrace Mission.
samuel_anders Fine, Whatever.
captain_kara_thrace I’m sorry, ok? I didn’t mean to…
samuel_anders Gotcha.
captain_kara_thrace So weak. So, so very weak.
samuel_anders Gotta lighten up a bit. It’s only the end of the world.
samuel_anders Sue-Shaun , I want you to watch our perimeter, especially on our flank. Okay. The Cylons have a refuelling airstrip just on the other side of that ridge. There’s a heavy raider makes a regular refuelling stop every after noon like clockwork.
captain_karl_agathon Machines like routine.
samuel_anders Yeah. It’s usually guarded by less then three of the mechanical varieties, and we’ve left it alone up until now.
captain_karl_agathon So? what’s the plan?
captain_kara_thrace Go through this gully . Approach the airstrip from the south side. Sprinkle our men through the tree line and wait for the Cylons to land the raider and hook-up the refuelling hoses. once they hook up the tylium hoses. We take out the guards and blow the refuelling station.
samuel_anders I thought you wanted the raider intact?
captain_kara_thrace They build ‘em tough, believe me. Blowing the fuel will barley put a scratch in the hull, but it might give us some time to board the raider. once I’m inside, I’ll blow the brain, and start working on trying to get it to--
admiral_william_adama Thank you. Thank you very Much. I’m glad to be back. There are things we don’t say often enough. Things like what we mean to one another. All of you mean a lot to me. I just want you to know that. Let’s get back to work.Adama: I feel Strange. Like closer to the ground.
colonel_saul_tigh You should check in with the doctor.
admiral_william_adama Mr Gaeta where do you think they are now?
lt_felix_gaeta The stolen Raptor with Captain Adama, the former President..Tigh: The Fugitives
lt_felix_gaeta The Fugitives docked at cloud 9 last week. We effectively lost them at that point due to the large volume of inter-fleet traffic going to and from cloud 9.
colonel_saul_tigh Right now they could be holed up anywhere in the fleet.
admiral_william_adama I want them Found .She was dangerous enough as a symbol of resistance, but now with Lee helping. I want to search every ship in the fleet. Quarantine Procedures. Isolate the ship out of the main body. If its clean we keep it quarantined away from the rest of the fleet. She can hide but she can’t run.
colonel_saul_tigh Dee start quarantine procedures, start with Cloud 9.
president_laura_roslin How much longer are we meant to stay hidden in this meat locker?
elosha I don’t know
tom_zarek I have communicated your latest message to Quorum of Twelve they have decided the question of openly supporting you needs more... deliberation.
president_laura_roslin I need to make an appeal to the people.
tom_zarek Make a strong enough argument, and the Astra Queen will be the first ship in line.
cpt_lee_adama Like they do anything but roll over and take orders from you.
tom_zarek one more bit of news I should convey, Zeus has returned to Olympus. Adama is back in command.
cpt_lee_adama My father, he’s um back.
tom_zarek Word just came in over the wireless.
president_laura_roslin He’s a tough old bird.
tom_zarek What we really need is something heart felt. Something human and personal that will galvanise the people. Like a son denouncing his father.
cpt_lee_adama My name is Lee Adama. Until recently I was the commander of Galactica’s air group but when Commander Adama, my father decided to stage a major military coup against the president. I could no longer support him or his actions. I love my father. I respect him. But in this he is wrong he must be apposed. I call on all free thinking people in the fleet, I….
cpt_lee_adama I can’t do this. Sorry everyone. I thought I could but I can’t.
president_laura_roslin How does this thing work?
captain_kara_thrace Kara..cough Kara Thrace.
simon You were in Surgery for about 2hrs.I removed the bullet. I didn’t think you were going to make it for a while. Take it easy. I know that hurts.
captain_kara_thrace Who brought me in?
simon A big Guy called Anders. Used to be a pro pyramid player if you can believe that.
captain_kara_thrace Yeah, I know him. Where is he?
simon He died….on the table. I thought he was only slightly wounded. Turns out that a piece of shrapnel had nicked his aorta. Massive internal bleeding. I’m sorry. We did everything we could do.
simon Morning. I see you are sucking down fluids at a rapid pace. That’s good.
captain_kara_thrace Are you a Cylon?
simon What do you think?
captain_kara_thrace I think you didn’t answer the question
simon I am most definitely not a Cylon. Of course I don’t know what you would expect me to say. If I was a Cylon I certainly wouldn’t admit it.
captain_kara_thrace Can I leave.
simon There’s the door.
captain_kara_thrace Frakkin’ doctors.
simon So I am a doctor. Not a Cylon.
captain_kara_thrace The jury’s still out. I would expect the Cylons to have better digs than this, though. Where is this rat trap?
simon We’re about twenty clicks north of Delphi . Used to be a mental institution. It’s not much, but it’s one of the few places the Cylons haven’t found yet. Okay.
captain_kara_thrace So, what, I’m supposed to believe there really is a resistance out there?
simon Time for your pain meds.
chief_galen_tyrol If I may speak on behalf of specialist Cally. She was distraught sir. The experience in Kobol. Being in the surface fighting Cylons. It’s shattering for all of us. I don’t believe she’s in her right mind when she shot Boomer.
admiral_william_adama Did you love her, Chief?
chief_galen_tyrol Excuse me?
admiral_william_adama Boomer, did you love her?
chief_galen_tyrol I thought I did
admiral_william_adama when you think you love somebody, you love them. That’s what love is - thoughts. She was a Cylon. A machine. Is that what Boomer was? A machine? A thing.
chief_galen_tyrol That’s what she turned out to be.
admiral_william_adama She was more than that to us. She was more than that to me. She was a vital, living person… aboard my ship for almost two years. She couldn’t have been just a machine. Could you love a machine?
chief_galen_tyrol No, sir. I guess I couldn’t have.
admiral_william_adama Cally discharged a firearm without permission, endangering life of her fellow shipmate. 30 days in the brig. Dismissed.
chief_galen_tyrol Thank you, sir.
admiral_william_adama You’ll see her again, Chief.
chief_galen_tyrol Excuse me?
admiral_william_adama There are many copies. You’ll see her again.
captain_kara_thrace How many patients do you have here?
simon Am I being interrogated again?
captain_kara_thrace I just think it’s odd that I’ve been here for two days and I haven’t seen anybody else. Just you.
simon We have 223 patients at the moments. Two doctors and five teachers masquerading as nurses.
captain_kara_thrace I know a teacher masquerading as president.
simon What’s that?
captain_kara_thrace It’s awfully quiet. No screams, no moans. No “Doctor, doctor please help me it hurts”.
simon Most of our patient are succumbing to acute radiation poisoning. Symptoms include powerful fatigue and immediate nausea. This is follows by several day of comparable well -being. After that, cell death in the gastric and intestinal tissue causes massive diarrhea, intestinal bleeding, and loss of water. It’s not pretty. But it is… quiet. The biggest killer in this place is infection. That’s why we have you under quarantine. We don’t know what you brought in with you yet. Your test result will be back this afternoon. Okay. Almost done. I think there may be a cist on one of your ovaries .
captain_kara_thrace Is it serious?
simon Nah , it should be fine. We’ll keep an eye on it. Gotta keep that reproductive system in great shape. It’s your most valuable asset these days.
captain_kara_thrace Right.
simon I’m serious. Finding healthy child bearing women your age is a top priority for the resistance. And you’ll be happy to know you are a very precious commodity to us.
captain_kara_thrace I’m not a commodity, I’m a viper pilot.
simon Do you see any, any vipers around here? I mean, you do realize that you’re one of the handful of women left on the planet actually capable of having children. Right? I mean, that is your most valuable skill right now.
captain_kara_thrace Well I don’t want a child. So just drop it, ok?
simon Well, no one’s forcing you. Just take a moment and think about where you are and what’s going on. The human race in on the verge of extinction. And to be quite frank with you, potential mothers are a lot more valuable right now than whole squadron of viper pilots. I shouldn’t have mention it. I should have know you’d have been sensitive. A lot of women with your history forego child bearing of their own.
captain_kara_thrace My history?
simon I saw the fracture on your X-Ray A lot of old fractures from childhood. It’s interesting how you manage to break every finger on both hands. Every breaks on the exact same place between the first and second knuckle. Did someone breaks your fingers, Kara?
captain_kara_thrace Get out.
simon Children of abusive parents often fear passing along that abuse to their own children.
captain_kara_thrace Get out!
admiral_william_adama Is she kidding with this?
colonel_saul_tigh I know it’s hard to believe, but that message has crop up all over the fleet.
admiral_william_adama It’s religious crap.” It seems I have been chosen to help lead you to the promise land of Earth. I will not question this choice I’ll simply try to play my part on the plan. Therefore, at the appointed hour, I will give the signal to the fleet. All those wishing to honour the gods and walk the paths of destiny will follow me back to Kobol it is there we will meet the Gods’ servant with the arrow of Apollo”.
colonel_saul_tigh We’ve got five raptors with marines fire teams standing by to board The Astral Queen.
admiral_william_adama No one’s gonna follow her. No one’s gonna believe this crap. No one’s this stupid. And anyone that is, the one make suicide run back to Kobol. Please let them.
president_laura_roslin How long till we jump.
tom_zarek Two minutes.
president_laura_roslin Any other ships declares themselves to us?
tom_zarek Not yet.
president_laura_roslin Oh no that, no. Please this isn’t necessary.
elosha Give them your blessing.
president_laura_roslin Oh no. It’s not right. This isn’t who I am.
elosha Laura, this is your path. The one the God’s picked for you. The one you picked for yourself.
captain_karl_agathon Anders, we musta been over this line ten times already
samuel_anders She must have taken a bullet. She’s right here by the vehicles.
captain_karl_agathon Ok, she would have got up and crawled the frak up out of here. Hey we have to search the entire area again.
samuel_anders I told you we shouldn’t have pulled back so fast. I though she was with us.
captain_karl_agathon Anders we got ambushed. Ok, we all got separated. There’s nothing we could have done about it. Kara, of all people would understand. Let’s just find her.
samuel_anders Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
lt_sharon_valerii I know where Starbuck is.
captain_karl_agathon Sharon? Where have you been?
lt_sharon_valerii Tracking you.
samuel_anders Who is she?
captain_karl_agathon She’s with us.
lt_sharon_valerii You’re the father of my child, Helo. I’m not gonna lose you.
captain_karl_agathon Where is she?
tom_zarek We’re ready
president_laura_roslin Send the signal and jump
lt_felix_gaeta Astral Queen has jumped away.
admiral_william_adama Now see how many follow.
colonel_saul_tigh To sit around and wait for Starbuck to show up with that stupid arrow? Two. Three at the most.
simon Good morning. You look better.
captain_kara_thrace What’s this new scar?
simon They had to go back in last night while you were asleep. Some internal bleeding to tie up. Nothing to worry about. Everything’s gonna be fine. Just about done with you, Starbuck.
captain_kara_thrace Nice way of puttin’ it.
simon Just couple more tests and I almost said we’ll be sending you back home I guess we’ll be sending you back to fight.
captain_kara_thrace Hey, sounds good to me. Hey, I just woke up.
simon Now you’re going back to sleep.
captain_kara_thrace You’re the Doc.
simon Pending lab test results on the sample ovaries, complete removal will proceed tomorrow. If lab tests are positive, then subject will be moved to processing facility for final disposition.
number_six It that regret I hear in your voice, Simon?
simon If it is, it certainly is any of your concern.
captain_kara_thrace Lords of Kobol, please help me.
simon Morning.
captain_kara_thrace Hmm.
simon Are you sure you are feeling ok?
captain_kara_thrace You know, something actually has been bothering me lately.
captain_kara_thrace I never told you my call sign was Starbuck.
simon You can’t kill me…
captain_kara_thrace Just die!
captain_kara_thrace Sue-Shaun. Sue Shaun it’s me Kara. Hold on, okay? I’m gonna get you out of here.
sueshaun No. No time. Cut the power.
captain_kara_thrace It’ll kill you.
sueshaun Can’t live like this. The baby machines. Please. Please.
simon Hello Starbuck.
captain_karl_agathon Kara come on.
samuel_anders Let’s go Let’s go .Go go. Get down. Kara get down Let’s go Let’s go. We gotta go.
lt_sharon_valerii Come on . Move like you have a purpose, people. Let’s go go go go.
lt_felix_gaeta Twenty four ships, sir.
colonel_saul_tigh That’s almost a third of the fleet.
admiral_william_adama Why?
lt_sharon_valerii They were conducting research into Human / Cylon breeding program.
captain_kara_thrace Human / Cylon?
captain_karl_agathon They call them farms. Your gunshot wound looks fine.
captain_kara_thrace So farms, that’s great. What were they gonna do? Knock me up with some Cylon kid?
Sharon#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode05 They were gonna try to. We haven’t been successful so far.
samuel_anders Supposedly they can’t reproduce. You know biologically. So they have been trying every which way to produce offspring.
captain_kara_thrace Why?
lt_sharon_valerii Procreation, it’s one of God’s commandments, be fruitful. We can’t fulfill it we tried so we decided to—
captain_kara_thrace To rape human women?
lt_sharon_valerii No if you agreed to bear a children it’d be voluntary maybe even set you up with someone you like.
captain_kara_thrace Like you two kids?
Sharon#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode05 We’re different.
captain_kara_thrace What the frak is that suppose to mean?
captain_karl_agathon They have this theory maybe the one thing they were missing was love. So Sharon and I… we were set up to—
captain_kara_thrace To fall in love? They didn’t ask Sue-Shaun if she wanted to fall in love, right? They put a tube in her! And they hooked her up into a machine!
lt_sharon_valerii They know who you are, Kara. You’re special. Leoben told you that. You have a destiny.
captain_karl_agathon Starbuck what is this second scar?
captain_kara_thrace I don’t know. I don’t think I wanna know now. You know?
lt_sharon_valerii No.
samuel_anders How many women do they have in these farms?
lt_sharon_valerii Hundreds… Maybe thousands. I don’t know I haven’t access that data.
captain_kara_thrace Here’s what we do. Take the heavy raider, cram it full of ground troops find out where the next farm is liberate it. And the next and the next and the next.
samuel_anders No no no no that’s not why you come to Caprica.
samuel_anders Go find earth.
captain_kara_thrace What about you? You said you needed professional advice.
samuel_anders We’ll muddle through. We’ve managed so far.
captain_kara_thrace They’ll kill you. You’ll die here. You know that.
samuel_anders A lot of people died here. I tell you this. If I’m gonna die here. I’m gonna take out every last one of those frakin’ farms before I do.
captain_kara_thrace Well I’m not gonna leave you here.
samuel_anders You said you where gonna come back remember? I’m gonna hold you to it.
captain_kara_thrace I’m coming back. I said it, I meant it.
samuel_anders Yeah, ok. Hey, be safe.
lt_sharon_valerii Let’s go home.
