Dualla 18,000 souls aboard the 24 ships that joined President roslin's rebellion, sir.
Tigh That's over a third of the people in the fleet.
Adama Give me a breakdown. What have we lost?
Dualla Uh, 9,500 souls from Gemenon. 6,250 from Caprica.
Dualla 18,000 souls aboard the 24 ships that joined President roslins rebellion, sir. Tigh: Thats over a third of the people in the fleet. Adama: Give me a breakdown. What have we lost? Dualla: Uh, 9,500 souls from Gemenon. 6,250 from Caprica.
Adama Not who. What? Im not interested in people who decide to join up with a religious fanatic and a terrorist. Thats their business. Now, what have I lost?
Dualla 12 transports, seven freighters, three construction platforms, a private cruiser, and a mining ship, sir.
Tigh Monarch was a blow. We cant afford to lose mining ships, not in our situation. And then theres the collateral damage. Morale is down throughout the fleet. The press is going wild. Families are being split apart.
Adama Dont talk to me about family.
Apollo I support the President completely.And my only priorities are the preservation of her safety and the completion of this mission.
Porter Thats all well and good, but hes still Adamas son. When push comes to shove, how do we know hell be willing to stand--
Roslin If it were not for him, I would still be in a Galactica jail cell. I trust him completely. And this subject is closed.
Bagot And what about Galactica? They--they know where we are! They could jump in here at any time and charge us all with treason or destroy this ship with a flick of the wrist.
Zarek Were not entirely defenseless! Some of our ships are armed! We should take steps to arm the others just in case.
Apollo Just in-- just in case we want to commit suicide! If Galactica wants to take us down, there is nothing we can do about it, nothing. And nobody in this room should be under any illusions on that count.
Roslin At this point, its my firm belief that commander Adama has let us go. Lieutenant thrace will return. She will have the Arrow of Apollo. And it will help us find our way to earth.
Bagot And exactly how long should we wait for her? I mean, maybe we should go down to the surface now. Go down now and start looking for this tomb.
Apollo I wouldnt be too eager. There may still be Cylons present.
Elosha And some of us will die down there. The scriptures tell us that any return to Kobol carries with it a cost... in blood.
Roslin People... I realize that there are still many unanswered questions here. But I refuse to lose sight of what this has always been about: Our mission to save humanity. Yes, it is a big one. But it is our foretold destiny. And I, for one... am not going to waver from it now. If there is anyone here who does not have the stomach for this mission, you are welcome to rejoin commander Adamas fleet.
Meier It jumped into dradis range about two minutes ago. No colonial transponder, and its too large to be thraces Cylon raider.
Zarek And no response to our hails?
Meier Not a peep, Tom. Its either a Cylon vessel, or its a raptor scout from Galactica. Either way, we should shoot first and ask questions later.
Zarek Okay.
Meier The Adriatic is in weapons range, and shes got ship-to-ship missiles. Tom, that thing is moving fast. If were gonna shoot it down, wed better shoot it down!
Roslin Shoot what down? Do I have to repeat myself?
Meier Madame President, we have a security situation. Thats all.
Apollo She wasnt talking to you.
Zarek Theres an unidentified ship making its way towards us. Its too big to be the lieutenants Cylon raider.
Meier Its in weapons range. The adriatic has to fire her missiles now.
Zarek We need a decision, Madame President.
Starbuck Civilian vessels, civilian vessels. This is starbuck. Do you read? Do you read? Say again, this is Starbuck. Is anybody getting this? Hello? Hello?
Astral_Queen_Radioman Initiate docking.
Starbcuck Good to see you too, Captain.
Apollo Remind me to send you to the brig later.
Starbuck Yeah, well...
Roslin Lieutenant.
Starbuck Lee, theres something I need to tell you. Lee, wait!
Apollo Dont you frakking move!
Starbuck Stop! Shes with us!
Helo Drop your weapon, sir. Drop your weapon.
Starbuck Helo!
Roslin Gentlemen, Im only going to say this once. Captain Adama, and--what is your name?
Helo Lieutenant agathon.
Apollo Used to be sharons eco. I thought you were dead, Helo. You a Cylon, too?
Helo Dont even.
Roslin All right, heres what were going to do. Youre going to lower your weapons. Am I being perfectly clear?
Helo What about Sharon?
Roslin She will be taken to a holding cell where she will remain unharmed.
Helo Okay. How about it, Apollo? Should we do what the nice lady says?
Apollo Shes the President of the colonies, you moron. And yes, were gonna do exactly what she says.
Roslin Lower your weapons. Now.
Roslin Thank you. Now put that thing out the airlock.
Helo What?
Roslin We dont keep Cylons around here, Lieutenant.
Helo What the frak? You said you werent gonna hurt her!
Apollo Hey, Helo! Listen to me! one of those things put two rounds into my fathers chest.
Boomer It wasnt me!
Starbuck Adama was shot?
Apollo Yes. You missed a few catastrophes while you were away.
Starbuck Please tell me hes alive.
Apollo After two emergency surgeries, Cottle managed to save him.
Boomer It wasnt me!
Helo Kara! For the love of gods! Sharon--this Sharon saved our lives back on Caprica. Tell them! Tell them!
Boomer I know how to find the tomb of athena! Do you? Kobols a big planet! You dont find the tomb, you dont find earth!
Helo Listen to her, for gods sakes!
Boomer Listen to me!
Starbuck Madame President.
Roslin Tell them to wait a minute.
Guard Yes sir.
Roslin Thank you. Mr. Zarek, is there some place where that... young woman and I can speak?
Zarek I can arrange that.
Apollo Its great to see you again, kara. Thanks for bringing in the trash.
Starbuck Looks like we missed all the fun.
Tigh Perry?
Adma No.
Tigh Mueller. Muellers not a bad choice. He did a tour as a squadron xo--
Adma Muellers a malcontent.
Tigh I know you dont want to hear this, but there is not another Apollo in this bunch. And we do have to pick a new cag.
Birch Commander Adama.
Adma Lieutenant birch, please come in. Thank you for coming on such short notice.
Birch Of course, sir.
Adma Im sure youre aware theres been a change in the fleet. Several of our pilots departed. I was just thinking that we need a new cag to step up.
Birch Absolutely, sir. Whos it going to be?
Adma Congratulations, Captain. Its you.
Birch Thank you, sir.
Adma Just want you to know you have total support of myself and this entire crew. Is that not right, Colonel?
Tigh Absolutely.
Adma Get your log book. Congratulations.
Birch Im honored, Commander. I wont let you down. And, sir, Id just like to say that I was a tremendous supporter of your son, Captain Adama. He was--he was a great leader, sir.
Adma A ship is a family. It works on trust, understanding, and love. I love everyone on this ship as much as I love my s-- my sons. Galactica is still a family. Youre an important part of that family. Do you understand?
Birch Yes, sir.
Adma Thank you, George. Im sure youll do a fine job.
Tigh What the hell? You got me in here jawing about picking a new cag, and youve already made your choice.
Adma I just wanted to see if you and I were on the same page or not.
Tigh I beg your pardon?
Adma I guess were not.
Tigh You guessed right. Youre telling me that kid is leadership material?
Adma We have very few choices. Hes the best. Hes a good man, saul. Hes honest and hes loyal. We need a little bit of that around here right now.
Tigh Well, its your call. Ill support it.
Playa Commander, will you be commenting today regarding the split of the fleet? Commander, will you be answering questions regarding the split of the fleet? Can you make any comments regarding laura roslin and how you feel about the split?
Adama Does this thing work? Please be seated.
Adama Allow me to make a statement, please. Please allow me to make a statement. Please be seated. Thank you very much. If you dont already know, the fleet has been divided.
Adama Please! We share the grief of friends lost. And the resources weve sacrificed will present new challenges for all of us. But if we stay together, we will rise to the occasion as we have before. And? Questions.
Adama Yes.
Playa Uh, you know the coordinates, the whereabouts of President roslins rebellion. Do you intend to put the fleet back together?
Adama First of all, Laura Roslin is no longer President. She relinquished that role when she suborned mutiny aboard this ship. Next question.
Playa But--but commander!
McManus Commander! Commander!
Adama Yes, go ahead.
McManus Since the fleet has been divided--
Playa Commander, you havent answered my question yet.
Adama We have lost no one that cannot be replaced by someone loyal... who has chosen to remain with us. This is the fleet. Thank you.
Hamilton Commander! Commander! Commander, is there any truth to the rumor that there is no earth, it doesnt exist, and you just made it up?
Adama What the hell kind of question is that?
Hamilton Its been all over talk wireless, newsletter circuit, hand mail.
Adama Freedom of the press is not a license to slander. Broadcasting that kind of garbage is the quickest way to find yourself in a holding cell. And that goes for all of you.
Tigh Were done here.
Playa Are you a dictator? What happened to free speech, commander?
Adama Get your hands off of me.
Tigh Why dont you calm down?
Adama Remind me not to do that again. Always looked easy enough when Roslin did it.
Baltar There was an old footbridge... over the euclid river. I used to go there when I was a boy. Watch the fish try and swim upstream. They were mesmerizing. I envied them. Unaware as they were of the... wider complexities and challenges of life.
#6 Youre beginning to see human beings as we see them.
Baltar What I am beginning to see are Cylon faces. Everywhere I look. Sharon told me there were eight Cylons left in the fleet. Why didnt I ask her who they were? If that idiot hadnt have shot her... and why is it when things go wrong, they go wrong so well?
#6 Gaius, you get yourself far, far too worked up about these things. Shh. They do have it easy, dont they?
Baltar They? Why are you talking to me like Im not one of them?
#6 In some ways you never were. You have a path, you will be spared their fate. For once, gaius, you can stop manipulating the world and let destiny take its course. If theres one thing we know about human beings with certainty... they are masters of self destruction.
Boomer Because I love him. And because Im carrying his child.
Roslin Oh, I see. That explains it. Youre not here because you mean us any harm or because youre a programmed enemy of humanity. Youre here because you had an affair with one of our raptor pilots.
Boomer Listen to me.
Roslin Im listening to you. Thats my mistake. Im listening to a Cylon.
Boomer I am here because i chose to come here. And I know you dont believe me. But hear this... even if you find the tomb, even if you find the map, and even if you find earth, the price you pay will be too high.
Roslin Im not interested in your prophecies. I know that there is a Cylon force on Kobol. I know its dangerous. And I have little doubt that you are communicating everything I say even as we speak.
Boomer It doesnt work like that! Im not wired in!
Roslin Sharon, its simple. What I need to know, and what might keep you alive is exactly how to find the tomb of athena.
Boomer Get me a map, and I will do my best to tell you how to get to the tomb.
Roslin No, youll do better than your best. I want to know where it is. And you either know or you dont.
Boomer We all know about the tomb. I can show you the path. I dont know how long the path is or exactly where it leads to, but I can tell you that youre going to have to move very, very quickly.
Roslin She claims to love Lieutenant Agathon. She says she loves the baby shes carrying.
Meier Who cares what she says? You cant believe a word any of them--
Elosha The Scrolls of Pythia do speak of a lower demon who helped the people in a time of crisis.
Zarek More superstition.
Roslin Ive told her that unless we return from Kobol with a map to earth that lieutenant agathon will be put out the airlock as a Cylon conspirator.
Meier Is that true?
Roslin Doesnt matter if its true, she believed it. She saved them, both of them. She didnt have to. She could have saved her child and let them die. Why didnt she? Because I believe that shes telling the truth about one thing. She thinks shes in love. Even if its software instead of an emotion, its real to her. She wants her baby to live. She wants agathon to live. We used that.
Helo This is not the way that I thought things were going to go down.
Boomer I knew theyd be suspicious, but... theyre human. Its the way you are.
Meier Has anyone stopped to consider that the reason sharon knows so much about Kobol is because its a Cylon trap?
Roslin Ive done more than consider it. Its clearly possible were facing a trap. Captain Apollo has already warned us that Cylon encounter in the region is probable.
Meier Has captain Apollo managed to tell us anything we dont already know?
Apollo He is in charge of this mission. He is second in command only to myself. I strongly encourage you to remember that, mr. Meier. Whatever the risks, whatever the consequences, I am going anyway. I am committed.
Dualla Captain birch, Galactica. You are cleared for target exercise maneuvers, acknowledge.
Birch Galactica, leader. Wilco. Cag to all vipers. Were initiating our precision firing exercise as planned. Hotdog, youre first up. Kat on deck.
Hotdog Leader, Hotdog. Clear to target. Executing eyeball run on three, two, one! Away! Frak! Winged it!
Birch Come on, people, I know this is just a drill, but lets look sharp out there. Hotdog, I know you can do a lot better. Lets try it again. See if you can put the next one in the x-ring.
Hotdog Cleared hot! Ready for another pass.
Kat Leader, Kat. Im confirming that Im cleared for my attack run. Am I clear?
Hotdog Leader, Hotdog. Executing eyeball run.
Birch Affirmative, youre clear.
Hotdog Rolling in! Weapons hot.
Kat Leader, Kat. Did you say all clear?
Birch I said all clear.
Hotdog Here we go with three, two, one! Away!
Kat Leader, beginning strafing run.
Birch Kat, what are you doing?
Kat You said Im clear for my attack run!
Birch Hotdog is cleared for his attack run.
Kat What? Hotdog?
Birch Back off, Kat! Now now now now!
Kat Oh, my gods! Ugh! Oh! Oh, crap.
Hotdog Damn, bang on! Did you see that? Whoo! Bang on?
Kat Hotdog, you frakking idiot! You almost got me killed!
Hotdog What are you talking about?
Kat Birch, you said I was clear.
Birch All vipers, this is leader. Repeat, all vipers, this is leader. Report back to Galactica. Report back to Galactica. Frak!
Boomer I know how you feel. I get it. But I didnt shoot him. It wasnt me.
Apollo Youre all the same.
Boomer You dont know what the hell youre talking about.
Apollo Then maybe Im done talking.
Starbuck I think theres been enough of that today.
Apollo You are the last one who should be telling me what to do. After the stunt you pulled? Stealing the Cylon raider and then tearing ass back to caprica?
Starbuck Yeah, cause youre clearly the poster boy for military discipline, huh? You know what? You have no idea what happened to me on caprica. So while youre standing here polishing off your halo, consider for a second that you may not have any damned idea what the hell youre talking about. Captain.
Meier What Roslins doing is reckless. We have our own fleet now. How much longer do we need to keep playing follow the leader?
Zarek We have a fleet because people believe roslins going to lead them to earth.
Meier Shes a fraud. You dont believe her, do you?
Zarek No, but I believe in the power of myth. Im not interested in risking our lives any more than you are, but shes clearly not gonna be talked out of this. And in the end, President or prophet, it doesnt really matter. She still needs a commander. A man in charge of the fleet. The man with the guns makes the rules.
Meier What if she decides youre not the man to be in charge of the fleet? What if she has someone else in mind? Someone already close to her. Like a certain captain.
Zarek Lets say youre right. That on some level... based on their belief in the scriptures,
Meier The fleet needs Laura Roslin in order to stay in line. So we do what we must in order to keep roslin safe on the surface of Kobol. But...
Zarek But... youre right. Youre absolutely right. How could I not have seen that? I wanna set this fleet on a path to freedom.
Meier Of course.
Zarek I wanna deliver unto them the liberty weve promised.
Meier We are far from daylight, my friend.
Zarek The scriptures say some of us will die on Kobol.
Meier One man in particular.
Striker Hows our approach?
Birch Youre a little left off the center line.
Emmit Striker, reset your deltato .35, acknowledge.
Striker Hows my approach speed?
Birch Your angle vectors are too steep. Adjust.I repeat, your angle vectors are too steep. Adjust.
Tigh What is he doing? Tell him to cut his speed.
Adama What is it this time?
Tigh Im glad youre here. Birch is coordinating the ship for refueling. But hes making a mess out of what should be the simplest op in the book!
Adama How long has he been at it?
Gaeta About four hours now. Sir, hes too green. Hes blowing the approach and the docking speeds. Hes missing the drogues. Hes bunching the lines. Its a mess out there.
Tigh As you know, this isnt the first screw-up.
Adama Yes, I know.
Tigh I realize that he is your guy, but...
Adama But hes no Apollo.
Apollo I was wondering when wed finally get a little R & R around here. Oh, boy.
Starbuck Can I have my ball back?
Apollo What, I cant hold it?
Starbuck Can I have my ball back, please?
Apollo Whered you get a pyramid ball, anyway?
Starbuck Caprica. Can I have my ball back, Lee?
Apollo Yeah, sure.
Starbuck Lee?
Starbuck Keep it.
Apollo Hey, come on, Kara. For fraks sake, Im just kidding around. All right, here, its all yours. You can take your ball and go home now.
Starbuck The whole things stupid anyway.
Apollo Whats up with you, Kara? Anything you wanna talk about?
Starbuck Nope.
Apollo Hmm. It must have been hard, being back on caprica. Being home. Probably saw some tough things back there. Anyway, tomorrow this whole thing is gonna end, one way or another. We find the tomb or we dont. We find a way to earth or we dont. I just want you to know, kara, that Im your friend. I love you. If theres anything you wanna talk about, anything you wanna get off your chest, then Im here for you. Anyway... whenever you wanna talk, just let me know.
Starbuck What was that middle part again?
Apollo Hmm? What do you mean?
Starbuck Did you say you love me?
Apollo Well, um--
Starbuck Lee Adama loves me.
Apollo No, all I meant was--
Starbuck no, seriously, very sweet. You love me.
Starbuck No, you love me. You cant take it back. Theres no take-backs.
Apollo Youre dreaming it, Kara.
Starbuck You love me.
Apollo Youre dreaming it.
Starbuck You love me.
Apollo Dreamer.
Starbuck Mm-hmm. Okay.
Striker This is striker. Im having trouble getting a visual on the fueling spar. Can you redirect?
Emmit Gas station, strikers coming in way too hot. You gotta back off your delta, like right now.
Striker Roger that, keeping attack angle.
Emmit Didnt you hear us? Back off your delta. Youre too close! Are you listening?
Striker We are not too close.
Adama Okay. Abort! Abort the op. Recall the ships.
Dualla Galactica to all shipsinvolved in fuel unrep. Abort mission. Say again, abort fuel unrep. Raptors return to base. Acknowledge.
Birch Wilco, Galactica. Aborting mission. Damn it! Roger that. Galactica says abort approach. Adjusting angle vectors full reverse.
Emmit Striker, youre still on a collision course. Put your helm hard left, full reverse thrusters. Back off, back off. Look out! Galactica, emmitt. Tankers intact. No wireless contact, but its in a lateral spin. And there does appear to be some damage.
Adama Away rescue team. Tell them to board the tanker, restore navigational control.
Announcement Away rescue teams to sector 0-4-6.
Apollo Here. You never know when you might need to defend yourself.
Elosha Here we go. And the blaze pursued them. And the people of Kobol had a choice, to board the great ship or take the high road through the rocky ridge-- and the body of each tribes leader
Boomer Was offered to the gods in the tomb of athena.
Elosha Yes, precisely.
Boomer And the great ship was the galleon that departed from here, where were standing. And it took the founders of the 13 colonies to their destiny. And those that didnt board the galleon took the high road... the rocky ridge that led to the tomb.
Roslin Lets move.
Elosha The path is supposed to be marked by gravestones. Theres something there.
Boomer Wait!
Starbuck Get back! Get back! Get back!
Helo Sharon, Sharon take cover!
Starbuck Switch. Nice one.
Apollo Ammo!
Starbuck Here.
Starbuck Lee, no!
Apollo You gotta be frakkin kidding me.
Starbuck Not bad. Damn.
Adama Its interesting. Betrayal has such a powerful grip on the mind. Its almost like a python. It can squeeze out all other thought. Suffocate all other emotion until everything is dead except for the rage. Im not talking about anger. Im talking about rage. I can feel it. Right here. Like its gonna burst. Feel like I wanna scream. Right now, matter of fact.
Dualla If I may say something?
Adama Speak your mind, dee.
Dualla I dont think the problem is that youve been betrayed. I think its that you feel helpless. You were shot, you were injured. You couldnt do anything.
Adama Dont make excuses for me.
Dualla And when you finally had a chance to do something--
Adama Sorry I did this.
Dualla You let us down. You let us down. You made a promise to all of us... to find earth, to find us a home. Together. It doesnt matter what the President did or even what Lee did, because every day that we remain apart is a day that youve broken your promise. The people aboard those ships made their own decision.
Adama It was their decision, not mine. Thank you, petty officer. You may leave now.
Dualla You asked to talk to me, sir... maybe because you think that I dont have anything to say. But I do. Its time to heal the wounds, commander.
Adama Thatll be enough.
Dualla People have been divided. I said, thats enough. Theyre separated from their parents.
Roslin A cost in blood.
Apollo Lets go, Madame President.
Adama Mr. Gaeta. I want to see all recon material on Kobol immediately in my quarters.
Gaeta Aye, sir.
Tigh Kobol?
Adama Yes. Im putting the fleet back together. Im putting our family back together. This ends now.
