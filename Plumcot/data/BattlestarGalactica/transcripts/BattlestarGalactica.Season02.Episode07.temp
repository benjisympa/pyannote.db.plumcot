Adama This could be anywhere.
Gaeta If we only use information contained within the Book of Pythia, which makes sense given the Presidents identification for that particular gospel, then the Tomb of Athena is most likely located somewhere... in the mountains to the west of the City of the Gods.
Adama Lets assume she starts at the most easily recognized landmark which is the opera house. Theyd be setting down somewhere around here in this meadow, then heading west.
Apollo Are you okay?
Roslin Yes. I am.
Apollo We got to get out of this ravine! I dont want us to get caught in a flash flood.
Tyrol Raptor one went down right about here just outside the ruins of the city. Now, we never made it past, say, here. But we visually scouted the approaches out to the mountains.
Meier Thanks.
Zarek Any time.
Tigh If this is all shes got to go on, I dont know how the hell that woman thinks shes gonna find this tomb.
Aama Well, maybe shes seen it in a vision.
Aama Im serious. She says she sees things. Images, prophecies, whatever. The point is that she believes in them. And so do the people that are with her.
Tyrol Sir, all due respect, that terrain is so rugged, I cant imagine navigating it without a map or a guide.
Helo Okay, youre king of the hill.
Boomer Queen of the hill, thank you very much. We should take shelter until the storm passes.
Helo Sounds good. After that?
Boomer Then we start the tough part.  Lets go.
Gaeta The last rescue team, reported no sign of a cylon base ship or a raider anywhere near Kobol.
Adama Well, well set the jump arrival coordinates to the upper atmosphere. Just in case.
Gaeta Ah, sir, thats risky, and its certainly not possible with a ship of this size.
Adama Ill be going down in a raptor.
Tigh What?
Adama Im not gonna leave the fleet undefended. And its too risky to try to take all of us.
Tigh Well send a search party for fraks sake.
Adama And zeus warned the leaders of the 12 tribes that any return to kobol would exact a price in blood.
Tyrol It certainly did for us.
Adama No more bloodshed. Enough loss. Im only gonna take people who are absolutely necessary. Dont try to argue with me, Saul. Truth is, Im the only one that can reach out to Roslin. Its always been between us anyway. We may have gone down separately, but were gonna come back together. Hopefully on our feet. But even in body bags, were gonna be coming back together.
Zarek Im going to contact the Astral Queen, see if they can pick us up until the weather clears.
Apollo Youre not in charge here, Tom. All com traffic goes through me. Try to remember that.
Meier How much longer do you wanna wait, Tom?
Zarek Just keep your eyes on him.
Meier All right.
Boomer Eleven OClock. Twenty degrees elevation. Theres a formation of twin rocks up ahead.
Helo Yeah, Ive got it.
Boomer I think those are the Gates of Hera.
Starbuck You think?
Boomer Im putting together a lot of pieces from a lot of sources beyond your scriptures. If Im right, thats the spot where your god supposedly stood and watched Athena throw herself down onto the rocks below out of despair over the exodus of the 13 tribes.
Zarek Supposedly? I thought the cylons believed in the gods.
Starbuck Yeah, dont get her started. They believe in one true god or something like that.
Boomer And we dont worship false idols.
Apollo You were quick enough to come on this mission. Lead us all to some tomb only actually mentioned in our false scriptures.
Boomer We know more about your religion than you do. Athenas Tomb, whoever, and whatever she really was is probably up there. That part is true.
Starbuck Madam President, we wont make it up there before nightfall.
Roslin Lets go, see how far we get.
Baltar This is a depressing place. Part of me is glad poor Sharon never made it in here. You decided to brighten up the place a little, did you?
#6 Our child will be born here. In this room. Youre not listening.
Baltar Oh, you noticed? No, Ive had enough. Do you seriously expect me to listen to you while you sit around stark naked, prattle on about this mythical baby of ours?
#6 Mythical?
Baltar Yes, mythical. It-- do you have any notion of how ridiculous youve become? The whole turn of our conversation completely shot to pieces. Im the father of a baby who will be born to me, uh, from my fantasy woman who I see solely in my head. My fantasy woman, by the way, who stopped being my fantasy. Youre not my fantasy anymore. No, sadly, no. Youre nothing more than a common tease.
#6 I never said I would bear the child.
Baltar Oh, wonderful. More doubletalk, more mind games. All right then, whos it going to be? Whos going to bear our secret love child? Its not starbuck is it?
#6 Careful, Gaius, youre in dangerous territory now.
Baltar Then I guess Im really scared. So whats it gonna be this week? What is it? Dont tell me, Ill guess. Um... the ships gonna blow up! No, damn, damn. Done that one. Done that one. So its gotta be someone else. Somebo--me! Yes, of course, me! Im gonna explode! Good! God is gonna make me spontaneously combust in a great big ball of flame, and then the whole crew of Galactica can celebrate on ambrosia. Get really drunk.
#6 Okay. Enough. I cant do this anymore. Youre right. Games over. You win.
Baltar Win? Ah, um... what did I win?
#6 You dont get it? Come on, gaius. Wake up and smell the psychosis already.
Baltar Im sorry, I dont know what youre talking about.
#6 Okay, look. There is no cylon chip implanted in your brain. Im not real. Youre not really getting secret messages from the Cylons. Youre just crazy.
Baltar Very funny. Hysterical. Do you, um, do you write your own material?
#6 You dont believe me, do you?
Baltar No, I dont.
#6 Thats great. I love it.
Baltar Is it? Good. Ive had enough of this. All right? So can we just stop playing this stupid game?
#6 Oh, Im sorry.But its the truth. There is no chip.
Baltar If there is no chip, then who... or what... are you, exactly?
#6 Im you. Im your subconscious frakking with your mind. Okay. Check it out. You helped the cylons commit genocide against your own people, and your fragile little mind couldnt handle it. So poof, I appear and start telling you how special you are. How god has chosen you. Yeah... right.
Baltar Well, I dont know what game youre playing anymore. But I dont like playing these stupid games. So, uh, now youve had your fun.
#6 Why dont you get yourself checked out, hmm? Go down to sick bay and get a brain scan. That would settle it, wouldnt it? Go ahead. I dare you.
Tyrol How simple could it be? Okay. Were in the north-northwest continent, quadrant c, sector 2, which...
Racetrack Oh, for fraks sake, let me see if I can make heads or tails of it.
Tyrol Look, I marked the terrain as best I could but were not... topographys for pansies anyways.
Adama How you feeling? Diplomatic?
Billy I still dont think this is a very good idea, commander. The last time she saw me, she wasnt too happy with me.
Adama She trusts you, values your counsel. Shell listen to you.
Billy I doubt that very much. Im her assistant. She doesnt put any more stock in what I say than--
Adama She thinks youll be president one day.
Billy Scuse me?
Adama Thats what she said to me once, that you reminded her of president adar when he ran for his first office.
Billy I dont really know how to respond to that, sir.
Adama Dont let it go to your head. Adar was a moron.
Racetrack This is an intra-atmos entry. You guys buckled in?
Adama Yeah
Adama See? Nothing to worry about. Having good luck already.
Apollo Gives me the creeps seeing him acting like that with her.
Starbuck He loves her. And, yeah, he knows shes a machine. He doesnt care. He loves her anyway.
Apollo Frak! How can one of us get that roped in by one of them? You know, we should keep an eye on him too.
Starbuck Helos a friend of mine, all right? Hes one of the good guys.
Apollo Yeah? Sharon was a friend of yours too.
Helo Feel like Im back on Caprica.
Boomer No thanks. Im happy right here.
Helo Really?
Boomer Yeah, actually. Just being with you and Kara feels like Ive come home. Its like Im back in the fleet.
Helo But you were never in the fleet.  That was the other sharon.
Boomer I know. I know that. But I remember all of it. Like getting my wings. My first trip aboard the Galactica. You know, the memory of being in a uniform is so strong, is so potent, its, like, Im Sharon Valerii and this is my family. Thats pretty weird, huh?
Helo Thats okay. I like weird.
Zarek Losing that priest really frakked her up.
Meier Shes lost a lot of people. Friends. Supporters. All she has left is her young prince. Were here. Hes here. We know what we have to do.
Zarek Terrains rougher than we thought. Dont know how far until we reach this tomb.
Meier Why are you backing out of this now?
Zarek Im not backing out of anything. Getting blood on your hands is a lot harder than washing it off.
Meier Then let the cylon do it. What if the Cylon were to get a weapon and shoot him herself? There would be a lot of confusion, stress, panic. And the cylon could find herself getting shot real easy.
Zarek How would you propose such a thing might happen?
Meier This has to happen, Tom. You know that.
Zarek Not until we find the tomb.
Helo How much further?
Boomer Farther.
Helo What?
Boomer Farther describes actual distance. Further is more figurative.
Helo Youre a dictionary now?
Boomer Im sorry Im smarter than you.
Helo Well, thats okay. The baby can have your brains as long as he gets my looks.
Boomer Yeah? Thatd be a real blessing for her.
Helo Her? You know its a girl?
Boomer Yeah.
Starbuck So from what I could tell, the Cylons have a plan for Caprica. Theyre cleaning up the bodies, bringing in the heavy machinery to fix the infrastructure.
Roslin I understand.
Starbuck But they havent killed everyone. Theres a resistance movement.  once we find the tomb and get the map, I think our first order of business has to be planning a rescue mission back to Caprica.
Roslin Lieutenant, I hope you know how grateful I am for everything youve done and what youve risked, but right now I cant think about anything but finding that tomb. Thank you.
#6 Comfy?
Baltar Cant talk. Cant move.
#6 Then you certainly wouldnt want me to do this.
Baltar Ooh!
Cottle Oh, frak. I told you not to move.
Baltar Im so terribly sorry, Doctor. It--it wont happen again.
Cottle Great. Now I have to reset and start from the beginning.
Baltar Now hes gotta reset and start all over again. Why are you doing this to me?
#6 Come on, Gaius. Even back when you werent nuts, there was always that little voice in your head. That little voice helping you through the rough times, remember? Im just the latest version of that little voice.
Baltar I dont believe that for one moment. No. God has a plan for me.
#6 Gods plan?
Baltar Mm-hmm.
#6 Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Theres a god and he talks to Gaius Baltar. Okay.
Baltar Oh, shut up, will you?
Cottle Hey. Will you stop going crazy in there?
Baltar Im not crazy.
Meier Once you find this tomb, you know hes going to have you killed, right?
Boomer Hes not like that.
Meier Hes a soldier. Youre the enemy. Nothings going to change that. Your twin, your copy or whatever--
Boomer I know. The other sharon shot the old man. I heard it about 1,000 times.
Meier Do you remember shooting him?
Boomer It wasnt me.
Meier Do you remember?
Boomer No.
Meier I see. Well, what do you think happened to her?
Boomer I dont know. Probably threw her in the brig or something.
Meier Hands her a gun She was murdered by one of the crew, and everyone aboard galactica just let it happen. Think Im lying? Ask Lee. Theyre not going to let your child be born. You think theyre going to let you raise a potential enemy right in their midst? You want to get off this planet alive, you better start looking out for yourself.
Apollo Psst! Starbuck! Psst.
Starbuck Lie low.
Adama Put down your weapon, Captain.
Roslin Commander.
Adama Its good to see you.
Billy Madame President.
Roslin Billy. Billy, you have no idea what it means to me to have you here.
Billy Its good to see you too.
Tyrol Oh, my gods. Commander? Commander!
Helo Shes with us, Commander.
Adama Why?
Starbuck Commander, no! No!
Boomer Get off of me!
Adama I want you to die.
Roslin Commander. Commander, please dont. We need her.
Helo Commander! Commander, youve got to let her go.
Adama Die.
Helo Sir!
Apollo Dad? Dad?
Boomer And you ask why?
Cottle Nothing, nothing, more nothing. Are you satisfied?
Baltar Yes. Yes, I am. Thank you very much, Doctor. Just, um... were absolutely positive, arent we, that theres no, um... unidentified objects?
Cottle Well, you can obsess over these as much as you like on your own time. Freakin hypochondriac. one on every bloody ship.
Adama You interfered with a military mission, and you broke your word to me.
Roslin Its the second part that really bothers you, isnt it?
Adama Laura, I forgive you.
Roslin Thank you, pal. I didnt ask for your forgiveness.
Adama Well, you have it anyway.
Helo I cant believe the old man reacted like that.
Boomer You know they killed the other Sharon?
Helo What?
Boomer In cold blood. Not even a trial.
Tyrol Hi.
Boomer Hi.
Tyrol Sharon?
Boomer Hello, Chief.
Tyrol You know who I am.
Boomer Yes. We havent met, but...I remember you. Its good to see you.
Meier So where does this leave us?
Zarek Back to where we started. Under the yoke of president roslin and commander adama.
Meier Not if we go back to the ship with a map to earth. And a sad story of how many people were killed down on Kobol by the Cylons.
Zarek Its over. Let it go. For now.
Roslin Lieutenant thrace says that there are survivors on the colonies. Back on Caprica, there are people fighting against the Cylons every day. Theyre fighting for their homes. Their future.
Adama I see.
Roslin Does it give you pause? Maybe your impulse the day the cylons attacked was right. Maybe we should have stayed and fought for our homes. Maybe the President of the Colonies should have stayed with her people.
Adama I didnt come here for this. I didnt come here to navel gaze. Or to catalogue our mistakes. We made a decision to leave the Colonies after the attack. We made the decision. It was the right one then, its the right one now. Cause every moment of every day since then... is a gift.
Roslin From the gods.
Adama No, from you. For convincing me that I should go. I would be dead. My son would be dead. Whatever else the cost... I wont second guess that outcome. I think its time to go find this...tomb of yours.
Boomer So Cally kills Sharon... and the old man gives her 30 days in the brig.
Helo 30 days for murder.
Boomer They dont see it as murder, Helo. Thats what Im trying to tell you. Thats what youre not hearing. To him, to the president, to all of them. Cylons arent people. Im not a person to them. Im a thing.
Helo I wont just stand by and let them kill you like the other Sharon. Okay?
Boomer I believe you, Helo. I do. But if were gonna have any future together, any at all... Im gonna have to take matters into my own hands.
Helo What are you talking about?
Boomer Do you love me?
Helo Yes.
Helo Yes.
Boomer Then dont ask me what I have to do.
Helo Sharon, what the frak are you talking--
Boomer Trust me. Trust us.
Meier Have you had a chance to think about our conversation?
Boomer I havent thought about anything else.
Meier And?
Boomer When we get to the entrance, theyll be distracted. Ill take the father, and you take the son.
Boomer You should see this!
Roslin Lieutenant Thrace, I hope you have that arrow handy.
Boomer I need you to know something. Im Sharon, but Im a different Sharon. I know who I am. I dont have hidden protocols or programs lying in wait to be activated. I make my own choices. I make my own decisions. And I need you to know this is my choice.
Tyrol This is one of the old stallions. Its not military issue. Where the helld you get this?
Boomer Its his.
Meier Oh...oh.
Zarek Take it easy.
Meier Just wanted... to see you get your due.
Zarek You never did listen to me.
Meier Grunts and dies
Starnuck Stupid frakking thing couldnt come with a handbook? No, because that would just be too logical, wouldnt it?
Roslin And the Arrow of Apollo will open the Tomb of Athena.
Zarek Yeah, well, unless anyone sees a keyhole or whatever, then were either in the wrong place or were just perfectly screwed.
Adama Okay, then why dont we just, uh-- Helo, cmere. on three. one... two...three.
Apollo There it is.
Roslin Oh, my gods.
Apollo After you.
Adama Helo, you stay out.
Helo Yes, sir.
Adama Chief.
Tyrol Sir?
Adama Guard everybody.
Tyrol Sir.
Starbuck If the arrow didnt actually open the tomb, how do we know this is the right place?
Adama We dont. But this is a tomb alright.
Roslin The scriptures say you need the arrow to find the map.
Starbuck These broken statues-- I recognize them. The ram, Aerilon. Gemenon, the twins. These are the icons of the 12 tribes, the 12 colonies. I mean, this is really where it all began. We all came from this place.
Billy This could be Picon, the fish.
Apollo I guess this little lady could be Virgon, right?
Starbuck The goat-- Caprica.
Roslin Sagittaron. The archer.
Adama Hes missing something.
Billy Uh... where the hell are we?
Roslin I dont know. Tomb of Athena, I think.
Adama I thought we were already in the tomb.
Starbuck I think that was the lobby.
Roslin Again the ancient symbols. These patterns... were on the original flags of the 12 colonies back in the days when the colonies were called by their ancient names: Aries... Taurus... Gemini... Cancer... Leo... Libra... Virgo.
Adama The jewels match the constellations.
Apollo this is the map-- this is the map to Earth.
Adama Maybe. So is Earth in one of these constellations?
Starbuck Were standing on it. Were standing on Earth. The scriptures say that when the 13th tribe landed on Earth, they looked up into the heavens and they saw their 12 brothers.
Roslin Earth is the place where you can look up in the sky and see the constellations of the 12 colonies.
Starbuck I dont know what good its gonna do us though. I mean, what are we supposed to do? Search the entire galaxy for one particular star pattern?
Apollo There. There in Scorpio. Ive seen that before. Its the lagoon nebula.
Adama Astro body M8.. Thats a long way from here.
Roslin Yeah. But at least now we have a map and a direction.
Adama We have struggled since the attacks... trying to rely on one another. Our strength and our only hope as a people, is to remain undivided. We havent always done all we could to insure that. Many people believe that the scriptures, the letters from the gods, will lead us to salvation. Maybe they will. But the gods shall lift those who lift each other. And so, to lift all of us, let me present once again the president of the colonies, Laura Roslin.
Boomer Im okay. Im okay, really.
Helo Yeah. Its just, uh... its just I dont want our baby born in this cell.
Baltar Their child?
#6 I told you a child would arrive. Told you it would be born right here in this room. How could you ever doubt me?
Baltar Boomer is going to bear... our child?
#6 An honor for which she is hardly deserving. But one doesnt question gods will.
Baltar Well, youre not a chip. That weve established.
#6 Yes.
Baltar But sharon being pregnant does suggest that you are rather more than a simple manifestation of my subconscious. And Im not... crazy?
#6 No.
Baltar Then who... or what... are you, exactly?
#6 Im an angel of god sent here to protect you. To guide you, to love you.
Baltar To what end?
#6 To the end of the human race.
