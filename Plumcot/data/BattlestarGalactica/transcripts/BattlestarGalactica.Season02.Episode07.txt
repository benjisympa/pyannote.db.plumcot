admiral_william_adama This could be anywhere.
lt_felix_gaeta If we only use information contained within the Book of Pythia, which makes sense given the Presidents identification for that particular gospel, then the Tomb of Athena is most likely located somewhere... in the mountains to the west of the City of the Gods.
admiral_william_adama Lets assume she starts at the most easily recognized landmark which is the opera house. Theyd be setting down somewhere around here in this meadow, then heading west.
cpt_lee_adama Are you okay?
president_laura_roslin Yes. I am.
cpt_lee_adama We got to get out of this ravine! I dont want us to get caught in a flash flood.
chief_galen_tyrol Raptor one went down right about here just outside the ruins of the city. Now, we never made it past, say, here. But we visually scouted the approaches out to the mountains.
meier Thanks.
tom_zarek Any time.
colonel_saul_tigh If this is all shes got to go on, I dont know how the hell that woman thinks shes gonna find this tomb.
admiral_william_adama Well, maybe shes seen it in a vision.
admiral_william_adama Im serious. She says she sees things. Images, prophecies, whatever. The point is that she believes in them. And so do the people that are with her.
chief_galen_tyrol Sir, all due respect, that terrain is so rugged, I cant imagine navigating it without a map or a guide.
captain_karl_agathon Okay, youre king of the hill.
lt_sharon_valerii Queen of the hill, thank you very much. We should take shelter until the storm passes.
captain_karl_agathon Sounds good. After that?
lt_sharon_valerii Then we start the tough part. Lets go.
lt_felix_gaeta The last rescue team, reported no sign of a cylon base ship or a raider anywhere near Kobol.
admiral_william_adama Well, well set the jump arrival coordinates to the upper atmosphere. Just in case.
lt_felix_gaeta Ah, sir, thats risky, and its certainly not possible with a ship of this size.
admiral_william_adama Ill be going down in a raptor.
colonel_saul_tigh What?
admiral_william_adama Im not gonna leave the fleet undefended. And its too risky to try to take all of us.
colonel_saul_tigh Well send a search party for fraks sake.
admiral_william_adama And zeus warned the leaders of the 12 tribes that any return to kobol would exact a price in blood.
chief_galen_tyrol It certainly did for us.
admiral_william_adama No more bloodshed. Enough loss. Im only gonna take people who are absolutely necessary. Dont try to argue with me, Saul. Truth is, Im the only one that can reach out to Roslin. Its always been between us anyway. We may have gone down separately, but were gonna come back together. Hopefully on our feet. But even in body bags, were gonna be coming back together.
tom_zarek Im going to contact the Astral Queen, see if they can pick us up until the weather clears.
cpt_lee_adama Youre not in charge here, Tom. All com traffic goes through me. Try to remember that.
meier How much longer do you wanna wait, Tom?
tom_zarek Just keep your eyes on him.
meier All right.
lt_sharon_valerii Eleven OClock. Twenty degrees elevation. Theres a formation of twin rocks up ahead.
captain_karl_agathon Yeah, Ive got it.
lt_sharon_valerii I think those are the Gates of Hera.
captain_kara_thrace You think?
lt_sharon_valerii Im putting together a lot of pieces from a lot of sources beyond your scriptures. If Im right, thats the spot where your god supposedly stood and watched Athena throw herself down onto the rocks below out of despair over the exodus of the 13 tribes.
tom_zarek Supposedly? I thought the cylons believed in the gods.
captain_kara_thrace Yeah, dont get her started. They believe in one true god or something like that.
lt_sharon_valerii And we dont worship false idols.
cpt_lee_adama You were quick enough to come on this mission. Lead us all to some tomb only actually mentioned in our false scriptures.
lt_sharon_valerii We know more about your religion than you do. Athenas Tomb, whoever, and whatever she really was is probably up there. That part is true.
captain_kara_thrace Madam President, we wont make it up there before nightfall.
president_laura_roslin Lets go, see how far we get.
dr_gaius_baltar This is a depressing place. Part of me is glad poor Sharon never made it in here. You decided to brighten up the place a little, did you?
number_six Our child will be born here. In this room. Youre not listening.
dr_gaius_baltar Oh, you noticed? No, Ive had enough. Do you seriously expect me to listen to you while you sit around stark naked, prattle on about this mythical baby of ours?
number_six Mythical?
dr_gaius_baltar Yes, mythical. It-- do you have any notion of how ridiculous youve become? The whole turn of our conversation completely shot to pieces. Im the father of a baby who will be born to me, uh, from my fantasy woman who I see solely in my head. My fantasy woman, by the way, who stopped being my fantasy. Youre not my fantasy anymore. No, sadly, no. Youre nothing more than a common tease.
number_six I never said I would bear the child.
dr_gaius_baltar Oh, wonderful. More doubletalk, more mind games. All right then, whos it going to be? Whos going to bear our secret love child? Its not starbuck is it?
number_six Careful, Gaius, youre in dangerous territory now.
dr_gaius_baltar Then I guess Im really scared. So whats it gonna be this week? What is it? Dont tell me, Ill guess. Um... the ships gonna blow up! No, damn, damn. Done that one. Done that one. So its gotta be someone else. Somebo--me! Yes, of course, me! Im gonna explode! Good! God is gonna make me spontaneously combust in a great big ball of flame, and then the whole crew of Galactica can celebrate on ambrosia. Get really drunk.
number_six Okay. Enough. I cant do this anymore. Youre right. Games over. You win.
dr_gaius_baltar Win? Ah, um... what did I win?
number_six You dont get it? Come on, gaius. Wake up and smell the psychosis already.
dr_gaius_baltar Im sorry, I dont know what youre talking about.
number_six Okay, look. There is no cylon chip implanted in your brain. Im not real. Youre not really getting secret messages from the Cylons. Youre just crazy.
dr_gaius_baltar Very funny. Hysterical. Do you, um, do you write your own material?
number_six You dont believe me, do you?
dr_gaius_baltar No, I dont.
number_six Thats great. I love it.
dr_gaius_baltar Is it? Good. Ive had enough of this. All right? So can we just stop playing this stupid game?
number_six Oh, Im sorry.But its the truth. There is no chip.
dr_gaius_baltar If there is no chip, then who... or what... are you, exactly?
number_six Im you. Im your subconscious frakking with your mind. Okay. Check it out. You helped the cylons commit genocide against your own people, and your fragile little mind couldnt handle it. So poof, I appear and start telling you how special you are. How god has chosen you. Yeah... right.
dr_gaius_baltar Well, I dont know what game youre playing anymore. But I dont like playing these stupid games. So, uh, now youve had your fun.
number_six Why dont you get yourself checked out, hmm? Go down to sick bay and get a brain scan. That would settle it, wouldnt it? Go ahead. I dare you.
chief_galen_tyrol How simple could it be? Okay. Were in the north-northwest continent, quadrant c, sector 2, which...
racetrack Oh, for fraks sake, let me see if I can make heads or tails of it.
chief_galen_tyrol Look, I marked the terrain as best I could but were not... topographys for pansies anyways.
admiral_william_adama How you feeling? Diplomatic?
billy_keikeya I still dont think this is a very good idea, commander. The last time she saw me, she wasnt too happy with me.
admiral_william_adama She trusts you, values your counsel. Shell listen to you.
billy_keikeya I doubt that very much. Im her assistant. She doesnt put any more stock in what I say than--
admiral_william_adama She thinks youll be president one day.
billy_keikeya Scuse me?
admiral_william_adama Thats what she said to me once, that you reminded her of president adar when he ran for his first office.
billy_keikeya I dont really know how to respond to that, sir.
admiral_william_adama Dont let it go to your head. Adar was a moron.
racetrack This is an intra-atmos entry. You guys buckled in?
admiral_william_adama Yeah
admiral_william_adama See? Nothing to worry about. Having good luck already.
cpt_lee_adama Gives me the creeps seeing him acting like that with her.
captain_kara_thrace He loves her. And, yeah, he knows shes a machine. He doesnt care. He loves her anyway.
cpt_lee_adama Frak! How can one of us get that roped in by one of them? You know, we should keep an eye on him too.
captain_kara_thrace Helos a friend of mine, all right? Hes one of the good guys.
cpt_lee_adama Yeah? Sharon was a friend of yours too.
captain_karl_agathon Feel like Im back on Caprica.
lt_sharon_valerii No thanks. Im happy right here.
captain_karl_agathon Really?
lt_sharon_valerii Yeah, actually. Just being with you and Kara feels like Ive come home. Its like Im back in the fleet.
captain_karl_agathon But you were never in the fleet. That was the other sharon.
lt_sharon_valerii I know. I know that. But I remember all of it. Like getting my wings. My first trip aboard the Galactica. You know, the memory of being in a uniform is so strong, is so potent, its, like, Im Sharon Valerii and this is my family. Thats pretty weird, huh?
captain_karl_agathon Thats okay. I like weird.
tom_zarek Losing that priest really frakked her up.
meier Shes lost a lot of people. Friends. Supporters. All she has left is her young prince. Were here. Hes here. We know what we have to do.
tom_zarek Terrains rougher than we thought. Dont know how far until we reach this tomb.
meier Why are you backing out of this now?
tom_zarek Im not backing out of anything. Getting blood on your hands is a lot harder than washing it off.
meier Then let the cylon do it. What if the Cylon were to get a weapon and shoot him herself? There would be a lot of confusion, stress, panic. And the cylon could find herself getting shot real easy.
tom_zarek How would you propose such a thing might happen?
meier This has to happen, Tom. You know that.
tom_zarek Not until we find the tomb.
captain_karl_agathon How much further?
lt_sharon_valerii Farther.
captain_karl_agathon What?
lt_sharon_valerii Farther describes actual distance. Further is more figurative.
captain_karl_agathon Youre a dictionary now?
lt_sharon_valerii Im sorry Im smarter than you.
captain_karl_agathon Well, thats okay. The baby can have your brains as long as he gets my looks.
lt_sharon_valerii Yeah? Thatd be a real blessing for her.
captain_karl_agathon Her? You know its a girl?
lt_sharon_valerii Yeah.
captain_kara_thrace So from what I could tell, the Cylons have a plan for Caprica. Theyre cleaning up the bodies, bringing in the heavy machinery to fix the infrastructure.
president_laura_roslin I understand.
captain_kara_thrace But they havent killed everyone. Theres a resistance movement. once we find the tomb and get the map, I think our first order of business has to be planning a rescue mission back to Caprica.
president_laura_roslin Lieutenant, I hope you know how grateful I am for everything youve done and what youve risked, but right now I cant think about anything but finding that tomb. Thank you.
number_six Comfy?
dr_gaius_baltar Cant talk. Cant move.
number_six Then you certainly wouldnt want me to do this.
dr_gaius_baltar Ooh!
dr_cottle Oh, frak. I told you not to move.
dr_gaius_baltar Im so terribly sorry, Doctor. It--it wont happen again.
dr_cottle Great. Now I have to reset and start from the beginning.
dr_gaius_baltar Now hes gotta reset and start all over again. Why are you doing this to me?
number_six Come on, Gaius. Even back when you werent nuts, there was always that little voice in your head. That little voice helping you through the rough times, remember? Im just the latest version of that little voice.
dr_gaius_baltar I dont believe that for one moment. No. God has a plan for me.
number_six Gods plan?
dr_gaius_baltar Mm-hmm.
number_six Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Theres a god and he talks to Gaius Baltar. Okay.
dr_gaius_baltar Oh, shut up, will you?
dr_cottle Hey. Will you stop going crazy in there?
dr_gaius_baltar Im not crazy.
meier Once you find this tomb, you know hes going to have you killed, right?
lt_sharon_valerii Hes not like that.
meier Hes a soldier. Youre the enemy. Nothings going to change that. Your twin, your copy or whatever--
lt_sharon_valerii I know. The other sharon shot the old man. I heard it about 1,000 times.
meier Do you remember shooting him?
lt_sharon_valerii It wasnt me.
meier Do you remember?
lt_sharon_valerii No.
meier I see. Well, what do you think happened to her?
lt_sharon_valerii I dont know. Probably threw her in the brig or something.
meier Hands her a gun She was murdered by one of the crew, and everyone aboard galactica just let it happen. Think Im lying? Ask Lee. Theyre not going to let your child be born. You think theyre going to let you raise a potential enemy right in their midst? You want to get off this planet alive, you better start looking out for yourself.
cpt_lee_adama Psst! Starbuck! Psst.
captain_kara_thrace Lie low.
admiral_william_adama Put down your weapon, Captain.
president_laura_roslin Commander.
admiral_william_adama Its good to see you.
billy_keikeya Madame President.
president_laura_roslin Billy. Billy, you have no idea what it means to me to have you here.
billy_keikeya Its good to see you too.
chief_galen_tyrol Oh, my gods. Commander? Commander!
captain_karl_agathon Shes with us, Commander.
admiral_william_adama Why?
captain_kara_thrace Commander, no! No!
lt_sharon_valerii Get off of me!
admiral_william_adama I want you to die.
president_laura_roslin Commander. Commander, please dont. We need her.
captain_karl_agathon Commander! Commander, youve got to let her go.
admiral_william_adama Die.
captain_karl_agathon Sir!
cpt_lee_adama Dad? Dad?
lt_sharon_valerii And you ask why?
dr_cottle Nothing, nothing, more nothing. Are you satisfied?
dr_gaius_baltar Yes. Yes, I am. Thank you very much, Doctor. Just, um... were absolutely positive, arent we, that theres no, um... unidentified objects?
dr_cottle Well, you can obsess over these as much as you like on your own time. Freakin hypochondriac. one on every bloody ship.
admiral_william_adama You interfered with a military mission, and you broke your word to me.
president_laura_roslin Its the second part that really bothers you, isnt it?
admiral_william_adama Laura, I forgive you.
president_laura_roslin Thank you, pal. I didnt ask for your forgiveness.
admiral_william_adama Well, you have it anyway.
captain_karl_agathon I cant believe the old man reacted like that.
lt_sharon_valerii You know they killed the other Sharon?
captain_karl_agathon What?
lt_sharon_valerii In cold blood. Not even a trial.
chief_galen_tyrol Hi.
lt_sharon_valerii Hi.
chief_galen_tyrol Sharon?
lt_sharon_valerii Hello, Chief.
chief_galen_tyrol You know who I am.
lt_sharon_valerii Yes. We havent met, but...I remember you. Its good to see you.
meier So where does this leave us?
tom_zarek Back to where we started. Under the yoke of president roslin and commander adama.
meier Not if we go back to the ship with a map to earth. And a sad story of how many people were killed down on Kobol by the Cylons.
tom_zarek Its over. Let it go. For now.
president_laura_roslin Lieutenant thrace says that there are survivors on the colonies. Back on Caprica, there are people fighting against the Cylons every day. Theyre fighting for their homes. Their future.
admiral_william_adama I see.
president_laura_roslin Does it give you pause? Maybe your impulse the day the cylons attacked was right. Maybe we should have stayed and fought for our homes. Maybe the President of the Colonies should have stayed with her people.
admiral_william_adama I didnt come here for this. I didnt come here to navel gaze. Or to catalogue our mistakes. We made a decision to leave the Colonies after the attack. We made the decision. It was the right one then, its the right one now. Cause every moment of every day since then... is a gift.
president_laura_roslin From the gods.
admiral_william_adama No, from you. For convincing me that I should go. I would be dead. My son would be dead. Whatever else the cost... I wont second guess that outcome. I think its time to go find this...tomb of yours.
lt_sharon_valerii So Cally kills Sharon... and the old man gives her 30 days in the brig.
captain_karl_agathon 30 days for murder.
lt_sharon_valerii They dont see it as murder, Helo. Thats what Im trying to tell you. Thats what youre not hearing. To him, to the president, to all of them. Cylons arent people. Im not a person to them. Im a thing.
captain_karl_agathon I wont just stand by and let them kill you like the other Sharon. Okay?
lt_sharon_valerii I believe you, Helo. I do. But if were gonna have any future together, any at all... Im gonna have to take matters into my own hands.
captain_karl_agathon What are you talking about?
lt_sharon_valerii Do you love me?
captain_karl_agathon Yes.
captain_karl_agathon Yes.
lt_sharon_valerii Then dont ask me what I have to do.
captain_karl_agathon Sharon, what the frak are you talking--
lt_sharon_valerii Trust me. Trust us.
meier Have you had a chance to think about our conversation?
lt_sharon_valerii I havent thought about anything else.
meier And?
lt_sharon_valerii When we get to the entrance, theyll be distracted. Ill take the father, and you take the son.
lt_sharon_valerii You should see this!
president_laura_roslin Lieutenant Thrace, I hope you have that arrow handy.
lt_sharon_valerii I need you to know something. Im Sharon, but Im a different Sharon. I know who I am. I dont have hidden protocols or programs lying in wait to be activated. I make my own choices. I make my own decisions. And I need you to know this is my choice.
chief_galen_tyrol This is one of the old stallions. Its not military issue. Where the helld you get this?
lt_sharon_valerii Its his.
meier Oh...oh.
tom_zarek Take it easy.
meier Just wanted... to see you get your due.
tom_zarek You never did listen to me.
meier Grunts and dies
captain_kara_thrace Stupid frakking thing couldnt come with a handbook? No, because that would just be too logical, wouldnt it?
president_laura_roslin And the Arrow of Apollo will open the Tomb of Athena.
tom_zarek Yeah, well, unless anyone sees a keyhole or whatever, then were either in the wrong place or were just perfectly screwed.
admiral_william_adama Okay, then why dont we just, uh-- Helo, cmere. on three. one... two...three.
cpt_lee_adama There it is.
president_laura_roslin Oh, my gods.
cpt_lee_adama After you.
admiral_william_adama Helo, you stay out.
captain_karl_agathon Yes, sir.
admiral_william_adama Chief.
chief_galen_tyrol Sir?
admiral_william_adama Guard everybody.
chief_galen_tyrol Sir.
captain_kara_thrace If the arrow didnt actually open the tomb, how do we know this is the right place?
admiral_william_adama We dont. But this is a tomb alright.
president_laura_roslin The scriptures say you need the arrow to find the map.
captain_kara_thrace These broken statues-- I recognize them. The ram, Aerilon. Gemenon, the twins. These are the icons of the 12 tribes, the 12 colonies. I mean, this is really where it all began. We all came from this place.
billy_keikeya This could be Picon, the fish.
cpt_lee_adama I guess this little lady could be Virgon, right?
captain_kara_thrace The goat-- Caprica.
president_laura_roslin Sagittaron. The archer.
admiral_william_adama Hes missing something.
billy_keikeya Uh... where the hell are we?
president_laura_roslin I dont know. Tomb of Athena, I think.
admiral_william_adama I thought we were already in the tomb.
captain_kara_thrace I think that was the lobby.
president_laura_roslin Again the ancient symbols. These patterns... were on the original flags of the 12 colonies back in the days when the colonies were called by their ancient names: Aries... Taurus... Gemini... Cancer... Leo... Libra... Virgo.
admiral_william_adama The jewels match the constellations.
cpt_lee_adama this is the map-- this is the map to Earth.
admiral_william_adama Maybe. So is Earth in one of these constellations?
captain_kara_thrace Were standing on it. Were standing on Earth. The scriptures say that when the 13th tribe landed on Earth, they looked up into the heavens and they saw their 12 brothers.
president_laura_roslin Earth is the place where you can look up in the sky and see the constellations of the 12 colonies.
captain_kara_thrace I dont know what good its gonna do us though. I mean, what are we supposed to do? Search the entire galaxy for one particular star pattern?
cpt_lee_adama There. There in Scorpio. Ive seen that before. Its the lagoon nebula.
admiral_william_adama Astro body M8.. Thats a long way from here.
president_laura_roslin Yeah. But at least now we have a map and a direction.
admiral_william_adama We have struggled since the attacks... trying to rely on one another. Our strength and our only hope as a people, is to remain undivided. We havent always done all we could to insure that. Many people believe that the scriptures, the letters from the gods, will lead us to salvation. Maybe they will. But the gods shall lift those who lift each other. And so, to lift all of us, let me present once again the president of the colonies, Laura Roslin.
lt_sharon_valerii Im okay. Im okay, really.
captain_karl_agathon Yeah. Its just, uh... its just I dont want our baby born in this cell.
dr_gaius_baltar Their child?
number_six I told you a child would arrive. Told you it would be born right here in this room. How could you ever doubt me?
dr_gaius_baltar Boomer is going to bear... our child?
number_six An honor for which she is hardly deserving. But one doesnt question gods will.
dr_gaius_baltar Well, youre not a chip. That weve established.
number_six Yes.
dr_gaius_baltar But sharon being pregnant does suggest that you are rather more than a simple manifestation of my subconscious. And Im not... crazy?
number_six No.
dr_gaius_baltar Then who... or what... are you, exactly?
number_six Im an angel of god sent here to protect you. To guide you, to love you.
dr_gaius_baltar To what end?
number_six To the end of the human race.
