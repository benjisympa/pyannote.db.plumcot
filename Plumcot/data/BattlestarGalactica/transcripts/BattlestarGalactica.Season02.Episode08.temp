Palladino People, just get back! Stay back, all right? We just need these supplies! Get em back, get em back!
Palladino Cease fire! Cease fire! Medic! We need a medic in here now!
Little_Girl dad! Dad? Oh, my gods! Oh, my gods!
Biers Thats gonna blow this thing wide open. And we need some stock footage of raging marines. Can intercut that with the  eyewitness statements.
Bell You have no right to come in here like this.
Marine Maam, youre to come with us.
Biers What, am I under arrest?
Marine No, maam.
Biers And what if I refuse to go?
Roslin Hello, Ms. Biers. Its nice to see you. Welcome to Colonial one.
Biers Madame President, its an honor. Commander Adama.
Adama Where did you get the tape?
Biers From an anonymous patriot. So is this a social call or are we on the verge of another coup?
Adama Funny.
Biers Just something to break the ice. I take it I am here because youre unhappy with my story on the  Gideon  Massacre?
Adama What happened aboard the Gideon was a tragedy. But it was not a Massacre.
Biers But the tape shows your men firing into a crowd of defenseless civilians.
Adama My marines tell a different story.
Biers Not to me. Ive submitted a dozen interview requests, all denied.
Roslin Well, thats about to change. Youve been lobbying to do a story on the Galactica for months. Commander Adama has agreed to give you unlimited access to his crew and his ship.
Adama Thats right. Unlimited access.
Biers Well, access wont buy you a propaganda piece.
Roslin We dont want one. Ms. Biers, this tape of yours has thrown fuel on a fire that was about to die. People are angry, they are distrustful of the military.
Biers Yeah, with good reason, maam.
Roslin In some cases with good reason. But I want to show the people what life aboard the Galacticas really like. I want to put a human face on the officers and the crew who protect us against cylons and guard our freedoms every day.
Biers You might not like that face when you see it.
Adama Why would that be?
Roslin All we really want is a balanced story. Show us what the men and women of Galactica are really like.
Biers Thats it?
Roslin Thats it. And I need you to do it now, before we tear each other apart.
Tigh The cag had better start cracking some heads. Half our supply runs are behind schedule.
Dualla Combat, Dualla. Colonel, its your wife. Somethings wrong.
Marine Colonel.
Tigh Ellen, are you okay?
Ellen Saul. Gods! Oh, Im so scared.
Tigh From the darkness, you must fall.
Ellen What does it mean?
Adama Racetrack. Where did you get these?
Racetrack Oh, sorry, sir, they were left over from a civilian run. Ive been meaning to throw them out.
Adama No. No, no. Put em in a safe place. Hold onto em.
Racetrack Yes, sir.
Adama Youre filming this?
Biers Weve been rolling since Colonial one. President did say total access.
Adama Youll have that. But you start shooting anything that compromises the safety of this ship, then itll be cut.
Dualla That hiss you hear is an oxygen recirc unit. We have about dozen co2 scrubbers aboard Galactica. They all work 24 hours a day.
Biers Get a close-up of that, would you, Bell?
Bell Yeah sure
Starbuck We just finished a 15-hour rotation.
Apollo Yeah, well, you better get used to it. Were gonna be short on pilots till the rest of the fleet pulls the stick out of its collective fat ass.
Starbuck More fallout from Tighs moment of glory?
Apollo You heard about his death threat?
Starbuck Couldnt have happened to a nicer guy. I just cant believe that I havent been called in for questioning yet.
Apollo Oh, you were top of the list. But dont worry, I told Tigh that you wouldnt know Caprican poetry if it was hot-soldered  across your helmet.
Starbuck From the darkness, you must fall, failed and weak, to darkness all. Kataris. Not one of his best. Can I be a suspect again? Please?
Dualla Ships galley is next on the itinerary. Our vegetable stores and canned goods are kept in titanium lockers to ensure maximum freshness.
Biers Didnt come all this way to interview the soup of the day.
Hotdog Oh--oh, no!
Kat_and_Hotdog laughing
Dualla Maam?
Apollo Here comes Tweedledum and Tweedledee.
Starbuck You guys, people are sleeping.
Palladino Yeah, keep it down.
Kat Sorry.
Orsel Lighten up, Palladino.
Kat Hey, is that on? Are you recording? Hi, mom! Miss you, mommy. Hey, this is for my buddies on freighter 212. Yeah! Thats for you!
Apollo Kat! Kat, you want to tell me what the hell you think youre doing?
Kat Um, I was just saying hi to some of my buddies on the fleet, sir.
Apollo Right. So you were literally talking out of your ass.
Kat Kinda.
Apollo Go on, get dressed.
Kat Yes, sir.
Apollo Constanza, get the hell outta here. Its the last time you come in a senior officers quarters, go, move. So, you must be the reporter we were expecting.
Biers Well, you didnt have to dress for me. Danna Biers, Fleet News Service.
Apollo Captain Lee Adama, commander of the air group. Thats pronounced, CAG. And I suggest you find yourselves an exit as soon as possible. And thats ronounced, a-sap.
Biers Think weve seen all we need to see here.
Apollo Whos brilliant idea was that?
Dualla My dad went crazy when I enlisted. He thought the military was a joke. Refuge for emotional cripples and patriotic fools.
Biers But you signed up anyway.
Dualla I guess I just wanted to believe in something.
Biers Think itll give it more memory?
Dualla Yeah, it seems pretty simple. Maybe just a basic adjustment. Its a pretty good piece.
Biers Yeah, its kind of old...
Baltar What the hells going on?
#6 I dont know.
Baltar Dont know. Im the Vice President. Shes supposed to be interviewing me, isnt she?
#6 Well, of course she should. Your title alone commands respect.
Baltar Of course it does. Its a rare commodity around here. I mean, Im the Vice President. Im not gonna beg, Ill tell you that much.
#6 Now, Gaius, you may have to beg. Youll do whatever is necessary to protect our child. Politics may not be your strong suit. But it serves us in the moment. Trust me. This one can help us.
Biers Mr. Vice President?
Baltar Hello.
Biers Hi, DAnna Biers, Fleet News Service.
Baltar Oh, youre the reporter. Thats right. Commander Adama said a news service might be joining us. Um... I suppose youre-- well, very busy doing a lot of interviews, I would imagine.
Biers Well, uh, I would love to speak to you. If youve got a second, we can do it now.
Baltar No, no. Im afraid not. I am, um, very busy. Really, really busy at the moment, snowed under. But if you get in touch with one of my aides, there might be a small window tomorrow. Im not promising anything, obviously. But I might be able to, uh, give you an interview then if--if--if--if thats what you would like. Uh, good. Good, good. Well, you just, um, carry on.
Biers What a strange little man.
Dualla Mm-hmm.
Biers Captain Adama, I hardly recognized you with your clothes on.
Apollo Look, Im sure you thought it was, uh, clever, busting into the pilots duty locker. But the areas off-limits for a reason. Its the one place where my people can unwind and be themselves.
Biers You seem to think that your pilots deserve special consideration.
Apollo Actually, I do. Like everyone else, my pilots have lost their families, and their friends, everyone they ever cared about.  But on top of that, theyre asked to put their lives on the line every single day for a fleet that seems more interested in what they do wrong than in what they do right. Theyre not asking for your pity, but they damn well deserve your respect.
Kat Gods, Chief, weve already run this up twice.
Tyrol Yeah, but something doesnt feel right.
Kat What?
Tyrol Something doesnt feel right.
Kat Well, hurry up.
Tyrol Oh, gods!
Kat Oh, thats fantastic. Thats just great.
Tyrol I knew it. How the hell did I miss that?
Kat Maybe if your knuckledraggers spent more time on maintenance, less time frakking around.
Tyrol This knuckledragger just saved your ass, sir.
Kat Why dont you say that a little louder, Chief? I dont think the camera heard you.
Tyrol You know what? Frak the camera.
Starbuck Knock it off! Knock it off! Chief, fix the ship.
Kat Yeah, fix the ship.
Starbuck Hey!
Kat What? What?
Starbuck Hey! Enough! Chief, fix her ship. You, get the hell outta here now.
Kat Camera outta my face.
Starbuck She has been pissing me off all week.
Apollo What the hells going on?
Starbuck Im taking her off rotation till she gets her head rewired. I mean--
Apollo Uh-uh, cant do it. We need the pilots. Besides, if I scratched everyone who...popped off at the chief, the cooks would be flying the missions.
Starbuck Son of a bitch. Did you get all that? You happy?
Apollo Come on. Come on, walk away. Walk away.
Kelso We were never trained for crowd control. First order of business when under attack is defend yourself and your squad.
Biers But these were civilians.
Kelso I have ten stitches that say we were under attack. The truth is, it was a command frak-up the moment Tigh put us on that supply ship. Im not surprised someones trying to take out that drunk son of a bitch.
Palladino All right, private. Belay that.
Biers Colonel Tighs been threatened?
Palladino No, this interviews over. Shut that off.
Adama Watch your step, please.
Biers Okay. Come on.
Adama Sitrep?
Tigh Fleets quiet, no enemy contact for the last ten days. No cylon contact, anyways.
Adama Well, they have their job to do. We have ours. Did you hear about the meeting on Cloud Nine?
Tigh Reps flying in from every vessel in the fleet for a king-size bitch session. Yeah, I heard.
Adama Well, they sent us an invitation to send a delegation. Youre it.
Tigh Do you mind?
Biers No, no, go ahead.
Tigh Im not exactly the most popular guy in the fleet right now.
Adama Well, itd be good then to, uh, let your critics see that youre not afraid of them.
Tigh That what you think? Ive been hiding?
Adama Youve been doing this too long to be worried about ulterior motives. Youre going because youre not afraid, and people should see that. Plus, itll also give people a chance to vent their feelings instead of seething in private. And finally, I think you need a little R & R. So consider this a mandatory shore leave. Take a swim. Get some sleep.
Tigh Sir.
Adama And, uh, stay away from the bar.
Tyrol Three. Theres three. She got locked.
Starbuck Good luck, Colonel. Have fun on Cloud Nine.
Tigh You bet.
Fuzzy Iniating Pre-flight
Fuzzy Whats going on?
Racetrack Abort launch! Everybody out now!
Tyrol Get back! Everybody back! Everybody back! Fire team. Get the fire team here now!
Tigh Whats going on?
Tyrol The main buss is totaled. Looks like somebody took a hammer to it. If this had blown in transit, the cabin would have vented to space.
Ellen Someones trying to kill you, Saul.
Tigh Comes with the stripes.
Ellen Because of that damned Gideon incident.
Tigh Ellen, we dont know that.
Ellen Of course we do. Danna Biers left two messages already. Shes giving you the chance to tell your side.
Tigh I dont have to explain myself, especially to her.
Ellen Roslin wants to placate the fleet, put the great bill Adama back on his pedestal. Fastest way to do that is by hanging you
Tigh The Gideon happened on my watch.
Ellen Yes. But you didnt order those jarheads to open fire. This is so like you, Saul. Always the proud soldier. Taking the heat because its honorable. When are you gonna realize... were all alone out here?
Biers Are you afraid when you go into combat?
Edmonson First thing they tell you is to assume youre already dead. That sounds ghoulish. Yeah, maybe. But dead men dont get scared or freeze up under fire. Me, Im just worried that hells gonna be a lonely place. And Im gonna fill it up with every toaster son of a bitch I find.
Biers Whats been the hardest for you?
Helo They try to turn off the human part of you because thats whatll get you killed. But... when youre out in the field, its not that easy. Nothings that easy.
Guard You got five minutes.
Helo Sharon? Its me. Sharon! Give me your light.
Guard What the hell are you talking about?
Helo Give me your light now! Somethings wrong!
Helo Oh, gods. Call Dr. Cottle. Now!
Biers Does that help you cope with the stress?
Gaeta Not really. Look, um, all that I ever wanted was to be an officer on a Battlestar. Okay, I trained my whole life, trained  harder than anyone in my unit. Basically, I put my life on hold until I was assigned to Galactica. Then the cylons hit. And I  realized that this is all that I know. Tech manuals, commands, and tactics, you know? Im not saying that Im unhappy. Just  wondering if theres something more.
Biers And what have you discovered?
Gaeta I hate cigarettes. Ambrosias good with a chaser. And if you have enough ambrosia-- didnt really hurt that much.
Biers There you go. Well make this as painless as possible. Drink?
Tigh Is this an interview or a cocktail party?
Biers Are you kidding? This is how we keep it painless. Just like to keep it casual, thats all. Please. Cheers, Colonel.
Tigh Cheers.
Biers Before we begin, um, I had heard a number of rumors that you had death threats leveled against you. Is that right?
Tigh This is a military vessel. We have rumors for every occasion.
Biers Was it hard for you to take over your friends command when he was shot?
Tigh I didnt take anything. Command fell to me, and I did my duty.
Biers But you were in full command of Galactica for more than a week. And in that time, there were a number of controversial actions taken.
Tigh Youre talking about the Gideon. I made a military decision. Given the same circumstances, Id do it again.
Biers So you have no regrets whatsoever?
Tigh Youre trying to set me up.
Biers Colonel, why do you think there was no official investigation into the Gideon Massacre? Please, Colonel--
Tigh Get out of my face!
Biers Did you get that?
Bell Got it.
Biers Someones a mean drunk.
Starbuck Great. I could use a sparring partner.
Biers Sorry, I, uh-- I didnt bring my gloves.
Starbuck Too bad.
Biers Captain Adama said that I could ask you about the new pilots.
Starbuck Yeah, well, Captain Adama likes to push my buttons.
Biers So what do you look for in a new recruit?
Starbuck Coordination. Good reflexes. Total commitment. And most of all, someone crazy enough to follow me into combat.
Biers Colonel, why do you think there was no official investigation into the Gideon Massacre? Please Colonel--
Tigh Get out of my face!
Adama I want to apologize for colonel Tighs behavior. It was uncalled for.
Biers Seems like a lot of people have been apologizing for him over the years, Commander. So level with me. Why has Colonel Tigh not been charged in the Gideon incident?
Adama Were at war against an enemy with a vastly superior force. I will not sacrifice the few people we have left on the altar of  public outrage.
Biers So four civilians are dead, and Tigh and the shooters take a walk.
Adama Nobody takes a walk. They all gotta live with it.
Kelly Viper five-niner-one, Galactica, you are cleared into the break. Portside landing bay, hands-on approach, checkers are green. Call the ball.
Kat Roger ball. Wait a second. Gods...damn it.
Kelly Speed two-zero-five. Keep your power up, Kat. Youre dropping below glide slope.
Kat The controls are messed up. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on.
Kelly Youre still too low. Wave off, Kat. Wave off!
Kat Oh, frak!
Starbuck what the hell is going on? That is her third wave-off.
Kat When we make a contact, the squadrons got seconds to put it all together. Pre-flight, weapons check, communications. one mistake, were a smear in the cockpit.
Biers I dont understand. Is she trying to--
Starbuck Shut the frak up. Kat.  Were gonna do this, okay? Leave the throttle alone down the middle, then chop it at the come-on in close. And feel for the deck.
Kat The controls are messed up. I cant feel it. I cant feel it. I cant feel it. I cant do it.
Starbuck Kat, we did this all through training, okay? You can stick this, just like before. Ugh!
Kelly Viper five-niner-one, Galactica, youre clear into the break, call the ball. Too low, five-niner-one, wave off! Wave off!
Starbuck No, shes putting down! Kat, full throttle, now!
Kat I cant feel it. I cant feel it.
Kat When you come back after a successful run, let me tell you. It is better than a great meal. Better than hitting a jackpot. Its better than sex.
Kelly She missed the trap. Damage control, medics, report to portside hangar bay.
Apollo What the hell happened? Kats made the trap a hundred times. Yeah, I guess 101 was a real bitch, huh?
Kat No! Let go of me! Lemme go!
Starbuck Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, Kat! Its Starbuck, youre okay. Youre home.
Kat Home? Home is dead! We gotta get outta here! Theyre gonna kill us! We gotta get outta here!
Starbuck Whats this? Stims?
Kat Please, dont take-- dont take that, please!
Starbuck Stop it.
Kat Let go! Aaah! No! Let go! Let go! Uh! Let go! Let go of me! Were gonna die! Were gonna--
Starbuck Get my pilot to sickbay now!
Kat Oh, please, dont take me! Oh, please--
Apollo Stims. And by look of her, shes been taking them by the handful.
Boomer Dont you dare touch me! What are you doing?
Cottle Listen to me! I am trying to save your baby. Hold her.
Guard This is a restricted area!
Biers Commander Adama. That woman looks just like the late Lieutenant Valerii.
Adama The tape, please.
Biers Why would Galactica be harboring a cylon?
Adama The tape.
Biers Did the baby survive?
Adama Do you understand that even a hint of this could be devastating to the morale in the fleet?
Biers Youre the master of understatement. You know, after the Gideon, this could turn the entire fleet against you.
Adama Then the real the question is whether or not it matters to you.
Biers You know, I am sick to death of people like you questioning my patriotism. We all want this fleet to survive.
Baltar I think youre doing very well. Very well, under the circumstances. I understand this has been a difficult job for you. I mean, I hear that your reports havent exactly ingratiated you with the Commander, have they? Or the rest of the crew, for that matter. Still, luckily, as a member of the civilian government, I am here to assure you that I have no such reservations.
Biers Well, I think most of the crew understands im just doing my job.
Baltar As are we all. All just doing our jobs, arent we? Im just doing my job, youre just doing your job.
#6 Okay, okay, cut to the chase, Gaius. Tell her why you deserve to lead this fleet.
Baltar As I myself discovered when I was stranded-- stranded on Kobol, I found that the stress of, uh, survival revealed leadership qualities that previously I didnt even know that I possessed, really.
Biers Yeah? I understand your party took several casualties.
Baltar Yes, that was very unfortunate. They were heroes, every one. You know what? Im ready. Um, shall we shoot this one?
Baltar Oh, its probably just a false alarm. Ignore it, really. Okay.
Biers Bell, you take the hangar deck. Im gonna take the CIC. Go!
Baltar Youre safer here really. Please youre as safe as houses down here, really. Thats show biz.
Gaeta A condition one throughout the ship. Incoming cylon raiders. This is not a drill. Repeat, action stations,action stations. Set condition onethroughout the ship this is not a drill.
Starbcuk What have we got?
Apollo Two raiders, closing fast.
Gaeta Sir, the cylon raiders are on C.B.D.R. With Galactica. Speed two-two point seven niner.
Biers Dualla, whats a C.B.D.R.?
Dualla Constant bearing, decreasing range-- collision course.
Tigh Where the hells the cap?
Dualla Other side of the fleet, sir.
Adama Scramble the alert fighters. Set condition one throughout the entire fleet. Have them spool up their FTLs just in case.
Tyrol Lets go, lets go, lets go! Move, move! Clear this deck, get this outta here! Whats the sitrep?
Starbuck Two bandits, coming hard.
Apollo Just keep your eyes open and follow us.
Tyrol All right, lets go, lets get the birds in the holes. Move em out, get this ladder outta here. Lets go, lets go, lets go, lets go. Move back, get this hose out of here.
Gaeta First team in the tubes.
Adama Dee.
Dualla Pilots on speaker.
Biers Did you ever come to terms with your dad?
Dualla I wouldnt let him. The last time we talked, it got...heated. I told him I never wanted to see him again. Three weeks later, the cylons attacked.
Biers Okay, so Im new at this. Should I be scared?
Dualla I am.
Tyrol Copy that. All right, people, thats it. Last birds away. Lets clear the nest. Get this deck ready for recovery. Lets go, lets go, lets go. Move, move!
Gaeta Sir, alert vipers are away. Gun control reports weapons manned and ready.
Apollo Apollo, wireless check.
Starbuck Starbuck, Im hearing you.
Hotdog Hotdog, one-four-one, loud and clear.
Grayshirt Grayshirt, loud and clear.
Kingston Kingston, youre good. Initiate search pattern delta.
Apollo Apollo, tally two cylon raiders, close formation.
Starbuck This is Starbuck, roger that.
Kingston Watch your formation.
Apollo Prepare to engage. Weapons hot.
Kingston Targets in view. Repeat targets in view. Lock 6-1-2-1. Weapons close 2-4-1
Gaeta Copy that.
Grayshirt Tango 1, Tango 1, Tango 1, weapons close 2-4-1
Hotdog Engaging cylon radiers. Engaging cylon raiders.
Starbuck Theyre breaking formation. Hotdog, stick with me.
Hotdog Roger that.
Starbuck Come on, you frakkin--
Hotdog Ive got no joy, lost visual.
Kingston Hes on me, Right on my six.
Apollo Come on Starbuck.
Starbuck Hotdog, raiders on your left eight. Im on em, Im on em. Yeah, splash one!
Apollo Targeting second raider.
Kingston Kingston, bandits breaking off, taking evasive action.
Hotdog Ive got him, Kingston. Come on, come to papa.
Apollo Damn it, take the shot! Thats a kill.
Adama Yes!
Tigh Dradis shows clear, Commander.
Adama This is the commander. Cylon raiders were intercepted and destroyed. Good work, people.
Starbuck Roger that, Galactica. Lets head back to the bird farm.
Adama Secure from action stations. Set condition three.
Tigh Mr. Gaeta, you have the deck.
Gaeta Yes, sir. Set condition three throughout the ship. Repeat, set condition three.
Biers Does this ever get any easier?
Dualla No, maam. It gets harder.
Biers Thank you.
Bell So how did it go out there?
Apollo Well, we didnt lose anyone. Thats a good day.
Tigh Ellen?
Biers Im not sure Ive found a story in all this yet.
Biers Go back a bit. Here, here. I know that book. Thats by Kataris.
Palladino Whats wrong, Colonel? Need a drink?
Tigh You can go to hell.
Palladino Ive been there. It was called Gideon. I cant eat, I cant sleep. I saw their faces. Those werent cylons we tagged, those were real people. Who looked like my dad, who looked like my little brother.
Tigh Well, this isnt gonna change anything.
Palladino Well, at least the people on the Gideon will have their justice.
Tigh If thats what this is about, then do it.
Palladino I will, Ill do it.
Tigh Somebody has to pay for what happened on that ship. I was in command, I sent you there. Its my fault. Come on, son. Do it.
Tigh Gideon was an accident. This is a choice.
Guard Colonel!
Tigh Were all right here.
Guard Lets go Lieutenant.
Tigh Will you get out of my face.
Biers What made you do it, Kat?
Kat I was tired. Havent gotten any sleep. Felt like I was losing my edge. I dont know what else to do.
Biers Couldnt you talk to someone?
Kat Who am I gonna talk to? Were all in the same hole. Okay, there are no replacements coming up. Theres no downtime. This is it. So I started taking stims.
Biers You made a mistake. It happens.
Kat Yeah, except now my flights a pilot short. Those guys, theyre just as tired and theyre just as messed up as I was.
Biers But theyre still laying it on the line. Ive worked my ass off defending this ship. Ive been-- Ive been frustrated, Ive been angry. Ive been everything that you can possibly think of. This is the first time that Ive felt ashamed.
Tigh Ive seen enough.
Biers Kill it. Look, I understand this might be hard for you to watch--
Tigh Its a hatchet job. The fleet already thinks were a bunch of trigger-happy assassins. This just confirms it. You show us with our pants down and our asses hanging out. Dont you have anything to say?
Adama I think its great. I think she did exactly what we asked her to do. That she put a human face on the guardians of the fleet. Warts and all. Im proud of it. You can show it to the entire fleet.
Biers It doesnt get better than that.
Roslin Id like to see the end.
Adama So would I.
Biers I came to Galactica to tell a story. In all honesty, I thought I knew what that story was before I ever set foot here. How an arrogant military let their egos get in the way of doing their job safeguarding the lives of the civilian population. But I found the truth was more complex than that. These people arent cylons. Theyre not robots blindly following orders and polishing their boots. Theyre people. Deeply flawed, yes, but deeply human too. And maybe thats saying the same thing. What struck me the most is that despite it all-- the hardships, the stress, the ever-present danger of being killed-- despite all that, they never give up. Never lie down in the road and let the truck run them over. They wake up in the morning, put on their uniforms, and do their jobs. Every day, no pay. No rest. No hope of ever laying down the burden and letting someone else do the job. There are no relief troops coming, no Colonial fleet training new recruits every day. The people on Galactica are it. They are the thin line of blue separating us from the cylons. Lieutenant Gaeta told me a remarkable statistic. Not a single member of Galacticas crew has asked to resign. Not one. Think about that. If you wore  the uniform, wouldnt you want to quit? To step aside and say, Enough. Let someone else protect the fleet. I know I would. But then, I dont wear a uniform. Most of us dont, most of us never will. The story of Galactica isnt that people make bad decisions under pressure. Its that those mistakes are the exception. Most of the time, the men and women serving under  Commander Adama get it right. The proof is that our fleet survives. And with Galactica at our side, we will endure. This is Danna Biers, Fleet News Service.
Doral That was shown across their entire fleet.
#6 Their resilience is remarkable.
Boomer Play the footage that was cut.
Boomer What are you doing! Stop it!
Cottle Listen to me! I am trying to save your baby. Hold her still.
Guard This is a restricted area!
Boomer Im still alive. Shes still alive. I told you.
#6 Thats incredible. And the baby?
Biers It was saved. We lost two raiders relaying the images back to the fleet, but I think the sacrifice was worth it.
Doral We must proceed with caution. The childs life must be protected at all costs.
Biers Yeah. Truly is a miracle from god.
