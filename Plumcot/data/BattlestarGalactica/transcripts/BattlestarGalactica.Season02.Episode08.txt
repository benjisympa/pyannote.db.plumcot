lt_joe_palladino People, just get back! Stay back, all right? We just need these supplies! Get em back, get em back!
lt_joe_palladino Cease fire! Cease fire! Medic! We need a medic in here now!
Little_Girl#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode08 dad! Dad? Oh, my gods! Oh, my gods!
danna_biers Thats gonna blow this thing wide open. And we need some stock footage of raging marines. Can intercut that with the eyewitness statements.
bell You have no right to come in here like this.
Marine#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode08 Maam, youre to come with us.
danna_biers What, am I under arrest?
Marine#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode08 No, maam.
danna_biers And what if I refuse to go?
president_laura_roslin Hello, Ms. Biers. Its nice to see you. Welcome to Colonial one.
danna_biers Madame President, its an honor. Commander Adama.
admiral_william_adama Where did you get the tape?
danna_biers From an anonymous patriot. So is this a social call or are we on the verge of another coup?
admiral_william_adama Funny.
danna_biers Just something to break the ice. I take it I am here because youre unhappy with my story on the Gideon Massacre?
admiral_william_adama What happened aboard the Gideon was a tragedy. But it was not a Massacre.
danna_biers But the tape shows your men firing into a crowd of defenseless civilians.
admiral_william_adama My marines tell a different story.
danna_biers Not to me. Ive submitted a dozen interview requests, all denied.
president_laura_roslin Well, thats about to change. Youve been lobbying to do a story on the Galactica for months. Commander Adama has agreed to give you unlimited access to his crew and his ship.
admiral_william_adama Thats right. Unlimited access.
danna_biers Well, access wont buy you a propaganda piece.
president_laura_roslin We dont want one. Ms. Biers, this tape of yours has thrown fuel on a fire that was about to die. People are angry, they are distrustful of the military.
danna_biers Yeah, with good reason, maam.
president_laura_roslin In some cases with good reason. But I want to show the people what life aboard the Galacticas really like. I want to put a human face on the officers and the crew who protect us against cylons and guard our freedoms every day.
danna_biers You might not like that face when you see it.
admiral_william_adama Why would that be?
president_laura_roslin All we really want is a balanced story. Show us what the men and women of Galactica are really like.
danna_biers Thats it?
president_laura_roslin Thats it. And I need you to do it now, before we tear each other apart.
colonel_saul_tigh The cag had better start cracking some heads. Half our supply runs are behind schedule.
officer_anastasia_dualla Combat, Dualla. Colonel, its your wife. Somethings wrong.
Marine#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode08 Colonel.
colonel_saul_tigh Ellen, are you okay?
ellen_tigh Saul. Gods! Oh, Im so scared.
colonel_saul_tigh From the darkness, you must fall.
ellen_tigh What does it mean?
admiral_william_adama Racetrack. Where did you get these?
racetrack Oh, sorry, sir, they were left over from a civilian run. Ive been meaning to throw them out.
admiral_william_adama No. No, no. Put em in a safe place. Hold onto em.
racetrack Yes, sir.
admiral_william_adama Youre filming this?
danna_biers Weve been rolling since Colonial one. President did say total access.
admiral_william_adama Youll have that. But you start shooting anything that compromises the safety of this ship, then itll be cut.
officer_anastasia_dualla That hiss you hear is an oxygen recirc unit. We have about dozen co2 scrubbers aboard Galactica. They all work 24 hours a day.
danna_biers Get a close-up of that, would you, Bell?
bell Yeah sure
captain_kara_thrace We just finished a 15-hour rotation.
cpt_lee_adama Yeah, well, you better get used to it. Were gonna be short on pilots till the rest of the fleet pulls the stick out of its collective fat ass.
captain_kara_thrace More fallout from Tighs moment of glory?
cpt_lee_adama You heard about his death threat?
captain_kara_thrace Couldnt have happened to a nicer guy. I just cant believe that I havent been called in for questioning yet.
cpt_lee_adama Oh, you were top of the list. But dont worry, I told Tigh that you wouldnt know Caprican poetry if it was hot-soldered across your helmet.
captain_kara_thrace From the darkness, you must fall, failed and weak, to darkness all. Kataris. Not one of his best. Can I be a suspect again? Please?
officer_anastasia_dualla Ships galley is next on the itinerary. Our vegetable stores and canned goods are kept in titanium lockers to ensure maximum freshness.
danna_biers Didnt come all this way to interview the soup of the day.
lt_brendan_constanza Oh--oh, no!
Kat_and_Hotdog#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode08 laughing
officer_anastasia_dualla Maam?
cpt_lee_adama Here comes Tweedledum and Tweedledee.
captain_kara_thrace You guys, people are sleeping.
lt_joe_palladino Yeah, keep it down.
louanne_katraine Sorry.
Orsel#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode08 Lighten up, Palladino.
louanne_katraine Hey, is that on? Are you recording? Hi, mom! Miss you, mommy. Hey, this is for my buddies on freighter 212. Yeah! Thats for you!
cpt_lee_adama Kat! Kat, you want to tell me what the hell you think youre doing?
louanne_katraine Um, I was just saying hi to some of my buddies on the fleet, sir.
cpt_lee_adama Right. So you were literally talking out of your ass.
louanne_katraine Kinda.
cpt_lee_adama Go on, get dressed.
louanne_katraine Yes, sir.
cpt_lee_adama Constanza, get the hell outta here. Its the last time you come in a senior officers quarters, go, move. So, you must be the reporter we were expecting.
danna_biers Well, you didnt have to dress for me. Danna Biers, Fleet News Service.
cpt_lee_adama Captain Lee Adama, commander of the air group. Thats pronounced, CAG. And I suggest you find yourselves an exit as soon as possible. And thats ronounced, a-sap.
danna_biers Think weve seen all we need to see here.
cpt_lee_adama Whos brilliant idea was that?
officer_anastasia_dualla My dad went crazy when I enlisted. He thought the military was a joke. Refuge for emotional cripples and patriotic fools.
danna_biers But you signed up anyway.
officer_anastasia_dualla I guess I just wanted to believe in something.
danna_biers Think itll give it more memory?
officer_anastasia_dualla Yeah, it seems pretty simple. Maybe just a basic adjustment. Its a pretty good piece.
danna_biers Yeah, its kind of old...
dr_gaius_baltar What the hells going on?
number_six I dont know.
dr_gaius_baltar Dont know. Im the Vice President. Shes supposed to be interviewing me, isnt she?
number_six Well, of course she should. Your title alone commands respect.
dr_gaius_baltar Of course it does. Its a rare commodity around here. I mean, Im the Vice President. Im not gonna beg, Ill tell you that much.
number_six Now, Gaius, you may have to beg. Youll do whatever is necessary to protect our child. Politics may not be your strong suit. But it serves us in the moment. Trust me. This one can help us.
danna_biers Mr. Vice President?
dr_gaius_baltar Hello.
danna_biers Hi, DAnna Biers, Fleet News Service.
dr_gaius_baltar Oh, youre the reporter. Thats right. Commander Adama said a news service might be joining us. Um... I suppose youre-- well, very busy doing a lot of interviews, I would imagine.
danna_biers Well, uh, I would love to speak to you. If youve got a second, we can do it now.
dr_gaius_baltar No, no. Im afraid not. I am, um, very busy. Really, really busy at the moment, snowed under. But if you get in touch with one of my aides, there might be a small window tomorrow. Im not promising anything, obviously. But I might be able to, uh, give you an interview then if--if--if--if thats what you would like. Uh, good. Good, good. Well, you just, um, carry on.
danna_biers What a strange little man.
officer_anastasia_dualla Mm-hmm.
danna_biers Captain Adama, I hardly recognized you with your clothes on.
cpt_lee_adama Look, Im sure you thought it was, uh, clever, busting into the pilots duty locker. But the areas off-limits for a reason. Its the one place where my people can unwind and be themselves.
danna_biers You seem to think that your pilots deserve special consideration.
cpt_lee_adama Actually, I do. Like everyone else, my pilots have lost their families, and their friends, everyone they ever cared about. But on top of that, theyre asked to put their lives on the line every single day for a fleet that seems more interested in what they do wrong than in what they do right. Theyre not asking for your pity, but they damn well deserve your respect.
louanne_katraine Gods, Chief, weve already run this up twice.
chief_galen_tyrol Yeah, but something doesnt feel right.
louanne_katraine What?
chief_galen_tyrol Something doesnt feel right.
louanne_katraine Well, hurry up.
chief_galen_tyrol Oh, gods!
louanne_katraine Oh, thats fantastic. Thats just great.
chief_galen_tyrol I knew it. How the hell did I miss that?
louanne_katraine Maybe if your knuckledraggers spent more time on maintenance, less time frakking around.
chief_galen_tyrol This knuckledragger just saved your ass, sir.
louanne_katraine Why dont you say that a little louder, Chief? I dont think the camera heard you.
chief_galen_tyrol You know what? Frak the camera.
captain_kara_thrace Knock it off! Knock it off! Chief, fix the ship.
louanne_katraine Yeah, fix the ship.
captain_kara_thrace Hey!
louanne_katraine What? What?
captain_kara_thrace Hey! Enough! Chief, fix her ship. You, get the hell outta here now.
louanne_katraine Camera outta my face.
captain_kara_thrace She has been pissing me off all week.
cpt_lee_adama What the hells going on?
captain_kara_thrace Im taking her off rotation till she gets her head rewired. I mean--
cpt_lee_adama Uh-uh, cant do it. We need the pilots. Besides, if I scratched everyone who...popped off at the chief, the cooks would be flying the missions.
captain_kara_thrace Son of a bitch. Did you get all that? You happy?
cpt_lee_adama Come on. Come on, walk away. Walk away.
pvt_scott_kelso We were never trained for crowd control. First order of business when under attack is defend yourself and your squad.
danna_biers But these were civilians.
pvt_scott_kelso I have ten stitches that say we were under attack. The truth is, it was a command frak-up the moment Tigh put us on that supply ship. Im not surprised someones trying to take out that drunk son of a bitch.
lt_joe_palladino All right, private. Belay that.
danna_biers Colonel Tighs been threatened?
lt_joe_palladino No, this interviews over. Shut that off.
admiral_william_adama Watch your step, please.
danna_biers Okay. Come on.
admiral_william_adama Sitrep?
colonel_saul_tigh Fleets quiet, no enemy contact for the last ten days. No cylon contact, anyways.
admiral_william_adama Well, they have their job to do. We have ours. Did you hear about the meeting on Cloud Nine?
colonel_saul_tigh Reps flying in from every vessel in the fleet for a king-size bitch session. Yeah, I heard.
admiral_william_adama Well, they sent us an invitation to send a delegation. Youre it.
colonel_saul_tigh Do you mind?
danna_biers No, no, go ahead.
colonel_saul_tigh Im not exactly the most popular guy in the fleet right now.
admiral_william_adama Well, itd be good then to, uh, let your critics see that youre not afraid of them.
colonel_saul_tigh That what you think? Ive been hiding?
admiral_william_adama Youve been doing this too long to be worried about ulterior motives. Youre going because youre not afraid, and people should see that. Plus, itll also give people a chance to vent their feelings instead of seething in private. And finally, I think you need a little R & R. So consider this a mandatory shore leave. Take a swim. Get some sleep.
colonel_saul_tigh Sir.
admiral_william_adama And, uh, stay away from the bar.
chief_galen_tyrol Three. Theres three. She got locked.
captain_kara_thrace Good luck, Colonel. Have fun on Cloud Nine.
colonel_saul_tigh You bet.
Fuzzy#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode08 Iniating Pre-flight
Fuzzy#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode08 Whats going on?
racetrack Abort launch! Everybody out now!
chief_galen_tyrol Get back! Everybody back! Everybody back! Fire team. Get the fire team here now!
colonel_saul_tigh Whats going on?
chief_galen_tyrol The main buss is totaled. Looks like somebody took a hammer to it. If this had blown in transit, the cabin would have vented to space.
ellen_tigh Someones trying to kill you, Saul.
colonel_saul_tigh Comes with the stripes.
ellen_tigh Because of that damned Gideon incident.
colonel_saul_tigh Ellen, we dont know that.
ellen_tigh Of course we do. Danna Biers left two messages already. Shes giving you the chance to tell your side.
colonel_saul_tigh I dont have to explain myself, especially to her.
ellen_tigh Roslin wants to placate the fleet, put the great bill Adama back on his pedestal. Fastest way to do that is by hanging you
colonel_saul_tigh The Gideon happened on my watch.
ellen_tigh Yes. But you didnt order those jarheads to open fire. This is so like you, Saul. Always the proud soldier. Taking the heat because its honorable. When are you gonna realize... were all alone out here?
danna_biers Are you afraid when you go into combat?
Edmonson#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode08 First thing they tell you is to assume youre already dead. That sounds ghoulish. Yeah, maybe. But dead men dont get scared or freeze up under fire. Me, Im just worried that hells gonna be a lonely place. And Im gonna fill it up with every toaster son of a bitch I find.
danna_biers Whats been the hardest for you?
captain_karl_agathon They try to turn off the human part of you because thats whatll get you killed. But... when youre out in the field, its not that easy. Nothings that easy.
Guard#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode08 You got five minutes.
captain_karl_agathon Sharon? Its me. Sharon! Give me your light.
Guard#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode08 What the hell are you talking about?
captain_karl_agathon Give me your light now! Somethings wrong!
captain_karl_agathon Oh, gods. Call Dr. Cottle. Now!
danna_biers Does that help you cope with the stress?
lt_felix_gaeta Not really. Look, um, all that I ever wanted was to be an officer on a Battlestar. Okay, I trained my whole life, trained harder than anyone in my unit. Basically, I put my life on hold until I was assigned to Galactica. Then the cylons hit. And I realized that this is all that I know. Tech manuals, commands, and tactics, you know? Im not saying that Im unhappy. Just wondering if theres something more.
danna_biers And what have you discovered?
lt_felix_gaeta I hate cigarettes. Ambrosias good with a chaser. And if you have enough ambrosia-- didnt really hurt that much.
danna_biers There you go. Well make this as painless as possible. Drink?
colonel_saul_tigh Is this an interview or a cocktail party?
danna_biers Are you kidding? This is how we keep it painless. Just like to keep it casual, thats all. Please. Cheers, Colonel.
colonel_saul_tigh Cheers.
danna_biers Before we begin, um, I had heard a number of rumors that you had death threats leveled against you. Is that right?
colonel_saul_tigh This is a military vessel. We have rumors for every occasion.
danna_biers Was it hard for you to take over your friends command when he was shot?
colonel_saul_tigh I didnt take anything. Command fell to me, and I did my duty.
danna_biers But you were in full command of Galactica for more than a week. And in that time, there were a number of controversial actions taken.
colonel_saul_tigh Youre talking about the Gideon. I made a military decision. Given the same circumstances, Id do it again.
danna_biers So you have no regrets whatsoever?
colonel_saul_tigh Youre trying to set me up.
danna_biers Colonel, why do you think there was no official investigation into the Gideon Massacre? Please, Colonel--
colonel_saul_tigh Get out of my face!
danna_biers Did you get that?
bell Got it.
danna_biers Someones a mean drunk.
captain_kara_thrace Great. I could use a sparring partner.
danna_biers Sorry, I, uh-- I didnt bring my gloves.
captain_kara_thrace Too bad.
danna_biers Captain Adama said that I could ask you about the new pilots.
captain_kara_thrace Yeah, well, Captain Adama likes to push my buttons.
danna_biers So what do you look for in a new recruit?
captain_kara_thrace Coordination. Good reflexes. Total commitment. And most of all, someone crazy enough to follow me into combat.
danna_biers Colonel, why do you think there was no official investigation into the Gideon Massacre? Please Colonel--
colonel_saul_tigh Get out of my face!
admiral_william_adama I want to apologize for colonel Tighs behavior. It was uncalled for.
danna_biers Seems like a lot of people have been apologizing for him over the years, Commander. So level with me. Why has Colonel Tigh not been charged in the Gideon incident?
admiral_william_adama Were at war against an enemy with a vastly superior force. I will not sacrifice the few people we have left on the altar of public outrage.
danna_biers So four civilians are dead, and Tigh and the shooters take a walk.
admiral_william_adama Nobody takes a walk. They all gotta live with it.
captain_aaron_kelly Viper five-niner-one, Galactica, you are cleared into the break. Portside landing bay, hands-on approach, checkers are green. Call the ball.
louanne_katraine Roger ball. Wait a second. Gods...damn it.
captain_aaron_kelly Speed two-zero-five. Keep your power up, Kat. Youre dropping below glide slope.
louanne_katraine The controls are messed up. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on.
captain_aaron_kelly Youre still too low. Wave off, Kat. Wave off!
louanne_katraine Oh, frak!
captain_kara_thrace what the hell is going on? That is her third wave-off.
louanne_katraine When we make a contact, the squadrons got seconds to put it all together. Pre-flight, weapons check, communications. one mistake, were a smear in the cockpit.
danna_biers I dont understand. Is she trying to--
captain_kara_thrace Shut the frak up. Kat. Were gonna do this, okay? Leave the throttle alone down the middle, then chop it at the come-on in close. And feel for the deck.
louanne_katraine The controls are messed up. I cant feel it. I cant feel it. I cant feel it. I cant do it.
captain_kara_thrace Kat, we did this all through training, okay? You can stick this, just like before. Ugh!
captain_aaron_kelly Viper five-niner-one, Galactica, youre clear into the break, call the ball. Too low, five-niner-one, wave off! Wave off!
captain_kara_thrace No, shes putting down! Kat, full throttle, now!
louanne_katraine I cant feel it. I cant feel it.
louanne_katraine When you come back after a successful run, let me tell you. It is better than a great meal. Better than hitting a jackpot. Its better than sex.
captain_aaron_kelly She missed the trap. Damage control, medics, report to portside hangar bay.
cpt_lee_adama What the hell happened? Kats made the trap a hundred times. Yeah, I guess 101 was a real bitch, huh?
louanne_katraine No! Let go of me! Lemme go!
captain_kara_thrace Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, Kat! Its Starbuck, youre okay. Youre home.
louanne_katraine Home? Home is dead! We gotta get outta here! Theyre gonna kill us! We gotta get outta here!
captain_kara_thrace Whats this? Stims?
louanne_katraine Please, dont take-- dont take that, please!
captain_kara_thrace Stop it.
louanne_katraine Let go! Aaah! No! Let go! Let go! Uh! Let go! Let go of me! Were gonna die! Were gonna--
captain_kara_thrace Get my pilot to sickbay now!
louanne_katraine Oh, please, dont take me! Oh, please--
cpt_lee_adama Stims. And by look of her, shes been taking them by the handful.
lt_sharon_valerii Dont you dare touch me! What are you doing?
dr_cottle Listen to me! I am trying to save your baby. Hold her.
Guard#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode08 This is a restricted area!
danna_biers Commander Adama. That woman looks just like the late Lieutenant Valerii.
admiral_william_adama The tape, please.
danna_biers Why would Galactica be harboring a cylon?
admiral_william_adama The tape.
danna_biers Did the baby survive?
admiral_william_adama Do you understand that even a hint of this could be devastating to the morale in the fleet?
danna_biers Youre the master of understatement. You know, after the Gideon, this could turn the entire fleet against you.
admiral_william_adama Then the real the question is whether or not it matters to you.
danna_biers You know, I am sick to death of people like you questioning my patriotism. We all want this fleet to survive.
dr_gaius_baltar I think youre doing very well. Very well, under the circumstances. I understand this has been a difficult job for you. I mean, I hear that your reports havent exactly ingratiated you with the Commander, have they? Or the rest of the crew, for that matter. Still, luckily, as a member of the civilian government, I am here to assure you that I have no such reservations.
danna_biers Well, I think most of the crew understands im just doing my job.
dr_gaius_baltar As are we all. All just doing our jobs, arent we? Im just doing my job, youre just doing your job.
number_six Okay, okay, cut to the chase, Gaius. Tell her why you deserve to lead this fleet.
dr_gaius_baltar As I myself discovered when I was stranded-- stranded on Kobol, I found that the stress of, uh, survival revealed leadership qualities that previously I didnt even know that I possessed, really.
danna_biers Yeah? I understand your party took several casualties.
dr_gaius_baltar Yes, that was very unfortunate. They were heroes, every one. You know what? Im ready. Um, shall we shoot this one?
dr_gaius_baltar Oh, its probably just a false alarm. Ignore it, really. Okay.
danna_biers Bell, you take the hangar deck. Im gonna take the CIC. Go!
dr_gaius_baltar Youre safer here really. Please youre as safe as houses down here, really. Thats show biz.
lt_felix_gaeta A condition one throughout the ship. Incoming cylon raiders. This is not a drill. Repeat, action stations,action stations. Set condition onethroughout the ship this is not a drill.
captain_kara_thrace What have we got?
cpt_lee_adama Two raiders, closing fast.
lt_felix_gaeta Sir, the cylon raiders are on C.B.D.R. With Galactica. Speed two-two point seven niner.
danna_biers Dualla, whats a C.B.D.R.?
officer_anastasia_dualla Constant bearing, decreasing range-- collision course.
colonel_saul_tigh Where the hells the cap?
officer_anastasia_dualla Other side of the fleet, sir.
admiral_william_adama Scramble the alert fighters. Set condition one throughout the entire fleet. Have them spool up their FTLs just in case.
chief_galen_tyrol Lets go, lets go, lets go! Move, move! Clear this deck, get this outta here! Whats the sitrep?
captain_kara_thrace Two bandits, coming hard.
cpt_lee_adama Just keep your eyes open and follow us.
chief_galen_tyrol All right, lets go, lets get the birds in the holes. Move em out, get this ladder outta here. Lets go, lets go, lets go, lets go. Move back, get this hose out of here.
lt_felix_gaeta First team in the tubes.
admiral_william_adama Dee.
officer_anastasia_dualla Pilots on speaker.
danna_biers Did you ever come to terms with your dad?
officer_anastasia_dualla I wouldnt let him. The last time we talked, it got...heated. I told him I never wanted to see him again. Three weeks later, the cylons attacked.
danna_biers Okay, so Im new at this. Should I be scared?
officer_anastasia_dualla I am.
chief_galen_tyrol Copy that. All right, people, thats it. Last birds away. Lets clear the nest. Get this deck ready for recovery. Lets go, lets go, lets go. Move, move!
lt_felix_gaeta Sir, alert vipers are away. Gun control reports weapons manned and ready.
cpt_lee_adama Apollo, wireless check.

lt_brendan_constanza Ive got him, Kingston. Come on, come to papa.
cpt_lee_adama Damn it, take the shot! Thats a kill.
admiral_william_adama Yes!
colonel_saul_tigh Dradis shows clear, Commander.
admiral_william_adama This is the commander. Cylon raiders were intercepted and destroyed. Good work, people.
captain_kara_thrace Roger that, Galactica. Lets head back to the bird farm.
admiral_william_adama Secure from action stations. Set condition three.
colonel_saul_tigh Mr. Gaeta, you have the deck.
lt_felix_gaeta Yes, sir. Set condition three throughout the ship. Repeat, set condition three.
danna_biers Does this ever get any easier?
officer_anastasia_dualla No, maam. It gets harder.
danna_biers Thank you.
bell So how did it go out there?
cpt_lee_adama Well, we didnt lose anyone. Thats a good day.
colonel_saul_tigh Ellen?
danna_biers Im not sure Ive found a story in all this yet.
danna_biers Go back a bit. Here, here. I know that book. Thats by Kataris.
lt_joe_palladino Whats wrong, Colonel? Need a drink?
colonel_saul_tigh You can go to hell.
lt_joe_palladino Ive been there. It was called Gideon. I cant eat, I cant sleep. I saw their faces. Those werent cylons we tagged, those were real people. Who looked like my dad, who looked like my little brother.
colonel_saul_tigh Well, this isnt gonna change anything.
lt_joe_palladino Well, at least the people on the Gideon will have their justice.
colonel_saul_tigh If thats what this is about, then do it.
lt_joe_palladino I will, Ill do it.
colonel_saul_tigh Somebody has to pay for what happened on that ship. I was in command, I sent you there. Its my fault. Come on, son. Do it.
colonel_saul_tigh Gideon was an accident. This is a choice.
Guard#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode08 Colonel!
colonel_saul_tigh Were all right here.
Guard#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode08 Lets go Lieutenant.
colonel_saul_tigh Will you get out of my face.
danna_biers What made you do it, Kat?
louanne_katraine I was tired. Havent gotten any sleep. Felt like I was losing my edge. I dont know what else to do.
danna_biers Couldnt you talk to someone?
louanne_katraine Who am I gonna talk to? Were all in the same hole. Okay, there are no replacements coming up. Theres no downtime. This is it. So I started taking stims.
danna_biers You made a mistake. It happens.
louanne_katraine Yeah, except now my flights a pilot short. Those guys, theyre just as tired and theyre just as messed up as I was.
danna_biers But theyre still laying it on the line. Ive worked my ass off defending this ship. Ive been-- Ive been frustrated, Ive been angry. Ive been everything that you can possibly think of. This is the first time that Ive felt ashamed.
colonel_saul_tigh Ive seen enough.
danna_biers Kill it. Look, I understand this might be hard for you to watch--
colonel_saul_tigh Its a hatchet job. The fleet already thinks were a bunch of trigger-happy assassins. This just confirms it. You show us with our pants down and our asses hanging out. Dont you have anything to say?
admiral_william_adama I think its great. I think she did exactly what we asked her to do. That she put a human face on the guardians of the fleet. Warts and all. Im proud of it. You can show it to the entire fleet.
danna_biers It doesnt get better than that.
president_laura_roslin Id like to see the end.
admiral_william_adama So would I.
danna_biers I came to Galactica to tell a story. In all honesty, I thought I knew what that story was before I ever set foot here. How an arrogant military let their egos get in the way of doing their job safeguarding the lives of the civilian population. But I found the truth was more complex than that. These people arent cylons. Theyre not robots blindly following orders and polishing their boots. Theyre people. Deeply flawed, yes, but deeply human too. And maybe thats saying the same thing. What struck me the most is that despite it all-- the hardships, the stress, the ever-present danger of being killed-- despite all that, they never give up. Never lie down in the road and let the truck run them over. They wake up in the morning, put on their uniforms, and do their jobs. Every day, no pay. No rest. No hope of ever laying down the burden and letting someone else do the job. There are no relief troops coming, no Colonial fleet training new recruits every day. The people on Galactica are it. They are the thin line of blue separating us from the cylons. Lieutenant Gaeta told me a remarkable statistic. Not a single member of Galacticas crew has asked to resign. Not one. Think about that. If you wore the uniform, wouldnt you want to quit? To step aside and say, Enough. Let someone else protect the fleet. I know I would. But then, I dont wear a uniform. Most of us dont, most of us never will. The story of Galactica isnt that people make bad decisions under pressure. Its that those mistakes are the exception. Most of the time, the men and women serving under Commander Adama get it right. The proof is that our fleet survives. And with Galactica at our side, we will endure. This is Danna Biers, Fleet News Service.
aaron_doral That was shown across their entire fleet.
number_six Their resilience is remarkable.
lt_sharon_valerii Play the footage that was cut.
lt_sharon_valerii What are you doing! Stop it!
dr_cottle Listen to me! I am trying to save your baby. Hold her still.
Guard#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode08 This is a restricted area!
lt_sharon_valerii Im still alive. Shes still alive. I told you.
number_six Thats incredible. And the baby?
danna_biers It was saved. We lost two raiders relaying the images back to the fleet, but I think the sacrifice was worth it.
aaron_doral We must proceed with caution. The childs life must be protected at all costs.
danna_biers Yeah. Truly is a miracle from god.
