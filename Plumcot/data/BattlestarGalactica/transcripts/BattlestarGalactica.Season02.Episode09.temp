Tyrol Viper 289, how are we feeling today?
Tyrol Oh, great.
Helo Hey I thought Id find you here.Hey, Karl Agathon.
Starbuck You want to sit in?
Helo Maybe next time.
Duck So hes the cylon lover.
Starbuck You know what? I dont care who or what he fraks. He saved my ass down there, all right?
Duck How could anyone fall in love with a toaster, though?
Starbuck Same way I hear everyone was high-fiving our Sharon right before she put two in Adamas chest. The bastards frak with your head.
Hotdog Yeah. Just ask the chief.
Tyrol I knew it.
Tyrol I need a drink.
Seelix Tan, rested, ready. Look at you.
Cally Rested, anyway. Nothing to do but eat and sleep in the can. Hey.
Jammer Unauthorized discharge of a firearm? What a bogus charge.
Cally I know.
Figurski They should have given you a medal for popping that toaster. Hey, chief.
Cally Chief. I heard that you went to bat for me.
Tyrol Forget it.
Cally I want you to know--
Tyrol Forget it. I need all the knuckledraggers I can get.
Tyrol Sharon flew 47 missions in this thing. Still couldnt trap a landing worth a damn. Had to bend the undercarriage back into place after every landing.
Helo Approaches made her nervous. She was afraid youd be watching.
Tyrol I usually was.
Racetrack Screw it.
Starbuck Youre folding with three up? Are you crazy?
Racetrack Not when youve got me beat. Prince high red, right? Been playing with these cards for so long, I know every fold.
Starbuck So lifes a bitch.  What do you want to do, cry about it?
Racetrack No, I just want it to end, okay? The bad food, the endless rotations, pretending that a card game is the high point of our day.
Starbuck Its not going to last forever, all right? Earth is out there.
Racetrack Right. We could all be chasing our tails over some half-assed planetarium show.
Starbuck And you guys can all go to hell. Im going to go find Helo.
Racetrack Good idea. Maybe that cylon whore taught him a few tricks.
Helo Hey! Look, chief. I never intended for sharon and I to-- You know, it just kind of evolved.
Tyrol Just a couple lovesick kids, huh?
Helo I know how she felt about you, okay? She loves you.
Tyrol Did she fill you in on the rest of the plan? She and I were going to muster out at the end of our service. You know, then we would get married. Maybe we would have children. I guess Im just a big frakkin idiot, though, huh? Probably that goddamn toasters plan all along.
Helo Dont call her that.
Tyrol Sucker some moron into giving her a kid. Hey, you know, but you know what? I should probably be grateful to you. Probably be grateful. You know why? Because that freak in her belly could have been mine.
Helo Hey, you okay? Im sorry.
Tyrol Son of a--
Helo Thats enough, Chief!
Tyrol You dont get to call it.
Helo Enough!
Tyrol Come on, you damn toaster lover!
Tyrol I dont even know why Im mad at you. My Sharons dead. That thing in the brig, that isnt Sharon.
Dualla Roger, blue leader. Say fuel state. Ah!
Tigh What the hell is that?
Gaeta It was us, sir. But I cant find a source for the transmission. Somethings triggering our com system to broadcast an automatic signal.
Tigh Which the cylons could trace to get a fix on our position.
Adama Lets assume that for now. Update and distribute the emergency jump sites just in case they show up again. Dee, get me a--
Dualla Im okay. Im okay, sir.
Adama Stay down. Well get you up to Doc Cottle, make sure everythings okay.
Tigh Mr. Gaeta, find out what happened.
Dualla Im okay.
Adama Mr. Gaeta.
Gaeta A power surge energized the board. Systems been twitchy ever since the cylons infiltrated our network.
Adama Mr. Gaeta, this is more than a glitch.
Tigh Commanders right. I dont care if you have to go through this program line by line; fix it.
Gaeta Excuse me?
Tigh You heard me.
Gaeta Sir, Im running every diagnostic weve got. Checking each line of code could take days.
Tigh I am not interested in excuses. Fix it!
Gaeta Its not an excuse, sir. Its a frakking fact!
Adama Mr. Gaeta.
Gaeta Yes, sir.
Adama Pull yourself together.
Gaeta Im sorry, sir.
Tigh What the hell is his problem?
Adama Months on the run, and what do we have to show for it? Casualties. Deteriorating conditions. This crew needs a rest. Its finally hitting them, thats all. Our old lives are gone. The only thing we have to look forward to is this.
Apollo Hey, chief, wheres 289? I need her for drills today.
Tyrol Ships grounded, sir.
Apollo What? For how long?
Tyrol Permanently. Were salvaging what we can, but its gone.
Apollo Damn it, I need that ship online.
Tyrol What can I tell you, captain? Engine mounts are shot. Cockpits seals are cracked. If it was a horse, Id shoot it.
Seelix Got something, chief.
Apollo Chief Come on, Work with me here. I need your help.
Tyrol What do want me to do, work my crew to death?
Apollo No, just do your best. Nobodys expecting any miracles.
Tyrol Maybe thats the problem.
Tyrol Frak it. Why not?
Jammer Whats going on, chief?
Tyrol All right, heres the deal. We are going to build a new fighter.
Jammer What about the rest of the ships? Im three days backlogged on repairs as is.
Tyrol This is strictly an off-duty project. Nobody takes one minute away from regular maintenance and repairs. You got it? You dont think we can do this?
Jammer I wouldnt even know how to begin.
Figurski What else is new?
Jammer Oh, screw you. Okay, hes talking about fabricating a frame, avionics, life support. Its frakkin impossible.
Tyrol You know what, then? Forget you. I dont need you.
Cally Chief, wait. Its not like that.
Tyrol I said forget it. Get back to work. Thats an order.
Roslin How much time do I have?
Cottle Weeks. A month at the outside.
Roslin Will I be able to work?
Cottle Unless the cancer goes to your brain. That happens, you--
Starbuck Someones a tad aggressive.
Apollo Just shut up and shoot.
Starbuck My gods, between you and Racetrack, its like-- having a conversation is like walking through a minefield.
Apollo And youre the last person who should be lecturing me about manners.
Starbuck From what I hear, youve also been riding Chief Tyrol pretty good.
Apollo Press it. I just reminded him that I expect viper maintenance to take precedence over his hobby project.
Starbuck Nice! Im surprised he didnt take a swing at you.
Apollo Come on, Starbuck. You dont actually think that piece of junks gonna actually fly, do you?
Starbuck 50 cubits says he gets it in the air.
Apollo Yeah? And whos gonna fly it? Its not gonna be me.
Hotdog Dont look at me.
Apollo I wasnt looking at you. What?
Starbuck Ill fly it. Ill fly it.
Apollo You?
Starbuck Me.
Apollo Why?
Starbuck Because... while everyone else is standing around whining--
Apollo Were whining?
Starbuck The chief is doing something positive.
Apollo Im deeply moved. Really? Honestly, I am.
Starbuck His lips are blue. You look like a blueberry.
Apollo Theres no oxygen in here. Theres no oxygen in here. Theres no oxygen.
Starbuck Im empty.
Starbuck Nice shot.
Gaeta The environmental computer decided that the firing range was overpressurized and started bleeding out air to compensate.
Apollo Two more minutes, and wed have been dead.
Adama Power fluctuations, equipment failures.
Gaeta Sir, I think Ive found whats causing it.
Adama What is that?
Baltar Its a cylon logic bomb. A heuristic computer virus. Its capable of learning, evolving, and probably running in parallel with every computer in the ship right now, just waiting to be activated. No doubt left behind when the cylons infiltrated the network Colonel Tigh set up the day you were shot, sir.
Adama That was weeks ago. Why now?
Gaeta Most likely, sir, it took this long for it to crack our encrypted pass codes. And once that happened, it started  testing its ability to control our systems-- electrical, environmental.
Adama How do you kill it?
Baltar Well, thats the tricky part. If its a cylon virus, it is extremely difficult to eradicate.
Adama Well, I guess im pretty lucky, then, cause I have an expert on board. Tell helo to run this past our prisoner.
Tyrol Come on.  Come on. Son of a bitch. I got it; go back to work.
Figurski Its a two-man job, chief. You want this wing up or not?
Tyrol On three. one, two, three. Great, great. Hold it there.
Dualla Sir? Were continuing to experience power spikes and equipment failures across the ship.
Adama Thank you.
Tigh Wed better up our alert status and put our damage-control teams on stand-by.
Adama Not yet. Have you seen this ship that the chief is building?
Tigh His imaginary fighter? I dont need to see it to know its a waste of time.
Adama The deck crew doesnt seem to think so.
Tigh We need to focus on the fleet weve got left, not get bogged down in some pipe dream. We should shut it down.
Adama It may come to that. But this project, its giving them something. Im not going to take that away... until I have to.
Dualla Doc cottle cleared me. Feel like hitting something.
Apollo Okay. Dont square up. Dont square up. Rotate. And just drop the knee.
Gaeta Attention on Galactica. Power outage reported on deck 12.
Apollo Thats nice. Now. If you want to throw them, Ill be you. Head in a lock. Grab the wrist. Secure the arm. And Im just going to drop the knee, rotate 45.
Dualla Okay.
Dualla Yeah. Just like we did in basic.
Apollo Lets bring a live opponent into the mix.
Apollo And strip the knife.
Dualla Billy hey. How long have you been on board?
Billy I just arrived.
Helo Do you have actual memories of being with the chief before the cylon attack?
Boomer Yeah. Im sorry. You asked.
Helo Do you still love him?
Boomer Helo. Youre the father of my child. Youre the first in my heart. And nothing is ever going to change that.
Helo All right, we have to get to this. Dr. Baltar said its some sort of cylon logic bomb. Do you see anything?
Boomer Can you flip?
Helo Sharon? Sharon, whats wrong? Sharon!
Boomer I need to talk to Commander Adama. Right now.
Helo Why?
Boomer Its a cylon virus, all right. Its been learning your systems, testing, adapting, finding weak spots.
Helo For what?
Boomer So they can turn Galacticas systems against you. Crash you into other ships, detonate your weapons stores, suffocate the crews.
Helo What about you, the baby?
Boomer Im a liability to them, a mistake. Helo, this logic bomb will run its course in a matter of hours. once it does, the cylons will be on top of us. Theyre gonna kill us all.
Boomer Commander Adama--
Adama Whatever it is you have to say, make it quick.
Apollo Well, I hate to say it, but youve got the cockpit too far back. Youre gonna run into cg problems when you maneuver.
Starbuck Were not going for maneuverability, Captain. Were going for speed. Besides, you didnt think this thing would fly anyway.
Apollo Well, it sure as hell wont with the cockpit rammed up its a-- Dee?
Dualla Hey.
Apollo What are you doing here?
Dualla Communications, I think. Chiefs great with the hydraulics, but this com systems a mess.
Figurski Ten hut.
Tigh Had to see this with my own eyes. Wont be long before we have the whole CIC down here. You working on this class project too, Apollo?
Apollo No, sir.
Tigh Its good to see someone has a little sense. Wheres the chief, the tool room?
Starbuck Ah, getting in some rack time, sir.
Tigh Whats this, chief?
Tyrol Im making solvent, sir, to clean machine parts.
Tigh Solvent my ass. I know a still when I smell it. What the hell are you up to?
Tyrol I need booze to trade for parts. Im scrounging most of what I can from the fleet, but I need engines. I know I need Commander Adamas permission to cannibalize one of the wrecks.
Tigh Engines or not, we both know that piece of crap out there is never going to fly.
Tyrol I gotta try, Colonel.
Tigh Whats the point?
Tyrol Because that ship, the work, thats all Ive got left. I dont have that, I--
Tigh I almost forgot. I promised the XO of the Baah Pakal Id help him out.
Tyrol Sir?
Tigh Hes got some obsolete DDG-62 engines taking up space on his flight deck. Theyre probably crap, but I told him that I would have a crew in there to haul em out as soon as possible.
Tyrol Glad to be of help, sir.
Tigh Good.
Adama Madam President, your shuttles ready.
Roslin Of course. Thank you again for letting me use your quarters.
Adama Please.
Roslin I wanted to return this.
Adama This was a gift.
Roslin Never lend a book, I know. But Ive had it far too long. It belongs in your collection. Im late for a Quorum meeting. Is there a problem?
Adama Our computers have been infected by a cylon virus, corrupting systems throughout the entire ship. Ive just been notified that this is a prelude to an all-out attack by the cylons.
Roslin I assume youve tried to disable it.
Adama Mr. Gaeta and the Vice President are handling that right now. Im not hopeful.
Roslin Commander, Im not sure what I can offer you here besides my moral support.
Adama Actually, Madam President, I could use your advice.
Tigh You want to what?
Geata Completely erase our computer drives, cold restart the entire ships system, then restore them using our prewar backups.
Tigh Leaving us with our pants down until were back online. The commander will never go for this.
Geata Ive already spoken to him, sir.
Tigh What did he say?
Geata Hes considering it.
Baltar Its the only way to destroy the virus.
Tigh I thought the commander told you to stay out of this.
Baltar Im sorry; do you want to survive this one or not, Colonel?
Tigh All right, so we calculate a jump and get some distance on these cylon bastards--
Geata No, sir, we cant risk a jump. All of our systems are compromised, including navigation. The virus could drop us in the middle of a sun.
Baltar Were running out of time; our signals going to catch up with the cylon fleet. If have not come up with anything before then--
Gaeta Theyll take control of all of our systems, and then theyll have a hundred ways to kill us.
Adama Ive just come from seeing our cylon prisoner. Shes offering a possible solution to the problem.
Roslin And youre wondering if you can trust her.
Adama It took everything I have not to put my hands around her throat. I cant believe im contemplating this.
Roslin We both know the cylons are experts at manipulation. They will do anything to confuse you.
Adama This is not the one who shot me.
Roslin Can they really be that different from one another? Commander, if youre asking me if its possible that your judgments been clouded by your history with this particular cylon model, well, Id have to say yes. But... we created them. Theres always a chance we might find common ground.
Boomer We need to work quickly. Were on borrowed time.
Adama Let her go.
Boomer Dee, do you still carry your fathers pocket knife?
Adama Give it to her.
Boomer Mr. Gaeta, can you set me up with a fiber-optic com link? I need broadcast to all frequencies and direct link to the  mainframe.
Adama Do it.
Gaeta Sir.
Adama Right here, Sharon.
Boomer Thanks.
Gaeta Dradis. Here they come. Multiple targets. Bearing 371 carom 552. Cylon raiders.
Tigh Bastards tracked us, all right.
Adama Launch vipers.
Hotdog Hotdog: Apollo, the raiders are holding.
Apollo Galactica, Apollo. Raiders are holding formation. Repeat, raiders are holding formation.
Tigh What the hell.
Boomer Okay, this is how its going to work. The raiders are going to send a signal to activate the virus. It could take a few seconds. on my mark, initiate the computer wipe. Miss the window...
Gaeta The virus takes over every system in the ship.
Boomer Yeah. Sometimes you gotta roll the hard six. Right, commander?
Tigh What the hell is she doing?
Dualla Theyve made contact, sir.
Gaeta Its moving too fast; I cant follow it.
Tigh We gotta stop this.
Adama Stand by to execute computer wipe on my command.
Gaeta Systems ready, sir.
Boomer Wipe the hard drives now.
Adama Do it.
Starbuck My gods what are they doing?
Tigh Weapons are still offline. No dradis. Systems down. Were looking at a godsdamned bloodbath. Were defenseless.
Hotdog Apollo, Hotdog. Here they come!
Apollo All right, copy, Hotdog.
Duck Gods, there must be hundreds of them.
Tigh Cylons are still moving in. She set us up!
Adama Give me your sidearm.
Marine Sir.
Adama If theyre coming for you, theyre gonna be very disappointed.
Tigh Do it. What are you waiting for?
Boomer This.
Tigh What the hell?
Gaeta We just transmitted a signal.
Apollo Uh, Galactica? They--they seem to have lost power. Theyre drifting out of control!
Tigh What the hell?
Adama Cylons sent a computer virus. But we just sent one back.
Tigh Apollo, this is Galactica. Kill the bastards.
Duck Yeah! Come on, baby.
Apollo Roger that. Vipers, weapons free. Engage.  This--this is payback.
Duck Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Hotdog Whoo!
Duck Yeah! How do you like that? You seeing this? Got this toaster padlocked. Come on! I got another where that one came from!
Starbuck Guys, clean em up! Come on; lets go.
Adama Officers.
Marine Yes sir.
Adama Take this thing back to its cell.
Cally There you go, chief.
Starbuck We are so damn close. There has got to be some extra metal lying around that we can use to skin this thing. Floorboards, extra bulkheads, something.
Tyrol Most of its ticketed for viper repair.
Helo Who says you need metal?
Apollo Carbon composite.
Starbuck Good call, Helo.
Apollo Its going to be hard as hell to see on dradis, but the question is, will it fly?
Starbuck Just watch me.
Starbuck Instruments... in the green. Fuel pressure... nominal.
Dualla Apollo, Starbuck. Blackbird flight is cleared for launch.
Starbuck Run-up.
Kelly Maglock secure, initiate launch sequence.
Starbuck Oh, dont blow up on me, you bastard.
Kelly You are clear for launch.
Dualla Blackbird is away.
Apollo Hey! Hey. Will you take it easy? Start slow. Youre testing the ship. Its not about the pilot showing off.
Starbuck Im not showing off.
Apollo Gods damn it, what is this? What are you trying to prove?
Starbuck Im not trying to prove anything. Youve got to be kidding me. Whoo! Oh, lords. Okay. Lets see what this baby can do. Yaa-ha-ha-ha!
Apollo Starbuck, where are you? Starbuck, do you hear me? Starbuck! Shes gone. Galactica, Apollo, Ive lost her. Ive lost her.
Dualla No dradis contact.
Apollo Starbuck, Starbuck, where are you? Starbuck, come in. Starbuck, do you read? Kara, are you okay?
Starbuck Of course you lost contact. Its a damned stealth ship, remember?
Apollo Oh, you--
Figurski Commander on deck.
Adama As you were.
Roslin Chief Tyrol? This is the blackbird?
Tyrol Yes, maam. Madam President, this is an honor.
Roslin No, the honors mine. Its remarkable.
Tyrol Just a ship, maam.
Roslin Oh, youre much too modest. After what weve been through, it would be very easy to give up, to lose hope. But not here. Not today. This is more than a ship, Chief. This is an act of faith. It is proof that despite all weve lost, we keep trying. And we will get through this, all of us, together. I promise.
Tyrol Commander.
Tyrol Uh, Madam President. This was supposed to be a surprise, but, well--
Roslin Thank you.
Adama If youll do us the honors, Madam President.
Roslin Of Course, Oh. Okay.
Tyrol Whoa!
Roslin Kidding.
Racetrack Hell of an idea, using carbon composites.
Duck It was a good job.
Hotdog Nice work.
Roslin That was lovely.
Adama They wanted to do that for you.
Roslin Thank you. None of this would have been possible if you hadnt trusted the cylon.
Adama I took your advice, met on common ground.
Roslin What was that?
Adama We both wanted to live.
