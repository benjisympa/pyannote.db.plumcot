chief_galen_tyrol Viper 289, how are we feeling today?
chief_galen_tyrol Oh, great.
captain_karl_agathon Hey I thought Id find you here.Hey, Karl Agathon.
captain_kara_thrace You want to sit in?
captain_karl_agathon Maybe next time.
tucker_clellan So hes the cylon lover.
captain_kara_thrace You know what? I dont care who or what he fraks. He saved my ass down there, all right?
tucker_clellan How could anyone fall in love with a toaster, though?
captain_kara_thrace Same way I hear everyone was high-fiving our Sharon right before she put two in Adamas chest. The bastards frak with your head.
lt_brendan_constanza Yeah. Just ask the chief.
chief_galen_tyrol I knew it.
chief_galen_tyrol I need a drink.
ensign_diana_seelix Tan, rested, ready. Look at you.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Rested, anyway. Nothing to do but eat and sleep in the can. Hey.
jammer Unauthorized discharge of a firearm? What a bogus charge.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson I know.
specialist_3rd_class_anthony_figurski They should have given you a medal for popping that toaster. Hey, chief.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Chief. I heard that you went to bat for me.
chief_galen_tyrol Forget it.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson I want you to know--
chief_galen_tyrol Forget it. I need all the knuckledraggers I can get.
chief_galen_tyrol Sharon flew 47 missions in this thing. Still couldnt trap a landing worth a damn. Had to bend the undercarriage back into place after every landing.
captain_karl_agathon Approaches made her nervous. She was afraid youd be watching.
chief_galen_tyrol I usually was.
racetrack Screw it.
captain_kara_thrace Youre folding with three up? Are you crazy?
racetrack Not when youve got me beat. Prince high red, right? Been playing with these cards for so long, I know every fold.
captain_kara_thrace So lifes a bitch. What do you want to do, cry about it?
racetrack No, I just want it to end, okay? The bad food, the endless rotations, pretending that a card game is the high point of our day.
captain_kara_thrace Its not going to last forever, all right? Earth is out there.
racetrack Right. We could all be chasing our tails over some half-assed planetarium show.
captain_kara_thrace And you guys can all go to hell. Im going to go find Helo.
racetrack Good idea. Maybe that cylon whore taught him a few tricks.
captain_karl_agathon Hey! Look, chief. I never intended for sharon and I to-- You know, it just kind of evolved.
chief_galen_tyrol Just a couple lovesick kids, huh?
captain_karl_agathon I know how she felt about you, okay? She loves you.
chief_galen_tyrol Did she fill you in on the rest of the plan? She and I were going to muster out at the end of our service. You know, then we would get married. Maybe we would have children. I guess Im just a big frakkin idiot, though, huh? Probably that goddamn toasters plan all along.
captain_karl_agathon Dont call her that.
chief_galen_tyrol Sucker some moron into giving her a kid. Hey, you know, but you know what? I should probably be grateful to you. Probably be grateful. You know why? Because that freak in her belly could have been mine.
captain_karl_agathon Hey, you okay? Im sorry.
chief_galen_tyrol Son of a--
captain_karl_agathon Thats enough, Chief!
chief_galen_tyrol You dont get to call it.
captain_karl_agathon Enough!
chief_galen_tyrol Come on, you damn toaster lover!
chief_galen_tyrol I dont even know why Im mad at you. My Sharons dead. That thing in the brig, that isnt Sharon.
officer_anastasia_dualla Roger, blue leader. Say fuel state. Ah!
colonel_saul_tigh What the hell is that?
lt_felix_gaeta It was us, sir. But I cant find a source for the transmission. Somethings triggering our com system to broadcast an automatic signal.
colonel_saul_tigh Which the cylons could trace to get a fix on our position.
admiral_william_adama Lets assume that for now. Update and distribute the emergency jump sites just in case they show up again. Dee, get me a--
officer_anastasia_dualla Im okay. Im okay, sir.
admiral_william_adama Stay down. Well get you up to Doc Cottle, make sure everythings okay.
colonel_saul_tigh Mr. Gaeta, find out what happened.
officer_anastasia_dualla Im okay.
admiral_william_adama Mr. Gaeta.
lt_felix_gaeta A power surge energized the board. Systems been twitchy ever since the cylons infiltrated our network.
admiral_william_adama Mr. Gaeta, this is more than a glitch.
colonel_saul_tigh Commanders right. I dont care if you have to go through this program line by line; fix it.
lt_felix_gaeta Excuse me?
colonel_saul_tigh You heard me.
lt_felix_gaeta Sir, Im running every diagnostic weve got. Checking each line of code could take days.
colonel_saul_tigh I am not interested in excuses. Fix it!
lt_felix_gaeta Its not an excuse, sir. Its a frakking fact!
admiral_william_adama Mr. Gaeta.
lt_felix_gaeta Yes, sir.
admiral_william_adama Pull yourself together.
lt_felix_gaeta Im sorry, sir.
colonel_saul_tigh What the hell is his problem?
admiral_william_adama Months on the run, and what do we have to show for it? Casualties. Deteriorating conditions. This crew needs a rest. Its finally hitting them, thats all. Our old lives are gone. The only thing we have to look forward to is this.
cpt_lee_adama Hey, chief, wheres 289? I need her for drills today.
chief_galen_tyrol Ships grounded, sir.
cpt_lee_adama What? For how long?
chief_galen_tyrol Permanently. Were salvaging what we can, but its gone.
cpt_lee_adama Damn it, I need that ship online.
chief_galen_tyrol What can I tell you, captain? Engine mounts are shot. Cockpits seals are cracked. If it was a horse, Id shoot it.
ensign_diana_seelix Got something, chief.
cpt_lee_adama Chief Come on, Work with me here. I need your help.
chief_galen_tyrol What do want me to do, work my crew to death?
cpt_lee_adama No, just do your best. Nobodys expecting any miracles.
chief_galen_tyrol Maybe thats the problem.
chief_galen_tyrol Frak it. Why not?
jammer Whats going on, chief?
chief_galen_tyrol All right, heres the deal. We are going to build a new fighter.
jammer What about the rest of the ships? Im three days backlogged on repairs as is.
chief_galen_tyrol This is strictly an off-duty project. Nobody takes one minute away from regular maintenance and repairs. You got it? You dont think we can do this?
jammer I wouldnt even know how to begin.
specialist_3rd_class_anthony_figurski What else is new?
jammer Oh, screw you. Okay, hes talking about fabricating a frame, avionics, life support. Its frakkin impossible.
chief_galen_tyrol You know what, then? Forget you. I dont need you.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Chief, wait. Its not like that.
chief_galen_tyrol I said forget it. Get back to work. Thats an order.
president_laura_roslin How much time do I have?
dr_cottle Weeks. A month at the outside.
president_laura_roslin Will I be able to work?
dr_cottle Unless the cancer goes to your brain. That happens, you--
captain_kara_thrace Someones a tad aggressive.
cpt_lee_adama Just shut up and shoot.
captain_kara_thrace My gods, between you and Racetrack, its like-- having a conversation is like walking through a minefield.
cpt_lee_adama And youre the last person who should be lecturing me about manners.
captain_kara_thrace From what I hear, youve also been riding Chief Tyrol pretty good.
cpt_lee_adama Press it. I just reminded him that I expect viper maintenance to take precedence over his hobby project.
captain_kara_thrace Nice! Im surprised he didnt take a swing at you.
cpt_lee_adama Come on, Starbuck. You dont actually think that piece of junks gonna actually fly, do you?
captain_kara_thrace 50 cubits says he gets it in the air.
cpt_lee_adama Yeah? And whos gonna fly it? Its not gonna be me.
lt_brendan_constanza Dont look at me.
cpt_lee_adama I wasnt looking at you. What?
captain_kara_thrace Ill fly it. Ill fly it.
cpt_lee_adama You?
captain_kara_thrace Me.
cpt_lee_adama Why?
captain_kara_thrace Because... while everyone else is standing around whining--
cpt_lee_adama Were whining?
captain_kara_thrace The chief is doing something positive.
cpt_lee_adama Im deeply moved. Really? Honestly, I am.
captain_kara_thrace His lips are blue. You look like a blueberry.
cpt_lee_adama Theres no oxygen in here. Theres no oxygen in here. Theres no oxygen.
captain_kara_thrace Im empty.
captain_kara_thrace Nice shot.
lt_felix_gaeta The environmental computer decided that the firing range was overpressurized and started bleeding out air to compensate.
cpt_lee_adama Two more minutes, and wed have been dead.
admiral_william_adama Power fluctuations, equipment failures.
lt_felix_gaeta Sir, I think Ive found whats causing it.
admiral_william_adama What is that?
dr_gaius_baltar Its a cylon logic bomb. A heuristic computer virus. Its capable of learning, evolving, and probably running in parallel with every computer in the ship right now, just waiting to be activated. No doubt left behind when the cylons infiltrated the network Colonel Tigh set up the day you were shot, sir.
admiral_william_adama That was weeks ago. Why now?
lt_felix_gaeta Most likely, sir, it took this long for it to crack our encrypted pass codes. And once that happened, it started testing its ability to control our systems-- electrical, environmental.
admiral_william_adama How do you kill it?
dr_gaius_baltar Well, thats the tricky part. If its a cylon virus, it is extremely difficult to eradicate.
admiral_william_adama Well, I guess im pretty lucky, then, cause I have an expert on board. Tell helo to run this past our prisoner.
chief_galen_tyrol Come on. Come on. Son of a bitch. I got it; go back to work.
specialist_3rd_class_anthony_figurski Its a two-man job, chief. You want this wing up or not?
chief_galen_tyrol On three. one, two, three. Great, great. Hold it there.
officer_anastasia_dualla Sir? Were continuing to experience power spikes and equipment failures across the ship.
admiral_william_adama Thank you.
colonel_saul_tigh Wed better up our alert status and put our damage-control teams on stand-by.
admiral_william_adama Not yet. Have you seen this ship that the chief is building?
colonel_saul_tigh His imaginary fighter? I dont need to see it to know its a waste of time.
admiral_william_adama The deck crew doesnt seem to think so.
colonel_saul_tigh We need to focus on the fleet weve got left, not get bogged down in some pipe dream. We should shut it down.
admiral_william_adama It may come to that. But this project, its giving them something. Im not going to take that away... until I have to.
officer_anastasia_dualla Doc cottle cleared me. Feel like hitting something.
cpt_lee_adama Okay. Dont square up. Dont square up. Rotate. And just drop the knee.
lt_felix_gaeta Attention on Galactica. Power outage reported on deck 12.
cpt_lee_adama Thats nice. Now. If you want to throw them, Ill be you. Head in a lock. Grab the wrist. Secure the arm. And Im just going to drop the knee, rotate 45.
officer_anastasia_dualla Okay.
officer_anastasia_dualla Yeah. Just like we did in basic.
cpt_lee_adama Lets bring a live opponent into the mix.
cpt_lee_adama And strip the knife.
officer_anastasia_dualla Billy hey. How long have you been on board?
billy_keikeya I just arrived.
captain_karl_agathon Do you have actual memories of being with the chief before the cylon attack?
lt_sharon_valerii Yeah. Im sorry. You asked.
captain_karl_agathon Do you still love him?
lt_sharon_valerii Helo. Youre the father of my child. Youre the first in my heart. And nothing is ever going to change that.
captain_karl_agathon All right, we have to get to this. Dr. Baltar said its some sort of cylon logic bomb. Do you see anything?
lt_sharon_valerii Can you flip?
captain_karl_agathon Sharon? Sharon, whats wrong? Sharon!
lt_sharon_valerii I need to talk to Commander Adama. Right now.
captain_karl_agathon Why?
lt_sharon_valerii Its a cylon virus, all right. Its been learning your systems, testing, adapting, finding weak spots.
captain_karl_agathon For what?
lt_sharon_valerii So they can turn Galacticas systems against you. Crash you into other ships, detonate your weapons stores, suffocate the crews.
captain_karl_agathon What about you, the baby?
lt_sharon_valerii Im a liability to them, a mistake. Helo, this logic bomb will run its course in a matter of hours. once it does, the cylons will be on top of us. Theyre gonna kill us all.
lt_sharon_valerii Commander Adama--
admiral_william_adama Whatever it is you have to say, make it quick.
cpt_lee_adama Well, I hate to say it, but youve got the cockpit too far back. Youre gonna run into cg problems when you maneuver.
captain_kara_thrace Were not going for maneuverability, Captain. Were going for speed. Besides, you didnt think this thing would fly anyway.
cpt_lee_adama Well, it sure as hell wont with the cockpit rammed up its a-- Dee?
officer_anastasia_dualla Hey.
cpt_lee_adama What are you doing here?
officer_anastasia_dualla Communications, I think. Chiefs great with the hydraulics, but this com systems a mess.
specialist_3rd_class_anthony_figurski Ten hut.
colonel_saul_tigh Had to see this with my own eyes. Wont be long before we have the whole CIC down here. You working on this class project too, Apollo?
cpt_lee_adama No, sir.
colonel_saul_tigh Its good to see someone has a little sense. Wheres the chief, the tool room?
captain_kara_thrace Ah, getting in some rack time, sir.
colonel_saul_tigh Whats this, chief?
chief_galen_tyrol Im making solvent, sir, to clean machine parts.
colonel_saul_tigh Solvent my ass. I know a still when I smell it. What the hell are you up to?
chief_galen_tyrol I need booze to trade for parts. Im scrounging most of what I can from the fleet, but I need engines. I know I need Commander Adamas permission to cannibalize one of the wrecks.
colonel_saul_tigh Engines or not, we both know that piece of crap out there is never going to fly.
chief_galen_tyrol I gotta try, Colonel.
colonel_saul_tigh Whats the point?
chief_galen_tyrol Because that ship, the work, thats all Ive got left. I dont have that, I--
colonel_saul_tigh I almost forgot. I promised the XO of the Baah Pakal Id help him out.
chief_galen_tyrol Sir?
colonel_saul_tigh Hes got some obsolete DDG-62 engines taking up space on his flight deck. Theyre probably crap, but I told him that I would have a crew in there to haul em out as soon as possible.
chief_galen_tyrol Glad to be of help, sir.
colonel_saul_tigh Good.
admiral_william_adama Madam President, your shuttles ready.
president_laura_roslin Of course. Thank you again for letting me use your quarters.
admiral_william_adama Please.
president_laura_roslin I wanted to return this.
admiral_william_adama This was a gift.
president_laura_roslin Never lend a book, I know. But Ive had it far too long. It belongs in your collection. Im late for a Quorum meeting. Is there a problem?
admiral_william_adama Our computers have been infected by a cylon virus, corrupting systems throughout the entire ship. Ive just been notified that this is a prelude to an all-out attack by the cylons.
president_laura_roslin I assume youve tried to disable it.
admiral_william_adama Mr. Gaeta and the Vice President are handling that right now. Im not hopeful.
president_laura_roslin Commander, Im not sure what I can offer you here besides my moral support.
admiral_william_adama Actually, Madam President, I could use your advice.
colonel_saul_tigh You want to what?
lt_felix_gaeta Completely erase our computer drives, cold restart the entire ships system, then restore them using our prewar backups.
colonel_saul_tigh Leaving us with our pants down until were back online. The commander will never go for this.
lt_felix_gaeta Ive already spoken to him, sir.
colonel_saul_tigh What did he say?
lt_felix_gaeta Hes considering it.
dr_gaius_baltar Its the only way to destroy the virus.
colonel_saul_tigh I thought the commander told you to stay out of this.
dr_gaius_baltar Im sorry; do you want to survive this one or not, Colonel?
colonel_saul_tigh All right, so we calculate a jump and get some distance on these cylon bastards--
lt_felix_gaeta No, sir, we cant risk a jump. All of our systems are compromised, including navigation. The virus could drop us in the middle of a sun.
dr_gaius_baltar Were running out of time; our signals going to catch up with the cylon fleet. If have not come up with anything before then--
lt_felix_gaeta Theyll take control of all of our systems, and then theyll have a hundred ways to kill us.
admiral_william_adama Ive just come from seeing our cylon prisoner. Shes offering a possible solution to the problem.
president_laura_roslin And youre wondering if you can trust her.
admiral_william_adama It took everything I have not to put my hands around her throat. I cant believe im contemplating this.
president_laura_roslin We both know the cylons are experts at manipulation. They will do anything to confuse you.
admiral_william_adama This is not the one who shot me.
president_laura_roslin Can they really be that different from one another? Commander, if youre asking me if its possible that your judgments been clouded by your history with this particular cylon model, well, Id have to say yes. But... we created them. Theres always a chance we might find common ground.
lt_sharon_valerii We need to work quickly. Were on borrowed time.
admiral_william_adama Let her go.
lt_sharon_valerii Dee, do you still carry your fathers pocket knife?
admiral_william_adama Give it to her.
lt_sharon_valerii Mr. Gaeta, can you set me up with a fiber-optic com link? I need broadcast to all frequencies and direct link to the mainframe.
admiral_william_adama Do it.
lt_felix_gaeta Sir.
admiral_william_adama Right here, Sharon.
lt_sharon_valerii Thanks.
lt_felix_gaeta Dradis. Here they come. Multiple targets. Bearing 371 carom 552. Cylon raiders.
colonel_saul_tigh Bastards tracked us, all right.
admiral_william_adama Launch vipers.
lt_brendan_constanza Hotdog: Apollo, the raiders are holding.
cpt_lee_adama Galactica, Apollo. Raiders are holding formation. Repeat, raiders are holding formation.
colonel_saul_tigh What the hell.
lt_sharon_valerii Okay, this is how its going to work. The raiders are going to send a signal to activate the virus. It could take a few seconds. on my mark, initiate the computer wipe. Miss the window...
lt_felix_gaeta The virus takes over every system in the ship.
lt_sharon_valerii Yeah. Sometimes you gotta roll the hard six. Right, commander?
colonel_saul_tigh What the hell is she doing?
officer_anastasia_dualla Theyve made contact, sir.
lt_felix_gaeta Its moving too fast; I cant follow it.
colonel_saul_tigh We gotta stop this.
admiral_william_adama Stand by to execute computer wipe on my command.
lt_felix_gaeta Systems ready, sir.
lt_sharon_valerii Wipe the hard drives now.
admiral_william_adama Do it.
captain_kara_thrace My gods what are they doing?
colonel_saul_tigh Weapons are still offline. No dradis. Systems down. Were looking at a godsdamned bloodbath. Were defenseless.
lt_brendan_constanza Apollo, Hotdog. Here they come!
cpt_lee_adama All right, copy, Hotdog.
tucker_clellan Gods, there must be hundreds of them.
colonel_saul_tigh Cylons are still moving in. She set us up!
admiral_william_adama Give me your sidearm.
Marine#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode09 Sir.
admiral_william_adama If theyre coming for you, theyre gonna be very disappointed.
colonel_saul_tigh Do it. What are you waiting for?
lt_sharon_valerii This.
colonel_saul_tigh What the hell?
lt_felix_gaeta We just transmitted a signal.
cpt_lee_adama Uh, Galactica? They--they seem to have lost power. Theyre drifting out of control!
colonel_saul_tigh What the hell?
admiral_william_adama Cylons sent a computer virus. But we just sent one back.
colonel_saul_tigh Apollo, this is Galactica. Kill the bastards.
tucker_clellan Yeah! Come on, baby.
cpt_lee_adama Roger that. Vipers, weapons free. Engage. This--this is payback.
tucker_clellan Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
lt_brendan_constanza Whoo!
tucker_clellan Yeah! How do you like that? You seeing this? Got this toaster padlocked. Come on! I got another where that one came from!
captain_kara_thrace Guys, clean em up! Come on; lets go.
admiral_william_adama Officers.
Marine#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode09 Yes sir.
admiral_william_adama Take this thing back to its cell.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson There you go, chief.
captain_kara_thrace We are so damn close. There has got to be some extra metal lying around that we can use to skin this thing. Floorboards, extra bulkheads, something.
chief_galen_tyrol Most of its ticketed for viper repair.
captain_karl_agathon Who says you need metal?
cpt_lee_adama Carbon composite.
captain_kara_thrace Good call, Helo.
cpt_lee_adama Its going to be hard as hell to see on dradis, but the question is, will it fly?
captain_kara_thrace Just watch me.
captain_kara_thrace Instruments... in the green. Fuel pressure... nominal.
officer_anastasia_dualla Apollo, Starbuck. Blackbird flight is cleared for launch.
captain_kara_thrace Run-up.
Kelly#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode09 Maglock secure, initiate launch sequence.
captain_kara_thrace Oh, dont blow up on me, you bastard.
Kelly#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode09 You are clear for launch.
officer_anastasia_dualla Blackbird is away.
cpt_lee_adama Hey! Hey. Will you take it easy? Start slow. Youre testing the ship. Its not about the pilot showing off.
captain_kara_thrace Im not showing off.
cpt_lee_adama Gods damn it, what is this? What are you trying to prove?
captain_kara_thrace Im not trying to prove anything. Youve got to be kidding me. Whoo! Oh, lords. Okay. Lets see what this baby can do. Yaa-ha-ha-ha!
cpt_lee_adama Starbuck, where are you? Starbuck, do you hear me? Starbuck! Shes gone. Galactica, Apollo, Ive lost her. Ive lost her.
officer_anastasia_dualla No dradis contact.
cpt_lee_adama Starbuck, Starbuck, where are you? Starbuck, come in. Starbuck, do you read? Kara, are you okay?
captain_kara_thrace Of course you lost contact. Its a damned stealth ship, remember?
cpt_lee_adama Oh, you--
specialist_3rd_class_anthony_figurski Commander on deck.
admiral_william_adama As you were.
president_laura_roslin Chief Tyrol? This is the blackbird?
chief_galen_tyrol Yes, maam. Madam President, this is an honor.
president_laura_roslin No, the honors mine. Its remarkable.
chief_galen_tyrol Just a ship, maam.
president_laura_roslin Oh, youre much too modest. After what weve been through, it would be very easy to give up, to lose hope. But not here. Not today. This is more than a ship, Chief. This is an act of faith. It is proof that despite all weve lost, we keep trying. And we will get through this, all of us, together. I promise.
chief_galen_tyrol Commander.
chief_galen_tyrol Uh, Madam President. This was supposed to be a surprise, but, well--
president_laura_roslin Thank you.
admiral_william_adama If youll do us the honors, Madam President.
president_laura_roslin Of Course, Oh. Okay.
chief_galen_tyrol Whoa!
president_laura_roslin Kidding.
racetrack Hell of an idea, using carbon composites.
tucker_clellan It was a good job.
lt_brendan_constanza Nice work.
president_laura_roslin That was lovely.
admiral_william_adama They wanted to do that for you.
president_laura_roslin Thank you. None of this would have been possible if you hadnt trusted the cylon.
admiral_william_adama I took your advice, met on common ground.
president_laura_roslin What was that?
admiral_william_adama We both wanted to live.
