Gaeta Action stations, action stations. Set condition one throughout the ship. This is not a drill. Repeat: Action stations,action stations.
Adama Well, Madam President, looks like you picked a hell of a day for a visit. This is the Commander. Sitrep.
Tigh Bogey just jumped into dradis range cbdr. From the size of it, its probably a cylon bases Caps on its way to intercept it.
Adama Alert the fleet to an emergency jump. Im on my way with the President.
Apollo Galactica, Apollo, Im out on course to the base star, Kat alongside me. I estimate one minute till intercept.
Dualla Roger that, Apollo. Be advised, alert fighters have launched and will take station on your six in three minute
Adama Sitrep.
Tigh Alert fighters have launched.
Gaeta New dradis contact, theyre launching raiders.
Roslin How long till we jump?
Tigh Another two minutes.
Gaeta Sir...sir, Im getting Colonial transponders.
Roslin Colonial?
Tigh Hell, now theyre using our own signals against us.
Adama Maybe. Weapons hold. Hold the jump too.
Roslin Something up your sleeve, I take it?
Adama Well see.
Dualla All ships, Galactica, hold jump. Say again, hold jump.
Adama Ship to ship, Colonial priority one channel. Send hostile challenge and then put your reply up on the speakers.
Dualla Attention, unknown vessel: This is the Battlestar Galactica. Identify yourself, or we will fire upon you.
Gaeta Range now 1,700, sir.
Fisk This is the battleship Pegasus to the ship claiming to be Galactica. Please respond.
Tigh Pegasus, how could that be? The entire fleet was destroyed.
Adama Give me direct contact. Pegasus, this is Galactica actual. Authenticate identity with recognition codes immediate
Dualla Sir, Im receiving Colonial recognition codes. Theyre authentic.
Cain Galactica, this is Pegasus actual. Adama, is that you?
Adama Admiral Cain. What a pleasure to hear your voice.
Cain Disengage.
Fisk Red team, disengage. Red team, disengage.
Cain Commander, I dont know what to say. This is a miracle.
Adama You took the words right out of my mouth. Step down to condition one throughout the fleet.
Apollo Galactica, Apollo, you are not going to believe what Im looking at out her Its like a dream.
Adama It is a dream.
Kelly Pegasus Raptor 861, Galactica. Skids down, mag secure. Welcome aboard, Admiral.
Tigh Get into ranks, people! Look sharp. This isnt recess.
Apollo Come on, the landing partys here. Dress and cover. Nice of you to show up.
Starbuck Couldnt get here too early.
Tigh Group! Attention!
Adama Admiral Cain, welcome aboard the Galactica.
Cain Commander Adama, its an honor.
Adama Allow me to present to you the President of the Colonies Laura Roslin.
Roslin Its a long story. Welcome.
Cain Madam President. Pleasure. on behalf of the officers and the crew of the Pegasus its a pleasure to see all of you. Welcome back to the Colonial fleet.
Taylor Captain Taylor
Starbuck Kara Thrace
Taylor Captain Taylor
Roslin Admiral, Im fairly burning with questions. I hope you dont mind if I just dive in.
Cain Please.
Roslin How did you find us?
Cain Well, we were tracking a cylon fleet. We were trying to predict their movements, which seemed rather random, initially, until we realized that they just jumping to systems with natural resources. So we began to scout those systems ourselves, hoping to carry out hit-and attacks on their fleet. But instead of finding the cylons, we found you.
Adama So youve been attacking their fleet?
Cain Well, you know what they say about the best defense.
Adama Hmm.
Roslin How did you avoid the initial cylon attack on the Colonies?
Cain Ill have another, if you dont mind.
Fisk Galacticas finest.
Tigh Ahh.
Fisk That beats the hell out of the nickel tour. Thank you.
Tigh I figure if youve seen one old Battlestar, youve seen them all.
Fisk Yeah, well, shes an old one. I cant believe the cylons didnt kick your ass up one side and down the other in this bucket. Sorry.
Tigh And just for that, you have to skip this round
Cain We were docking at Scorpion Fleet Shipyard. We were getting ready to go for a three-month overhaul. Most of the crew was getting ready for extended shore leave and family reunions. XO had the deck. I was down in my quarters, wrapping up some  paperwork, and getting ready to pack up and go home to Tauron. And thats when the cylons attacked. They hit the shipyard with three, maybe four nukes. Five ships, two of them Battlestars, they were destroyed right there. And by the time I got back to CIC, I discovered that Id lost over 700 men
Roslin My gods.
Cain We were completely defenseless. So I ordered a jump.
Roslin To where?
Cain Wherever. Nowhere. Just jump.
Adama Blind jump. You couldve ended up anywhere. Gutsy call.
Cain Desperate move. Didnt see any other choice. Im sure you have quite a story to tell yourself But I wont make you go through it right this very minute. You can send over your logs when you get the chance.
Adama Yes, sir.
Cain Something wrong?
Roslin No. I sometimes forget about the rules of military protocol.
Adama Admiral Cain is my superior officer. She will take complete command of the entire fleet.
Cain I was wondering how to broach that topic. Trust me when I say that while the chain of command is strict it is not heartless, and neither am I. This is your ship, and I have no desire to interfere with Galacticas internal affairs.
Adama I appreciate it, Admiral.
Cain Madam President, you look like I just shot your dog.
Roslin No, its just-- its just the Commander and weve been through a lot.
Billy Excuse me. Madam President?
Roslin Yes. If you both will excuse me. Admiral, I cant tell you how grateful we are to have you here. Thank you for finding us.
Cain Madam President. Roslin leaves. The secretary of education?
Adama Shes come a long way.
Cain Im sure.
Tigh Tell me about Admiral Cain.
Fisk Officers discretion?
Tigh Of course.
Fisk We were going after what we thought was a little Cylon Comm Relay. Easy target, right? Turns out it wasnt a comm relay at  all. It was a staging area full of 15 squadrons of raiders.
Tigh Whoa.
Fisk Admiral Cain ordered our XO to attack. Those two were real close. He had served with her for years. But heres the thing-- he refused the order.
Adama Admiral Cain We have a cylon prisoner aboard this ship.
Cain Really? We have one on ours as well.
Adama Ours has proven to be an excellent source of intelligence. Shes been very cooperative Vice President, Dr. Baltar, has been working with her.
Tigh Whatd she do?
Fisk She asked for his gun, shot him in the head with it in front of the whole crew. And then she turned to me.
Tigh What did you do?
Fisk Well, I ordered the frakkin attack. What do you think I did? No, no, Im just joking. Im just kidding, you know.
Cain It gives me no pleasure to have to take command, Bill. I want you to know that.
Adama Dont give it a moments thought, Admiral
Starbuck Is this a scorecard? You guys put scorecards on the side of your ships?
Racetrack Like you dont keep score.
Starbuck You dont see me painting them on the side like Im bragging to the whole frakking universe.
Whiplash Hey, thats 48 kills right there.
Starbuck Special. Do you have caps and t-shirts too?
Helo laughs very loudly
Taylor Wheres the Galactica cag?
Apollo Right here.
Taylor Lets hear the run-down on squadron of yours, Captain. I see you dont keep track of your kills. You should start-- encourages morale, gets competition going, esprit de corps.
Apollo Well, thats one philosophy.
Taylor Its Admiral Cains philosophy. That means its your philosophy now, Captain.
Apollo The name of my Commander is Adama, which should be pretty easy to remember, because its my name.
Taylor Yeah, Ill keep that in mind daddys boy. Lets see your ordnance lists.
Baltar They made me head of the cylon project. My main focus is cylon detection.
Cain We have our own cylon prisoner. Id like you to examine it as soon as possible. See if you can glean anything from it.
#6 I wonder who the cylon will turn out to be-- stranger, familiar face, trusted friend who suddenly turns out to be the enemy?
Cain Did you hear what I just said?
Baltar Yes, yes, and Id be really-- Id be very happy to examine the prisoner. Commander.
Cain Admiral.
Baltar Admiral, I am so sorry.
Laird That is one ugly baby.
Tyrol Excuse me?
Laird Do you mind if I take a look around? Im Laird, Pegasus deck chief.
Tyrol Oh, hey yeah. Tyrol. Thanks for sending over these parts. Yeah, look at whatever you like.
Laird DDG-62s. Ill be. I designed these engines. I thought they phased them over ten years ago.
Tyrol Youre an aeronautical engineer?
Laird Yeah, I was. Then the war happened, and I got drafted into being deck chief on Pegasus.
Cally So youre really a civilian? Howd that happen?
Laird I was on the Scylla, and we got picked up by the Pegasus. Things happened. Mind if I crawl around inside here? I heard you designed this yourself. Id love to see how you did it.
Tyrol Yeah, go ahead.
Adama Pegasus has been resupplying Galactica from its own reserve, for military operations.
Roslin Which I completely support, but when will some of these supplies start getting out to the fleet?
Adama Well, Admiral Cain has assured me that those supplies are on their way.
Roslin Well, at least shes taking your phone calls. I cant even get her to answer mine.
Adama Ill bring it to her attention.
Roslin How are you doing with all this.
Adama She outranks me. Its as simple as that.
Roslin You know, if President Adar stepped off that raptor, Id be elated, grateful to have someone take over. And yet...
Adama I dont go to the, and yet, part. Ive been taking orders my entire career. This is no different.
Roslin Well, then, Commander, thank you. We would appreciate all the you can give us.
Adama You shall receive it.
Adama Sounds like you were both drunk.
Tigh No question. But he wasnt lying; I can tell you that right now.
Adama Well, I hope you wont jump to conclusions. Wait for all the facts. Context matters.
Tigh Context?
Adama That woman shot an officer right in front of the crew. We shot down an entire civilian transport with over a thousand people on board. Says so right there.
Tigh That was completely different. And we dont know there were people on that ship.
Adama Which is why I hope the Admiral reads the complete log and understands the context.
Tigh We should ask Admiral Cain for her logs, just so we can put her in context.
Adama Wouldnt that be nice?
Thorne Dont get too close. It killed seven of my crew. Do you want my guards to come in with you?
#6 Feeling scared, Gaius? Want the big, bad soldiers to protect you from the mean old cylon prisoner?
Baltar No, I think well be just fine. Thank you.
#6 Oh, my god. My god, Gaius, its me. Look at what theyve done to her.
Baltar Open the door, now, please.
Computer ID confirmed. Lieutenant Thorne.
Baltar She must have struggled. She must have fought back.
#6 That doesnt justify this.
Baltar Stop it. Hello? Hello, can you hear me? Shes obviously been abused tortured.
#6 Yes.
Baltar But theres no obvious sign of head trauma. Voluntary eye movement suggests conscious thought.
#6 Cant you stop being a scientist for one moment and look at the abused woman lying there in front of you.
Baltar Now, listen, I know this must be very difficult for you.
#6 Dont patronize me.
Baltar Im not patronizing you. Im trying to reason with you. If Im going to help her, I have to understand her first.
#6 Will you help her, Gaius?
Baltar I will do everything I can. After all, she is remarkably similar to someone I care about a great deal. I think it would be  best if you left us alone for a time.
Baltar It suffered no serious head injuries and therefore no physical damage to its neural pathways or cognitive reasoning centers. But its quite clearly traumatized, which would suggest that its current condition is psychological in nature. Had you thought of that? No. It shows that the cylon consciousness is just as susceptible to the same pressures and cleavages as the human psyche, it can be manipulated in the same fashion. Simply put, Admiral, you have already used the stick. Its time to use a carrot.
Cain Please give the Doctor whatever he needs.
Fisk Aye, sir.
Cain Commander, having read your logs, it appears that you have been through quite an ordeal.
Adama Weve had our moments.
Cain Well, you did yourselves proud.
Adama Thank you, Admiral.
Cain As I told you, we were tracking a cylon fleet when we found Galactica. And now that Ive had a chance to compare their route to your ships its quite clear that they been following you. Well, our recon so far tells us the fleet is composed of two base ships, about a dozen or so support ships and one large vessel that we are still unable to identify.
Cain Its this large ship here that Im interested in. Whats its function? Is it a command and control ship?
Adama A raider factory?
Cain Possibly. Whatever it is, the cylons are protecting it.
Adama Thats what Id call a tempting target.
Cain Hmm. And here I was getting read to do a whole song and dance about combining resources for a joint strike mission.
Adama Any chance of hitting the cylon where it hurts... My pleasure. Ill have Apollo coordinate with your CAG.
Cain Which leads me to the next subject, commander. Im going to integrate the crews. And Im starting by reassigning Captain Adama to the Pegasus air wing.
Adama I have a team that works very well together.
Cain Lets just cut through it, shall we? After reviewing your logs, it is my judgment that having your son as Galactica CAG has been a grave mistake. Hes been insubordinate, even mutinous, and these are direct quotes from your logs, by the way. And I dare say hes not the only one with disciplinary problems. Theres a Kara Thrace who habitually strikes fellow officers and disobeys orders. This Lieutenant Agathon has fraternized with and evidently impregnated an enemy agent. Lets not even discuss your XO. So... there is a complete list of the transfers.
Adama I thought you said you had no desire to interfere with my command.
Cain Im saving your command, Bill. Youre way too close to these officers, and its blinding you to their weaknesses and to the damage that theyre doing to unit cohesion and to morale.
Adama I dont agree.
Cain Well, that is certainly your right. You have your orders.
Apollo Transfer to Pegasus?
Starbuck Why the frak should we do that?
Adama Because those are your orders.
Apollo We cant just let her come over here and frak up our entire roster on the eve of a major Cylon operation.--
Starbuck Thats a load of crap! Shes just trying to frak with the G, because their CAG has a stick up his ass.
Adama Thats enough! Youre officers. Act like it. Shes given you an order. You will carry it out.
Starbuck Permission to speak freely?
Adama You may not. Weve all gotten used to bending the rules, having our way, letting things slide. Well, thats over. You wear the uniform; you will accept the rules that go with it. Youve been transferred. Pack your gear and report to the Pegasus CAG. Dismissed.
Taylor This is a photo recon mission. We are interested in one cylon ship in particular which is larger than anything weve encountered before. Analysis to date suggests they will be in this star system next. We will hide behind this moon which has an abnormally large magnetotail and will mask our dradis signatures. Well power down, hide near the surface, wait for the  fleet to pass by. Starbuck? You have something to add?
Starbuck Your plan sucks. And the cylons arent stupid. That moons a blind spot. Theyll never go near it. You really want to get close? You got to use the stealth we constructed aboard Galactica.
Whiplash The homemade tin can?
Taylor Thats enough. Starbuck, youre off this mission. Whiplash, Thumper get your optical gear ready. Apollo, youll pilot the Raptor with me. Your jacket says you qualified in one. Remember how to fly it?
Apollo Yes, sir.
Taylor Good. Dismissed.
Starbuck They expect us to take this lying down? Now youre driving a frakking raptor. Its humiliating.
Starbuck Is that a surveillance package?
Apollo Go get the blackbird. Take some pretty pictures of our cylon ship.
Starbuck Copy that.
Vireem Cheers, everybody.
Tyrol Chief, wheres the blackbird.
Laird Oh, Lieutenant Thrace took it out. She said Admiral Cain ordered a performance check What?
Gage Hey, chief, deserve a frakking medal. We havent seen booze for months. This place is a frakking party.
Vireem Oh I heard you guys even got yourselves a cylon. Heard shes a hot one too.
Gage Like to get me some of that cylon stuff, huh? A little of the oh-yeah, oh-yeah.
Tyrol Okay, you know what guys thats enough, guys. Just shut up.
Vireem Ohh, sensitive. You got a soft spot for the little robot girl, do you?
Boomer Who the hell are you?
Gage I got in line twice.
Vireem Oh, I hear that. Remember she was just laying there, like, with that blank look on her face.
Cally Do you mind?
Vireem Ooh, frisky.
Gage That hurts.
Thorne What is the function of this ship?
Boomer I dont know.
Thorne Here, take a closer look. What makes it so important? Why would two basestars be tasked to protect it?
Boomer I dont... I dont know.
Gage Think Thornell give us a chance at this one too?
Vireem Nah, I heard him say hes going to have to break her in a little first.
Tyrol Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, no, not here, not here, not here.
Helo Who the hells this Thorne?
Gage Lieutenant Thorne, sir, cylon interrogator. Rides em hard and keeps em talkin.
Vireem Your little robot girl is in for quite a ride. Yee-ha!
Tyrol No, no, no, no. No. Think about it. We need to go.
Boomer What the frak?
Thorne Hold her.
Boomer No!
Tyrol Move; move; move; move.
Helo Get out of the way!
Tyrol Move; move; move; move.
Helo Get out of the way!
Boomer No!
Tyrol Get off her!
Guard Freeze! Freeze! Freeze! Dont either of you frakking move! Dont move! Dont either of you frakking move! Dont move. Get down. Get down! on your knees, hands behind your head. Now! Hands behind your head. Do it now. Do it!
Guard Hes dead.
Pilot Pegasus, Raptor 923. Weve cleared Galactica and are en route with prisoners and the body of Lieutenant Thorne. Eta to Pegasus, three minutes.
Adama The assault happened here. They should face court-martial on Galactica.
Cain Commander, I am the senior convening authority present and they will be tried on Pegasus.
Adama Theyre my men.
Cain One of my men is dead.
Adama Fine. We both have strong feeling about the case that only underlines the need for an impartial trial.
Cain Oh You mean an independent tribunal? Because according to your logs Commander, you dissolved an independent tribunal when you didnt like the verdict. And if Im not mistaken, Chief Tyrol was on trial there as well.
Adama That was a different time.
Cain Yes, indeed it was. Ill be in touch, Commander Thank you.
Baltar Thank you. Now, get out. The food is yours. Its not a trick. Im not going to take it away at the last second. You know, I...um...Im just going to talk right now. I dont expect you to say anything, back on Caprica, before the attack... and sometimes I forget there a world before the attack.. I knew someone-- a woman, unlike any other woman Id ever known. She was unique-- beautiful, clever, intensely sensual. When she wasnt in my bed, she was in my thoughts. She was a cylon. And she changed my life in a very real, very fundamental way in that I have quite literally never stopped thinking about her, because I love her. To this very day, I love her. And she looks exactly like you. My name is Gaius Baltar, and Im here to help you.
Taylor Check me on these jump coordinates.
Apollo Sorry. Jump coordinates verified.
Taylor You seem a little distracted Captain. Something I should know about?
Apollo Two of my friends just got arrested and charged with treason.
Taylor I suggest you file that under not your problem. We have a recon mission to perform. I need your head in the game.
Apollo Right.
Taylor Pegasus, blue team, jump coordinates set and verified. Ready to FTL. We will jump in ten minutes. on my mark--mark.
Cally Any word on the chief, sir?
Adama Hes going to have to stand trial.
Cally Hes a good man, sir.
Adama I know. Ill do everything--
Gaeta Commander Adama, please call CIC ASAP
Adama This is Adama.
Tigh I just talked to Fisk. Court-partials over.
Adama Over? When did it start?
Tigh I dont know, but theyve been found guilty on all counts. Shes going to execute them for murder and treason.
Adama I want a marine strike team in a raptor in five minutes. Prepare to launch alert fighters. You have work to do.
Cally Sir.
Dualla Pegasus, Galactica, please secure a channel. Commander Adama would like to speak to Admiral Cain. Go ahead, sir.
Adama You told me theyd get a fair trial. What kind of a trial could have possibly had?
Cain I assure you I heard them out. I weighed their statements against those of the guards and I took into consideration their service records and commendations. It was a difficult decision Commander, but I dare say it was a fair one.
Adama They have the right to have their case heard by a jury.
Cain I am a flag officer on detached service during a time of war. Regulations give me broad authority in this matter.
Adama Launch the fighters. You can quote me whatever regulation youd like. Im not not going to let you execute my men.
Cain I highly suggest you reconsider that statement, Commander.
Fisk Admiral, Galactica is launching vipers and a raptor.
Cain Commander, why are you launching vipers.
Adama Please arrange for Chief Tyrol and Lieutenant Agathon to be handed over to my marines as soon as they arrive.
Cain I dont take orders from you.
Adama Call it whatever you like. Im getting my men.
Cain You are making such a mistake.
Adama Im getting my men.
Cain Action stations.
Fisk Admiral, this will spiral out of control fast.
Cain Launch the alert vipers. Adama has taken us over the line. Hes left me with no choice.
