lt_felix_gaeta Action stations, action stations. Set condition one throughout the ship. This is not a drill. Repeat: Action stations,action stations.
admiral_william_adama Well, Madam President, looks like you picked a hell of a day for a visit. This is the Commander. Sitrep.
colonel_saul_tigh Bogey just jumped into dradis range cbdr. From the size of it, its probably a cylon bases Caps on its way to intercept it.
admiral_william_adama Alert the fleet to an emergency jump. Im on my way with the President.
cpt_lee_adama Galactica, Apollo, Im out on course to the base star, Kat alongside me. I estimate one minute till intercept.
officer_anastasia_dualla Roger that, Apollo. Be advised, alert fighters have launched and will take station on your six in three minute
admiral_william_adama Sitrep.
colonel_saul_tigh Alert fighters have launched.
lt_felix_gaeta New dradis contact, theyre launching raiders.
president_laura_roslin How long till we jump?
colonel_saul_tigh Another two minutes.
lt_felix_gaeta Sir...sir, Im getting Colonial transponders.
president_laura_roslin Colonial?
colonel_saul_tigh Hell, now theyre using our own signals against us.
admiral_william_adama Maybe. Weapons hold. Hold the jump too.
president_laura_roslin Something up your sleeve, I take it?
admiral_william_adama Well see.
officer_anastasia_dualla All ships, Galactica, hold jump. Say again, hold jump.
admiral_william_adama Ship to ship, Colonial priority one channel. Send hostile challenge and then put your reply up on the speakers.
officer_anastasia_dualla Attention, unknown vessel: This is the Battlestar Galactica. Identify yourself, or we will fire upon you.
lt_felix_gaeta Range now 1,700, sir.
colonel_jack_fisk This is the battleship Pegasus to the ship claiming to be Galactica. Please respond.
colonel_saul_tigh Pegasus, how could that be? The entire fleet was destroyed.
admiral_william_adama Give me direct contact. Pegasus, this is Galactica actual. Authenticate identity with recognition codes immediate
officer_anastasia_dualla Sir, Im receiving Colonial recognition codes. Theyre authentic.
admiral_helena_cain Galactica, this is Pegasus actual. Adama, is that you?
admiral_william_adama Admiral Cain. What a pleasure to hear your voice.
admiral_helena_cain Disengage.
colonel_jack_fisk Red team, disengage. Red team, disengage.
admiral_helena_cain Commander, I dont know what to say. This is a miracle.
admiral_william_adama You took the words right out of my mouth. Step down to condition one throughout the fleet.
cpt_lee_adama Galactica, Apollo, you are not going to believe what Im looking at out her Its like a dream.
admiral_william_adama It is a dream.
Kelly#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode10 Pegasus Raptor 861, Galactica. Skids down, mag secure. Welcome aboard, Admiral.
colonel_saul_tigh Get into ranks, people! Look sharp. This isnt recess.
cpt_lee_adama Come on, the landing partys here. Dress and cover. Nice of you to show up.
captain_kara_thrace Couldnt get here too early.
colonel_saul_tigh Group! Attention!
admiral_william_adama Admiral Cain, welcome aboard the Galactica.
admiral_helena_cain Commander Adama, its an honor.
admiral_william_adama Allow me to present to you the President of the Colonies Laura Roslin.
president_laura_roslin Its a long story. Welcome.
admiral_helena_cain Madam President. Pleasure. on behalf of the officers and the crew of the Pegasus its a pleasure to see all of you. Welcome back to the Colonial fleet.
captain_cole_taylor Captain Taylor
captain_kara_thrace Kara Thrace
captain_cole_taylor Captain Taylor
president_laura_roslin Admiral, Im fairly burning with questions. I hope you dont mind if I just dive in.
admiral_helena_cain Please.
president_laura_roslin How did you find us?
admiral_helena_cain Well, we were tracking a cylon fleet. We were trying to predict their movements, which seemed rather random, initially, until we realized that they just jumping to systems with natural resources. So we began to scout those systems ourselves, hoping to carry out hit-and attacks on their fleet. But instead of finding the cylons, we found you.
admiral_william_adama So youve been attacking their fleet?
admiral_helena_cain Well, you know what they say about the best defense.
admiral_william_adama Hmm.
president_laura_roslin How did you avoid the initial cylon attack on the Colonies?
admiral_helena_cain Ill have another, if you dont mind.
colonel_jack_fisk Galacticas finest.
colonel_saul_tigh Ahh.
colonel_jack_fisk That beats the hell out of the nickel tour. Thank you.
colonel_saul_tigh I figure if youve seen one old Battlestar, youve seen them all.
colonel_jack_fisk Yeah, well, shes an old one. I cant believe the cylons didnt kick your ass up one side and down the other in this bucket. Sorry.
colonel_saul_tigh And just for that, you have to skip this round
admiral_helena_cain We were docking at Scorpion Fleet Shipyard. We were getting ready to go for a three-month overhaul. Most of the crew was getting ready for extended shore leave and family reunions. XO had the deck. I was down in my quarters, wrapping up some paperwork, and getting ready to pack up and go home to Tauron. And thats when the cylons attacked. They hit the shipyard with three, maybe four nukes. Five ships, two of them Battlestars, they were destroyed right there. And by the time I got back to CIC, I discovered that Id lost over 700 men
president_laura_roslin My gods.
admiral_helena_cain We were completely defenseless. So I ordered a jump.
president_laura_roslin To where?
admiral_helena_cain Wherever. Nowhere. Just jump.
admiral_william_adama Blind jump. You couldve ended up anywhere. Gutsy call.
admiral_helena_cain Desperate move. Didnt see any other choice. Im sure you have quite a story to tell yourself But I wont make you go through it right this very minute. You can send over your logs when you get the chance.
admiral_william_adama Yes, sir.
admiral_helena_cain Something wrong?
president_laura_roslin No. I sometimes forget about the rules of military protocol.
admiral_william_adama Admiral Cain is my superior officer. She will take complete command of the entire fleet.
admiral_helena_cain I was wondering how to broach that topic. Trust me when I say that while the chain of command is strict it is not heartless, and neither am I. This is your ship, and I have no desire to interfere with Galacticas internal affairs.
admiral_william_adama I appreciate it, Admiral.
admiral_helena_cain Madam President, you look like I just shot your dog.
president_laura_roslin No, its just-- its just the Commander and weve been through a lot.
billy_keikeya Excuse me. Madam President?
president_laura_roslin Yes. If you both will excuse me. Admiral, I cant tell you how grateful we are to have you here. Thank you for finding us.
admiral_helena_cain Madam President. Roslin leaves. The secretary of education?
admiral_william_adama Shes come a long way.
admiral_helena_cain Im sure.
colonel_saul_tigh Tell me about Admiral Cain.
colonel_jack_fisk Officers discretion?
colonel_saul_tigh Of course.
colonel_jack_fisk We were going after what we thought was a little Cylon Comm Relay. Easy target, right? Turns out it wasnt a comm relay at all. It was a staging area full of 15 squadrons of raiders.
colonel_saul_tigh Whoa.
colonel_jack_fisk Admiral Cain ordered our XO to attack. Those two were real close. He had served with her for years. But heres the thing-- he refused the order.
admiral_william_adama Admiral Cain We have a cylon prisoner aboard this ship.
admiral_helena_cain Really? We have one on ours as well.
admiral_william_adama Ours has proven to be an excellent source of intelligence. Shes been very cooperative Vice President, Dr. Baltar, has been working with her.
colonel_saul_tigh Whatd she do?
colonel_jack_fisk She asked for his gun, shot him in the head with it in front of the whole crew. And then she turned to me.
colonel_saul_tigh What did you do?
colonel_jack_fisk Well, I ordered the frakkin attack. What do you think I did? No, no, Im just joking. Im just kidding, you know.
admiral_helena_cain It gives me no pleasure to have to take command, Bill. I want you to know that.
admiral_william_adama Dont give it a moments thought, Admiral
captain_kara_thrace Is this a scorecard? You guys put scorecards on the side of your ships?
racetrack Like you dont keep score.
captain_kara_thrace You dont see me painting them on the side like Im bragging to the whole frakking universe.
Whiplash#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode10 Hey, thats 48 kills right there.
captain_kara_thrace Special. Do you have caps and t-shirts too?
captain_karl_agathon laughs very loudly
captain_cole_taylor Wheres the Galactica cag?
cpt_lee_adama Right here.
captain_cole_taylor Lets hear the run-down on squadron of yours, Captain. I see you dont keep track of your kills. You should start-- encourages morale, gets competition going, esprit de corps.
cpt_lee_adama Well, thats one philosophy.
captain_cole_taylor Its Admiral Cains philosophy. That means its your philosophy now, Captain.
cpt_lee_adama The name of my Commander is Adama, which should be pretty easy to remember, because its my name.
captain_cole_taylor Yeah, Ill keep that in mind daddys boy. Lets see your ordnance lists.
dr_gaius_baltar They made me head of the cylon project. My main focus is cylon detection.
admiral_helena_cain We have our own cylon prisoner. Id like you to examine it as soon as possible. See if you can glean anything from it.
number_six I wonder who the cylon will turn out to be-- stranger, familiar face, trusted friend who suddenly turns out to be the enemy?
admiral_helena_cain Did you hear what I just said?
dr_gaius_baltar Yes, yes, and Id be really-- Id be very happy to examine the prisoner. Commander.
admiral_helena_cain Admiral.
dr_gaius_baltar Admiral, I am so sorry.
chief_peter_laird That is one ugly baby.
chief_galen_tyrol Excuse me?
chief_peter_laird Do you mind if I take a look around? Im Laird, Pegasus deck chief.
chief_galen_tyrol Oh, hey yeah. Tyrol. Thanks for sending over these parts. Yeah, look at whatever you like.
chief_peter_laird DDG-62s. Ill be. I designed these engines. I thought they phased them over ten years ago.
chief_galen_tyrol Youre an aeronautical engineer?
chief_peter_laird Yeah, I was. Then the war happened, and I got drafted into being deck chief on Pegasus.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson So youre really a civilian? Howd that happen?
chief_peter_laird I was on the Scylla, and we got picked up by the Pegasus. Things happened. Mind if I crawl around inside here? I heard you designed this yourself. Id love to see how you did it.
chief_galen_tyrol Yeah, go ahead.
admiral_william_adama Pegasus has been resupplying Galactica from its own reserve, for military operations.
president_laura_roslin Which I completely support, but when will some of these supplies start getting out to the fleet?
admiral_william_adama Well, Admiral Cain has assured me that those supplies are on their way.
president_laura_roslin Well, at least shes taking your phone calls. I cant even get her to answer mine.
admiral_william_adama Ill bring it to her attention.
president_laura_roslin How are you doing with all this.
admiral_william_adama She outranks me. Its as simple as that.
president_laura_roslin You know, if President Adar stepped off that raptor, Id be elated, grateful to have someone take over. And yet...
admiral_william_adama I dont go to the, and yet, part. Ive been taking orders my entire career. This is no different.
president_laura_roslin Well, then, Commander, thank you. We would appreciate all the you can give us.
admiral_william_adama You shall receive it.
admiral_william_adama Sounds like you were both drunk.
colonel_saul_tigh No question. But he wasnt lying; I can tell you that right now.
admiral_william_adama Well, I hope you wont jump to conclusions. Wait for all the facts. Context matters.
colonel_saul_tigh Context?
admiral_william_adama That woman shot an officer right in front of the crew. We shot down an entire civilian transport with over a thousand people on board. Says so right there.
colonel_saul_tigh That was completely different. And we dont know there were people on that ship.
admiral_william_adama Which is why I hope the Admiral reads the complete log and understands the context.
colonel_saul_tigh We should ask Admiral Cain for her logs, just so we can put her in context.
admiral_william_adama Wouldnt that be nice?
lt_alastair_thorne Dont get too close. It killed seven of my crew. Do you want my guards to come in with you?
number_six Feeling scared, Gaius? Want the big, bad soldiers to protect you from the mean old cylon prisoner?
dr_gaius_baltar No, I think well be just fine. Thank you.
number_six Oh, my god. My god, Gaius, its me. Look at what theyve done to her.
dr_gaius_baltar Open the door, now, please.
Computer#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode10 ID confirmed. Lieutenant Thorne.
dr_gaius_baltar She must have struggled. She must have fought back.
number_six That doesnt justify this.
dr_gaius_baltar Stop it. Hello? Hello, can you hear me? Shes obviously been abused tortured.
number_six Yes.
dr_gaius_baltar But theres no obvious sign of head trauma. Voluntary eye movement suggests conscious thought.
number_six Cant you stop being a scientist for one moment and look at the abused woman lying there in front of you.
dr_gaius_baltar Now, listen, I know this must be very difficult for you.
number_six Dont patronize me.
dr_gaius_baltar Im not patronizing you. Im trying to reason with you. If Im going to help her, I have to understand her first.
number_six Will you help her, Gaius?
dr_gaius_baltar I will do everything I can. After all, she is remarkably similar to someone I care about a great deal. I think it would be best if you left us alone for a time.
dr_gaius_baltar It suffered no serious head injuries and therefore no physical damage to its neural pathways or cognitive reasoning centers. But its quite clearly traumatized, which would suggest that its current condition is psychological in nature. Had you thought of that? No. It shows that the cylon consciousness is just as susceptible to the same pressures and cleavages as the human psyche, it can be manipulated in the same fashion. Simply put, Admiral, you have already used the stick. Its time to use a carrot.
admiral_helena_cain Please give the Doctor whatever he needs.
colonel_jack_fisk Aye, sir.
admiral_helena_cain Commander, having read your logs, it appears that you have been through quite an ordeal.
admiral_william_adama Weve had our moments.
admiral_helena_cain Well, you did yourselves proud.
admiral_william_adama Thank you, Admiral.
admiral_helena_cain As I told you, we were tracking a cylon fleet when we found Galactica. And now that Ive had a chance to compare their route to your ships its quite clear that they been following you. Well, our recon so far tells us the fleet is composed of two base ships, about a dozen or so support ships and one large vessel that we are still unable to identify.
admiral_helena_cain Its this large ship here that Im interested in. Whats its function? Is it a command and control ship?
admiral_william_adama A raider factory?
admiral_helena_cain Possibly. Whatever it is, the cylons are protecting it.
admiral_william_adama Thats what Id call a tempting target.
admiral_helena_cain Hmm. And here I was getting read to do a whole song and dance about combining resources for a joint strike mission.
admiral_william_adama Any chance of hitting the cylon where it hurts... My pleasure. Ill have Apollo coordinate with your CAG.
admiral_helena_cain Which leads me to the next subject, commander. Im going to integrate the crews. And Im starting by reassigning Captain Adama to the Pegasus air wing.
admiral_william_adama I have a team that works very well together.
admiral_helena_cain Lets just cut through it, shall we? After reviewing your logs, it is my judgment that having your son as Galactica CAG has been a grave mistake. Hes been insubordinate, even mutinous, and these are direct quotes from your logs, by the way. And I dare say hes not the only one with disciplinary problems. Theres a Kara Thrace who habitually strikes fellow officers and disobeys orders. This Lieutenant Agathon has fraternized with and evidently impregnated an enemy agent. Lets not even discuss your XO. So... there is a complete list of the transfers.
admiral_william_adama I thought you said you had no desire to interfere with my command.
admiral_helena_cain Im saving your command, Bill. Youre way too close to these officers, and its blinding you to their weaknesses and to the damage that theyre doing to unit cohesion and to morale.
admiral_william_adama I dont agree.
admiral_helena_cain Well, that is certainly your right. You have your orders.
cpt_lee_adama Transfer to Pegasus?
captain_kara_thrace Why the frak should we do that?
admiral_william_adama Because those are your orders.
cpt_lee_adama We cant just let her come over here and frak up our entire roster on the eve of a major Cylon operation.--
captain_kara_thrace Thats a load of crap! Shes just trying to frak with the G, because their CAG has a stick up his ass.
admiral_william_adama Thats enough! Youre officers. Act like it. Shes given you an order. You will carry it out.
captain_kara_thrace Permission to speak freely?
admiral_william_adama You may not. Weve all gotten used to bending the rules, having our way, letting things slide. Well, thats over. You wear the uniform; you will accept the rules that go with it. Youve been transferred. Pack your gear and report to the Pegasus CAG. Dismissed.
captain_cole_taylor This is a photo recon mission. We are interested in one cylon ship in particular which is larger than anything weve encountered before. Analysis to date suggests they will be in this star system next. We will hide behind this moon which has an abnormally large magnetotail and will mask our dradis signatures. Well power down, hide near the surface, wait for the fleet to pass by. Starbuck? You have something to add?
captain_kara_thrace Your plan sucks. And the cylons arent stupid. That moons a blind spot. Theyll never go near it. You really want to get close? You got to use the stealth we constructed aboard Galactica.
Whiplash#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode10 The homemade tin can?
captain_cole_taylor Thats enough. Starbuck, youre off this mission. Whiplash, Thumper get your optical gear ready. Apollo, youll pilot the Raptor with me. Your jacket says you qualified in one. Remember how to fly it?
cpt_lee_adama Yes, sir.
captain_cole_taylor Good. Dismissed.
captain_kara_thrace They expect us to take this lying down? Now youre driving a frakking raptor. Its humiliating.
captain_kara_thrace Is that a surveillance package?
cpt_lee_adama Go get the blackbird. Take some pretty pictures of our cylon ship.
captain_kara_thrace Copy that.
crewman_specialist_vireem Cheers, everybody.
chief_galen_tyrol Chief, wheres the blackbird.
chief_peter_laird Oh, Lieutenant Thrace took it out. She said Admiral Cain ordered a performance check What?
crewman_specialist_gage Hey, chief, deserve a frakking medal. We havent seen booze for months. This place is a frakking party.
crewman_specialist_vireem Oh I heard you guys even got yourselves a cylon. Heard shes a hot one too.
crewman_specialist_gage Like to get me some of that cylon stuff, huh? A little of the oh-yeah, oh-yeah.
chief_galen_tyrol Okay, you know what guys thats enough, guys. Just shut up.
crewman_specialist_vireem Ohh, sensitive. You got a soft spot for the little robot girl, do you?
lt_sharon_valerii Who the hell are you?
crewman_specialist_gage I got in line twice.
crewman_specialist_vireem Oh, I hear that. Remember she was just laying there, like, with that blank look on her face.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Do you mind?
crewman_specialist_vireem Ooh, frisky.
crewman_specialist_gage That hurts.
lt_alastair_thorne What is the function of this ship?
lt_sharon_valerii I dont know.
lt_alastair_thorne Here, take a closer look. What makes it so important? Why would two basestars be tasked to protect it?
lt_sharon_valerii I dont... I dont know.
crewman_specialist_gage Think Thornell give us a chance at this one too?
crewman_specialist_vireem Nah, I heard him say hes going to have to break her in a little first.
chief_galen_tyrol Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, no, not here, not here, not here.
captain_karl_agathon Who the hells this Thorne?
crewman_specialist_gage Lieutenant Thorne, sir, cylon interrogator. Rides em hard and keeps em talkin.
crewman_specialist_vireem Your little robot girl is in for quite a ride. Yee-ha!
chief_galen_tyrol No, no, no, no. No. Think about it. We need to go.
lt_sharon_valerii What the frak?
lt_alastair_thorne Hold her.
lt_sharon_valerii No!
chief_galen_tyrol Move; move; move; move.
captain_karl_agathon Get out of the way!
chief_galen_tyrol Move; move; move; move.
captain_karl_agathon Get out of the way!
lt_sharon_valerii No!
chief_galen_tyrol Get off her!
Guard#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode10 Freeze! Freeze! Freeze! Dont either of you frakking move! Dont move! Dont either of you frakking move! Dont move. Get down. Get down! on your knees, hands behind your head. Now! Hands behind your head. Do it now. Do it!
Guard#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode10 Hes dead.
Pilot#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode10 Pegasus, Raptor 923. Weve cleared Galactica and are en route with prisoners and the body of Lieutenant Thorne. Eta to Pegasus, three minutes.
admiral_william_adama The assault happened here. They should face court-martial on Galactica.
admiral_helena_cain Commander, I am the senior convening authority present and they will be tried on Pegasus.
admiral_william_adama Theyre my men.
admiral_helena_cain One of my men is dead.
admiral_william_adama Fine. We both have strong feeling about the case that only underlines the need for an impartial trial.
admiral_helena_cain Oh You mean an independent tribunal? Because according to your logs Commander, you dissolved an independent tribunal when you didnt like the verdict. And if Im not mistaken, Chief Tyrol was on trial there as well.
admiral_william_adama That was a different time.
admiral_helena_cain Yes, indeed it was. Ill be in touch, Commander Thank you.
dr_gaius_baltar Thank you. Now, get out. The food is yours. Its not a trick. Im not going to take it away at the last second. You know, I...um...Im just going to talk right now. I dont expect you to say anything, back on Caprica, before the attack... and sometimes I forget there a world before the attack.. I knew someone-- a woman, unlike any other woman Id ever known. She was unique-- beautiful, clever, intensely sensual. When she wasnt in my bed, she was in my thoughts. She was a cylon. And she changed my life in a very real, very fundamental way in that I have quite literally never stopped thinking about her, because I love her. To this very day, I love her. And she looks exactly like you. My name is Gaius Baltar, and Im here to help you.
captain_cole_taylor Check me on these jump coordinates.
cpt_lee_adama Sorry. Jump coordinates verified.
captain_cole_taylor You seem a little distracted Captain. Something I should know about?
cpt_lee_adama Two of my friends just got arrested and charged with treason.
captain_cole_taylor I suggest you file that under not your problem. We have a recon mission to perform. I need your head in the game.
cpt_lee_adama Right.
captain_cole_taylor Pegasus, blue team, jump coordinates set and verified. Ready to FTL. We will jump in ten minutes. on my mark--mark.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Any word on the chief, sir?
admiral_william_adama Hes going to have to stand trial.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Hes a good man, sir.
admiral_william_adama I know. Ill do everything--
lt_felix_gaeta Commander Adama, please call CIC ASAP
admiral_william_adama This is Adama.
colonel_saul_tigh I just talked to Fisk. Court-partials over.
admiral_william_adama Over? When did it start?
colonel_saul_tigh I dont know, but theyve been found guilty on all counts. Shes going to execute them for murder and treason.
admiral_william_adama I want a marine strike team in a raptor in five minutes. Prepare to launch alert fighters. You have work to do.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Sir.
officer_anastasia_dualla Pegasus, Galactica, please secure a channel. Commander Adama would like to speak to Admiral Cain. Go ahead, sir.
admiral_william_adama You told me theyd get a fair trial. What kind of a trial could have possibly had?
admiral_helena_cain I assure you I heard them out. I weighed their statements against those of the guards and I took into consideration their service records and commendations. It was a difficult decision Commander, but I dare say it was a fair one.
admiral_william_adama They have the right to have their case heard by a jury.
admiral_helena_cain I am a flag officer on detached service during a time of war. Regulations give me broad authority in this matter.
admiral_william_adama Launch the fighters. You can quote me whatever regulation youd like. Im not not going to let you execute my men.
admiral_helena_cain I highly suggest you reconsider that statement, Commander.
colonel_jack_fisk Admiral, Galactica is launching vipers and a raptor.
admiral_helena_cain Commander, why are you launching vipers.
admiral_william_adama Please arrange for Chief Tyrol and Lieutenant Agathon to be handed over to my marines as soon as they arrive.
admiral_helena_cain I dont take orders from you.
admiral_william_adama Call it whatever you like. Im getting my men.
admiral_helena_cain You are making such a mistake.
admiral_william_adama Im getting my men.
admiral_helena_cain Action stations.
colonel_jack_fisk Admiral, this will spiral out of control fast.
admiral_helena_cain Launch the alert vipers. Adama has taken us over the line. Hes left me with no choice.
