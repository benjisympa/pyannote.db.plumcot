Kat Galactica, Kat--I got inbound Pegasus vipers coming right at me. Request instructions.
Tigh Youve gotta let them defend themselves. We should turn our main batteries on Pegasus.
Kat Galactica, Kat--request weapons free. We need your help.
Dualla Kat, Galactica--do not fire unless fired upon. I repeat, do not fire unless fired upon.
Kat Galactica, Kat! Theyre really frakking with us out here.
Hot_Dog Galactica, Hot Dog. one of them just pulled into my kill slot.
Freaker Hot Dog, watch your six, hes right behind you.
Hot_Dog Evasive action, come on!
Kat Gods damn frakkers!
Nacho Okay, were going to have to break your course now. Narcho, Pegasus-- do not fire first.
Peg_Petty_Officer Stinger, Pegasus-- you are ordered to relieve captain Adama of duty and aid an attack mission on Galactica.
Stinger Your weapon, captain. Youre relieved.
Apollo Permission to go aft.
Stinger Granted.
Nacho Come on break.
Kat Ahhh! Frak me! Theyre all over us! Galactica, request weapon free. Theyre coming around for another head-on pass. Repeat, request weapons free!
Apollo Come on, starbuck. Tell me youre out there somewhere.
Starbuck What the hell?
Starbuck Starbuck...here, what the hell is going on
Gaeta Dradis contact. Single bogey and its nearly on top of us.
Adama Identify.
Gaeta No transponders, no recognition codes, uh, it has to be a cylon raider, sir.
Fisk Admiral, sir, this has gotta be a raider.
Cain Well, how the frak did it get in so close without being detected?
Peg_Tacttical_Officer I dont know, sir, I assume it came out of nowhere.
Cain Right. Recall the vipers. Bring the ship about. And prepare to engage the
Peg_Petty_Officer All Pegasus vipers, all pegasus vipers, emergency recall. Theres a cylon raider right on top of you.
Dualla Attention all Galactica vipers, youve got a cylon raider comin right at you.
Kat Oh there you are, you bastard on my lead!
Breaker Quick right, full power, x-axis climb!
Starbuck Starbuck to all vipers-- do not fire... repeat, do not fire! I am a friendly, okay? Were all friendlies. So, lets just...be friendly.
Stinger Thats no raider, thats that stealth ship of yours. Whos flying it? It wasnt cleared to launch?
Apollo You got me, Im just a passenger back here.
Kat Galactica, Kat. Its the blackbird, Galactica. Repeat, its the blackbird.
Tigh What the hell is the blackbird doing out there
Gaeta Its starbuck. She launched in the blackbird a couple hours ago. Said she was running flight tests for Admiral Cain.
Adama That doesnt sound likely
Tigh Ahh, another one of her crazy ass stunts. Thank the gods.
Adama You can say that again. Get me Pegasus.
Cain This is Pegasus actual, go ahead.
Adama You can either stand down or we can start shooting at each other. Its your call.
Fisk Admiral.
Cain Wait, one.
Fisk Were receiving a download, Admiral.
Cain That is the cylon fleet. Are these from our recon mission?
Fisk No, sir. The recon mission was aborted. These are from blackbird.
Cain Thrace. She took off and did the whole recon mission alone. My gods, look at these shots, Jack. She put her nose right up their backsides and they never even knew it.
Peg_Petty_Officer Admiral...we still have Commander Adama on the line and our fighters are stil requesting instructions. Should they resume the attack?
Cain All right, joint recall. Both ships stand down to condition two. Then I want you to report to me directly, in person.
Adama I have no intention of coolling my heels in your brig.
Cain Fine. Neutral ground, Colonial one. No aides. Be there in 15 minutes.
Adama Stand down, condition two
Cain There you are.
Rolsin Lets start this by admitting an ugly truth. What happened out there today was the result of failure in leadership of  everyone in this room. We are the leaders of this fleet. As such, we need to set an example. We cannot continue to let the conflicts between--
Cain Oh, lets just cut through the handholding, shall we. Two of his men murdered one of my officers while protecting a cylon. Theyre guilty, they admitted it. And under regulations, I have complete authority to try, convict, and sentence them. And you and I both know that the penalty for that crime is death. Admiral, surely...
Rolsin The spirit of the law requires something here more than summary executions.
Cain Is this what the two of you have been doing for the past six months? Debating the finer points of colonial law? Well, guess what, were at war! And we dont have the luxury of academic debate over these issues.
Rolsin You wanna cut through it, fine. You have Pegasus, he has Galactica. Two heavily armed, very powerful warships. Now, I am sure that Pegasus would prevail in any fight.
Adama I wouldnt count on that.
Rolsin But certainly, thered be heavy damage and youd take significant casualties. So you can go out there a fight it out with Galactica or you can compromise. And those are the only two options on the table, period.
Cain How the two of you have survived this long, I will never know. All right. Lieutenant Thrace has sent me detailed recon information on the cylon fleet. I want that fleet. And I need  Galactica to get it. So Im willing to go this far. Ill suspend the execution until after the attack.
Adama And I want them back on Galactica.
Cain I dont give a damn what you want. You frakking lucky youre staring at your own warrant.
Roslin The destruction of the cylon fleet will take priority over all other considerations. After that, we will meet back here and we will resolve this issue. Thank you.
Cain Stand at ease, lieutenant and come forward. Seems youve had quite a day. Im promoting you to captain Im making you commander of the Pegasus air group.
Starbuck Youre promoting me?
Cain I need a CAG with guts and initiative to plan and lead the attack on this fleet. Now, I thought Stinger was that man. But he managed to let captain Adama contact you and pull off that fly-by right under his nose, so, hes out.
Starbuck And captain Adama, sir?
Cain Truth be told, I came this close to throwing him in the brig. But I couldnt exactly charge him and not you, so I just revoked his flight status.
Starbuck I want him on my team, sir.
Cain And do you always get what you want?
Starbuck Most of the time...sir.
Cain Good.Me, too. All right, you can have him. I hear you want to return to Caprica.
Starbuck Yes, sir. We have people back there still alive.
Cain Yes, and they deserve to be saved. I absolutely agree. In fact, I will go one step further and I will say that our ultimate goal is that we should return to the 12 colonies and kick the cylons the frak out of our homes. What do you think of that, Captain?
Starbuck I think thats the best idea Ive heard all day, sir.
Roslin I afraid this can only end one way. Youve got to kill her.
Adama What the hell are you talking about?
Roslin Like she said, lets cut through it. The two of you were willing to go to war today. Do you think shes going to step down from that? Shes going to bide her time and hit you the first chance she gets. Thats a given. I hate to lay this on you Bill, but she is dangerous and the only thing that you can do is to hit her before she hits you.
Adama Im not an assassin.
Roslin No. Youre not an assassin, you are a colonial officer whos taken an oath to protect this fleet. What do you think that she is going to do with the civilian fleet once she has eliminated you. You know Im right. You just dont want to face it.
Adama So the whole worlds going mad?
Cottle Your fluid and electrolytes levels are stable. But I think the babys going to be fine. You do have a cracked rib though. Hairline fracture, which means its gonna hurt like hell for a while. But, Im not seeing any signs of permanent damage from the attack.
Boomer The attack. Is that what were calling it now?
Adama They were not from the Galactica.
Boomer They were from the Pegasus. So what? What about Helo and the chief? I heard a rumor theyre going to be executed.
Adama Im not going to let that happen.
Boomer Well, how are you going to do that? Isnt Admiral Cain in command?
Adama What happened to you--
Cottle Was unforgivable.
Adama Happened aboard my ship, on my watch. And its my responsibility. So I just want you to know that I personally apologize. See that shes okay, then back into her cell.
Helo Arent we supposed to be dead. Everyone said execution in an hour, its been at least two.
Tyrol Ah, Im not complaining.
Apollo So. Just how many different kinds of stupid are you?
Helo More than we can count.
Tyrol Whats going on, Captain.
Apollo Good news--youre not dead...yet. Bad news-- its a delay, not a pardon. Theres a big op coming up and the firing squads on hold till its over. Yeah, the old man went to mat for you guys on this one, and then some. We were this close to a shooting war with the Pegasus.
Helo Frak me.
Apollo Yeah, now its us.
#6 Whats wrong, Gaius?
Baltar Nothing. Nothing. I suppose I just, uh... lost interest.
#6 In me?
Baltar No, not in you, in... in this. In this place, I... I suppose I just dont really miss it anymore.
#6 You know what I miss? Sports.
Baltar Youre joking.
#6 No. I used to go the pyramid court just before game time. Scalp two tickets. If I timed it right, Id just be sitting down at the horn. Sit back...let the energy of the crowd flow over me Waves and waves of emotion like an electric current.
Baltar Why did you get two tickets?
#6 One for me, and one for you. I know Id never get you Pyramid was far too lowbrow for you, but... I always liked to feel that you were there with me.
Cain Well, I see that you got it to eat. Thats progress, I suppose. Can you get it to roll over...beg? See what it can make of these. You know this thing used to sit in our mess and eat our food, and listen to our stories. Didnt you? You just sat  there... listening to us, pretending to be our friend didnt you?!
Baltar Admiral, please! Any...physical contact with the subject will only to set my efforts back at this point.
Cain Find out about that ship.
Gina I want to die. Will you help me do that? Will you kill me, please?
Laird Hey, Im just still getting up to speed on the way you do things around here. But Im reasonably sure that we can have all our birds in the air for the attack thing, Sure. I mean, um, yes, sir.
Adama Thank you, chief. Cally. Lairds not military, is he?
Cally No, sir. He was a civilian aeronautical engineer on a ship called the Scylla..
Cally Civilian? Do you know how he got on the Pegasus? Scuttlebutt is that the Pegasus used to have a civilian fleet but something happened to them.
Adama Thank you.
Tigh Lairds ship was the Scylla.
Fisk Scylla was, uh... civilian transport. We found her and a few other civvies about a week after the attack. They were good  ships. FTL drives and weapons even. A lot of potential spare parts that we could use on Pegasus.  So...the Admiral made a decision. Military needs are a priority.
Tigh You stripped them. You stripped the ships for parts? Sweet mother of Artemis. How much equipment did you take? You take their jump drives? Left all those people marooned out there?
Fisk No, not all. Admiral Cain looked over the passenger list and she made a decision about who was valuable and who wasnt.  Scylla was the toughest. Laird and 15 other men and women, they were all traveling with their families-- wives, husbands,  children. The selectees... they refused to go. There was resistance. So the order came down to shoot the family of anyone who refused to come. So we did. Two families, we put them up against the bulkhead. And we shot them.
Apollo A cags work is never done.
Starbcuk Hi...how ya doing?
Apollo Oh, you mean apart from being, uh, demoted? Finding myself working for one of my pilots? Great. Never better.
Starbcuk You know I had nothing to do with that, right?
Apollo Never thought you did. I, uh, just checked in on Helo and Tyrol. Theyre hanging tight for now.
Starbcuk Good. Help me plan this op. Ive been staring at this roster. You wanna just carry on? As if nothings happened?
Apollo Lee, shes in command, what do you want to do? Theres nothing we can do.
Baltar I thought you might like a fresh set of clothes.
Baltar Were you aware of your true nature as a cylon when you boarded the ship? Or would you describe you as a sleeper agent?
Gina I knew what I was. I was a soldier. I-I had a mission, I carried it out. I thought that when it was done I was going to die. That you would kill me. Then I-- then I would download into a new body...be reborn. But you didnt kill me. The things you did to me.
Baltar What they did to you was evil. But Im not one of them. You have to believe me. Things are going to get better for you. From this moment on. I promise.
Gina I dont want things to get better. I want to die.
Baltar But you know you cant die. You do know that, dont you? Your consciousnessill merely transfer and youll wake up in another body.
Gina Not if you destroy that.
Baltar What, this-- this ship? Tell me. Whats so important about this ship?
Baltar The cylons call this their resurrection ship. At the moment, we are too far away from the cylon home for the normal downloading process to work, which is why they built this ship. It contains the entire apparatus necessary for cylon resurrection. Now this ship has been traveling with the fleet trailing Galactica for the last several months
Starbuck So its a safety net? A place where they fall back to when they die.
Cain And if they lose their safety net?
Starbuck Then any cylon who dies out here--
Cain Would be dead. As in, really dead. I daresay they wont like that.
Starbuck No, sir. They might even stop chasing us. Why risk getting killed if you cant just wake up all nice and cozy in a brand-new body?
Cain Doctor, I think you just identified the most important ship in the galaxy.
Roslin I have good days and bad But dont look so worried Im not dying today.
Adama Sorry.
Roslin What can I do for you?
Adama You were right about Cain Pegasus had a civilian fleet with her, 15 ships. Cain stripped them. For parts, supplies...people.
Roslin I wish I could say I was surprised, but its who she is. Shes playing for keeps, youve gotta do the same.
Adama Whats gotten into you?
Roslin Mm.
Adama Youve become so bloody-minded.
Roslin I know that as long as Cain lives... your survival is at risk, I know that.
Adama What can I get you?
Roslin A new body. Perhaps, one of those young cylon models from the resurrection ship.
Adama I cant see you as a blonde.
Roslin Youd be surprised.
Adama Well see you tomorrow?
Roslin Mm-hmm. Commander. She wont hesitate to kill you. Dont let her.
Tyrol You know, when we get outta here... Im going to make some changes.
Helo Yeah? Like what?
Tyrol Me and Sharon. Its done. I mean, really done, I cant do it anymore. I mean dont get me wrong. LT, what we did, I would do again... in a heartbeat. But Ive gotta let it go. I so thought I had let go.
Helo Yeah...I know what you mean.
Tyrol You?
Helo Yeah, me. What? You think I dont have second thoughts sometimes You think I dont wonder Im losing my frakkin mind. Im in love a woman I know isnt a woman. Im having a baby thats- thats what? Half machine?
Tyrol You really do love her, dont you?
Helo Yeah. Yes, I do. And I cant let go of it. But if you can... let it go.
Starbuck Our primary objective is a vessel named Resurrection by the cylons. Its guarded by two basestars which have been following us throughout this sector.
Apollo Our plan, simply put, is to let them find us. We will wait in this system here and appear to be conducting mining operations.
Starbuck When the cylons launch the raiders, Galactica and most of the civilians will jump away. A small group of civilians will be left behind.
Apollo To the cylons, theyll appear to be having trouble with their FTL drives and attempting to escape at sub-light speed.
Starbuck The cylon raiders pursue the civilian decoys pulling the raiders farther away from the cylon basestar as they can.
Apollo once the raiders have been drawn off by the decoys, Galactica and Pegasus will jump in and attack the base stars While I jump in, in the blackbird stealth fighter and take out the FTL drives on the resurrection ship, preventing it from jumping away.
Tigh Why not have the stealth ship carry nukes and destroy it right at the start?
Starbuck We ran simulations on that. We determined that the cylons would detect the nuclear warheads and destroy the stealth ship before it got within weapons range. When the FTL is destroyed Galactica and Pegasus will take on the basestars and our attack squadrons will go after the resurrection ship itself.
Tigh How many squadrons?
Starbuck All of em.
Cain Is there a problem, commander?
Adama I need time to study the operational details.
Cain Suit yourself. Ive gone over the details and Im satisfied.
Adama I want your CAG to stay and help me. Answer some of my questions.
Cain One hour, Thrace.
Starbuck Yes, sir.
Adama Stay focused, son.
Cain Jack, I want to transfer a detachment of marines to Galactica. And I want you to handpick them. Completely reliable. Completely loyal. Razors.
Adama I have a mission for you, Kara.
Starbuck Anything for you, you know that.
Adama Dont accept too quickly. You wont like this one. I dont like it. But Ive decided that it has to be done.
Cain Im transferring you to Galactica, as well. Ill tell Adama that youre there to be my eyes and ears. Hell hate it. Hell think youre my spy and try to freeze you out of  decision-making. But hell accept it. Now I want you to stay in throughout the attack. Stay with Adama.
Adama After the attack is completed and youve accounted for your pilots I want you to land your bird on the Pegasus to report directly to CIC. Youll take Lee with you. Hell watch your back.
Cain Position marines in key positions throughout the ship and keep a squad posted just outside CIC.
Adama Therell the normal chaos emotional high after the attack.
Cain Theyll be slapping each other on the back, celebrating the victory.
Adama Theyll keep their guard down.
Cain Security will be lax.
Adama I will ask for you over the wireless.
Cain I will call you directly, and when I have you on the line and you hear me give the command, execute case orange
Adama When you hear me say downfall
Cain You are to signal the marines to terminate Adamas command. Starting with Adama.
Adama I want you to pull out your weapon... and shoot Admiral Cain in the head.
