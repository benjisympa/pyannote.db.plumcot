louanne_katraine Galactica, Kat--I got inbound Pegasus vipers coming right at me. Request instructions.
colonel_saul_tigh Youve gotta let them defend themselves. We should turn our main batteries on Pegasus.
louanne_katraine Galactica, Kat--request weapons free. We need your help.
officer_anastasia_dualla Kat, Galactica--do not fire unless fired upon. I repeat, do not fire unless fired upon.
louanne_katraine Galactica, Kat! Theyre really frakking with us out here.
lt_brendan_constanza Galactica, Hot Dog. one of them just pulled into my kill slot.
lt_mei_firelli Hot Dog, watch your six, hes right behind you.
lt_brendan_constanza Evasive action, come on!
louanne_katraine Gods damn frakkers!
lt_noel_allison Okay, were going to have to break your course now. Narcho, Pegasus-- do not fire first.
Peg_Petty_Officer#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode11 Stinger, Pegasus-- you are ordered to relieve captain Adama of duty and aid an attack mission on Galactica.
captain_cole_taylor Your weapon, captain. Youre relieved.
cpt_lee_adama Permission to go aft.
captain_cole_taylor Granted.
lt_noel_allison Come on break.
louanne_katraine Ahhh! Frak me! Theyre all over us! Galactica, request weapon free. Theyre coming around for another head-on pass. Repeat, request weapons free!
cpt_lee_adama Come on, starbuck. Tell me youre out there somewhere.
captain_kara_thrace What the hell?
captain_kara_thrace Starbuck...here, what the hell is going on
lt_felix_gaeta Dradis contact. Single bogey and its nearly on top of us.
admiral_william_adama Identify.
lt_felix_gaeta No transponders, no recognition codes, uh, it has to be a cylon raider, sir.
colonel_jack_fisk Admiral, sir, this has gotta be a raider.
admiral_helena_cain Well, how the frak did it get in so close without being detected?
Peg_Tacttical_Officer#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode11 I dont know, sir, I assume it came out of nowhere.
admiral_helena_cain Right. Recall the vipers. Bring the ship about. And prepare to engage the
Peg_Petty_Officer#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode11 All Pegasus vipers, all pegasus vipers, emergency recall. Theres a cylon raider right on top of you.
officer_anastasia_dualla Attention all Galactica vipers, youve got a cylon raider comin right at you.
louanne_katraine Oh there you are, you bastard on my lead!
Breaker#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode11 Quick right, full power, x-axis climb!
captain_kara_thrace Starbuck to all vipers-- do not fire... repeat, do not fire! I am a friendly, okay? Were all friendlies. So, lets just...be friendly.
captain_cole_taylor Thats no raider, thats that stealth ship of yours. Whos flying it? It wasnt cleared to launch?
cpt_lee_adama You got me, Im just a passenger back here.
louanne_katraine Galactica, Kat. Its the blackbird, Galactica. Repeat, its the blackbird.
colonel_saul_tigh What the hell is the blackbird doing out there
lt_felix_gaeta Its starbuck. She launched in the blackbird a couple hours ago. Said she was running flight tests for Admiral Cain.
admiral_william_adama That doesnt sound likely
colonel_saul_tigh Ahh, another one of her crazy ass stunts. Thank the gods.
admiral_william_adama You can say that again. Get me Pegasus.
admiral_helena_cain This is Pegasus actual, go ahead.
admiral_william_adama You can either stand down or we can start shooting at each other. Its your call.
colonel_jack_fisk Admiral.
admiral_helena_cain Wait, one.
colonel_jack_fisk Were receiving a download, Admiral.
admiral_helena_cain That is the cylon fleet. Are these from our recon mission?
colonel_jack_fisk No, sir. The recon mission was aborted. These are from blackbird.
admiral_helena_cain Thrace. She took off and did the whole recon mission alone. My gods, look at these shots, Jack. She put her nose right up their backsides and they never even knew it.
Peg_Petty_Officer#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode11 Admiral...we still have Commander Adama on the line and our fighters are stil requesting instructions. Should they resume the attack?
admiral_helena_cain All right, joint recall. Both ships stand down to condition two. Then I want you to report to me directly, in person.
admiral_william_adama I have no intention of coolling my heels in your brig.
admiral_helena_cain Fine. Neutral ground, Colonial one. No aides. Be there in 15 minutes.
admiral_william_adama Stand down, condition two
admiral_helena_cain There you are.
president_laura_roslin Lets start this by admitting an ugly truth. What happened out there today was the result of failure in leadership of everyone in this room. We are the leaders of this fleet. As such, we need to set an example. We cannot continue to let the conflicts between--
admiral_helena_cain Oh, lets just cut through the handholding, shall we. Two of his men murdered one of my officers while protecting a cylon. Theyre guilty, they admitted it. And under regulations, I have complete authority to try, convict, and sentence them. And you and I both know that the penalty for that crime is death. Admiral, surely...
president_laura_roslin The spirit of the law requires something here more than summary executions.
admiral_helena_cain Is this what the two of you have been doing for the past six months? Debating the finer points of colonial law? Well, guess what, were at war! And we dont have the luxury of academic debate over these issues.
president_laura_roslin You wanna cut through it, fine. You have Pegasus, he has Galactica. Two heavily armed, very powerful warships. Now, I am sure that Pegasus would prevail in any fight.
admiral_william_adama I wouldnt count on that.
president_laura_roslin But certainly, thered be heavy damage and youd take significant casualties. So you can go out there a fight it out with Galactica or you can compromise. And those are the only two options on the table, period.
admiral_helena_cain How the two of you have survived this long, I will never know. All right. Lieutenant Thrace has sent me detailed recon information on the cylon fleet. I want that fleet. And I need Galactica to get it. So Im willing to go this far. Ill suspend the execution until after the attack.
admiral_william_adama And I want them back on Galactica.
admiral_helena_cain I dont give a damn what you want. You frakking lucky youre staring at your own warrant.
president_laura_roslin The destruction of the cylon fleet will take priority over all other considerations. After that, we will meet back here and we will resolve this issue. Thank you.
admiral_helena_cain Stand at ease, lieutenant and come forward. Seems youve had quite a day. Im promoting you to captain Im making you commander of the Pegasus air group.
captain_kara_thrace Youre promoting me?
admiral_helena_cain I need a CAG with guts and initiative to plan and lead the attack on this fleet. Now, I thought Stinger was that man. But he managed to let captain Adama contact you and pull off that fly-by right under his nose, so, hes out.
captain_kara_thrace And captain Adama, sir?
admiral_helena_cain Truth be told, I came this close to throwing him in the brig. But I couldnt exactly charge him and not you, so I just revoked his flight status.
captain_kara_thrace I want him on my team, sir.
admiral_helena_cain And do you always get what you want?
captain_kara_thrace Most of the time...sir.
admiral_helena_cain Good.Me, too. All right, you can have him. I hear you want to return to Caprica.
captain_kara_thrace Yes, sir. We have people back there still alive.
admiral_helena_cain Yes, and they deserve to be saved. I absolutely agree. In fact, I will go one step further and I will say that our ultimate goal is that we should return to the 12 colonies and kick the cylons the frak out of our homes. What do you think of that, Captain?
captain_kara_thrace I think thats the best idea Ive heard all day, sir.
president_laura_roslin I afraid this can only end one way. Youve got to kill her.
admiral_william_adama What the hell are you talking about?
president_laura_roslin Like she said, lets cut through it. The two of you were willing to go to war today. Do you think shes going to step down from that? Shes going to bide her time and hit you the first chance she gets. Thats a given. I hate to lay this on you Bill, but she is dangerous and the only thing that you can do is to hit her before she hits you.
admiral_william_adama Im not an assassin.
president_laura_roslin No. Youre not an assassin, you are a colonial officer whos taken an oath to protect this fleet. What do you think that she is going to do with the civilian fleet once she has eliminated you. You know Im right. You just dont want to face it.
admiral_william_adama So the whole worlds going mad?
dr_cottle Your fluid and electrolytes levels are stable. But I think the babys going to be fine. You do have a cracked rib though. Hairline fracture, which means its gonna hurt like hell for a while. But, Im not seeing any signs of permanent damage from the attack.
lt_sharon_valerii The attack. Is that what were calling it now?
admiral_william_adama They were not from the Galactica.
lt_sharon_valerii They were from the Pegasus. So what? What about Helo and the chief? I heard a rumor theyre going to be executed.
admiral_william_adama Im not going to let that happen.
lt_sharon_valerii Well, how are you going to do that? Isnt Admiral Cain in command?
admiral_william_adama What happened to you--
dr_cottle Was unforgivable.
admiral_william_adama Happened aboard my ship, on my watch. And its my responsibility. So I just want you to know that I personally apologize. See that shes okay, then back into her cell.
captain_karl_agathon Arent we supposed to be dead. Everyone said execution in an hour, its been at least two.
chief_galen_tyrol Ah, Im not complaining.
cpt_lee_adama So. Just how many different kinds of stupid are you?
captain_karl_agathon More than we can count.
chief_galen_tyrol Whats going on, Captain.
cpt_lee_adama Good news--youre not dead...yet. Bad news-- its a delay, not a pardon. Theres a big op coming up and the firing squads on hold till its over. Yeah, the old man went to mat for you guys on this one, and then some. We were this close to a shooting war with the Pegasus.
captain_karl_agathon Frak me.
cpt_lee_adama Yeah, now its us.
number_six Whats wrong, Gaius?
dr_gaius_baltar Nothing. Nothing. I suppose I just, uh... lost interest.
number_six In me?
dr_gaius_baltar No, not in you, in... in this. In this place, I... I suppose I just dont really miss it anymore.
number_six You know what I miss? Sports.
dr_gaius_baltar Youre joking.
number_six No. I used to go the pyramid court just before game time. Scalp two tickets. If I timed it right, Id just be sitting down at the horn. Sit back...let the energy of the crowd flow over me Waves and waves of emotion like an electric current.
dr_gaius_baltar Why did you get two tickets?
number_six One for me, and one for you. I know Id never get you Pyramid was far too lowbrow for you, but... I always liked to feel that you were there with me.
admiral_helena_cain Well, I see that you got it to eat. Thats progress, I suppose. Can you get it to roll over...beg? See what it can make of these. You know this thing used to sit in our mess and eat our food, and listen to our stories. Didnt you? You just sat there... listening to us, pretending to be our friend didnt you?!
dr_gaius_baltar Admiral, please! Any...physical contact with the subject will only to set my efforts back at this point.
admiral_helena_cain Find out about that ship.
number_six I want to die. Will you help me do that? Will you kill me, please?
chief_peter_laird Hey, Im just still getting up to speed on the way you do things around here. But Im reasonably sure that we can have all our birds in the air for the attack thing, Sure. I mean, um, yes, sir.
admiral_william_adama Thank you, chief. Cally. Lairds not military, is he?
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson No, sir. He was a civilian aeronautical engineer on a ship called the Scylla..
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Civilian? Do you know how he got on the Pegasus? Scuttlebutt is that the Pegasus used to have a civilian fleet but something happened to them.
admiral_william_adama Thank you.
colonel_saul_tigh Lairds ship was the Scylla.
colonel_jack_fisk Scylla was, uh... civilian transport. We found her and a few other civvies about a week after the attack. They were good ships. FTL drives and weapons even. A lot of potential spare parts that we could use on Pegasus. So...the Admiral made a decision. Military needs are a priority.
colonel_saul_tigh You stripped them. You stripped the ships for parts? Sweet mother of Artemis. How much equipment did you take? You take their jump drives? Left all those people marooned out there?
colonel_jack_fisk No, not all. Admiral Cain looked over the passenger list and she made a decision about who was valuable and who wasnt. Scylla was the toughest. Laird and 15 other men and women, they were all traveling with their families-- wives, husbands, children. The selectees... they refused to go. There was resistance. So the order came down to shoot the family of anyone who refused to come. So we did. Two families, we put them up against the bulkhead. And we shot them.
cpt_lee_adama A cags work is never done.
captain_kara_thrace Hi...how ya doing?
cpt_lee_adama Oh, you mean apart from being, uh, demoted? Finding myself working for one of my pilots? Great. Never better.
captain_kara_thrace You know I had nothing to do with that, right?
cpt_lee_adama Never thought you did. I, uh, just checked in on Helo and Tyrol. Theyre hanging tight for now.
captain_kara_thrace Good. Help me plan this op. Ive been staring at this roster. You wanna just carry on? As if nothings happened?
cpt_lee_adama Lee, shes in command, what do you want to do? Theres nothing we can do.
dr_gaius_baltar I thought you might like a fresh set of clothes.
dr_gaius_baltar Were you aware of your true nature as a cylon when you boarded the ship? Or would you describe you as a sleeper agent?
number_six I knew what I was. I was a soldier. I-I had a mission, I carried it out. I thought that when it was done I was going to die. That you would kill me. Then I-- then I would download into a new body...be reborn. But you didnt kill me. The things you did to me.
dr_gaius_baltar What they did to you was evil. But Im not one of them. You have to believe me. Things are going to get better for you. From this moment on. I promise.
number_six I dont want things to get better. I want to die.
dr_gaius_baltar But you know you cant die. You do know that, dont you? Your consciousnessill merely transfer and youll wake up in another body.
number_six Not if you destroy that.
dr_gaius_baltar What, this-- this ship? Tell me. Whats so important about this ship?
dr_gaius_baltar The cylons call this their resurrection ship. At the moment, we are too far away from the cylon home for the normal downloading process to work, which is why they built this ship. It contains the entire apparatus necessary for cylon resurrection. Now this ship has been traveling with the fleet trailing Galactica for the last several months
captain_kara_thrace So its a safety net? A place where they fall back to when they die.
admiral_helena_cain And if they lose their safety net?
captain_kara_thrace Then any cylon who dies out here--
admiral_helena_cain Would be dead. As in, really dead. I daresay they wont like that.
captain_kara_thrace No, sir. They might even stop chasing us. Why risk getting killed if you cant just wake up all nice and cozy in a brand-new body?
admiral_helena_cain Doctor, I think you just identified the most important ship in the galaxy.
president_laura_roslin I have good days and bad But dont look so worried Im not dying today.
admiral_william_adama Sorry.
president_laura_roslin What can I do for you?
admiral_william_adama You were right about Cain Pegasus had a civilian fleet with her, 15 ships. Cain stripped them. For parts, supplies...people.
president_laura_roslin I wish I could say I was surprised, but its who she is. Shes playing for keeps, youve gotta do the same.
admiral_william_adama Whats gotten into you?
president_laura_roslin Mm.
admiral_william_adama Youve become so bloody-minded.
president_laura_roslin I know that as long as Cain lives... your survival is at risk, I know that.
admiral_william_adama What can I get you?
president_laura_roslin A new body. Perhaps, one of those young cylon models from the resurrection ship.
admiral_william_adama I cant see you as a blonde.
president_laura_roslin Youd be surprised.
admiral_william_adama Well see you tomorrow?
president_laura_roslin Mm-hmm. Commander. She wont hesitate to kill you. Dont let her.
chief_galen_tyrol You know, when we get outta here... Im going to make some changes.
captain_karl_agathon Yeah? Like what?
chief_galen_tyrol Me and Sharon. Its done. I mean, really done, I cant do it anymore. I mean dont get me wrong. LT, what we did, I would do again... in a heartbeat. But Ive gotta let it go. I so thought I had let go.
captain_karl_agathon Yeah...I know what you mean.
chief_galen_tyrol You?
captain_karl_agathon Yeah, me. What? You think I dont have second thoughts sometimes You think I dont wonder Im losing my frakkin mind. Im in love a woman I know isnt a woman. Im having a baby thats- thats what? Half machine?
chief_galen_tyrol You really do love her, dont you?
captain_karl_agathon Yeah. Yes, I do. And I cant let go of it. But if you can... let it go.
captain_kara_thrace Our primary objective is a vessel named Resurrection by the cylons. Its guarded by two basestars which have been following us throughout this sector.
cpt_lee_adama Our plan, simply put, is to let them find us. We will wait in this system here and appear to be conducting mining operations.
captain_kara_thrace When the cylons launch the raiders, Galactica and most of the civilians will jump away. A small group of civilians will be left behind.
cpt_lee_adama To the cylons, theyll appear to be having trouble with their FTL drives and attempting to escape at sub-light speed.
captain_kara_thrace The cylon raiders pursue the civilian decoys pulling the raiders farther away from the cylon basestar as they can.
cpt_lee_adama once the raiders have been drawn off by the decoys, Galactica and Pegasus will jump in and attack the base stars While I jump in, in the blackbird stealth fighter and take out the FTL drives on the resurrection ship, preventing it from jumping away.
colonel_saul_tigh Why not have the stealth ship carry nukes and destroy it right at the start?
captain_kara_thrace We ran simulations on that. We determined that the cylons would detect the nuclear warheads and destroy the stealth ship before it got within weapons range. When the FTL is destroyed Galactica and Pegasus will take on the basestars and our attack squadrons will go after the resurrection ship itself.
colonel_saul_tigh How many squadrons?
captain_kara_thrace All of em.
admiral_helena_cain Is there a problem, commander?
admiral_william_adama I need time to study the operational details.
admiral_helena_cain Suit yourself. Ive gone over the details and Im satisfied.
admiral_william_adama I want your CAG to stay and help me. Answer some of my questions.
admiral_helena_cain One hour, Thrace.
captain_kara_thrace Yes, sir.
admiral_william_adama Stay focused, son.
admiral_helena_cain Jack, I want to transfer a detachment of marines to Galactica. And I want you to handpick them. Completely reliable. Completely loyal. Razors.
admiral_william_adama I have a mission for you, Kara.
captain_kara_thrace Anything for you, you know that.
admiral_william_adama Dont accept too quickly. You wont like this one. I dont like it. But Ive decided that it has to be done.
admiral_helena_cain Im transferring you to Galactica, as well. Ill tell Adama that youre there to be my eyes and ears. Hell hate it. Hell think youre my spy and try to freeze you out of decision-making. But hell accept it. Now I want you to stay in throughout the attack. Stay with Adama.
admiral_william_adama After the attack is completed and youve accounted for your pilots I want you to land your bird on the Pegasus to report directly to CIC. Youll take Lee with you. Hell watch your back.
admiral_helena_cain Position marines in key positions throughout the ship and keep a squad posted just outside CIC.
admiral_william_adama Therell the normal chaos emotional high after the attack.
admiral_helena_cain Theyll be slapping each other on the back, celebrating the victory.
admiral_william_adama Theyll keep their guard down.
admiral_helena_cain Security will be lax.
admiral_william_adama I will ask for you over the wireless.
admiral_helena_cain I will call you directly, and when I have you on the line and you hear me give the command, execute case orange
admiral_william_adama When you hear me say downfall
admiral_helena_cain You are to signal the marines to terminate Adamas command. Starting with Adama.
admiral_william_adama I want you to pull out your weapon... and shoot Admiral Cain in the head.
