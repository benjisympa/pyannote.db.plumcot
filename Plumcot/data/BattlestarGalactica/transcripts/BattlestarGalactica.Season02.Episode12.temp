Starbuck This is a frakked-up thing that Ive been asked to do. But we kill people for a living. They say shoot, we shoot.
Apollo So youre gonna do this?
Starbuck Yeah, Im gonna do it.
Apollo Kara.
Starbuck I could use some backup. Ill understand if you cant.
Apollo You know better than that.
Starbuck Yeah, I guess so.
Apollo People have to have this, Kara. Trust. Your word and my word. We dont have this, then we really are no different than the cylons.
Starbuck Thank you.
Helo Oh, looky here. Sunshine boys are here.
Gage You know, the man you killed saved my life and the lives of 50 other men, you miserable fraks.
Helo Hey. You. You call me sir.
Gage Yes, sir.
Vireem So I guess you were both getting your poles greased by that filthy little robot girl.
Tyrol Im sorry. I dont think I quite heard that right. The glass. I cant hear you. So, why dont you open the door, come in, and well talk about it in here.
Vireem Thats a great idea, chief.
Helo They really want to do things.
Marine Hands over your head.
Tyrol Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Helo Slow it down. Just think about what youre doing here. Just think about what were doing here, guys.
Tyrol What the frak is this?
Gage Dont worry, sir. Well take it real slow. Sir!
Tyrol Hey!
Gage You see, the gut, thats a vulnerable area. Lieutenant Thorne told me that once. He said if you really want to do some damage without leaving a mark, go for the gut.
Vireem Youd be surprised what you can do with the simplest things. Bar of soap, plain old towel. How bad could it be, right? Youd be surprised.
Tyrol Cowards.
Gage Cowards? Is that what you said? Now give me that. You know what, I lied. Im not going slow anymore.
Fisk Attention on deck! Gage. Vireem. Out of the cell, standing tall. Right here. Remove the restraints from the prisoners. Specialist Gage, let me ask you something. Those men in there, are they wearing colonial uniforms?
Gage Yes, sir.
Fisk Specialist Vireem, do you agree with specialist gage here that those are, in fact, colonial officers?
Vireem Yes, sir. They killed lieutenant--
Fisk Shut your frakkin mouth! You see, I dont quite understand what I just saw because I think I saw you two knuckledraggers treating those men like they were cylons, which, of course, couldnt be right because if, in fact, that was the case, then youre both subject to charges of assaulting a chief and a lieutenant under color of authority in a time of war. Which, if Im not mistaken, carries a penalty on this ship that is quite severe. Now, get the hell out of here.
Gage Sir.
Vireem Sir.
Fisk Get out.
Marine Yes, sir.
Helo Thank you.
Tyrol Thank you, Colonel.
Fisk I dont want your thanks. I owe Lieutenant Thorne my life, as do many people on this ship.
Helo He was trying to rape a prisoner.
Fisk You cant rape a machine, Lieutenant.
Cain You drink, Thrace?
Starbuck Only to excess, sir.
Cain Only to excess? Learn that from Colonel Tigh, did you?
Starbuck Not exactly.
Cain I understand you belted him once.
Starbuck That was something that I did without really thinking.
Cain Dont apologize. Some people get exactly what they deserve. From what I read about your XO. Maybe he needs to get popped in the mouth every once in while, hmm?
Cain I know youre very close with Adama.
Starbuck Yes, sir.
Cain And I know hes a good man. And I know hes had to make some very hard choices over the last few months. Lord knows I have.
Starbuck Well then maybe you can understand why he did what he thought he had to do when you said you were going to execute Helo and Tyrol.
Cain Let me tell you something. Ive had to watch a lot of kids be put into body bags. Theyre covered with flags and they float out that airlock. You think I dont understand his feelings towards his men? Sometimes terrible things have to be done. Inevitably, each and every one of us will have to face a moment where we have to commit that horrible sin. And if we flinch in that moment, if we hesitate for one second, if we let our conscience get in the way, you know what happens? There are more kids in those body bags. More kids floating out that airlock. I dont know why... but I have a lot of faith in you. And I want you to promise me that when that moment comes you wont flinch. Do not flinch.
Adama Come in.
Apollo Courier run from Pegasus, sir.
Adama They got you doing courier runs now, huh?
Apollo Well, I...I volunteered for this one. Kara told me about her, uh... her mission.
Adama Come to change my mind?
Apollo Just wanted to hear it from you.
Adama Decisions been made.
Apollo Assassination. Thats your decision. Thats how you resolve your differences with your superior officers.
Adama If youre gonna have some problem backing up Starbuck, I can find somebody else.
Apollo Its not about me watching her back.
Adama Im not going to debate this with you. This was a very hard decision. But I think the Presidents right. This is the best way to safeguard the fleet.
Apollo The president? So you--you and the president--
Adama Yes. Shes made of sterner stuff than people give her credit for. Is this all I have to sign?
Apollo Uh, yes, sir. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
Adama Lieutenant. Its good to see you.
Pegasus_Tactical_Officer Attention Pegasus. Jump prep underway. Viper pilots report to ready room in five minutes. Decoy squadrons, check in with CIC. Fire control, set parameters for cylon base ship. Upon jump completion, target cylon base ships.
Fisk Lets go.
Pegasus_Tactical_Officer All resurrection strike squadrons, report to mission briefing in ready room four. Special marine detachments assigned to  Galactica report to debarkation stations on starboard hangar deck immediately. Make ship ready for combat jump. Set condition one throughout the ship.
Fisk Good hunting, Captain.
Starbuck You too, Colonel.
Fisk Sorry about this, Saul, but the Admiral didnt feel comfortable with our marines under your command.
Tigh Yeah. Sorry about a lot of things. Be sure your marines and our marines are aware of their areas of responsibility in case were boarded by the cylons. The last thing we need is Colonials shooting at each other.
Fisk Amen to that.
Adama Wait outside. Sit down. Ive asked you here to find out why the cylons hate us so much.
Boomer Im not sure I know how to answer that. I mean, hate might not be the right word.
Adama I dont want to fence with you. I just want to know why.
Boomer Its what you said at the ceremony before the attack when Galactica was being decommissioned. You gave a speech that sounded like it wasnt the one you prepared. You said that humanity was a flawed creation. And that people still kill one another for petty jealousy and greed. You said that humanity never asked itself why it deserved to survive. Maybe you dont.
Gaeta Resurrection ships firing up their ftl drives. Theyre getting ready to jump.
Apollo Dont anyone look out of the window right now, please.
Apollo Starbuck, Apollo, targets ftl is history. Shes all yours.
Starbuck Roger that, Apollo--
Apollo Frakk! Drifter, drifter, drifter. Ive been hit. Ejecting.
Dualla Sir, I just received an emergency transponder from the blackbird. Its the auto-distress beacon.
Adama Alert the search and rescue raptor. See if he had time to eject.
Pegasus_Tactical_Officer Attention on Pegasus. Prepare to launch attack squadrons.
Cain Copy to Galactica.
Pegasus_Tactical_Officer Aye, sir. Attention on Galactica. Prepare to launch attack squadrons.
Pegasus Petty_Officer Starbuck, Pegasus. Resurrection Ship Twelve low at fifteen.
Starbuck Watch your intervals.
Fisk Take your posts.
Shrieker Engaging cylon fighters.
Pilot_1 Fleece look down I got em.
Fleece Nice work. Zero, one.
Pilot_1 Hang on, hang on! Take a shot!
Shrieker Fraking toasters: Cover me I cant shake him.
Adama Mr. Gaeta.
Gaeta Sir?
Adama Order batteries alpha through echo to switch to salvo fire.
Fire_Control Set secondary battery. Full attack mode. Fire at will.
Pegasus Brig
#6 Tens of thousands of cylons are about to die. Tens of thousands, Gaius. God will not forgive this sin.
Baltar Do you think god will forgive this?
Gina God forgives all.
#6 Dont listen to her. You think she can help you? You think that that broken woman can offer you even a fraction of what I can? I know gods plan for you. I know how to help you fulfill your destiny.
Baltar Do you know what I miss most? Youre going to laugh when I tell you this. Sports.
#6 Dont do this.
Baltar Yeah, thats right. I used to love getting to the pyramid game just before tip-off. By timing it right, I could sit down right at the horn and then let the emotion of the crowd flood over me. Waves and waves of it. Like electric current.
Gina Thats beautiful.
Baltar And I always had two tickets.
#6 No.
Baltar One more me...
#6 Please.
Baltar And one for you.
Dualla Apollo, Galactica, do you read? Apollo, Galactica, do you read? Can you say your position? Apollo, Galactica, do you read? Can you say your position? Apollo, Galactica, do you read? Can you say your position? Apollo, Galactica, are you reading this? Are you out there? Apollo, Galactica, do you read? Apollo, Galactica, are you reading this? Are you out there?
Apollo Im sorry Kara.
Pegasus CIC
Pegasus_Tactical_Officer Captain Thrace is reporting massive detonations. The resurrection ship has been destroyed.
Cain Yes! Theyve done it.
Racetrack Clear. Hes all right. Hes a little shaken. But, I say again, Apollo is all right.
Gaeta All the remaining cylons have jumped way. Its over, sir.
Adama Congratulations, gentlemen.
Gina Im ready to die. Send my soul to god. Please.
Starbuck I wish you were here, Lee. Oh, what the hell.
Cain I am so very proud of you.
Tigh Secure for condition one. Set condition two throughout the ship. Division officers, submit casualty and damage report to combat. Glad we didnt need your marines today.
Fisk Yeah. Yeah, me too.
Dualla Signal from the flagship, sir. Admiral cain on the line.
Adama Put her through.
Cain Congratulations, Commander.
Adama Congratulations to you too, Admiral. A significant victory. Is starbuck with you?
Cain Yes, she is.
Starbuck This is starbuck.
Adama Ive been thinking about what we talked about before. Its not enough to survive. one has to be worthy of surviving. Thats all.
Starbuck I think thats very wise, sir. Thank you.
Cain Commander, I wonder if my XO is standing close by.
Adama Yes, he is.
Fisk Yes, sir?
Cain Congratulations, Jack.
Fisk Thank you, sir.
Cain Thats all.
Fisk Yes, sir.
Tigh You look like you could use a drink.
Baltar Thank you. Oh, by the way, there was something i wanted to tell you. Last night, I was walking down this corridor here when I saw--
Baltar No! No, no. I cant--I cant do this.
Gina Suicide is a sin. But I need to die.
Baltar What you need... is justice. I know a place where you can stay, where you will be safe. Where I can look after you.
Gina Why? Why would you do that?
Baltar Because I love you.
Gina Tell me, admiral. Can you roll over? Beg?
Cain Frakk you.
Gina Youre not my type.
Fisk And she died knowing that her ship and her crew were safe and that her mission had been accomplished. Nothing was more important to her than her ship, her crew, and her mission. And as I take command of Pegasus I pledge to uphold those values that made her such an effective and heroic leader.
Starbuck I, um, only knew Admiral Cain for a short time, so what I have to say about her will be short. She faced things. She looked them right in the eye and she didnt flinch. Thats something that we do a lot around here. We second-guess. We worry. When I think about what she went through after the attack-- all alone, one ship, no help, no hope-- she didnt give up. She didnt worry. She didnt second-guess. She acted. She did what she thought needed to be done, and the Pegasus survived. Might be hard to admit, or hard to hear, but I think that we were safer with her... than we are without.
Starbuck Lee. Lee, you okay? Are you okay?
Apollo No. Not really. I, um, I broke my word to you.
Starbuck Whatre you talking about?
Apollo I let you down. I wasnt there when you needed me.
Starbuck Look... a close call like that... that would mess with anybodys head. All right? It turns out I didnt need you anyway. So... lets just be glad that we both came back alive, all right?
Apollo Thats just it, Kara. I didnt want to make it back alive.
Boomer I didnt think Id ever see you again.
Helo Same here.
Boomer So... where do we go from here?
Roslin So, how did the cylon manage to get off the Pegasus undetected?
Adama No one really knows. There was so much chaos in the aftermath of the attack.
Roslin Thank the gods that you did not have to do what I advised. That makes me very happy.
Adama Yes, thank the gods. How are you feeling?
Roslin I could sleep for about a year. But you, however, do not have that luxury because you have a new job. Billy.
Billy It took a little while to find that jeweler.
Roslin Thank you. Rumor has it that I know very little about military protocol, but I do believe that someone who commands more than one ship is called an admiral. Congratulations, Admiral Adama.
Adama Thank you, Madame president. Thank you, Billy. I, um, I never gave up hope. I just stopped trying to get these a long time ago.
Roslin Just goes to show you, Bill. Never give up hope.
Adama Same goes for you, Laura.
