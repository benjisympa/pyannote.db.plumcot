captain_kara_thrace This is a frakked-up thing that Ive been asked to do. But we kill people for a living. They say shoot, we shoot.
cpt_lee_adama So youre gonna do this?
captain_kara_thrace Yeah, Im gonna do it.
cpt_lee_adama Kara.
captain_kara_thrace I could use some backup. Ill understand if you cant.
cpt_lee_adama You know better than that.
captain_kara_thrace Yeah, I guess so.
cpt_lee_adama People have to have this, Kara. Trust. Your word and my word. We dont have this, then we really are no different than the cylons.
captain_kara_thrace Thank you.
captain_karl_agathon Oh, looky here. Sunshine boys are here.
crewman_specialist_gage You know, the man you killed saved my life and the lives of 50 other men, you miserable fraks.
captain_karl_agathon Hey. You. You call me sir.
crewman_specialist_gage Yes, sir.
crewman_specialist_vireem So I guess you were both getting your poles greased by that filthy little robot girl.
chief_galen_tyrol Im sorry. I dont think I quite heard that right. The glass. I cant hear you. So, why dont you open the door, come in, and well talk about it in here.
crewman_specialist_vireem Thats a great idea, chief.
captain_karl_agathon They really want to do things.
Marine#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode12 Hands over your head.
chief_galen_tyrol Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
captain_karl_agathon Slow it down. Just think about what youre doing here. Just think about what were doing here, guys.
chief_galen_tyrol What the frak is this?
crewman_specialist_gage Dont worry, sir. Well take it real slow. Sir!
chief_galen_tyrol Hey!
crewman_specialist_gage You see, the gut, thats a vulnerable area. Lieutenant Thorne told me that once. He said if you really want to do some damage without leaving a mark, go for the gut.
crewman_specialist_vireem Youd be surprised what you can do with the simplest things. Bar of soap, plain old towel. How bad could it be, right? Youd be surprised.
chief_galen_tyrol Cowards.
crewman_specialist_gage Cowards? Is that what you said? Now give me that. You know what, I lied. Im not going slow anymore.
colonel_jack_fisk Attention on deck! Gage. Vireem. Out of the cell, standing tall. Right here. Remove the restraints from the prisoners. Specialist Gage, let me ask you something. Those men in there, are they wearing colonial uniforms?
crewman_specialist_gage Yes, sir.
colonel_jack_fisk Specialist Vireem, do you agree with specialist gage here that those are, in fact, colonial officers?
crewman_specialist_vireem Yes, sir. They killed lieutenant--
colonel_jack_fisk Shut your frakkin mouth! You see, I dont quite understand what I just saw because I think I saw you two knuckledraggers treating those men like they were cylons, which, of course, couldnt be right because if, in fact, that was the case, then youre both subject to charges of assaulting a chief and a lieutenant under color of authority in a time of war. Which, if Im not mistaken, carries a penalty on this ship that is quite severe. Now, get the hell out of here.
crewman_specialist_gage Sir.
crewman_specialist_vireem Sir.
colonel_jack_fisk Get out.
Marine#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode12 Yes, sir.
captain_karl_agathon Thank you.
chief_galen_tyrol Thank you, Colonel.
colonel_jack_fisk I dont want your thanks. I owe Lieutenant Thorne my life, as do many people on this ship.
captain_karl_agathon He was trying to rape a prisoner.
colonel_jack_fisk You cant rape a machine, Lieutenant.
admiral_helena_cain You drink, Thrace?
captain_kara_thrace Only to excess, sir.
admiral_helena_cain Only to excess? Learn that from Colonel Tigh, did you?
captain_kara_thrace Not exactly.
admiral_helena_cain I understand you belted him once.
captain_kara_thrace That was something that I did without really thinking.
admiral_helena_cain Dont apologize. Some people get exactly what they deserve. From what I read about your XO. Maybe he needs to get popped in the mouth every once in while, hmm?
admiral_helena_cain I know youre very close with Adama.
captain_kara_thrace Yes, sir.
admiral_helena_cain And I know hes a good man. And I know hes had to make some very hard choices over the last few months. Lord knows I have.
captain_kara_thrace Well then maybe you can understand why he did what he thought he had to do when you said you were going to execute Helo and Tyrol.
admiral_helena_cain Let me tell you something. Ive had to watch a lot of kids be put into body bags. Theyre covered with flags and they float out that airlock. You think I dont understand his feelings towards his men? Sometimes terrible things have to be done. Inevitably, each and every one of us will have to face a moment where we have to commit that horrible sin. And if we flinch in that moment, if we hesitate for one second, if we let our conscience get in the way, you know what happens? There are more kids in those body bags. More kids floating out that airlock. I dont know why... but I have a lot of faith in you. And I want you to promise me that when that moment comes you wont flinch. Do not flinch.
admiral_william_adama Come in.
cpt_lee_adama Courier run from Pegasus, sir.
admiral_william_adama They got you doing courier runs now, huh?
cpt_lee_adama Well, I...I volunteered for this one. Kara told me about her, uh... her mission.
admiral_william_adama Come to change my mind?
cpt_lee_adama Just wanted to hear it from you.
admiral_william_adama Decisions been made.
cpt_lee_adama Assassination. Thats your decision. Thats how you resolve your differences with your superior officers.
admiral_william_adama If youre gonna have some problem backing up Starbuck, I can find somebody else.
cpt_lee_adama Its not about me watching her back.
admiral_william_adama Im not going to debate this with you. This was a very hard decision. But I think the Presidents right. This is the best way to safeguard the fleet.
cpt_lee_adama The president? So you--you and the president--
admiral_william_adama Yes. Shes made of sterner stuff than people give her credit for. Is this all I have to sign?
cpt_lee_adama Uh, yes, sir. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
admiral_william_adama Lieutenant. Its good to see you.
Pegasus_Tactical_Officer#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode12 Attention Pegasus. Jump prep underway. Viper pilots report to ready room in five minutes. Decoy squadrons, check in with CIC. Fire control, set parameters for cylon base ship. Upon jump completion, target cylon base ships.
colonel_jack_fisk Lets go.
Pegasus_Tactical_Officer#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode12 All resurrection strike squadrons, report to mission briefing in ready room four. Special marine detachments assigned to Galactica report to debarkation stations on starboard hangar deck immediately. Make ship ready for combat jump. Set condition one throughout the ship.
colonel_jack_fisk Good hunting, Captain.
captain_kara_thrace You too, Colonel.
colonel_jack_fisk Sorry about this, Saul, but the Admiral didnt feel comfortable with our marines under your command.
colonel_saul_tigh Yeah. Sorry about a lot of things. Be sure your marines and our marines are aware of their areas of responsibility in case were boarded by the cylons. The last thing we need is Colonials shooting at each other.
colonel_jack_fisk Amen to that.
admiral_william_adama Wait outside. Sit down. Ive asked you here to find out why the cylons hate us so much.
lt_sharon_valerii Im not sure I know how to answer that. I mean, hate might not be the right word.
admiral_william_adama I dont want to fence with you. I just want to know why.
lt_sharon_valerii Its what you said at the ceremony before the attack when Galactica was being decommissioned. You gave a speech that sounded like it wasnt the one you prepared. You said that humanity was a flawed creation. And that people still kill one another for petty jealousy and greed. You said that humanity never asked itself why it deserved to survive. Maybe you dont.
lt_felix_gaeta Resurrection ships firing up their ftl drives. Theyre getting ready to jump.
cpt_lee_adama Dont anyone look out of the window right now, please.
cpt_lee_adama Starbuck, Apollo, targets ftl is history. Shes all yours.
captain_kara_thrace Roger that, Apollo--
cpt_lee_adama Frakk! Drifter, drifter, drifter. Ive been hit. Ejecting.
officer_anastasia_dualla Sir, I just received an emergency transponder from the blackbird. Its the auto-distress beacon.
admiral_william_adama Alert the search and rescue raptor. See if he had time to eject.
Pegasus_Tactical_Officer#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode12 Attention on Pegasus. Prepare to launch attack squadrons.
admiral_helena_cain Copy to Galactica.
Pegasus_Tactical_Officer#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode12 Aye, sir. Attention on Galactica. Prepare to launch attack squadrons.
Pegasus#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode12 Petty_Officer Starbuck, Pegasus. Resurrection Ship Twelve low at fifteen.
captain_kara_thrace Watch your intervals.

Pegasus#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode12 Brig
number_six Tens of thousands of cylons are about to die. Tens of thousands, Gaius. God will not forgive this sin.
dr_gaius_baltar Do you think god will forgive this?
number_six God forgives all.
number_six Dont listen to her. You think she can help you? You think that that broken woman can offer you even a fraction of what I can? I know gods plan for you. I know how to help you fulfill your destiny.
dr_gaius_baltar Do you know what I miss most? Youre going to laugh when I tell you this. Sports.
number_six Dont do this.
dr_gaius_baltar Yeah, thats right. I used to love getting to the pyramid game just before tip-off. By timing it right, I could sit down right at the horn and then let the emotion of the crowd flood over me. Waves and waves of it. Like electric current.
number_six Thats beautiful.
dr_gaius_baltar And I always had two tickets.
number_six No.
dr_gaius_baltar One more me...
number_six Please.
dr_gaius_baltar And one for you.
officer_anastasia_dualla Apollo, Galactica, do you read? Apollo, Galactica, do you read? Can you say your position? Apollo, Galactica, do you read? Can you say your position? Apollo, Galactica, do you read? Can you say your position? Apollo, Galactica, are you reading this? Are you out there? Apollo, Galactica, do you read? Apollo, Galactica, are you reading this? Are you out there?
cpt_lee_adama Im sorry Kara.
Pegasus#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode12 CIC
Pegasus_Tactical_Officer#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode12 Captain Thrace is reporting massive detonations. The resurrection ship has been destroyed.
admiral_helena_cain Yes! Theyve done it.
Racetrack#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode12 Clear. Hes all right. Hes a little shaken. But, I say again, Apollo is all right.
lt_felix_gaeta All the remaining cylons have jumped way. Its over, sir.
admiral_william_adama Congratulations, gentlemen.
number_six Im ready to die. Send my soul to god. Please.
captain_kara_thrace I wish you were here, Lee. Oh, what the hell.
admiral_helena_cain I am so very proud of you.
colonel_saul_tigh Secure for condition one. Set condition two throughout the ship. Division officers, submit casualty and damage report to combat. Glad we didnt need your marines today.
colonel_jack_fisk Yeah. Yeah, me too.
officer_anastasia_dualla Signal from the flagship, sir. Admiral cain on the line.
admiral_william_adama Put her through.
admiral_helena_cain Congratulations, Commander.
admiral_william_adama Congratulations to you too, Admiral. A significant victory. Is starbuck with you?
admiral_helena_cain Yes, she is.
captain_kara_thrace This is starbuck.
admiral_william_adama Ive been thinking about what we talked about before. Its not enough to survive. one has to be worthy of surviving. Thats all.
captain_kara_thrace I think thats very wise, sir. Thank you.
admiral_helena_cain Commander, I wonder if my XO is standing close by.
admiral_william_adama Yes, he is.
colonel_jack_fisk Yes, sir?
admiral_helena_cain Congratulations, Jack.
colonel_jack_fisk Thank you, sir.
admiral_helena_cain Thats all.
colonel_jack_fisk Yes, sir.
colonel_saul_tigh You look like you could use a drink.
dr_gaius_baltar Thank you. Oh, by the way, there was something i wanted to tell you. Last night, I was walking down this corridor here when I saw--
dr_gaius_baltar No! No, no. I cant--I cant do this.
number_six Suicide is a sin. But I need to die.
dr_gaius_baltar What you need... is justice. I know a place where you can stay, where you will be safe. Where I can look after you.
number_six Why? Why would you do that?
dr_gaius_baltar Because I love you.
number_six Tell me, admiral. Can you roll over? Beg?
admiral_helena_cain Frakk you.
number_six Youre not my type.
colonel_jack_fisk And she died knowing that her ship and her crew were safe and that her mission had been accomplished. Nothing was more important to her than her ship, her crew, and her mission. And as I take command of Pegasus I pledge to uphold those values that made her such an effective and heroic leader.
captain_kara_thrace I, um, only knew Admiral Cain for a short time, so what I have to say about her will be short. She faced things. She looked them right in the eye and she didnt flinch. Thats something that we do a lot around here. We second-guess. We worry. When I think about what she went through after the attack-- all alone, one ship, no help, no hope-- she didnt give up. She didnt worry. She didnt second-guess. She acted. She did what she thought needed to be done, and the Pegasus survived. Might be hard to admit, or hard to hear, but I think that we were safer with her... than we are without.
captain_kara_thrace Lee. Lee, you okay? Are you okay?
cpt_lee_adama No. Not really. I, um, I broke my word to you.
captain_kara_thrace Whatre you talking about?
cpt_lee_adama I let you down. I wasnt there when you needed me.
captain_kara_thrace Look... a close call like that... that would mess with anybodys head. All right? It turns out I didnt need you anyway. So... lets just be glad that we both came back alive, all right?
cpt_lee_adama Thats just it, Kara. I didnt want to make it back alive.
lt_sharon_valerii I didnt think Id ever see you again.
captain_karl_agathon Same here.
lt_sharon_valerii So... where do we go from here?
president_laura_roslin So, how did the cylon manage to get off the Pegasus undetected?
admiral_william_adama No one really knows. There was so much chaos in the aftermath of the attack.
president_laura_roslin Thank the gods that you did not have to do what I advised. That makes me very happy.
admiral_william_adama Yes, thank the gods. How are you feeling?
president_laura_roslin I could sleep for about a year. But you, however, do not have that luxury because you have a new job. Billy.
billy_keikeya It took a little while to find that jeweler.
president_laura_roslin Thank you. Rumor has it that I know very little about military protocol, but I do believe that someone who commands more than one ship is called an admiral. Congratulations, Admiral Adama.
admiral_william_adama Thank you, Madame president. Thank you, Billy. I, um, I never gave up hope. I just stopped trying to get these a long time ago.
president_laura_roslin Just goes to show you, Bill. Never give up hope.
admiral_william_adama Same goes for you, Laura.
