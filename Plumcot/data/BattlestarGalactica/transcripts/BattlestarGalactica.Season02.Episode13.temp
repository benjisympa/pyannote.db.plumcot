Doctor Im afraid the tests are positive. The mass is malignant. Its advanced well beyond the left breast. Im afraid the test is positive. Ms. Roslin... the surgery, of course, to remove the mass...
Stans Secretary Roslin?
Roslin Yes?
Stans Naylin Stans from the education alliance. You said you wanted to talk?
Roslin Yes. Im sorry, Mr. Stans...
Stans I have to admit, I was surprised to get your message.
Roslin The President was surprised I sent it.
Stans Once our chief negotiator got a billy club to the head, we figured Adars government had written us off as a lost cause.
Roslin I was a teacher long before I was secretary of education, and causes are only lost when we give up.
Cottle Madame President? Can you hear me? Lets make her as comfortable as we can.
Roslin Oh, gods...
Starbuck Starbuck zero four niner-- cap is away.
Dualla Galactica, roger that. Zero four niner. Safe flight.
Kat Safe and 20 frakkin minutes late. Did you have a rough night, starbuck?
Starbuck Youre way out of line. Just follow my lead and save the attitude for someone who cares.
Kat Kat six seven zero-- roger that. Request permission to clear guns.
Starbuck Roger that, Kat. Clear your throat.
Starbuck Damn it!
Kat Weapons malfunction! Weapons malfunction! Galactica!
Starbuck Kat, you good?
Kat Im good, Im good. What the hell just happened?
Starbuck Your wing guns out. Just keep it steady, were going home. Galactica, this is Starbuck. Im declaring an emergency. Weve got two bent birds. Requesting priority clearance to land.
Kelly Starbuck, Galactica. Flight deck is yours.
Starbuck Why dont you just shoot us in the locker room, chief? Save the wear and tear on the ships.
Tyrol Kats guns are clean, I checked em myself.
Starbuck Yeah, well I dont believe in accidents.
Cally Chief. Somethings not right.
Tyrol The weights off, its too light.
Cally I found three more just like it. Mixed in with the regular rounds.
Tyrol Casings been weakened. Falls apart in the barrel. Next one hits it-- bang, shes lucky she didnt lose her whole wing. one bad rounds a fluke. More than one, sabotage. Pull em all!
Deckhand Alright you heard the cheif, lets pull em all! Go!
Adama Hows the President doing, Doc?
Cottle Shes dying... and she knows it. I offered her a shot of morpha to ease the pain, but...she wouldnt hear of it.
Roslin Mr. President... the terrorists...
Roslin Mr. President, we should at least speak with the strikers before sending in the troops. Theyre teachers, not terrorists.
Adar Theyre acting like thugs. Theyre last demonstration put two policemen in the hospital. Six of them have chained themselves outside the hall of education. As far as Im concerned, theyre criminals.
Roslin Their pay is substandard, their schools are falling apart, and the strike action has been gaining momentum for months, and you know that. I dont understand why were not at least talking to them.
Adar One of the most interesting things about being president is that you dont have to explain yourself...to anyone. Youve already set a meeting with Stans, havent you?
Roslin Obviously, only if you approve, Mr. President.
Baltar Shes really not in a fit state to do anything... let alone conduct any government business.
Roslin Dont talk about me as if Im not here. Therell be plenty of time for that soon enough. Billy, could you--
Cottle Im no expert in genetics, but I can read a blood test. That cylon fetus is showing some very peculiar genetic abnormalities.
Adama I havent seen any of this on your report, Doctor.
Baltar No, um. Well, as Dr. Cottle says, hes-- hes not an expert, and I am. Um, Ive been through the tests and I-I wouldnt say that there was anything conclusive.
Cottle Didnt say conclusive, just damned odd.
Baltar Right. Madame President. As you know, the Sharon Cylon is of considerable tactical value to the fleet.
Roslin Perhaps youve gotten too close to your subject, Doctor. This is difficult, so Im going to cut right to it. Allowing this thing to be born could have frightening consequences. For the security of this fleet, I believe the cylon pregnancy must be terminated before it is too late.
Adama Madame President, Id like--
Roslin I thought you of all people would understand, Admiral.
Baltar Madame President. I dont understand, this makes no sense.
Roslin One of the interesting things about being president is you dont have to explain yourself to anyone. Thank you, gentlemen, Im-Im a little tired. Gentlemen.
Baltar I dont want to seem alarmist, um, but I am perturbed. I think that the, uh, the Presidents illness is affecting her judgment. Especially when it comes to the subject--
Adama She seemed reasonably coherent to me.
Baltar Well, then Ill have to appeal to you on scientific grounds. Destroying this child would seriously impact my studies of the cylon sub-species.
Adama The President made the call and Im backing her.
Baltar Look, with all due respect, the President made the call based on evidence presented by Dr. Cottle, and hes medicines--
Adama Pull yourself together. Youre about to become President of the colonies. Youre going to be asked to make some very hard decisions. Act like you can handle it.
Baltar Gods-- uh... where have you been?
#6 Where have I been? I never left you, Gaius.
Baltar Oh, right, yeah, um. Yeah, metaphorically speaking. Its just that it was weeks ago, and I, uh...
#6 Im sure youve suffered mightily in my absence.
Baltar You know, jealousy is a really ugly emotion. What is this lingering controversy over my affair with your three-dimensional duplicate.
#6 Im not jealous, Im concerned.
Baltar Oh yeah, concerned, about what?
#6 Our child!
Baltar Oh--now youre concerned?
#6 Well, for your information, the President wants to kill it. once Roslins gone, youll be President. You can use your new authority to save our child.
Baltar Oh, like thats gonna-- did you see the way Adama looked at me? The contempt on his face? I will be the President, all right, but without the military support, I might as well be an anointed dog catcher.
#6 Yes, well, you have your own resources if youd use them. What, you dont know what I mean?
Baltar No, I dont know what you mean.
#6 The nuclear device. The one Adama provided for your research.
Baltar There is one way.
#6 I didnt want to have to ask you for this.
Baltar I didnt want to have to ask you for this.
#6 But what I really need--
Baltar But what I really need
#6 To complete the project... is a nuclear warhead.
Baltar Is a nuclear-- warhead.
Baltar Youre totally insane.
#6 Im trying to help you, you idiot. If Adama remains committed to the destruction of our child, it may be our only hope.
Adama Theres no easy way to say this. Its about the cylon. The President has decided that her pregnancy will be terminated.
Helo What? Why?
Adama Doc cottle discovered some anomalies in the fetal blood work.
Helo Isnt that expected?
Adama Maybe. But the President believes that to allow the baby to come to full term constitutes an unacceptable risk to the fleet.
Helo I dont understand. Sharons only helped us since she came back from Caprica. She even turned on her own.
Adama To save her life. Dont mistake the will the live for genuine conversion, Lieutenant. Shes still the enemy.
Helo Does she know?
Adama Not yet.
Helo Then I should be the one to tell her. If thats all, sir.
Adama Helo. I dont expect you to agree to the decision. But I need you to accept it.
Helo Were talking about my child, sir. Part of me. But I guess its easier to kill when you call it a cylon.
Adama Dismissed.
Tigh So youre saying someones been tampering with our ammunition.
Starbuck Shells dont unload themselves.
Tigh Whats this I hear about you ordering both Galactica and Pegasus fighters to stand down?
Apollo Price you pay for reinstating me as CAG, sir.
Tigh Maybe that was a mistake.
Apollo Maybe I dont give a damn what you think, sir.
Adama Take it easy, both of you.
Apollo Fact is, weve been sharing stories between the ships. And nobody flies combat until our ammo supplies check out.
Tigh Leaving us defenseless if the cylons decide to pick a fight.
Adama We were defenseless before this, we just didnt know about it. Lee, find out who did this.
Apollo All right. Excuse me, Im looking for Asha Janik.
Worker Asha, shes over there.
Apollo Lets do this quietly. Asha Janik? Captain Adama.
Janik I have a message for your father. They may take me!
Apollo Okay, stop her!
Janik But I am one of many! We have declared war against Galacticas armies of death! The cylons arent our true enemy! Its the military that refuses to negotiate! All we want is peace! Demand peace! Demand peace!
Starbuck So much for being discreet, huh?
Adama We found these pamphlets in Janiks quarters. Some kind of a manifesto.
Tigh Demand peace from the cylons? Who the hell are these people?
Baltar Cylon sympathizers. Just had no idea they were this organized.
Adama I want to know how she got aboard my ship.
Apollo The hangar decks short-staffed. Weve been forced to import civilians to handle some of the grunt work. Apparently shes, um, shes a Picon, worked maintenance on the Greenleaf, no known criminal affiliations.
Tigh Huh, until now, now listen to this: Do not be afraid, we are not terrorists, but we will not sit back while Adamas war machine continues to press us into cruel and futile conflict. Gods damn it.
Apollo Our demonstrations worked. News is already spreading across the fleet.
Adama I know. We were contacted by a person claiming to speak for the subversives demanding a meeting on the Galactica.
Tigh Theyve got stones, Ill give them that.
Adama Well, Ive agreed.
Tigh What?
Adama Were not negotiating. I just want to know what were up against.
Stans Madame secretary? Considering the stakes, you dont seem particularly engaged.
Roslin The stakes are what we decide to make them, Mr. Stans. If the President uses troops to enforce us back to work order, people will get hurt. Even die.
Stans Some causes are worth dying for.
Roslin Not this one.
Jahee Admiral, I am Royan Jahee. You have a unique way of welcoming visitors to your ship.
Tigh Visitor, my ass. We shoot people like you for treason.
Jahee Colonel, Im only an interested party trying to prevent more bloodshed. I deplore what happened aboard your vipers.
Adama How many sympathizers do we have aboard this fleet?
Jahee If youre trying to crush an organization, you can stop now. The people in this movement are following an idea, not a leader.
Tigh What the hell do they want?
Jahee Peace...with the cylon.
Adama You want us to surrender? They attacked us.
Jahee Only after wed enslaved them! You call yourselves military men, strategists. Explain to me how our current course of attack and retreat leads to victory?
Adama You can play innocent bystander, but I think you know more than youre telling us. Either way, youre a danger to this fleet.
Jahee Admiral, arresting me isnt going to stop any of this.
Adama Maybe not. But its a start. Take him away.
Apollo All right, get your rubber gloves on. This is everything from the Janik womans quarters. Somehow the Admiral thinks looking through this craps gonna tell us something new about their so-called movement.
Starbuck So, um...havent seen much of you since your space walk.
Apollo Hold it, what is this?
Starbuck Whats a deckhand need with a portable library reader?
Apollo The Daru Mozu. A tylium refinery. And janiks used to explosives. This is the CAG. Get me a tac team ready, right now.
Boomer I dont understand, why are they doing this now?
Helo I dont know. The Admiral said they found something in the babys blood. Somehow, President Roslin considers it a threat to the fleet.
Boomer It cant just be that. Ive done nothing but help them since Ive come here. Ive held back my anger. Ive tried to show them that cylons are not all the same. That were not all murderers.
Helo Deep down, I think theyre still afraid of you.
Boomer Yeah...afraid. They wanna be afraid of something? Yeah? Just let them come! Let em! Let them try to take my baby! Ahhh! Just let them try to take my baby!
Helo Sharon, stop!
Boomer Ahh!
Helo Sharon, please dont do this! Please!
Boomer Ahhh!
Helo Listen to me, listen to me! Listen to me.
Boomer Ahh!
Apollo When we land, move fast. Were looking for explosive devices set near the Darus ftl drive.
Marine Captain, Im getting something on the wireless I think its coming from the Daru Mozu.
Woman None of us want to die, but the fighting must end. If my sacrifice sends a signal to the cylon that brings peace, then it was worth it. I do this for my children, and for the children that will follow them. Gods willing, demand peace, demand peace.
Apollo Pull out, pull out! Pull out, pull out, pull out!
Adama People are dead.
Jahee I grieve for them, Admiral. And I assure you, the tyliums ships just a taste of whats in store, unless someone starts listening!
Adama You listen and you listen well. I dont care if I have to interrogate every civilian on board this fleet. This is gonna stop. Do you understand?
Jahee Yes.
Billy Mr. Vice President, President Roslin insisted on your taking the tour. Shed like the transition to go as smoothly as possible.
Baltar What are these?
Billy Cylon agent suspects, sir.
Billy That number means everything to her. Represents hope, thats our future.
Baltar Yes, yes.
Billy Being the President is, uh, a lot of responsibility. Its tradition for outgoing Presidents to leave a letter for their successor. Its usually opened on the first day of the new term, but the next few days are liable to prove...hectic, so...
Baltar Well, lets just pray that she gets better.
Billy Lets.
Billy Excuse me. Mr. Vice President?
Baltar Hello? Yes. Yes. I understand. Thank you.
Baltar I was told I might meet an old friend here.
Gina Its good to see you, Gaius.
Baltar So youve become a member of the peace movement?
Gina Well, despite what you may think, Ive always abhorred violence. Would you excuse us? Please.
Baltar Do they have any idea what you are?
Gina Of course not, even their dedication has limits.
Baltar I miss you. You look amazing. I cant believe-- how real you are.
Gina Whatre you doing?
Baltar I havent stopped thinking about you since the second I left the pegasus.
Gina No, no--
Baltar I cant get you out of my head.
Gina Dont--do this, not yet.
Baltar I cant help myself, I cant.
Gina Gaius.
Baltar Ahhh! Im sorry.
Gina No, Im-- Im sorry. Im just--Im not ready.
Baltar So, is there any reason in particular for inviting me around here?
Gina Because you saved me. Let me save you.
Baltar Oh, here we go again. What are you talking about?
Gina You must sense it. Gaius, the fleets crumbling. People are turning on each other. There are serious misgivings about the military. When youre President, you can use the office to turn them against Adama, paving the way for the cylons to save us.
Baltar I-I would love to be with you always, but--
Gina I know its hard, but its the only way.
Baltar No. No. I am not who you think I am. And I will not be responsible for the destruction of mankind.
Cottle If you would have caught it sooner, maybe we could have done more.
Adar Laura, come in. I didnt like the way we left things this morning.
Roslin Richard, I--
Adar I know. Youve been thinking this is a mistake for a while now.
Roslin I just met with Stans. The education alliance is going to back off.
Adar Back off? Laura, what did you give them?
Roslin I made them a promise that we would seriously hear out their grievances, Richard. I thought youd be happy theyre going back to work.
Adar Laura, youve put me in a very awkward position.
Roslin I dont see how. Both sides gave ground.
Adar Its not just about your teachers. Its the next strike im worried about. You just showed them that if they hold out long enough, this administration will cave.
Roslin You expected me to fail.
Adar I expected you to hold the line. This doesnt have to be the end of the world. You can stay on in an advisory capacity. Gods know we need your ideas.
Roslin Youre asking me to resign?
Adar I dont have any choice. This isnt about you and me anymore.
Roslin Youre right, its not. You were willing to attack those people and up until a few hours ago, I was prepared to let you. I am on my way to the Galactica to represent this administration. When I return, if you still want my job, be prepared to fight. When I return...
Cottle Notify the Admiral.
Adama This is Admiral Adama. As you know, President Roslin has been aboard Galactica for the last few days. Shes a fighter. But as of this moment, her prognosis is grave. I know that many of you believe in the power of prayer. If that is your way, then I urge you to pray for our President. As for the others, I hope you will join me in keeping her in our thoughts.
Helo Admiral, please dont do this.
Adama Stand down, everyone. Give me room. Think about what youre doing Helo. Youre a soldier.
Helo Im a father, like you. Please, sir...give me a raptor, let me take her off the ship. Ill get her away from the fleet.
Adama I cant do that, son.
Helo Admiral, Admiral!
Adama Doctor, get the hell outta here.
Baltar Admiral, I must talk to you concerning the cylon child. It seems I may have been...wrong. Very wrong. When I said that Dr. Cottle misinterpreted the fetal blood work--
Baltar See, I had another look at those samples and I discovered something quite intriguing. Understand, cylon blood is virtually impossible to differentiate from our own. That being said, obviously it has to be slightly different because the cylon is not human, um... if, um... if our blood looks like this... for example. And the cylons blood looks like this... then its fair to assume that the cylon human is carrying an amalgam.
Adama Is this a theory or fact?
Baltar The cylons fetus contains no antigens. It has no blood type. Thats what Dr. Cottle was talking about when he said it was damned odd. Except its not damned odd, its astonishing. Now, knowing as we do that the cylons are built slightly better to endure than their human counterparts, I wonder could the cylon blood also be blessed, shall we say blessed, with a heightened resistance to disease? Huh...so.I applied a sample of sharons fetal blood to some cancer cells I took from the President.
Adama What am I looking at?
Baltar Nothing. Thats the whole point. The cancer was gone and it was gone within a matter of hours.
Adama Are you saying you found a cure for the Presidents cancer?
Baltar Well, its untried. It-its obviously untried and therefore extremely dangerous. But, yes, its possible. If you abort Sharons fetus now, youll never know.
Baltar Now you may feel a sharp pain.
Helo Sharon, its okay, its gonna be all right.
Cottle I dont like what youre doing. I think its unnatural and damned dangerous.
Baltar Yes, well, given the patients current condition, I am not sure that I see the downside.
Cottle Maybe its just her time.
Baltar Then for once...perhaps I am the beacon of hope around here.
Roslin If you want to settle this, your people have to disengage. No more civil disobedience, no more acts of violence. I want our students back in school.
Stans Done. Im glad you called, Madame secretary.
Roslin Me too.
Caprica_Doctor_Flashback Im afraid the tests are positive. The mass is malignant.
Roslin Uhhhh.
Baltar Whats happening?
Cottle Move, move! Damn, shes convulsing. Nurse, get me 10 ccs. Nurse! Help me get her on her side.
Baltar Nurse, nurse!
Cottle No, hold it.
Cottle Ill be damned.
Baltar Madame President?
Roslin Dr. Baltar?
Baltar Its so very good to see you. No, no, dont--dont move. Dont move. Madame President, very good.
Adama Hows she doing, doctor?
Cottle Ive never seen anything like it. Itll be a while before shes a hundred percent, but...her scans are clear. Cancers gone.
Adama Are you sure?
Cottle Its gone.
Adama Thank you.
Cottle Thank you. Admiral.
Adama You seem better.
Roslin Much. Are you still holding the spokesman from the new faction in the brig?
Adama Yes.
Roslin Would you take me to him, please?
Adama Certainly.
Roslin Thank you.
Adama Ill wait for you to get dressed.
Jahee President Roslin.
Roslin Mr. Yahee, isnt it? I thought it was time we met. Would you open the door, please?
Adama Do it.
Roslin All these people want is to be heard. A member of your group nearly destroyed our tylium refiner. Before we can even begin to talk I need your personal assurance that there will be no more attacks.
Jahee As I told you the Admiral, I have had no direct contact--
roslin Genuine negotiations require trust. Do not lie to me.
Jahee Ill talk to my people. Make them understand.
Roslin Excellent. And Ill listen... maybe even act. But if you renege, Ill insist the Admiral hunt you and your friends down, without mercy.
#6 You seem very content.
Baltar Sharons child is safe. Adama and Roslin have agreed that more study is required before any drastic measures are taken.
#6 Yes, but by saving Roslin, youve denied yourself your rightful place of leadership. There are many aspects of you, Gaius, I will never understand.
Baltar You wouldnt. Neither, would I suspect, your corporeal counterpart.
#6 Do you love her?
#6 What is that?
Baltar The letter Roslin wrote me. To be opened upon the event of her death.
#6 President Baltar. I offer my sincere congratulations--
Baltar Thank you.
#6 I say that knowing weve had our differences and that you take office despite my many reservations. You may be the most  brilliant person Ive ever met, but your intelligence is unleavened by compassion. You must be reminded of your ethical  responsibilities and challenged to rise above your own selfish needs. I dont write this to hurt you, but to beg you to open your heart. Understand that the people in the fleet look to you not just for leadership, but for solace... justice. Find a way to give them that, and you will be a great leader. Laura Roslin.
Baltar After all Ive done for the fleet. After all Ive done for her.
#6 Roslins never trusted you. Shes undermined you at every turn, and now--
Baltar So now we know shes never gonna trust me.
#6 This is not a political struggle anymore, Gaius.This is quite literally life and death.
Jahee The President assured me that as long as there are no further acts of violence, shes willing to bring our concerns to the quorum and Admiral Adama.
Gina Shes trying to buy time. Shell never be open to negotiating with the cylons.
Jahee I disagree. I think weve made real progress today, and so does the Vice President.
Gina Baltar?
Jahee Yes. Just before I left, he asked to meet with me. He encouraged patience while he works with Roslin from within. And he offered the contents of this case as proof of his sincerity.
Gina Whats in it?
Jahee I dont know. He said that you should be the one to open it.
Gina Frak!
