dr_cottle Im afraid the tests are positive. The mass is malignant. Its advanced well beyond the left breast. Im afraid the test is positive. Ms. Roslin... the surgery, of course, to remove the mass...
naylin_stans Secretary Roslin?
president_laura_roslin Yes?
naylin_stans Naylin Stans from the education alliance. You said you wanted to talk?
president_laura_roslin Yes. Im sorry, Mr. Stans...
naylin_stans I have to admit, I was surprised to get your message.
president_laura_roslin The President was surprised I sent it.
naylin_stans Once our chief negotiator got a billy club to the head, we figured Adars government had written us off as a lost cause.
president_laura_roslin I was a teacher long before I was secretary of education, and causes are only lost when we give up.
dr_cottle Madame President? Can you hear me? Lets make her as comfortable as we can.
president_laura_roslin Oh, gods...
captain_kara_thrace Starbuck zero four niner-- cap is away.
officer_anastasia_dualla Galactica, roger that. Zero four niner. Safe flight.
louanne_katraine Safe and 20 frakkin minutes late. Did you have a rough night, starbuck?
captain_kara_thrace Youre way out of line. Just follow my lead and save the attitude for someone who cares.
louanne_katraine Kat six seven zero-- roger that. Request permission to clear guns.
captain_kara_thrace Roger that, Kat. Clear your throat.
captain_kara_thrace Damn it!
louanne_katraine Weapons malfunction! Weapons malfunction! Galactica!
captain_kara_thrace Kat, you good?
louanne_katraine Im good, Im good. What the hell just happened?
captain_kara_thrace Your wing guns out. Just keep it steady, were going home. Galactica, this is Starbuck. Im declaring an emergency. Weve got two bent birds. Requesting priority clearance to land.
Kelly#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode13 Starbuck, Galactica. Flight deck is yours.
captain_kara_thrace Why dont you just shoot us in the locker room, chief? Save the wear and tear on the ships.
chief_galen_tyrol Kats guns are clean, I checked em myself.
captain_kara_thrace Yeah, well I dont believe in accidents.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Chief. Somethings not right.
chief_galen_tyrol The weights off, its too light.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson I found three more just like it. Mixed in with the regular rounds.
chief_galen_tyrol Casings been weakened. Falls apart in the barrel. Next one hits it-- bang, shes lucky she didnt lose her whole wing. one bad rounds a fluke. More than one, sabotage. Pull em all!
Deckhand#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode13 Alright you heard the cheif, lets pull em all! Go!
admiral_william_adama Hows the President doing, Doc?
dr_cottle Shes dying... and she knows it. I offered her a shot of morpha to ease the pain, but...she wouldnt hear of it.
president_laura_roslin Mr. President... the terrorists...
president_laura_roslin Mr. President, we should at least speak with the strikers before sending in the troops. Theyre teachers, not terrorists.
president_richard_adar Theyre acting like thugs. Theyre last demonstration put two policemen in the hospital. Six of them have chained themselves outside the hall of education. As far as Im concerned, theyre criminals.
president_laura_roslin Their pay is substandard, their schools are falling apart, and the strike action has been gaining momentum for months, and you know that. I dont understand why were not at least talking to them.
president_richard_adar One of the most interesting things about being president is that you dont have to explain yourself...to anyone. Youve already set a meeting with Stans, havent you?
president_laura_roslin Obviously, only if you approve, Mr. President.
dr_gaius_baltar Shes really not in a fit state to do anything... let alone conduct any government business.
president_laura_roslin Dont talk about me as if Im not here. Therell be plenty of time for that soon enough. Billy, could you--
dr_cottle Im no expert in genetics, but I can read a blood test. That cylon fetus is showing some very peculiar genetic abnormalities.
admiral_william_adama I havent seen any of this on your report, Doctor.
dr_gaius_baltar No, um. Well, as Dr. Cottle says, hes-- hes not an expert, and I am. Um, Ive been through the tests and I-I wouldnt say that there was anything conclusive.
dr_cottle Didnt say conclusive, just damned odd.
dr_gaius_baltar Right. Madame President. As you know, the Sharon Cylon is of considerable tactical value to the fleet.
president_laura_roslin Perhaps youve gotten too close to your subject, Doctor. This is difficult, so Im going to cut right to it. Allowing this thing to be born could have frightening consequences. For the security of this fleet, I believe the cylon pregnancy must be terminated before it is too late.
admiral_william_adama Madame President, Id like--
president_laura_roslin I thought you of all people would understand, Admiral.
dr_gaius_baltar Madame President. I dont understand, this makes no sense.
president_laura_roslin One of the interesting things about being president is you dont have to explain yourself to anyone. Thank you, gentlemen, Im-Im a little tired. Gentlemen.
dr_gaius_baltar I dont want to seem alarmist, um, but I am perturbed. I think that the, uh, the Presidents illness is affecting her judgment. Especially when it comes to the subject--
admiral_william_adama She seemed reasonably coherent to me.
dr_gaius_baltar Well, then Ill have to appeal to you on scientific grounds. Destroying this child would seriously impact my studies of the cylon sub-species.
admiral_william_adama The President made the call and Im backing her.
dr_gaius_baltar Look, with all due respect, the President made the call based on evidence presented by Dr. Cottle, and hes medicines--
admiral_william_adama Pull yourself together. Youre about to become President of the colonies. Youre going to be asked to make some very hard decisions. Act like you can handle it.
dr_gaius_baltar Gods-- uh... where have you been?
number_six Where have I been? I never left you, Gaius.
dr_gaius_baltar Oh, right, yeah, um. Yeah, metaphorically speaking. Its just that it was weeks ago, and I, uh...
number_six Im sure youve suffered mightily in my absence.
dr_gaius_baltar You know, jealousy is a really ugly emotion. What is this lingering controversy over my affair with your three-dimensional duplicate.
number_six Im not jealous, Im concerned.
dr_gaius_baltar Oh yeah, concerned, about what?
number_six Our child!
dr_gaius_baltar Oh--now youre concerned?
number_six Well, for your information, the President wants to kill it. once Roslins gone, youll be President. You can use your new authority to save our child.
dr_gaius_baltar Oh, like thats gonna-- did you see the way Adama looked at me? The contempt on his face? I will be the President, all right, but without the military support, I might as well be an anointed dog catcher.
number_six Yes, well, you have your own resources if youd use them. What, you dont know what I mean?
dr_gaius_baltar No, I dont know what you mean.
number_six The nuclear device. The one Adama provided for your research.
dr_gaius_baltar There is one way.
number_six I didnt want to have to ask you for this.
dr_gaius_baltar I didnt want to have to ask you for this.
number_six But what I really need--
dr_gaius_baltar But what I really need
number_six To complete the project... is a nuclear warhead.
dr_gaius_baltar Is a nuclear-- warhead.
dr_gaius_baltar Youre totally insane.
number_six Im trying to help you, you idiot. If Adama remains committed to the destruction of our child, it may be our only hope.
admiral_william_adama Theres no easy way to say this. Its about the cylon. The President has decided that her pregnancy will be terminated.
captain_karl_agathon What? Why?
admiral_william_adama Doc cottle discovered some anomalies in the fetal blood work.
captain_karl_agathon Isnt that expected?
admiral_william_adama Maybe. But the President believes that to allow the baby to come to full term constitutes an unacceptable risk to the fleet.
captain_karl_agathon I dont understand. Sharons only helped us since she came back from Caprica. She even turned on her own.
admiral_william_adama To save her life. Dont mistake the will the live for genuine conversion, Lieutenant. Shes still the enemy.
captain_karl_agathon Does she know?
admiral_william_adama Not yet.
captain_karl_agathon Then I should be the one to tell her. If thats all, sir.
admiral_william_adama Helo. I dont expect you to agree to the decision. But I need you to accept it.
captain_karl_agathon Were talking about my child, sir. Part of me. But I guess its easier to kill when you call it a cylon.
admiral_william_adama Dismissed.
colonel_saul_tigh So youre saying someones been tampering with our ammunition.
captain_kara_thrace Shells dont unload themselves.
colonel_saul_tigh Whats this I hear about you ordering both Galactica and Pegasus fighters to stand down?
cpt_lee_adama Price you pay for reinstating me as CAG, sir.
colonel_saul_tigh Maybe that was a mistake.
cpt_lee_adama Maybe I dont give a damn what you think, sir.
admiral_william_adama Take it easy, both of you.
cpt_lee_adama Fact is, weve been sharing stories between the ships. And nobody flies combat until our ammo supplies check out.
colonel_saul_tigh Leaving us defenseless if the cylons decide to pick a fight.
admiral_william_adama We were defenseless before this, we just didnt know about it. Lee, find out who did this.
cpt_lee_adama All right. Excuse me, Im looking for Asha Janik.
Worker#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode13 Asha, shes over there.
cpt_lee_adama Lets do this quietly. Asha Janik? Captain Adama.
asha_janik I have a message for your father. They may take me!
cpt_lee_adama Okay, stop her!
asha_janik But I am one of many! We have declared war against Galacticas armies of death! The cylons arent our true enemy! Its the military that refuses to negotiate! All we want is peace! Demand peace! Demand peace!
captain_kara_thrace So much for being discreet, huh?
admiral_william_adama We found these pamphlets in Janiks quarters. Some kind of a manifesto.
colonel_saul_tigh Demand peace from the cylons? Who the hell are these people?
dr_gaius_baltar Cylon sympathizers. Just had no idea they were this organized.
admiral_william_adama I want to know how she got aboard my ship.
cpt_lee_adama The hangar decks short-staffed. Weve been forced to import civilians to handle some of the grunt work. Apparently shes, um, shes a Picon, worked maintenance on the Greenleaf, no known criminal affiliations.
colonel_saul_tigh Huh, until now, now listen to this: Do not be afraid, we are not terrorists, but we will not sit back while Adamas war machine continues to press us into cruel and futile conflict. Gods damn it.
cpt_lee_adama Our demonstrations worked. News is already spreading across the fleet.
admiral_william_adama I know. We were contacted by a person claiming to speak for the subversives demanding a meeting on the Galactica.
colonel_saul_tigh Theyve got stones, Ill give them that.
admiral_william_adama Well, Ive agreed.
colonel_saul_tigh What?
admiral_william_adama Were not negotiating. I just want to know what were up against.
naylin_stans Madame secretary? Considering the stakes, you dont seem particularly engaged.
president_laura_roslin The stakes are what we decide to make them, Mr. Stans. If the President uses troops to enforce us back to work order, people will get hurt. Even die.
naylin_stans Some causes are worth dying for.
president_laura_roslin Not this one.
royan_jahee Admiral, I am Royan Jahee. You have a unique way of welcoming visitors to your ship.
colonel_saul_tigh Visitor, my ass. We shoot people like you for treason.
royan_jahee Colonel, Im only an interested party trying to prevent more bloodshed. I deplore what happened aboard your vipers.
admiral_william_adama How many sympathizers do we have aboard this fleet?
royan_jahee If youre trying to crush an organization, you can stop now. The people in this movement are following an idea, not a leader.
colonel_saul_tigh What the hell do they want?
royan_jahee Peace...with the cylon.
admiral_william_adama You want us to surrender? They attacked us.
royan_jahee Only after wed enslaved them! You call yourselves military men, strategists. Explain to me how our current course of attack and retreat leads to victory?
admiral_william_adama You can play innocent bystander, but I think you know more than youre telling us. Either way, youre a danger to this fleet.
royan_jahee Admiral, arresting me isnt going to stop any of this.
admiral_william_adama Maybe not. But its a start. Take him away.
cpt_lee_adama All right, get your rubber gloves on. This is everything from the Janik womans quarters. Somehow the Admiral thinks looking through this craps gonna tell us something new about their so-called movement.
captain_kara_thrace So, um...havent seen much of you since your space walk.
cpt_lee_adama Hold it, what is this?
captain_kara_thrace Whats a deckhand need with a portable library reader?
cpt_lee_adama The Daru Mozu. A tylium refinery. And janiks used to explosives. This is the CAG. Get me a tac team ready, right now.
lt_sharon_valerii I dont understand, why are they doing this now?
captain_karl_agathon I dont know. The Admiral said they found something in the babys blood. Somehow, President Roslin considers it a threat to the fleet.
lt_sharon_valerii It cant just be that. Ive done nothing but help them since Ive come here. Ive held back my anger. Ive tried to show them that cylons are not all the same. That were not all murderers.
captain_karl_agathon Deep down, I think theyre still afraid of you.
lt_sharon_valerii Yeah...afraid. They wanna be afraid of something? Yeah? Just let them come! Let em! Let them try to take my baby! Ahhh! Just let them try to take my baby!
captain_karl_agathon Sharon, stop!
lt_sharon_valerii Ahh!
captain_karl_agathon Sharon, please dont do this! Please!
lt_sharon_valerii Ahhh!
captain_karl_agathon Listen to me, listen to me! Listen to me.
lt_sharon_valerii Ahh!
cpt_lee_adama When we land, move fast. Were looking for explosive devices set near the Darus ftl drive.
marine Captain, Im getting something on the wireless I think its coming from the Daru Mozu.
Woman#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode13 None of us want to die, but the fighting must end. If my sacrifice sends a signal to the cylon that brings peace, then it was worth it. I do this for my children, and for the children that will follow them. Gods willing, demand peace, demand peace.
cpt_lee_adama Pull out, pull out! Pull out, pull out, pull out!
admiral_william_adama People are dead.
royan_jahee I grieve for them, Admiral. And I assure you, the tyliums ships just a taste of whats in store, unless someone starts listening!
admiral_william_adama You listen and you listen well. I dont care if I have to interrogate every civilian on board this fleet. This is gonna stop. Do you understand?
royan_jahee Yes.
billy_keikeya Mr. Vice President, President Roslin insisted on your taking the tour. Shed like the transition to go as smoothly as possible.
dr_gaius_baltar What are these?
billy_keikeya Cylon agent suspects, sir.
billy_keikeya That number means everything to her. Represents hope, thats our future.
dr_gaius_baltar Yes, yes.
billy_keikeya Being the President is, uh, a lot of responsibility. Its tradition for outgoing Presidents to leave a letter for their successor. Its usually opened on the first day of the new term, but the next few days are liable to prove...hectic, so...
dr_gaius_baltar Well, lets just pray that she gets better.
billy_keikeya Lets.
billy_keikeya Excuse me. Mr. Vice President?
dr_gaius_baltar Hello? Yes. Yes. I understand. Thank you.
dr_gaius_baltar I was told I might meet an old friend here.
number_six Its good to see you, Gaius.
dr_gaius_baltar So youve become a member of the peace movement?
number_six Well, despite what you may think, Ive always abhorred violence. Would you excuse us? Please.
dr_gaius_baltar Do they have any idea what you are?
number_six Of course not, even their dedication has limits.
dr_gaius_baltar I miss you. You look amazing. I cant believe-- how real you are.
number_six Whatre you doing?
dr_gaius_baltar I havent stopped thinking about you since the second I left the pegasus.
number_six No, no--
dr_gaius_baltar I cant get you out of my head.
number_six Dont--do this, not yet.
dr_gaius_baltar I cant help myself, I cant.
number_six Gaius.
dr_gaius_baltar Ahhh! Im sorry.
number_six No, Im-- Im sorry. Im just--Im not ready.
dr_gaius_baltar So, is there any reason in particular for inviting me around here?
number_six Because you saved me. Let me save you.
dr_gaius_baltar Oh, here we go again. What are you talking about?
number_six You must sense it. Gaius, the fleets crumbling. People are turning on each other. There are serious misgivings about the military. When youre President, you can use the office to turn them against Adama, paving the way for the cylons to save us.
dr_gaius_baltar I-I would love to be with you always, but--
number_six I know its hard, but its the only way.
dr_gaius_baltar No. No. I am not who you think I am. And I will not be responsible for the destruction of mankind.
dr_cottle If you would have caught it sooner, maybe we could have done more.
president_richard_adar Laura, come in. I didnt like the way we left things this morning.
president_laura_roslin Richard, I--
president_richard_adar I know. Youve been thinking this is a mistake for a while now.
president_laura_roslin I just met with Stans. The education alliance is going to back off.
president_richard_adar Back off? Laura, what did you give them?
president_laura_roslin I made them a promise that we would seriously hear out their grievances, Richard. I thought youd be happy theyre going back to work.
president_richard_adar Laura, youve put me in a very awkward position.
president_laura_roslin I dont see how. Both sides gave ground.
president_richard_adar Its not just about your teachers. Its the next strike im worried about. You just showed them that if they hold out long enough, this administration will cave.
president_laura_roslin You expected me to fail.
president_richard_adar I expected you to hold the line. This doesnt have to be the end of the world. You can stay on in an advisory capacity. Gods know we need your ideas.
president_laura_roslin Youre asking me to resign?
president_richard_adar I dont have any choice. This isnt about you and me anymore.
president_laura_roslin Youre right, its not. You were willing to attack those people and up until a few hours ago, I was prepared to let you. I am on my way to the Galactica to represent this administration. When I return, if you still want my job, be prepared to fight. When I return...
dr_cottle Notify the Admiral.
admiral_william_adama This is Admiral Adama. As you know, President Roslin has been aboard Galactica for the last few days. Shes a fighter. But as of this moment, her prognosis is grave. I know that many of you believe in the power of prayer. If that is your way, then I urge you to pray for our President. As for the others, I hope you will join me in keeping her in our thoughts.
captain_karl_agathon Admiral, please dont do this.
admiral_william_adama Stand down, everyone. Give me room. Think about what youre doing Helo. Youre a soldier.
captain_karl_agathon Im a father, like you. Please, sir...give me a raptor, let me take her off the ship. Ill get her away from the fleet.
admiral_william_adama I cant do that, son.
captain_karl_agathon Admiral, Admiral!
admiral_william_adama Doctor, get the hell outta here.
dr_gaius_baltar Admiral, I must talk to you concerning the cylon child. It seems I may have been...wrong. Very wrong. When I said that Dr. Cottle misinterpreted the fetal blood work--
dr_gaius_baltar See, I had another look at those samples and I discovered something quite intriguing. Understand, cylon blood is virtually impossible to differentiate from our own. That being said, obviously it has to be slightly different because the cylon is not human, um... if, um... if our blood looks like this... for example. And the cylons blood looks like this... then its fair to assume that the cylon human is carrying an amalgam.
admiral_william_adama Is this a theory or fact?
dr_gaius_baltar The cylons fetus contains no antigens. It has no blood type. Thats what Dr. Cottle was talking about when he said it was damned odd. Except its not damned odd, its astonishing. Now, knowing as we do that the cylons are built slightly better to endure than their human counterparts, I wonder could the cylon blood also be blessed, shall we say blessed, with a heightened resistance to disease? Huh...so.I applied a sample of sharons fetal blood to some cancer cells I took from the President.
admiral_william_adama What am I looking at?
dr_gaius_baltar Nothing. Thats the whole point. The cancer was gone and it was gone within a matter of hours.
admiral_william_adama Are you saying you found a cure for the Presidents cancer?
dr_gaius_baltar Well, its untried. It-its obviously untried and therefore extremely dangerous. But, yes, its possible. If you abort Sharons fetus now, youll never know.
dr_gaius_baltar Now you may feel a sharp pain.
captain_karl_agathon Sharon, its okay, its gonna be all right.
dr_cottle I dont like what youre doing. I think its unnatural and damned dangerous.
dr_gaius_baltar Yes, well, given the patients current condition, I am not sure that I see the downside.
dr_cottle Maybe its just her time.
dr_gaius_baltar Then for once...perhaps I am the beacon of hope around here.
president_laura_roslin If you want to settle this, your people have to disengage. No more civil disobedience, no more acts of violence. I want our students back in school.
naylin_stans Done. Im glad you called, Madame secretary.
president_laura_roslin Me too.
dr_cottle Im afraid the tests are positive. The mass is malignant.
president_laura_roslin Uhhhh.
dr_gaius_baltar Whats happening?
dr_cottle Move, move! Damn, shes convulsing. Nurse, get me 10 ccs. Nurse! Help me get her on her side.
dr_gaius_baltar Nurse, nurse!
dr_cottle No, hold it.
dr_cottle Ill be damned.
dr_gaius_baltar Madame President?
president_laura_roslin Dr. Baltar?
dr_gaius_baltar Its so very good to see you. No, no, dont--dont move. Dont move. Madame President, very good.
admiral_william_adama Hows she doing, doctor?
dr_cottle Ive never seen anything like it. Itll be a while before shes a hundred percent, but...her scans are clear. Cancers gone.
admiral_william_adama Are you sure?
dr_cottle Its gone.
admiral_william_adama Thank you.
dr_cottle Thank you. Admiral.
admiral_william_adama You seem better.
president_laura_roslin Much. Are you still holding the spokesman from the new faction in the brig?
admiral_william_adama Yes.
president_laura_roslin Would you take me to him, please?
admiral_william_adama Certainly.
president_laura_roslin Thank you.
admiral_william_adama Ill wait for you to get dressed.
royan_jahee President Roslin.
president_laura_roslin Mr. Yahee, isnt it? I thought it was time we met. Would you open the door, please?
admiral_william_adama Do it.
president_laura_roslin All these people want is to be heard. A member of your group nearly destroyed our tylium refiner. Before we can even begin to talk I need your personal assurance that there will be no more attacks.
royan_jahee As I told you the Admiral, I have had no direct contact--
president_laura_roslin Genuine negotiations require trust. Do not lie to me.
royan_jahee Ill talk to my people. Make them understand.
president_laura_roslin Excellent. And Ill listen... maybe even act. But if you renege, Ill insist the Admiral hunt you and your friends down, without mercy.
number_six You seem very content.
dr_gaius_baltar Sharons child is safe. Adama and Roslin have agreed that more study is required before any drastic measures are taken.
number_six Yes, but by saving Roslin, youve denied yourself your rightful place of leadership. There are many aspects of you, Gaius, I will never understand.
dr_gaius_baltar You wouldnt. Neither, would I suspect, your corporeal counterpart.
number_six Do you love her?
number_six What is that?
dr_gaius_baltar The letter Roslin wrote me. To be opened upon the event of her death.
number_six President Baltar. I offer my sincere congratulations--
dr_gaius_baltar Thank you.
number_six I say that knowing weve had our differences and that you take office despite my many reservations. You may be the most brilliant person Ive ever met, but your intelligence is unleavened by compassion. You must be reminded of your ethical responsibilities and challenged to rise above your own selfish needs. I dont write this to hurt you, but to beg you to open your heart. Understand that the people in the fleet look to you not just for leadership, but for solace... justice. Find a way to give them that, and you will be a great leader. Laura Roslin.
dr_gaius_baltar After all Ive done for the fleet. After all Ive done for her.
number_six Roslins never trusted you. Shes undermined you at every turn, and now--
dr_gaius_baltar So now we know shes never gonna trust me.
number_six This is not a political struggle anymore, Gaius.This is quite literally life and death.
royan_jahee The President assured me that as long as there are no further acts of violence, shes willing to bring our concerns to the quorum and Admiral Adama.
number_six Shes trying to buy time. Shell never be open to negotiating with the cylons.
royan_jahee I disagree. I think weve made real progress today, and so does the Vice President.
number_six Baltar?
royan_jahee Yes. Just before I left, he asked to meet with me. He encouraged patience while he works with Roslin from within. And he offered the contents of this case as proof of his sincerity.
number_six Whats in it?
royan_jahee I dont know. He said that you should be the one to open it.
number_six Frak!
