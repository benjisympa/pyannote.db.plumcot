Phelan Youre not going to shoot. Youre not like me.
Apollo Hey, hey. Hey, dont go.
Shevan Sorry. I though you were still asleep.
Apollo You should have kicked me out of bed an hour ago. If I hold up Galacticas raptor, Tighll have my ass.
Shevan Which me both know currently belongs to me.
Roslin All right, lets move on to the the next item--  Oh, no, gentlemen. Please, dont get up. After the last few weeks, it just feels good to be on my feet, thank you though.
Fisk Youve made a remarkable recovery, Madame President.
Roslin Remarkable, indeed. But, now Im playing catch-up, and Im afraid during my illness I lost focus. I let some things slide.
Adama Thats behind us now.
Roslin Yes, it is. To the point-- supplies are running low and the people are worried.
Fisk Well, they wouldnt be civilians if they didnt have something to bitch about.
Roslin Well, I think that in this case, theyre entitled. Our inventory levels are tight, but theyre not critical. But all the way across the fleet, people are reporting shortages of essential goods and what they do get comes at a high price.
Adama Theyre turning to the black market.
Roslin Last week, one of my aides came down with pneumonia. Billy had to trade liquor to get the antibiotics.
Fisk Its the nature of the beast. People want what they want.
Roslin A few trades would be one thing, Commander Fisk, thats reality. But, Im talking about criminals making outrageous demands on the people, so bottom line is, Im implementing a new fleet-wide trade policy. We need to be in control of our supply chain, not black market thugs. I am hoping that I can have the militarys support on this.
Fisk Admiral. If you want Pegasus to run these dogs down, you just give us the word.
Adama Our people will do whatever it takes to get this under control. And its good to have you back, Madame President.
Roslin Its good to be back, thank you, Admiral. Gentlemen, thank you.
Fisk Is madame President always so right in your face?
Baltar Her last-minute resurrection seems to have invigorated her somewhat.
Fisk Yeah, well, maybe too much. She doesnt really think her made-up plans and regulations are going to change anything, does she?
Baltar As if we dont have enough to do. Hmm. No, madame President sets a great prestige by her office and Adama supports her, at least for the moment.
Fisk Well then, so do I, just for the moment. By the way, did you get the cigars I sent over?
Baltar I not only got them, I enjoyed them, as well.
Fisk Oh, my pleasure, Mr. Vice President. Well, Ive got a ship to run. Look forward to our next visit.
Baltar As do I.
Shevon I got them from a friend.
Apollo Paya!
Shevon Hey, sweetie.
Apollo Wow, you seem to get an inch taller every time I see you. What, I dont get my handshake? Well, its okay Paya. I have a special surprise for you. And its in here. You wanna come see?
Shevon Whats he got?
Apollo Come on. What have we got?
Paya Gasps
Shevon Oh, Paya!
Apollo Ive never been great with kids. Maybe next time Ill get one with, uh, two eyes.
Shevon Laughing
Apollo See if I can trade her for something else.
Shevon No, its okay. You just surprised her.
Apollo Well. Well, um. Look, Im not sure when ill be able to make it back.
Shevon I know. Oh. Um. Im gonna have to ask for an extra hundred since you spent the night.
Fisk Hmm. Well, I wondered when you were going to show up.
Kelly Raptor one-two-niner. You are cleared into the break.
Racetrack Galactica, raptor one-two-niner has the ball. Inbound speed two-two-zero.
Cottle Admiral, Colonel, Im just getting started, but from the looks of him, Id say he was garroted.
Tigh Gods. This is the last thing we needed.
Cottle Admiral, you might want to take a look at this. Looks like our friend, Fisk, hit the jackpot.
Tigh Cubit?
Adama Find anything else, let me know right away.
Cottle If I find anything else, I may retire early.
Adama Someones sending us a message.
Tigh Or running us in circles. Maybe theres another cylon in the fleet.
Adama I almost prefer that to the alternative. We start killing our own, all they have to do is sit back and watch.
Apollo Fisk. Do we have any idea who did it?
Adama No. But we will do a full investigation and I want you to lead it.
Apollo Dont you think it would be better if someone from Pegasus dealt with this?
Adama Even though Cains gone, her influence lingers. I need someone I can trust.
Apollo You know, there were times when that was in short supply between us.
Adama Weve both been through an awful lot, son. And I hope that weve grown stronger for it. I need your help.
Apollo Ill call up a flight to Pegasus right away.
Apollo Anyone else been inside?
Marine Just the medical team, sir.
Marine No ones allowed in.
Baltar What? Do you know who I am? I am the vice President of the colonies, let me in! Captain Adama. Commander Fisk didnt tell me  you were invited.
Apollo Let him in.
Baltar They were going to let me in. Oh, my gods! Whats going on in here? Wheres Fisk?
Apollo On a slab in Galacticas morgue.
Baltar What, hes dead?
Apollo Isnt this your brand?
#6 Careful, Gaius. Youve bought yourself some good will by saving Roslin. But its fading. Their old suspicions are re-emerging.
Baltar What are you doing here? Captain.
Apollo I was about to ask you the same thing.
Baltar Wait a minute. Are you interrogating me? Im not sure I appreciate your tone.
Apollo This isnt a diplomatic exercise. A man was butchered. His head was practically severed from his body with piano wire.
#6 Youre Vice President of the fleet. Why are you acting like a child with your hand in the cookie jar, hmm? Wonder what she would say if she saw you like this.
Baltar You know I cant believe its even necessary for me to explain myself to you. But obviously, no, I had nothing to do with Commander Fisks death. For the record, I just came here to discuss President Roslins new trade policy.
Apollo Oh, I-I thought that was settled.
Baltar No, uh, Commander Fisk had some reservations.
Apollo Ill bet.
Baltar And as the vice President, I decided to assuage his doubts. Of my own free will. Is that sufficient? Or would you like me to provide you with an alibi? Im sure I can rustle one up.
Apollo Enjoy the cigars. Escort the vice President to his ship.
Tigh The wireless is going crazy. Word of Fisks murder has spread out through the entire fleet.
Adama When we lose a command officer aboard a warship people are going to be concerned about their security.
Tgh Crew can fall apart when their Commander is killed. Pegasus lost two in a matter of weeks.
Apollo Maybe, this time, they were lucky. His personal log shows that he was rerouting supply runs, on- and off-loading freighters without command authorization. He raided the McConnell, and at least a dozen other ships in the last week. I also found a small warehouse of high value merchandise in his quarters.
Adama He was working the black market.
Apollo Well, half the fleets working it. Fisk was getting greedy.
Adama If he crossed one of his suppliers on a deal, that would explain the cubits that Cottle found.
Tigh Still doesnt tell us who did it.
Adama Well, hes going to need trading partners.
Apollo And they wouldnt be hard to find, even on Galactica.
Shevon Lee. Im scared. Payas cough keeps getting worse.
Apollo Ill bring her something on my next trip.
Shevon Which could be weeks if theres another cylon attack. I keep hearing about shortages on the other ships. People trading anything they can for food and for medicine.
Apollo Really?
Shevon Have you seen all the new working girls outside? Lee, when your babys crying because its hungry, youll do anything to make it stop.
Apollo Hey. Come here.
Paya Mommy.
Tigh Captain. What do you want?
Apollo Is your wife around, Colonel?
Tigh No. Why?
Apollo Is this hers?
Tigh Oh, yeah. She lost it a couple weeks ago. Where the hell did you find it?
Apollo On Pegasus.
Tigh Hmm.
Apollo In Commander Fisks quarters.
Paya Coughing
Shevon Shes burning up.
Apollo What did they say at the infirmary?
Shevon Antibiotics have all been rationed out. They said they might have something by the end of the week.
Paya Coughing
Apollo We got shortages across the fleet. People begging for scraps. Somehow, you and Mrs. Tigh have fresh fruit, real liquor--
Tigh All right, what the hell is this about?
Apollo You must have known she was trading with Fisk. Or maybe Ill talk to her.
Tigh She didnt give it to Fisk, I did. I traded it for a few necessities, a couple of things to help her get by, big frakkin deal. Theres nothing illegal about that.
Apollo Not yet.
Tigh Dont you play holier than thou with me. I havent done anything that most people on this ship havent done. Including you.
Apollo Doesnt make us right, Colonel, just a whole lot of people wrong.
Dualla You didnt make it to class today.
Apollo Yeah, I been pretty jammed up. Anyway, Im not sure you need me holding your hand anymore.
Dualla Is that what you were doing? Holding my hand?
Apollo I meant it as a compliment.
Dualla Permission to speak frankly, sir?
Apollo You dont need my permission and you dont need the sir.
Dualla Maybe thats the problem. I dont really know what to think anymore. So, Ill just ask. Is this going somewhere?
Apollo Dee--
Dualla Please dont pretend like you dont know what Im talking about. You know our time together, our workouts. Somethings changed between us.
Apollo Im just not sure what you want me to say.
Dualla Then dont say anything.
Petty_Officer Communications paging captain Adama. You have a priority ship-to-ship call, Cloud Nine.
Apollo Captain Adama here.
Cloud_Nine L259
Apollo Shevon. Shevon, its me.
Paya Crying
Apollo Shevon!
Paya Mommy!
Apollo Oh, my gods! What did they do?
Shevon They said they knew about you and me. They wanted to know what wed been talking about. I dont understand why theyd care.
Apollo All right, get what you need. Im taking you and Paya back to Galactica.
Shevon Lee, wait.
Apollo Its the only place I can keep you safe.
Shevon What are you going to tell them about us?
Apollo Im not fooling myself. I know what this is.
Shevon Lee!
Shevon Get away from us! Ahh!
Phelan You listening? I hear any more talk about Fisk, Im going send your whore back to you piece...by piece. And then Im going start with the little girl. I know who you are. I know whose son you are. And I dont care. You tell Adama to let it go.
Shevon Is that when you knew that you loved her?
Apollo I thought so.
Shevon But you hurt her.
Apollo Yes.
Apollo Ohh. This is captain Adama. I need a medic and a security team on L deck, asap.
Baltar You wanted to see me, Madame President?
Roslin Yes. Thank you for coming, doctor. Have a seat. Would you like some tea?
Baltar Id love one.
Roslin You know, Im never quite sure where we stand with each other, doctor. Why do you think that is?
Baltar I cant imagine why. Ive never had anything but the utmost respect for you, and your office.
Roslin I understand that you and Commander Fisk planned to meet just prior to his death.
Baltar Um. As I have already explained to Captain Adama, Commander Fisk had several lingering concerns about your new trade policy. What can I say?
Roslin And thats it?
#6 Gaius, shes afraid of you.
Baltar Why-- are you asking me this?
Roslin You saved my life. And Im grateful. But I sense that there is some unease in you about assuming the presidency, and Id like to offer you an out.
Baltar You what?
Roslin Resign. Return to your scientific work on Galactica. No one will question your motives. You can consider it a second chance,like the one you gave me.
Baltar Charming.
Roslin Doctor. This is a one-time offer. I suggest you reconsider.
Baltar You know, Madame President, Ive never been particularly interested in politics. I never wanted any lofty position of power. I never wanted to be the Vice President. That is, until this very moment. Because right now, I cant think of anything I want more.
Security One to the head. You didnt do this?
Apollo I was attacked. Found him there when I woke up.
Security Security bulletin said Commander Fisk was garroted with a wire. Whatever happened, looks like you found your guy.
Apollo What about Shevon... and her daughter.
Security Cloud Nines an open port. Chances are, theyre already off ship. Ill get a team down here. Councilman Zarek.
Zarek Lee. I just heard, are you all right?
Apollo What are you doing here?
Zarek Attending a Quorum meeting. Nothing as exciting as all this. I assure you. I know these places are legal. But still, the son of the almighty Adama--
Apollo Talk to me about the black market.
Zarek Not much to say. Its widespread, inevitable, and according to President Roslin...illegal.
Apollo So, its no surprise that you and Fisk were in it up to your necks.
Zarek Fisk, maybe, but not me. I represent Astral Queen. I have to be careful about the company I keep.
Apollo This is Fisks log. He says, he made three runs to astral queen in the last ten days, and I doubt it was to discuss prison reform.
Zarek What do you want from me, Captain?
Apollo Names of ships. Contacts.
Zarek I cant help you. Why do you think Fisk approached me?
Apollo To get a piece of your black market scam. To offer you protection.
Zarek You and your father are so blinded by the past. Fisks black market was up and running when he approached me. He knew Adama would pick up on his unauthorized shuttles, so he tried to force me into taking over the deliveries, creating a firewall between Pegasus and the illegal shipments.
Apollo So, youre trying to tell me that you turned him down.
Zarek At great cost. Check the fleet logs. See how many supply ships made stops at the astral queen after last Fisks trip. The answer is none.
Apollo So, if Fisk was trying to starve you out, why didnt you bring it to the quorum?
Zarek Roslins acting like the black markets some sort of aberration, but I thought you were smarter than that. Did you really expect some utopian fantasy to rise from the ashes? I heard the security officer. They gave you Fisks killer for a reason. Theyre offering you a way out.
Apollo You know something, dont you?
Zarek Just rumors. Theres a freighter, Prometheus. Some people say its gone off the grid. But if you want something bad enough, thats where you go. The deals are brokered by an ex-military mercenary named Phelan. Lee. I hope shes worth it.
Apollo Oh, Paya. Paya! Paya, hey. Paya. Its okay, its Lee. You remember, its Lee. All right, youre going to be fine. I promise you. Okay, you just hang Tight. Ill be right back. Ill be right back.
Apollo Is she dead?
Phelan I can see why you want her back, shes one of my best.
Apollo One of yours.
Phelan A good escort understands its about a lot more than sex. She knows when to listen and when to call for help.
Shevan Lee, I had to.
Phelan Dont blame her. The only reason youre alive is because I was able to see you through Shevons eyes. And what I saw seemed reasonable. Like Fisk. Fisk was a pig. He tried to force us to renegotiate.
Apollo So you killed him.
Phelan No. I gave you the killer. The murder weapon, the prints. Everything you needed to close the case legitimately. Despite the Presidents objections, the fleet needs us. Rationings too tight, ship comes in too late, were the pressure valve, we provide. When Shevon needed antibiotics, she knew where to go. Without us, people would have nowhere to turn. The fleet would tear itself apart.
Apollo And what about those children outside? How are they helping the fleet?
Phelan Everyone has needs. Some settle for cigars or liquor. You wanted shevon. Others are more demanding. Its hard to find the moral high ground when were all standing in the mud. Im not not like my old man, Captain, and you are not like yours.
Apollo I came alone. But, Galactica tracked me on dradis. All theyll need to vent this ship into space is an excuse. So, lets make a deal. I want Shevon, the girl. I walk out of here, and you shut down this operation. And all of you will live.
Phelan Sorry, the little girls been paid for. No refunds.
Shevon Oh, gods! No!
Phelan Wait.
Shevon Lee, dont.
Apollo Come on, do it. Do it.
Phelan I made you a fair offer.
Apollo So did I. Yeah, youre probably right about everything. You, me, Fisk. Nobody can stop it, and maybe nobody should. But it needs limits. Theres lines you cant cross. And you crossed them.
Phelan Youre not gonna shoot. Youre not like me. Youre not gonna-- Uh-- uhhh.
Apollo All right, its done. Fleet relies on the black market. Much as wed like, we cant wish that away. So, youre still in  business. For now. But if they are any more killings, if you hold back essential medicines, if you ever touch a child...
Apollo Shevon.
Shevon No, I dont want to see--
Apollo Hey, hey. Its over, its okay, everythings gonna be okay.
Shevon Lee, Lee, let go.
Apollo Shevon, its over.
Shevon Stop! I cant be what you want me to be.
Apollo I dont want you to be anything.
Shevon You want me to be her. Thats what this is about. Thats what this has always been about.
Apollo No...thats not what this has ever been about.
Shevon Come on, Lee. I know my job. Im a replacement.
Apollo Hey.
Shevon For a lot of things. Things that men cant get anywhere else. Things theyve lost. She wanted to give you a child. But you were afraid, so you pushed her away and then you ran. And you didnt stop running until it was too late. Well, Im not her! And Paya is not, and will never be, your child.
Apollo Commander Fisks murder has been resolved, and Pegasus crew appears to have accepted Galacticas conclusions. Thats all, Madame President.
Roslin Not quite. What about the ship, Prometheus? I understand its the hub of the fleets black market.
Apollo We will keep an eye on them.
Roslin Keep an eye on em? Its not exactly the solution I had in mind. Whether or not we allow a criminal enterprise to thrive in this fleet is not a matter of choice, Captain. Admiral?
Adama Ive given Lee full authority on this issue. The decision is his.
Apollo I support your trade policies wholeheartedly madame President. But, we are never going to have a perfect system. There will always be some kind of black market. At least this way, I know names, I know faces, I know where they are, and we will monitor the situation.
Roslin Thank you, gentlemen, Im busy.
Billy 18, Im starting to sweat here. 19
Dualla You should be sweating.
Billy 20
Dualla Why arent you doing any of these?
Billy No talking, no talking. No cheating, all the way up, a little higher.
Dualla Oh. Oh! Sneaky.
Billy 8, 9, uh-- start again.
Dualla You lost track.
Billy Zero-- oh...no?
Apollo President wasnt very happy today.
Adama No. Ever since you ejected from the blackbird, youve been different. Harder to reach. Im just trying to understand.
Apollo Well, like you said, dad. Weve all been through a lot.
Adama Fair enough. But you should have told me about the woman.
