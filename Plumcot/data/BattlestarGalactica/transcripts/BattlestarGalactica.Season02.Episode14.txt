phelan Youre not going to shoot. Youre not like me.
cpt_lee_adama Hey, hey. Hey, dont go.
shevon Sorry. I though you were still asleep.
cpt_lee_adama You should have kicked me out of bed an hour ago. If I hold up Galacticas raptor, Tighll have my ass.
shevon Which me both know currently belongs to me.
president_laura_roslin All right, lets move on to the the next item-- Oh, no, gentlemen. Please, dont get up. After the last few weeks, it just feels good to be on my feet, thank you though.
colonel_jack_fisk Youve made a remarkable recovery, Madame President.
president_laura_roslin Remarkable, indeed. But, now Im playing catch-up, and Im afraid during my illness I lost focus. I let some things slide.
admiral_william_adama Thats behind us now.
president_laura_roslin Yes, it is. To the point-- supplies are running low and the people are worried.
colonel_jack_fisk Well, they wouldnt be civilians if they didnt have something to bitch about.
president_laura_roslin Well, I think that in this case, theyre entitled. Our inventory levels are tight, but theyre not critical. But all the way across the fleet, people are reporting shortages of essential goods and what they do get comes at a high price.
admiral_william_adama Theyre turning to the black market.
president_laura_roslin Last week, one of my aides came down with pneumonia. Billy had to trade liquor to get the antibiotics.
colonel_jack_fisk Its the nature of the beast. People want what they want.
president_laura_roslin A few trades would be one thing, Commander Fisk, thats reality. But, Im talking about criminals making outrageous demands on the people, so bottom line is, Im implementing a new fleet-wide trade policy. We need to be in control of our supply chain, not black market thugs. I am hoping that I can have the militarys support on this.
colonel_jack_fisk Admiral. If you want Pegasus to run these dogs down, you just give us the word.
admiral_william_adama Our people will do whatever it takes to get this under control. And its good to have you back, Madame President.
president_laura_roslin Its good to be back, thank you, Admiral. Gentlemen, thank you.
colonel_jack_fisk Is madame President always so right in your face?
dr_gaius_baltar Her last-minute resurrection seems to have invigorated her somewhat.
colonel_jack_fisk Yeah, well, maybe too much. She doesnt really think her made-up plans and regulations are going to change anything, does she?
dr_gaius_baltar As if we dont have enough to do. Hmm. No, madame President sets a great prestige by her office and Adama supports her, at least for the moment.
colonel_jack_fisk Well then, so do I, just for the moment. By the way, did you get the cigars I sent over?
dr_gaius_baltar I not only got them, I enjoyed them, as well.
colonel_jack_fisk Oh, my pleasure, Mr. Vice President. Well, Ive got a ship to run. Look forward to our next visit.
dr_gaius_baltar As do I.
shevon I got them from a friend.
cpt_lee_adama Paya!
shevon Hey, sweetie.
cpt_lee_adama Wow, you seem to get an inch taller every time I see you. What, I dont get my handshake? Well, its okay Paya. I have a special surprise for you. And its in here. You wanna come see?
shevon Whats he got?
cpt_lee_adama Come on. What have we got?
paya Gasps
shevon Oh, Paya!
cpt_lee_adama Ive never been great with kids. Maybe next time Ill get one with, uh, two eyes.
shevon Laughing
cpt_lee_adama See if I can trade her for something else.
shevon No, its okay. You just surprised her.
cpt_lee_adama Well. Well, um. Look, Im not sure when ill be able to make it back.
shevon I know. Oh. Um. Im gonna have to ask for an extra hundred since you spent the night.
colonel_jack_fisk Hmm. Well, I wondered when you were going to show up.
Kelly#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode14 Raptor one-two-niner. You are cleared into the break.
racetrack Galactica, raptor one-two-niner has the ball. Inbound speed two-two-zero.
dr_cottle Admiral, Colonel, Im just getting started, but from the looks of him, Id say he was garroted.
colonel_saul_tigh Gods. This is the last thing we needed.
dr_cottle Admiral, you might want to take a look at this. Looks like our friend, Fisk, hit the jackpot.
colonel_saul_tigh Cubit?
admiral_william_adama Find anything else, let me know right away.
dr_cottle If I find anything else, I may retire early.
admiral_william_adama Someones sending us a message.
colonel_saul_tigh Or running us in circles. Maybe theres another cylon in the fleet.
admiral_william_adama I almost prefer that to the alternative. We start killing our own, all they have to do is sit back and watch.
cpt_lee_adama Fisk. Do we have any idea who did it?
admiral_william_adama No. But we will do a full investigation and I want you to lead it.
cpt_lee_adama Dont you think it would be better if someone from Pegasus dealt with this?
admiral_william_adama Even though Cains gone, her influence lingers. I need someone I can trust.
cpt_lee_adama You know, there were times when that was in short supply between us.
admiral_william_adama Weve both been through an awful lot, son. And I hope that weve grown stronger for it. I need your help.
cpt_lee_adama Ill call up a flight to Pegasus right away.
cpt_lee_adama Anyone else been inside?
pegasus_marine Just the medical team, sir.
pegasus_marine No ones allowed in.
dr_gaius_baltar What? Do you know who I am? I am the vice President of the colonies, let me in! Captain Adama. Commander Fisk didnt tell me you were invited.
cpt_lee_adama Let him in.
dr_gaius_baltar They were going to let me in. Oh, my gods! Whats going on in here? Wheres Fisk?
cpt_lee_adama On a slab in Galacticas morgue.
dr_gaius_baltar What, hes dead?
cpt_lee_adama Isnt this your brand?
number_six Careful, Gaius. Youve bought yourself some good will by saving Roslin. But its fading. Their old suspicions are re-emerging.
dr_gaius_baltar What are you doing here? Captain.
cpt_lee_adama I was about to ask you the same thing.
dr_gaius_baltar Wait a minute. Are you interrogating me? Im not sure I appreciate your tone.
cpt_lee_adama This isnt a diplomatic exercise. A man was butchered. His head was practically severed from his body with piano wire.
number_six Youre Vice President of the fleet. Why are you acting like a child with your hand in the cookie jar, hmm? Wonder what she would say if she saw you like this.
dr_gaius_baltar You know I cant believe its even necessary for me to explain myself to you. But obviously, no, I had nothing to do with Commander Fisks death. For the record, I just came here to discuss President Roslins new trade policy.
cpt_lee_adama Oh, I-I thought that was settled.
dr_gaius_baltar No, uh, Commander Fisk had some reservations.
cpt_lee_adama Ill bet.
dr_gaius_baltar And as the vice President, I decided to assuage his doubts. Of my own free will. Is that sufficient? Or would you like me to provide you with an alibi? Im sure I can rustle one up.
cpt_lee_adama Enjoy the cigars. Escort the vice President to his ship.
colonel_saul_tigh The wireless is going crazy. Word of Fisks murder has spread out through the entire fleet.
admiral_william_adama When we lose a command officer aboard a warship people are going to be concerned about their security.
Tgh#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode14 Crew can fall apart when their Commander is killed. Pegasus lost two in a matter of weeks.
cpt_lee_adama Maybe, this time, they were lucky. His personal log shows that he was rerouting supply runs, on- and off-loading freighters without command authorization. He raided the McConnell, and at least a dozen other ships in the last week. I also found a small warehouse of high value merchandise in his quarters.
admiral_william_adama He was working the black market.
cpt_lee_adama Well, half the fleets working it. Fisk was getting greedy.
admiral_william_adama If he crossed one of his suppliers on a deal, that would explain the cubits that Cottle found.
colonel_saul_tigh Still doesnt tell us who did it.
admiral_william_adama Well, hes going to need trading partners.
cpt_lee_adama And they wouldnt be hard to find, even on Galactica.
shevon Lee. Im scared. Payas cough keeps getting worse.
cpt_lee_adama Ill bring her something on my next trip.
shevon Which could be weeks if theres another cylon attack. I keep hearing about shortages on the other ships. People trading anything they can for food and for medicine.
cpt_lee_adama Really?
shevon Have you seen all the new working girls outside? Lee, when your babys crying because its hungry, youll do anything to make it stop.
cpt_lee_adama Hey. Come here.
paya Mommy.
colonel_saul_tigh Captain. What do you want?
cpt_lee_adama Is your wife around, Colonel?
colonel_saul_tigh No. Why?
cpt_lee_adama Is this hers?
colonel_saul_tigh Oh, yeah. She lost it a couple weeks ago. Where the hell did you find it?
cpt_lee_adama On Pegasus.
colonel_saul_tigh Hmm.
cpt_lee_adama In Commander Fisks quarters.
paya Coughing
shevon Shes burning up.
cpt_lee_adama What did they say at the infirmary?
shevon Antibiotics have all been rationed out. They said they might have something by the end of the week.
paya Coughing
cpt_lee_adama We got shortages across the fleet. People begging for scraps. Somehow, you and Mrs. Tigh have fresh fruit, real liquor--
colonel_saul_tigh All right, what the hell is this about?
cpt_lee_adama You must have known she was trading with Fisk. Or maybe Ill talk to her.
colonel_saul_tigh She didnt give it to Fisk, I did. I traded it for a few necessities, a couple of things to help her get by, big frakkin deal. Theres nothing illegal about that.
cpt_lee_adama Not yet.
colonel_saul_tigh Dont you play holier than thou with me. I havent done anything that most people on this ship havent done. Including you.
cpt_lee_adama Doesnt make us right, Colonel, just a whole lot of people wrong.
officer_anastasia_dualla You didnt make it to class today.
cpt_lee_adama Yeah, I been pretty jammed up. Anyway, Im not sure you need me holding your hand anymore.
officer_anastasia_dualla Is that what you were doing? Holding my hand?
cpt_lee_adama I meant it as a compliment.
officer_anastasia_dualla Permission to speak frankly, sir?
cpt_lee_adama You dont need my permission and you dont need the sir.
officer_anastasia_dualla Maybe thats the problem. I dont really know what to think anymore. So, Ill just ask. Is this going somewhere?
cpt_lee_adama Dee--
officer_anastasia_dualla Please dont pretend like you dont know what Im talking about. You know our time together, our workouts. Somethings changed between us.
cpt_lee_adama Im just not sure what you want me to say.
officer_anastasia_dualla Then dont say anything.
Petty_Officer#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode14 Communications paging captain Adama. You have a priority ship-to-ship call, Cloud Nine.
cpt_lee_adama Captain Adama here.
Cloud_Nine#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode14 L259
cpt_lee_adama Shevon. Shevon, its me.
paya Crying
cpt_lee_adama Shevon!
paya Mommy!
cpt_lee_adama Oh, my gods! What did they do?
shevon They said they knew about you and me. They wanted to know what wed been talking about. I dont understand why theyd care.
cpt_lee_adama All right, get what you need. Im taking you and Paya back to Galactica.
shevon Lee, wait.
cpt_lee_adama Its the only place I can keep you safe.
shevon What are you going to tell them about us?
cpt_lee_adama Im not fooling myself. I know what this is.
shevon Lee!
shevon Get away from us! Ahh!
phelan You listening? I hear any more talk about Fisk, Im going send your whore back to you piece...by piece. And then Im going start with the little girl. I know who you are. I know whose son you are. And I dont care. You tell Adama to let it go.
shevon Is that when you knew that you loved her?
cpt_lee_adama I thought so.
shevon But you hurt her.
cpt_lee_adama Yes.
cpt_lee_adama Ohh. This is captain Adama. I need a medic and a security team on L deck, asap.
dr_gaius_baltar You wanted to see me, Madame President?
president_laura_roslin Yes. Thank you for coming, doctor. Have a seat. Would you like some tea?
dr_gaius_baltar Id love one.
president_laura_roslin You know, Im never quite sure where we stand with each other, doctor. Why do you think that is?
dr_gaius_baltar I cant imagine why. Ive never had anything but the utmost respect for you, and your office.
president_laura_roslin I understand that you and Commander Fisk planned to meet just prior to his death.
dr_gaius_baltar Um. As I have already explained to Captain Adama, Commander Fisk had several lingering concerns about your new trade policy. What can I say?
president_laura_roslin And thats it?
number_six Gaius, shes afraid of you.
dr_gaius_baltar Why-- are you asking me this?
president_laura_roslin You saved my life. And Im grateful. But I sense that there is some unease in you about assuming the presidency, and Id like to offer you an out.
dr_gaius_baltar You what?
president_laura_roslin Resign. Return to your scientific work on Galactica. No one will question your motives. You can consider it a second chance,like the one you gave me.
dr_gaius_baltar Charming.
president_laura_roslin Doctor. This is a one-time offer. I suggest you reconsider.
dr_gaius_baltar You know, Madame President, Ive never been particularly interested in politics. I never wanted any lofty position of power. I never wanted to be the Vice President. That is, until this very moment. Because right now, I cant think of anything I want more.
security_officer One to the head. You didnt do this?
cpt_lee_adama I was attacked. Found him there when I woke up.
security_officer Security bulletin said Commander Fisk was garroted with a wire. Whatever happened, looks like you found your guy.
cpt_lee_adama What about Shevon... and her daughter.
security_officer Cloud Nines an open port. Chances are, theyre already off ship. Ill get a team down here. Councilman Zarek.
tom_zarek Lee. I just heard, are you all right?
cpt_lee_adama What are you doing here?
tom_zarek Attending a Quorum meeting. Nothing as exciting as all this. I assure you. I know these places are legal. But still, the son of the almighty Adama--
cpt_lee_adama Talk to me about the black market.
tom_zarek Not much to say. Its widespread, inevitable, and according to President Roslin...illegal.
cpt_lee_adama So, its no surprise that you and Fisk were in it up to your necks.
tom_zarek Fisk, maybe, but not me. I represent Astral Queen. I have to be careful about the company I keep.
cpt_lee_adama This is Fisks log. He says, he made three runs to astral queen in the last ten days, and I doubt it was to discuss prison reform.
tom_zarek What do you want from me, Captain?
cpt_lee_adama Names of ships. Contacts.
tom_zarek I cant help you. Why do you think Fisk approached me?
cpt_lee_adama To get a piece of your black market scam. To offer you protection.
tom_zarek You and your father are so blinded by the past. Fisks black market was up and running when he approached me. He knew Adama would pick up on his unauthorized shuttles, so he tried to force me into taking over the deliveries, creating a firewall between Pegasus and the illegal shipments.
cpt_lee_adama So, youre trying to tell me that you turned him down.
tom_zarek At great cost. Check the fleet logs. See how many supply ships made stops at the astral queen after last Fisks trip. The answer is none.
cpt_lee_adama So, if Fisk was trying to starve you out, why didnt you bring it to the quorum?
tom_zarek Roslins acting like the black markets some sort of aberration, but I thought you were smarter than that. Did you really expect some utopian fantasy to rise from the ashes? I heard the security officer. They gave you Fisks killer for a reason. Theyre offering you a way out.
cpt_lee_adama You know something, dont you?
tom_zarek Just rumors. Theres a freighter, Prometheus. Some people say its gone off the grid. But if you want something bad enough, thats where you go. The deals are brokered by an ex-military mercenary named Phelan. Lee. I hope shes worth it.
cpt_lee_adama Oh, Paya. Paya! Paya, hey. Paya. Its okay, its Lee. You remember, its Lee. All right, youre going to be fine. I promise you. Okay, you just hang Tight. Ill be right back. Ill be right back.
cpt_lee_adama Is she dead?
phelan I can see why you want her back, shes one of my best.
cpt_lee_adama One of yours.
phelan A good escort understands its about a lot more than sex. She knows when to listen and when to call for help.
shevon Lee, I had to.
phelan Dont blame her. The only reason youre alive is because I was able to see you through Shevons eyes. And what I saw seemed reasonable. Like Fisk. Fisk was a pig. He tried to force us to renegotiate.
cpt_lee_adama So you killed him.
phelan No. I gave you the killer. The murder weapon, the prints. Everything you needed to close the case legitimately. Despite the Presidents objections, the fleet needs us. Rationings too tight, ship comes in too late, were the pressure valve, we provide. When Shevon needed antibiotics, she knew where to go. Without us, people would have nowhere to turn. The fleet would tear itself apart.
cpt_lee_adama And what about those children outside? How are they helping the fleet?
phelan Everyone has needs. Some settle for cigars or liquor. You wanted shevon. Others are more demanding. Its hard to find the moral high ground when were all standing in the mud. Im not not like my old man, Captain, and you are not like yours.
cpt_lee_adama I came alone. But, Galactica tracked me on dradis. All theyll need to vent this ship into space is an excuse. So, lets make a deal. I want Shevon, the girl. I walk out of here, and you shut down this operation. And all of you will live.
phelan Sorry, the little girls been paid for. No refunds.
shevon Oh, gods! No!
phelan Wait.
shevon Lee, dont.
cpt_lee_adama Come on, do it. Do it.
phelan I made you a fair offer.
cpt_lee_adama So did I. Yeah, youre probably right about everything. You, me, Fisk. Nobody can stop it, and maybe nobody should. But it needs limits. Theres lines you cant cross. And you crossed them.
phelan Youre not gonna shoot. Youre not like me. Youre not gonna-- Uh-- uhhh.
cpt_lee_adama All right, its done. Fleet relies on the black market. Much as wed like, we cant wish that away. So, youre still in business. For now. But if they are any more killings, if you hold back essential medicines, if you ever touch a child...
cpt_lee_adama Shevon.
shevon No, I dont want to see--
cpt_lee_adama Hey, hey. Its over, its okay, everythings gonna be okay.
shevon Lee, Lee, let go.
cpt_lee_adama Shevon, its over.
shevon Stop! I cant be what you want me to be.
cpt_lee_adama I dont want you to be anything.
shevon You want me to be her. Thats what this is about. Thats what this has always been about.
cpt_lee_adama No...thats not what this has ever been about.
shevon Come on, Lee. I know my job. Im a replacement.
cpt_lee_adama Hey.
shevon For a lot of things. Things that men cant get anywhere else. Things theyve lost. She wanted to give you a child. But you were afraid, so you pushed her away and then you ran. And you didnt stop running until it was too late. Well, Im not her! And Paya is not, and will never be, your child.
cpt_lee_adama Commander Fisks murder has been resolved, and Pegasus crew appears to have accepted Galacticas conclusions. Thats all, Madame President.
president_laura_roslin Not quite. What about the ship, Prometheus? I understand its the hub of the fleets black market.
cpt_lee_adama We will keep an eye on them.
president_laura_roslin Keep an eye on em? Its not exactly the solution I had in mind. Whether or not we allow a criminal enterprise to thrive in this fleet is not a matter of choice, Captain. Admiral?
admiral_william_adama Ive given Lee full authority on this issue. The decision is his.
cpt_lee_adama I support your trade policies wholeheartedly madame President. But, we are never going to have a perfect system. There will always be some kind of black market. At least this way, I know names, I know faces, I know where they are, and we will monitor the situation.
president_laura_roslin Thank you, gentlemen, Im busy.
billy_keikeya 18, Im starting to sweat here. 19
officer_anastasia_dualla You should be sweating.
billy_keikeya 20
officer_anastasia_dualla Why arent you doing any of these?
billy_keikeya No talking, no talking. No cheating, all the way up, a little higher.
officer_anastasia_dualla Oh. Oh! Sneaky.
billy_keikeya 8, 9, uh-- start again.
officer_anastasia_dualla You lost track.
billy_keikeya Zero-- oh...no?
cpt_lee_adama President wasnt very happy today.
admiral_william_adama No. Ever since you ejected from the blackbird, youve been different. Harder to reach. Im just trying to understand.
cpt_lee_adama Well, like you said, dad. Weve all been through a lot.
admiral_william_adama Fair enough. But you should have told me about the woman.
