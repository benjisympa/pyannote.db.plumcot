Starbuck Entering section two-five-nine. Keep your eyes open, Kat. This is where BB and Jo-Jo  bought it.
Kat Come on out, Scar, you ugly cylon son of a bitch. Lets party!
Starbuck Yeah, I dont think hes gonna RSVP, Kat. He prefers surprise parties.
Kat Yeah, well be surprised when I blow his ass apart.
Starbuck Yeah, thatll be the day.
Kat Cassie. Cassie, wasnt that her name?
Starbuck Whose name?
Kat Reillys girlfriend.
Starbuck You know what Kat, I told you I have no frakkin idea, so give it rest, all right?
Starbuck Reillys dead for one very simple reason. He couldnt control his fear.
Kat Yup, poor idiot cut and ran. Gave the toaster a free shot up his ass.
Starbuck Scar spooked him. He saw that motherfrakkers red eye coming straight for him, and he panicked. Reilly was a good stick. A little short on guts, but a good stick.
Duck Beano who had plenty. Took Cally an hour to clean out his cockpit.
Kat Hey, does anybody remember the name of Reillys girlfriend?
Starbuck No.
Duck Karen, I think. Died on Picon. Karen.
Hotdog No, was it Kather.. Kathy?
Starbuck You guys, what does it matter? Gonna hold a little prayer circle? Good cry? The whole thing?
Kat Actually. It does matter.
Jo_Jo Clark: Hi.
BB Hey.
Jo_Jo This is Ensign Baxton.
BB Ensign Clark. And I guess were your new bunkmates.
Kat Welcome.
BB We just finished, uh, viper training on pegasus. Ready to kick some cylon butt.
Starbuck So was Beano.
BB Whos, uh, Beano?
BB Right here.
Kat Ooh, Scars gonna smoke you like a fine cigar, my man.
BB Whos Scar?
Duck Not who. What. Toasters top gun. Deadliest raider in the cylon fleet.
Jo_Jo Gimme break. Come on theyre machines. ones the same as the next.
Hotdog Scars the best they got. Lotta pilots die going after that bastard.
BB Why do they call him Scar?
Kat Youll find out soon enough. Hes got a taste for nuggets. Easy pickings.
Kat Starbuck, I think I got something. Big spud, lower rim. You see that?
Starbuck Negative.
Kat A time youd have noticed it before me.
Starbuck Fine, youre the shooter.
Kat Try to keep up!
Starbuck Yeah, just dont screw up.
Jo_Jo So, how does Scar take out an experienced pilot like Beano?
Kat He hides--
Starbuck He hides behind an asteroid. Or the debris field that youve ignored. Because it looked like a bunch of harmless rocks. You see, Scar doesnt like to fight until the odds are on his side. And then, suddenly out of nowhere, bam. He pops out, blows you to pieces. And then jumps away before you can return fire.
Jo_Jo Well, if you ask me, I think Scars a coward.
Helo Ha!
Starbuck This isnt dueling pistols at dawn, this is war. You never wanna fight fair. You wanna sneak up behind your enemy, and club em over the head. You see, Scar understands that. And so do I. So, thats why Im gonna kill him.
Kat You? Starbuck, you can barely walk.
Starbuck Look whos talking, Stim Junkie.
Pilots Ooh!
Kat You know, I wouldnt be calling anyone a junkie if I were you Starbuck. Not the way you been pounding back that booze lately. One Tigh on the ships enough. Uh, I got-- I got 200 here. Says I nail Scars chrome-plated ass. And when I do? You hand that top gun over to me and pour me my first drink.
Starbuck Your lipsll never touch the rim, little girl.
Kat Well see.
Pilots Cheering
Apollo Whoa, whoa, whoa. Maybe you should slow down.
Starbuck Maybe. Maybe not.
Pilots Go, go, go, go-- Starbuck, Starbuck, Starbuck--
Starbuck Comin in hot! Checkers green. Speed 250!
Kat Oh, yeah,  its gotta be Scar. Found your hiding place, you little frakker. Starbuck, kiss your 200 goodbye. This guys mine.
Starbuck Somethings definitely wrong. That cant be Scar. He should be jumping, or wheeling to gun at us. Ill check our six.
Starbuck Frakk! Frakk, Im hit! Starbuck: Im hit, Im hit, Im hit!
Kat See, Beano opened fire too early. You guys, you gotta fill the windscreen with the sucker or youre not gonna hit him. See,  look. Hes still not close enough. Beanos already dead, he just doesnt know it yet. Do any of you guys see where he went  wrong? There, you see that glint? There. Thats a Raider. If beano hadnt fixated on his target, hed have seen that.
BB Was it Scar?
Kat There he is, boys and girls. Theres the motherfrakker Im gonna kill.
Roslin Im afraid this is one of those good news, bad news conversations.
Adama Bad news first.
Roslin The mining chips broken another drill bit. We need to extend again. Another eight days.
Tigh Eight more days. Son of a bitch.
Roslin Theyve just discovered an incredibly rich vein of ore. Enough to build two entire squadrons of vipers. I cant walk away from that.
Adama Whats the good news?
Roslin The Pegasus production team has just turned out its first combat-ready viper. We are beginning to replace our losses.
Tigh Hmm. Are they going to be able to replace pilots as well?
Starbuck Lets review the tactical situation. Four weeks ago, our mining ships struck pay dirt on this asteroid. A pile of strategic  metals that we need to build new ships. Since were sitting ducks until the miners finish the job, the old man has sent the  fleet out of harms way under the protection of Pegasus. Our job is to stay behind and protect the miners. Unfortunately, this star system is full of rocks and dust. Dradis cannot tell the rocks from the bad guys, so our only reliable system of detection is--
Kat Our eyeballs.
Starbuck Which means we have to put those eyeballs way out there. Split up, cover a huge perimeter. Well be patrolling the area in divisions of four at these picket points.
Kat Twos, were going in sections of twos.
Starbuck Are you planning the ops for me now too?
Kat CAG wants us to spread out to control a larger area. Its right here in the briefings.
Starbuck All right. So, we do go in twos. Scar and his buddies are out there. Looking for easy kills. Lets not give him any.
Roslin This operation is vital to the long term survival of this fleet.
Adama Yes, it is. And well continue to support it.
Tigh Theyre grinding us down, viper by viper.
Roslin Whyd they stop coming at us en masse? Is it because we destroyed the resurrection ship?
Adama Starbucks working on that.
Boomer This guys probably died and been reborn a dozen times. You may have faced him before.
Starbuck So what, raiders reincarnate? Just like you?
Boomer Yeah, just like me.
Starbuck Great. What a frakkin world.
Boomer A raiders much like a trained animal, with the basic consciousness and survival instinct. But with the destruction of the resurrection ship, when they die, theyre really dead. So, theyre not gonna mount mass attacks where they could have major casualties.
Starbuck Raiders reincarnate?
Boomer Makes sense, doesnt it? It takes months for you to train a nugget into an effective viper pilot. And then they get killed. And their experience, their knowledge, their skill sets. Theyre all lost forever. So, if you could bring em back and put em in a brand new body, wouldnt you do it? Cause death then becomes a learning experience. How, uh-- how many pilots have we lost? I mean, have you lost?
Starbuck You know, there are times when I look at you and I forget what you are. All I see is that kid that pooched her landings day after day. The kid that was frakkin the chief and thinking she was getting away with it.
Boomer Yeah, I remember. You were like a big sister to--
Boomer Kara, um-- be careful of Scar, okay? Hes filled with rage.
Starbuck About what?
Boomer Dyings a painful and traumatic experience. Every time hes reborn, hes filled with more bitter memories. Scar hates you every bit as much as you hate him.
Starbuck A raider is a squirmy son of a bitch. You wont be able to keep him in your sights for more than two seconds. So, you have to deliver a killing burst within that time or he will turn and nail you. All that yanking and banking gives you one hell of a case of vertigo. And that is what this chair simulates. All right, Jo-Jo. Go!
Starbuck Time! Not bad. At least you hit the target.
Duck Yeah, but thats a lot better than I did the first time. I think I took out that clock over there.
Jo_Jo So, whats the all time record?
Hotdog Four hits on the x-ring.
Jo_Jo Are you kidding? Who did that?
Starbuck I did.
Kat Mind if I give it a shot for old times sake?
Starbuck Be my guest.
Starbuck Two seconds. Go.
Starbuck Time!
Hotdog Five.
Kat Yes! whoo!
Starbuck Frakk! Im hit, Im hit! Scar got me! Im hit, Im hit, Im hit.
Kat Kat, Starbuck. Where the hell are you? Starbuck, I lost visual on you. Starbuck, whats your position?
Starbuck Primary and secondary hydraulics are bent. I can deal with it.
Kat Starbuck, I got no visual on you, where you at?
Starbuck Forget it, Kat. Scars mine.
Kat Dont be an idiot, Starbuck, whats your position?
Starbuck Yeah, you remember me, dont you? You want my ass so bad, you can taste it. Well keep coming. Cause I guaran-frakkin-tee you, I will put you down this time for good.
Helo One more. Come on, Starbuck, lets go. Get it up there. Why are you pushing so hard? Kats just another hot shot kid out to  make her bones. Like you were before you met Anders. You ever think about him?
Starbuck Kats the point? Hes dead.
Helo Kara. If you didnt think he had a chance of surviving, whyd you promise to return with a rescue party?
Starbuck I thought I was-- I dont know what I thought.
BB Captain Thrace. If Scar jumps us out there, um--
Starbuck Keep your eyes open so he cant.
BB Okay. But, if I screw up and he bushwhacks me, what do I do then?
Starbuck Come on! They drilled this into you over and over and over again at basic air combat. I know, sir, but Scars something Im not-- Scar is no different than any other attacker. He comes at you, turn into him, get closer, pull the trigger.
BB Turn into him, get closer, pull the trigger. Thank you, sir.
Starbuck Dont run, or youll die.
BB Right.
Starbuck What are you waiting for?
BB Nothing, sir.
Kat Come here. Come here, I want to talk to you. Now listen me, youre flying Ducks wing today. Baxton, right?
BB Yes, call sign BB, sir.
Kat Okay, thats one of our best pilots that we got. Okay, so just do what he says, and youll be fine. Just dont let the raiders get anywhere near the miners. Okay.
BB Yeah. Thank you, sir.
Kat Okay, go get em, tiger. Starbuck. That kid needs more than a pat on the ass and a textbook quote about tactics, okay?
Starbuck You wanna be his wet-nurse, go right ahead, all right? Be my guest. His jacket says hes a qualified viper jock. So, I either fly him, or I ground him and then we go up short. Whats it gonna be? Your call, Kat.
Starbuck Galactica, Starbuck. Wilco return to base.
Dualla Roger, Starbuck.
Duck BB, Duck. Four raiders. From behind the rocket, left ten. Coming hard, looks like Scar.
BB Duck, BB. What do we do?
Duck We dont have enough fuel to mix it up. We bug out, BB. Let our relief deal with em. Were going home.
BB Negative! Starbuck said to turn into any attack. Weapons hot!
Apollo Youre bingo fuel. Dont attack, you idiot.
Duck Gods damn it, BB. This is the frakkin exception. Abort and reform.
Starbuck Duck, Starbuck. Position?
Duck Four-two alpha. Behind the big spud. We need a hand, right frakkin now.
Apollo Youre on your own, Duck. Everybodys way out of range.
Starbuck Duck, be there in six minutes.
Kat Duck, Kat. Eight minutes out.
BB Duck, theyre on my six, oh, my god.
Crewman Its all right, Jo-Jo.
Tyrol Verify pc-2 pressure zero, throttles closed, oxygen, generator and master switches off.
Starbuck Check. Shutdown complete.
Tyrol Nothing you could do, Captain. You were too far away.
Kat Nice work, Starbuck.
Starbuck What the hell happened to BB?
Kat What happened? He did exactly what you told him to do, Captain. Him and Duck had bingo fuel and a head start home, but instead the FNG turned and attacked. And Scar lit him up like a pinwheel.
Starbuck Whyd he try to take Scar on by himself? Stupid idiot.
Kat Try to run and your dead. I heard you, you drilled that into the poor morons head.
Starbuck You know what? You and I both know that 99% of the time that is the right move.
Kat Hmm, not this time.
Apollo You know what gets me? I know that in two weeks, I wont remember his face. I cant remember any of their faces after theyre killed. No matter how hard I try, they just fade.
Starbuck I dont even remember their names.
Apollo Names. Oh, lets see, there was-- there was Flattop. Who bought it on his thousandth landing. There was Chuckles. Stop it, already. Please, not funny. All right. Its not funny.
Starbuck It is funny. You know the President says that were saving humanity for a bright, shiny future. on Earth. That you and I are never gonna see. Were not. Because we go out over and over again until someday, some metal motherfrakker is gonna catch us on a bad day and just blow us away.
Apollo Bright, shiny futures are overrated anyway.
Starbuck That is why we gotta get what we can. Right now.
Apollo Ill drink to that. To right now.
Starbuck So, why dont we?
Apollo Why dont we what?
Apollo Hey, wait a minute. What? Wait a minute. Ow. Hey, slow down. Whoa, this isnt a race. Kara, whats going on? Whats going on? Whats wrong with you, all right?
Starbuck Okay, you know what? I dont wanna know. I dont wanna know.
Apollo Hey, what about us?
Starbuck There is no us, all right? I just wanted a good lay. There is nothing here. Do you get that? Nothing.
Apollo Sure.
Starbuck My gods.
Apollo Hey. Well, thats just great. Frakk or fight, huh? Okay, maybe I am just a quick lay. But, Kara, Im also your friend.
Starbuck I am hung up on a dead guy, okay? And it is pissing me off. And I dont know what Im doing.
Apollo Anders, right? on caprica, the resistance fighter.
Starbuck Yeah, well, Samuels dead so what does it matter?
Apollo Oh, Kara please.
Starbuck I dont need your pity, Lee!
Apollo For once in your life-- you havent got my pity! Listen, you are fine, youre fine with the dead guys. Its the living guys you cant deal with.
Kat There you are. I got visual on you Starbuck. Im inbound about 15 out. Now!
Starbuck All right, Scar, lets see how much you like playing chicken when you cant download, bitch. Hows it feel, you bastard? one of us is gonna have to break away first and it isnt gonna be me!
Kat Starbuck, wake up! Hes a machine, hes not gonna break. Youre committing suicide, Starbuck!
Starbuck In two on two engagements, cylon raiders like to isolate individual vipers, and then gang up on one, hoping to kill it before his wingman has a chance to protect him.
Crewman Captain
Starbuck Which is exactly what happened to Jo-Jo 20 minutes ago.
Duck Frakk me, was it Scar?
Starbuck Bastard smoked Jo-Jo and jumped away in less than 15 seconds before his wingman could get a shot off.
Kat And, where were you?
Starbuck What?
Kat Flight schedule had you flying lead for Jo-Jo on that patrol. So--whyd you assign snake to take your place? Was it too early in the morning for you, Starbuck?
Starbuck What exactly are you trying to say, lieutenant?
Kat What Im trying to say, Captain, maybe if you werent up all night drinking, Jo-Jo would have still been here.
Starbuck Mm. Give us the room. What is it with you, Katraine? Ever since I got back, youve been on my ass like a bad rash.
Kat You know, coming late for a briefing cause your hung over, thats bad enough. But when you back out on a mission?
Starbuck I put Snake in my place because I was in no condition to fly. And I knew that. You see, unlike you, I dont take a bunch of pills, and then climb into my cockpit so wired that I cant land the frakkin ship.
Kat Starbuck, youre an embarrassment. You used to be the hottest stick on the fleet. Now, youre just a reckless drunk that sends other people out to get killed. Whatre you gonna do, hmm? What are you gonna do, you gonna hit me Starbuck?
Starbuck Its scares you, does it?
Kat Actually, no.
Starbuck Youre afraid most of the time, Kat. Youre afraid that youre gonna end up like that picture of Reillys girlfriend. Some little, forgotten picture that nobody really remembers. You see, thats why youre riding my ass so hard. So, no one will notice that Scar scares the living crap out of you. Uh!
Apollo Ten-hut! Whats going on?
Starbuck Little tactical discussion, sir.
Apollo Well, it must have been lively. Right, Im pairing you two up. Kat, I want you to fly Starbucks wing out by the big spud.
Kat Sir, I--
Apollo I got a hunch a couple of raiders are gonna try and sneak through that sector. So, I want my heavy hitters out there to greet em. Skids up in 49 minutes. Starbuck. Are you okay?
Starbuck Entering section two-five-nine. Keep your eyes open, Kat. This is where BB and Jo-Jo bought it.
Kat Cassie, Cassie! Maybe that was her name.
Starbuck You know, Kat, I told you I have no frakkin idea, so give it a rest, all right?
Kat Whoa, hold up Starbuck. Did you see that? Oh yeah! Its gotta be Scar.
Starbuck Somethings definitely wrong. That cant be Scar. Frakk! Im hit, Scar got me. Im hit, Im hit, Im hit!
Kat Dont be an idiot, Starbuck, whats your position?
Starbuck Now, you remember me, dont you?
Kat There you are. Got visual on you, Starbuck. Im inbound about 15 out.
Starbuck Alll right, Scar, lets see how much you like playing chicken when you cant download, you bitch. Hows it feel, you bastard? one of us is gonna have to break away first and it isnt gonna be me!
Kat Starbuck, Im inbound your starboard, Seven high at ten. Starbuck, wake up! Hes a machine, hes not gonna break! Hes a machine, hes not gonna break!
Starbuck I got nothing to lose.
Kat Youre committing suicide, Starbuck!
Starbuck Im coming back. I said it. I meant it.
Anders Yeah, okay.
Starbuck Gods damn it! I am gonna put him right in front of you. Do not miss him, you frakkin stim junkie.
Kat And thats the way its done! Yeah, lets go home, skipper! whoo!
Kat Yo, Starbuck! Hey, Starbuck! My cup runneth dry. Seems I recall someone boasting that my lips would never touch this rim.
Starbuck You earned it. To BB. Jo-Jo, Reilly, Beano, Dipper, Flattop, Chuckles, Jolly, Crashdown, Sheppard, Dash, Flyboy, Stepchild, Puppet, Fireball. ...
Apollo To all of em.
Adama So say we all.
Starbuck I could have done it, you know. Could have taken out Scar. Head on pass. Straight for him. Just needed to get a little closer.
Helo So, why didnt you do it?
Starbuck Probably would have died in the process. The bastard was too good. Couple months ago, I wouldnt have even thought about that. Would have just gone for the glory hoping I could pull it out of the fire somehow.
Helo Quit kicking yourself. You did the right thing and called in your wingman. Okay? Scars dead. You and Kat came back alive.
Helo You got something to live for now. Not just die for.
Helo Ho, hey, ho. Uh. Oh.Oh, oh. Hes down for the count. Uh!
