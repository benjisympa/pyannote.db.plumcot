captain_kara_thrace Entering section two-five-nine. Keep your eyes open, Kat. This is where BB and Jo-Jo bought it.
louanne_katraine Come on out, Scar, you ugly cylon son of a bitch. Lets party!
captain_kara_thrace Yeah, I dont think hes gonna RSVP, Kat. He prefers surprise parties.
louanne_katraine Yeah, well be surprised when I blow his ass apart.
captain_kara_thrace Yeah, thatll be the day.
louanne_katraine Cassie. Cassie, wasnt that her name?
captain_kara_thrace Whose name?
louanne_katraine Reillys girlfriend.
captain_kara_thrace You know what Kat, I told you I have no frakkin idea, so give it rest, all right?
captain_kara_thrace Reillys dead for one very simple reason. He couldnt control his fear.
louanne_katraine Yup, poor idiot cut and ran. Gave the toaster a free shot up his ass.
captain_kara_thrace Scar spooked him. He saw that motherfrakkers red eye coming straight for him, and he panicked. Reilly was a good stick. A little short on guts, but a good stick.
tucker_clellan Beano who had plenty. Took Cally an hour to clean out his cockpit.
louanne_katraine Hey, does anybody remember the name of Reillys girlfriend?
captain_kara_thrace No.
tucker_clellan Karen, I think. Died on Picon. Karen.
lt_brendan_constanza No, was it Kather.. Kathy?
captain_kara_thrace You guys, what does it matter? Gonna hold a little prayer circle? Good cry? The whole thing?
louanne_katraine Actually. It does matter.
ensign_joseph_clark Clark: Hi.
ensign_brent_baxton Hey.
ensign_joseph_clark This is Ensign Baxton.
ensign_brent_baxton Ensign Clark. And I guess were your new bunkmates.
louanne_katraine Welcome.
ensign_brent_baxton We just finished, uh, viper training on pegasus. Ready to kick some cylon butt.
captain_kara_thrace So was Beano.
ensign_brent_baxton Whos, uh, Beano?
ensign_brent_baxton Right here.
louanne_katraine Ooh, Scars gonna smoke you like a fine cigar, my man.
ensign_brent_baxton Whos Scar?
tucker_clellan Not who. What. Toasters top gun. Deadliest raider in the cylon fleet.
ensign_joseph_clark Gimme break. Come on theyre machines. ones the same as the next.
lt_brendan_constanza Scars the best they got. Lotta pilots die going after that bastard.
ensign_brent_baxton Why do they call him Scar?
louanne_katraine Youll find out soon enough. Hes got a taste for nuggets. Easy pickings.
louanne_katraine Starbuck, I think I got something. Big spud, lower rim. You see that?
captain_kara_thrace Negative.
louanne_katraine A time youd have noticed it before me.
captain_kara_thrace Fine, youre the shooter.
louanne_katraine Try to keep up!
captain_kara_thrace Yeah, just dont screw up.
ensign_joseph_clark So, how does Scar take out an experienced pilot like Beano?
louanne_katraine He hides--
captain_kara_thrace He hides behind an asteroid. Or the debris field that youve ignored. Because it looked like a bunch of harmless rocks. You see, Scar doesnt like to fight until the odds are on his side. And then, suddenly out of nowhere, bam. He pops out, blows you to pieces. And then jumps away before you can return fire.
ensign_joseph_clark Well, if you ask me, I think Scars a coward.
captain_karl_agathon Ha!
captain_kara_thrace This isnt dueling pistols at dawn, this is war. You never wanna fight fair. You wanna sneak up behind your enemy, and club em over the head. You see, Scar understands that. And so do I. So, thats why Im gonna kill him.
louanne_katraine You? Starbuck, you can barely walk.
captain_kara_thrace Look whos talking, Stim Junkie.
Pilots#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode15 Ooh!
louanne_katraine You know, I wouldnt be calling anyone a junkie if I were you Starbuck. Not the way you been pounding back that booze lately. One Tigh on the ships enough. Uh, I got-- I got 200 here. Says I nail Scars chrome-plated ass. And when I do? You hand that top gun over to me and pour me my first drink.
captain_kara_thrace Your lipsll never touch the rim, little girl.
louanne_katraine Well see.
Pilots#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode15 Cheering
cpt_lee_adama Whoa, whoa, whoa. Maybe you should slow down.
captain_kara_thrace Maybe. Maybe not.
Pilots#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode15 Go, go, go, go-- Starbuck, Starbuck, Starbuck--
captain_kara_thrace Comin in hot! Checkers green. Speed 250!
louanne_katraine Oh, yeah, its gotta be Scar. Found your hiding place, you little frakker. Starbuck, kiss your 200 goodbye. This guys mine.
captain_kara_thrace Somethings definitely wrong. That cant be Scar. He should be jumping, or wheeling to gun at us. Ill check our six.
captain_kara_thrace Frakk! Frakk, Im hit! Starbuck: Im hit, Im hit, Im hit!
louanne_katraine See, Beano opened fire too early. You guys, you gotta fill the windscreen with the sucker or youre not gonna hit him. See, look. Hes still not close enough. Beanos already dead, he just doesnt know it yet. Do any of you guys see where he went wrong? There, you see that glint? There. Thats a Raider. If beano hadnt fixated on his target, hed have seen that.
ensign_brent_baxton Was it Scar?
louanne_katraine There he is, boys and girls. Theres the motherfrakker Im gonna kill.
president_laura_roslin Im afraid this is one of those good news, bad news conversations.
admiral_william_adama Bad news first.
president_laura_roslin The mining chips broken another drill bit. We need to extend again. Another eight days.
colonel_saul_tigh Eight more days. Son of a bitch.
president_laura_roslin Theyve just discovered an incredibly rich vein of ore. Enough to build two entire squadrons of vipers. I cant walk away from that.
admiral_william_adama Whats the good news?
president_laura_roslin The Pegasus production team has just turned out its first combat-ready viper. We are beginning to replace our losses.
colonel_saul_tigh Hmm. Are they going to be able to replace pilots as well?
captain_kara_thrace Lets review the tactical situation. Four weeks ago, our mining ships struck pay dirt on this asteroid. A pile of strategic metals that we need to build new ships. Since were sitting ducks until the miners finish the job, the old man has sent the fleet out of harms way under the protection of Pegasus. Our job is to stay behind and protect the miners. Unfortunately, this star system is full of rocks and dust. Dradis cannot tell the rocks from the bad guys, so our only reliable system of detection is--
louanne_katraine Our eyeballs.
captain_kara_thrace Which means we have to put those eyeballs way out there. Split up, cover a huge perimeter. Well be patrolling the area in divisions of four at these picket points.
louanne_katraine Twos, were going in sections of twos.
captain_kara_thrace Are you planning the ops for me now too?
louanne_katraine CAG wants us to spread out to control a larger area. Its right here in the briefings.
captain_kara_thrace All right. So, we do go in twos. Scar and his buddies are out there. Looking for easy kills. Lets not give him any.
president_laura_roslin This operation is vital to the long term survival of this fleet.
admiral_william_adama Yes, it is. And well continue to support it.
colonel_saul_tigh Theyre grinding us down, viper by viper.
president_laura_roslin Whyd they stop coming at us en masse? Is it because we destroyed the resurrection ship?
admiral_william_adama Starbucks working on that.
lt_sharon_valerii This guys probably died and been reborn a dozen times. You may have faced him before.
captain_kara_thrace So what, raiders reincarnate? Just like you?
lt_sharon_valerii Yeah, just like me.
captain_kara_thrace Great. What a frakkin world.
lt_sharon_valerii A raiders much like a trained animal, with the basic consciousness and survival instinct. But with the destruction of the resurrection ship, when they die, theyre really dead. So, theyre not gonna mount mass attacks where they could have major casualties.
captain_kara_thrace Raiders reincarnate?
lt_sharon_valerii Makes sense, doesnt it? It takes months for you to train a nugget into an effective viper pilot. And then they get killed. And their experience, their knowledge, their skill sets. Theyre all lost forever. So, if you could bring em back and put em in a brand new body, wouldnt you do it? Cause death then becomes a learning experience. How, uh-- how many pilots have we lost? I mean, have you lost?
captain_kara_thrace You know, there are times when I look at you and I forget what you are. All I see is that kid that pooched her landings day after day. The kid that was frakkin the chief and thinking she was getting away with it.
lt_sharon_valerii Yeah, I remember. You were like a big sister to--
lt_sharon_valerii Kara, um-- be careful of Scar, okay? Hes filled with rage.
captain_kara_thrace About what?
lt_sharon_valerii Dyings a painful and traumatic experience. Every time hes reborn, hes filled with more bitter memories. Scar hates you every bit as much as you hate him.
captain_kara_thrace A raider is a squirmy son of a bitch. You wont be able to keep him in your sights for more than two seconds. So, you have to deliver a killing burst within that time or he will turn and nail you. All that yanking and banking gives you one hell of a case of vertigo. And that is what this chair simulates. All right, Jo-Jo. Go!
captain_kara_thrace Time! Not bad. At least you hit the target.
tucker_clellan Yeah, but thats a lot better than I did the first time. I think I took out that clock over there.
ensign_joseph_clark So, whats the all time record?
lt_brendan_constanza Four hits on the x-ring.
ensign_joseph_clark Are you kidding? Who did that?
captain_kara_thrace I did.
louanne_katraine Mind if I give it a shot for old times sake?
captain_kara_thrace Be my guest.
captain_kara_thrace Two seconds. Go.
captain_kara_thrace Time!
lt_brendan_constanza Five.
louanne_katraine Yes! whoo!
captain_kara_thrace Frakk! Im hit, Im hit! Scar got me! Im hit, Im hit, Im hit.
louanne_katraine Kat, Starbuck. Where the hell are you? Starbuck, I lost visual on you. Starbuck, whats your position?
captain_kara_thrace Primary and secondary hydraulics are bent. I can deal with it.
louanne_katraine Starbuck, I got no visual on you, where you at?
captain_kara_thrace Forget it, Kat. Scars mine.
louanne_katraine Dont be an idiot, Starbuck, whats your position?
captain_kara_thrace Yeah, you remember me, dont you? You want my ass so bad, you can taste it. Well keep coming. Cause I guaran-frakkin-tee you, I will put you down this time for good.
captain_karl_agathon One more. Come on, Starbuck, lets go. Get it up there. Why are you pushing so hard? Kats just another hot shot kid out to make her bones. Like you were before you met Anders. You ever think about him?
captain_kara_thrace Kats the point? Hes dead.
captain_karl_agathon Kara. If you didnt think he had a chance of surviving, whyd you promise to return with a rescue party?
captain_kara_thrace I thought I was-- I dont know what I thought.
ensign_brent_baxton Captain Thrace. If Scar jumps us out there, um--
captain_kara_thrace Keep your eyes open so he cant.
ensign_brent_baxton Okay. But, if I screw up and he bushwhacks me, what do I do then?
captain_kara_thrace Come on! They drilled this into you over and over and over again at basic air combat. I know, sir, but Scars something Im not-- Scar is no different than any other attacker. He comes at you, turn into him, get closer, pull the trigger.
ensign_brent_baxton Turn into him, get closer, pull the trigger. Thank you, sir.
captain_kara_thrace Dont run, or youll die.
ensign_brent_baxton Right.
captain_kara_thrace What are you waiting for?
ensign_brent_baxton Nothing, sir.
louanne_katraine Come here. Come here, I want to talk to you. Now listen me, youre flying Ducks wing today. Baxton, right?
ensign_brent_baxton Yes, call sign BB, sir.
louanne_katraine Okay, thats one of our best pilots that we got. Okay, so just do what he says, and youll be fine. Just dont let the raiders get anywhere near the miners. Okay.
ensign_brent_baxton Yeah. Thank you, sir.
louanne_katraine Okay, go get em, tiger. Starbuck. That kid needs more than a pat on the ass and a textbook quote about tactics, okay?
captain_kara_thrace You wanna be his wet-nurse, go right ahead, all right? Be my guest. His jacket says hes a qualified viper jock. So, I either fly him, or I ground him and then we go up short. Whats it gonna be? Your call, Kat.
captain_kara_thrace Galactica, Starbuck. Wilco return to base.
officer_anastasia_dualla Roger, Starbuck.
tucker_clellan BB, Duck. Four raiders. From behind the rocket, left ten. Coming hard, looks like Scar.
ensign_brent_baxton Duck, BB. What do we do?
tucker_clellan We dont have enough fuel to mix it up. We bug out, BB. Let our relief deal with em. Were going home.
ensign_brent_baxton Negative! Starbuck said to turn into any attack. Weapons hot!
cpt_lee_adama Youre bingo fuel. Dont attack, you idiot.
tucker_clellan Gods damn it, BB. This is the frakkin exception. Abort and reform.
captain_kara_thrace Duck, Starbuck. Position?
tucker_clellan Four-two alpha. Behind the big spud. We need a hand, right frakkin now.
cpt_lee_adama Youre on your own, Duck. Everybodys way out of range.
captain_kara_thrace Duck, be there in six minutes.
louanne_katraine Duck, Kat. Eight minutes out.
ensign_brent_baxton Duck, theyre on my six, oh, my god.
Crewman#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode15 Its all right, Jo-Jo.
chief_galen_tyrol Verify pc-2 pressure zero, throttles closed, oxygen, generator and master switches off.
captain_kara_thrace Check. Shutdown complete.
chief_galen_tyrol Nothing you could do, Captain. You were too far away.
louanne_katraine Nice work, Starbuck.
captain_kara_thrace What the hell happened to BB?
louanne_katraine What happened? He did exactly what you told him to do, Captain. Him and Duck had bingo fuel and a head start home, but instead the FNG turned and attacked. And Scar lit him up like a pinwheel.
captain_kara_thrace Whyd he try to take Scar on by himself? Stupid idiot.
louanne_katraine Try to run and your dead. I heard you, you drilled that into the poor morons head.
captain_kara_thrace You know what? You and I both know that 99% of the time that is the right move.
louanne_katraine Hmm, not this time.
cpt_lee_adama You know what gets me? I know that in two weeks, I wont remember his face. I cant remember any of their faces after theyre killed. No matter how hard I try, they just fade.
captain_kara_thrace I dont even remember their names.
cpt_lee_adama Names. Oh, lets see, there was-- there was Flattop. Who bought it on his thousandth landing. There was Chuckles. Stop it, already. Please, not funny. All right. Its not funny.
captain_kara_thrace It is funny. You know the President says that were saving humanity for a bright, shiny future. on Earth. That you and I are never gonna see. Were not. Because we go out over and over again until someday, some metal motherfrakker is gonna catch us on a bad day and just blow us away.
cpt_lee_adama Bright, shiny futures are overrated anyway.
captain_kara_thrace That is why we gotta get what we can. Right now.
cpt_lee_adama Ill drink to that. To right now.
captain_kara_thrace So, why dont we?
cpt_lee_adama Why dont we what?
cpt_lee_adama Hey, wait a minute. What? Wait a minute. Ow. Hey, slow down. Whoa, this isnt a race. Kara, whats going on? Whats going on? Whats wrong with you, all right?
captain_kara_thrace Okay, you know what? I dont wanna know. I dont wanna know.
cpt_lee_adama Hey, what about us?
captain_kara_thrace There is no us, all right? I just wanted a good lay. There is nothing here. Do you get that? Nothing.
cpt_lee_adama Sure.
captain_kara_thrace My gods.
cpt_lee_adama Hey. Well, thats just great. Frakk or fight, huh? Okay, maybe I am just a quick lay. But, Kara, Im also your friend.
captain_kara_thrace I am hung up on a dead guy, okay? And it is pissing me off. And I dont know what Im doing.
cpt_lee_adama Anders, right? on caprica, the resistance fighter.
captain_kara_thrace Yeah, well, Samuels dead so what does it matter?
cpt_lee_adama Oh, Kara please.
captain_kara_thrace I dont need your pity, Lee!
cpt_lee_adama For once in your life-- you havent got my pity! Listen, you are fine, youre fine with the dead guys. Its the living guys you cant deal with.
louanne_katraine There you are. I got visual on you Starbuck. Im inbound about 15 out. Now!
captain_kara_thrace All right, Scar, lets see how much you like playing chicken when you cant download, bitch. Hows it feel, you bastard? one of us is gonna have to break away first and it isnt gonna be me!
louanne_katraine Starbuck, wake up! Hes a machine, hes not gonna break. Youre committing suicide, Starbuck!
captain_kara_thrace In two on two engagements, cylon raiders like to isolate individual vipers, and then gang up on one, hoping to kill it before his wingman has a chance to protect him.
Crewman#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode15 Captain
captain_kara_thrace Which is exactly what happened to Jo-Jo 20 minutes ago.
tucker_clellan Frakk me, was it Scar?
captain_kara_thrace Bastard smoked Jo-Jo and jumped away in less than 15 seconds before his wingman could get a shot off.
louanne_katraine And, where were you?
captain_kara_thrace What?
louanne_katraine Flight schedule had you flying lead for Jo-Jo on that patrol. So--whyd you assign snake to take your place? Was it too early in the morning for you, Starbuck?
captain_kara_thrace What exactly are you trying to say, lieutenant?
louanne_katraine What Im trying to say, Captain, maybe if you werent up all night drinking, Jo-Jo would have still been here.
captain_kara_thrace Mm. Give us the room. What is it with you, Katraine? Ever since I got back, youve been on my ass like a bad rash.
louanne_katraine You know, coming late for a briefing cause your hung over, thats bad enough. But when you back out on a mission?
captain_kara_thrace I put Snake in my place because I was in no condition to fly. And I knew that. You see, unlike you, I dont take a bunch of pills, and then climb into my cockpit so wired that I cant land the frakkin ship.
louanne_katraine Starbuck, youre an embarrassment. You used to be the hottest stick on the fleet. Now, youre just a reckless drunk that sends other people out to get killed. Whatre you gonna do, hmm? What are you gonna do, you gonna hit me Starbuck?
captain_kara_thrace Its scares you, does it?
louanne_katraine Actually, no.
captain_kara_thrace Youre afraid most of the time, Kat. Youre afraid that youre gonna end up like that picture of Reillys girlfriend. Some little, forgotten picture that nobody really remembers. You see, thats why youre riding my ass so hard. So, no one will notice that Scar scares the living crap out of you. Uh!
cpt_lee_adama Ten-hut! Whats going on?
captain_kara_thrace Little tactical discussion, sir.
cpt_lee_adama Well, it must have been lively. Right, Im pairing you two up. Kat, I want you to fly Starbucks wing out by the big spud.
louanne_katraine Sir, I--
cpt_lee_adama I got a hunch a couple of raiders are gonna try and sneak through that sector. So, I want my heavy hitters out there to greet em. Skids up in 49 minutes. Starbuck. Are you okay?
captain_kara_thrace Entering section two-five-nine. Keep your eyes open, Kat. This is where BB and Jo-Jo bought it.
louanne_katraine Cassie, Cassie! Maybe that was her name.
captain_kara_thrace You know, Kat, I told you I have no frakkin idea, so give it a rest, all right?
louanne_katraine Whoa, hold up Starbuck. Did you see that? Oh yeah! Its gotta be Scar.
captain_kara_thrace Somethings definitely wrong. That cant be Scar. Frakk! Im hit, Scar got me. Im hit, Im hit, Im hit!
louanne_katraine Dont be an idiot, Starbuck, whats your position?
captain_kara_thrace Now, you remember me, dont you?
louanne_katraine There you are. Got visual on you, Starbuck. Im inbound about 15 out.
captain_kara_thrace Alll right, Scar, lets see how much you like playing chicken when you cant download, you bitch. Hows it feel, you bastard? one of us is gonna have to break away first and it isnt gonna be me!
louanne_katraine Starbuck, Im inbound your starboard, Seven high at ten. Starbuck, wake up! Hes a machine, hes not gonna break! Hes a machine, hes not gonna break!
captain_kara_thrace I got nothing to lose.
louanne_katraine Youre committing suicide, Starbuck!
captain_kara_thrace Im coming back. I said it. I meant it.
Anders#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode15 Yeah, okay.
captain_kara_thrace Gods damn it! I am gonna put him right in front of you. Do not miss him, you frakkin stim junkie.
louanne_katraine And thats the way its done! Yeah, lets go home, skipper! whoo!
louanne_katraine Yo, Starbuck! Hey, Starbuck! My cup runneth dry. Seems I recall someone boasting that my lips would never touch this rim.
captain_kara_thrace You earned it. To BB. Jo-Jo, Reilly, Beano, Dipper, Flattop, Chuckles, Jolly, Crashdown, Sheppard, Dash, Flyboy, Stepchild, Puppet, Fireball. ...
cpt_lee_adama To all of em.
admiral_william_adama So say we all.
captain_kara_thrace I could have done it, you know. Could have taken out Scar. Head on pass. Straight for him. Just needed to get a little closer.
captain_karl_agathon So, why didnt you do it?
captain_kara_thrace Probably would have died in the process. The bastard was too good. Couple months ago, I wouldnt have even thought about that. Would have just gone for the glory hoping I could pull it out of the fire somehow.
captain_karl_agathon Quit kicking yourself. You did the right thing and called in your wingman. Okay? Scars dead. You and Kat came back alive.
captain_karl_agathon You got something to live for now. Not just die for.
captain_karl_agathon Ho, hey, ho. Uh. Oh.Oh, oh. Hes down for the count. Uh!
