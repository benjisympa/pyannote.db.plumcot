Sesha Aleeper...agents... within the fleet. Takeover by brute force... cylon impregnation... and reproduction... multiple models... suicide bombings... assault on natural resources.
Reporter Speculation continues that Galactica is harboring a cylon agent. Eyewitnesses claim to have seen one of the known cylon models moving in and out of Galacticas brig. Admiral Adama has made no comment on this situation. We will continue to--
Adama How the hell did this get out to the press?
Roslin Im surprised it didnt happen sooner. Im told youve been meeting with her regularly, allowing her to interact with members of your crew.
Adama Shes a military asset, providing us with vital strategic intelligence.
Billy While we pray that shes not somehow... colluding with other cylons.
Adama If I felt for one second that she posed some kind of a threat to this fleet, Id pull the trigger on her myself.
Billy I think the fleet may need to hear that, Admiral. Even more, they need to believe it.
Roslin Someone took their vitamins this morning.
Billy Yeah, I dont know what got into me.
Roslin No, youre right. Keeping Sharon Valerii alive, allowing her pregnancy to continue-- there is no road map for any of this. Somebody, somebody has got to keep asking the hard questions.
Billy I agree.
Roslin I wanna stay ahead of this. Acknowledge the cylons existence, and then make... some kind of case for her to stay aboard Galactica.
Billy I dont think thats gonna work.
Roslin What? Why?
Billy I think you need to trust the people. Use the press, tell them the truth. I mean, we barely know anything about the cylons. And until we learn more, were not gonna destroy the only source of information that we have, period.
Roslin Period. That simple, huh?
Billy Uh...well... um, could I-- could I have a minute?
Roslin Sure. Important? Mm-hmm.
Billy You were saying about the hard questions...
Billy I know its just my debate team ring, but its the best I could do. This...this really isnt how I planned it.
Dualla Anyway, um... Billy...
Billy I love you. Ive loved you since-- since the first day I met you. I mean, you were half naked, granted... I know that I kind of blindsided you with this. Okay? I mean, it doesnt have to be tomorrow. We can take our time.
Dualla Billy, I cant marry you. I dont know how else to say it. Im sorry.
Dualla He pulled out that ring... and it was like an electric shock. I could barely say anything.
Apollo Well, maybe youre  regretting that you didnt say yes.
Dualla No. No. I dont know what to make of me and Billy, but... I know I cant marry him. Then again, I dont know what to make of you and me either.
Ellen Scuse me.
Ellen Coming right up.
Apollo Ellen. Its, uh... its...good to see you.
Ellen Its good to see you, captain.
Dualla Billy.
Billy I didnt know you were coming down here.
Dualla I, um...I grabbed a two-day rotation. I thought Id grab some R & R.
Billy Im on business, as usual. Captain Adama. Oh... I really am an idiot, arent I?
Dualla No, Billy--
Billy Dont. Dont bother.
Dualla Can you give us a minute?
Billy No, you know what? Have a seat, captain. Be my guest.
Apollo Billy, Im sorry.
Billy I thought if anything, we were honest with each other. But you knew you were gonna be here with him today, and you let me propose to you.
Dualla I didnt--
Billy I know that giving you that ring was stupid. Thats fine. And maybe this wasnt gonna work out between us. But this...you shouldve told me about this.
Apollo Us?
Dualla Im sorry.
Billy Im here with friends.
Ellen Oh...only when I came in and wondered when they were gonna start enforcing a dress code.
Apollo Ellen, the bathrooms over here.
Ellen Are you serious?
Apollo Lets go.
Apollo Shh.
Sesha Yes.
Vinson Were with you.
Sesha Do it.
Vinson Everybody by the bar! Now! Move!
Chu You, you-- get up against the bar.
Apollo Three men, one woman, all armed.
Boomer Is it true the fleet knows im on Galactica?
Adama Im interested in navigational weaknesses. Worm holes, dark matter blind spots. Likely ambushes.
Boomer I would avoid these pulsar pointers because of dradis interference. If I was gonna plan an ambush, Id do it there. It  depends, Admiral. They adapt to your every move. Every move triggers a counter-move.
Adama Adapt. Thats what youre good at, right?
Boomer Why wont you answer my question? Does the fleet know Im on Galactica? Mm. Its the baby. Shes kicking.
Adama The fleet knows. Thatll be all for today. Guards.
Tigh You know, if people knew how much youve relied on that things so-called intelligence, theyd be scared out of their wits.
Adama What about you, Saul? Are you afraid of her?
Tigh You know, the truth is... I dont like the way its gotten under your skin.
Ellen What are you doing? What are you doing?
Apollo The pressure hatch can withstand explosive decompression. The only way helps getting in is with a raft of high explosives. Or we could just let these clowns open the pressure door for us. Theres bound to be a security force on its way soon.
Ellen Open the door for us? Why would they do that?
Apollo Gimme your drink.
Ellen Let me talk to them.
Apollo The ice-- I need the dry ice. Okay, stay calm. Ellen!
Vinson Who are you?
Ellen Ellen Tigh.
Vinson Get over here. Now. Move.
Sesha We are not criminals. We are members of the fleet, just like you.
Ellen My husbands XO of Galactica. Youve just made the worst mistakes of your life.
Radio_Officer Colonel Tigh, Admiral-- you need to hear this.
Ellen Saul--
Tigh Ellen? Whats wrong?
Ellen Theyre holding us hostage. Theyre threatening to kill us!
Sesha My name is Sesha Abinell. I have seized control of the Cloud Nine lounge... and held the people in it hostage.
Tigh What do you want?
Sesha What I want... this is not about... what I want. The colonial fleet has become a cylon-occupied territory. You are working in collusion with a cylon agent-- the very same model of a cylon who tried to murder you, Admiral Adama, on your own ship. We want Sharon Valerii. You have two hours.
Adama Get me everything you can on Sesha Abinell.
Gaeta Yes, sir.
Gaeta Sesha Abinell... fleet records indicate shes the widow of a Ray Abinell. He was a casualty aboard the Greenleaf Freighter when the cylons hit it about ten weeks ago.
Adama Widow. Who do we have aboard Cloud Nine?
Geata Uh, rotation schedule shows... Captain Adama, half a marine squad, and starbucks already there on R & R.
Adama Get me Starbuck right away.
Radio_Officer Yes, sir.
Apollo Hell, one of you beauties has got to be an O-2 sensor. And Im guessing its you. Take a sip of carbon dioxide.
Vinson There was another guy at the bar. Check the back. We dont want any more mistakes.
Chu Kern, theres an awful lot of military types here.
Vinson And thats why were here. To get Galacticas attention, remember? Page. You go.
Page No problem.
Starbuck Good to see ya, Gunny. Im gonna need some of those gorillas you call marines.
Burrel Most of my gorillas are already here, sir. Just trying to cop a little R & R.
Starbuck Tell me about it. All right, heres what we know. We got an unknown number of shooters at least 20 hostages. And about a 90-minute window before they start throwing out bodies.
Burrel You got a plan, sir?
Starbuck Lock and load. Lets figure out the rest as we go along.
Apollo Tell them.
Apollo Talk, thats it. Just talk.
Sesha Theyre together. Put it down. Or she dies.
Apollo Hey, she dies, he dies, you get it?
Sesha Difference is, you wont do it. He will.
Apollo Okay?
Sesha We all have someone we care about. Its his son. Hes not gonna choose the cylon over his son.
Vinson Get in line with the others.  CO-2 is through the roof. Theyre trying to suffocate us.
Sesha What is this, a trap?
Apollo Theres a reason you dont just start shooting on a spaceship. You probably nicked a line. Why dont you let me talk to the Admiral, see if we cant find a way out of this?
Adama Ive got two strike teams inbound to you. ETA ten minutes.
Starbuck Well have plenty of fire power, so thats good. But Im concerned with limited access points.
Radio_Officer Admiral. Its Abinell.
Adama Keep Starbuck on the line with us. Adama.
Sesha Were losing oxygen. If its not restored, the hostages die.
Adama Then youll all die. Because this is over.
Sesha Not until the cylons dead. Im willing to die to see this through. You willing to risk your sons life?
Starbuck Son of a bitch.
Sesha Suddenly youre listening.
Ellen Gods damn it, give her what she wants! Give her the cylon!
Sesha Youre all alone on this, Admiral.
Adama Im not gonna sacrifice a military asset on your altar of revenge.
Sesha What are you talking about? This isnt a--
Adama You said this was about us being played by the cylons. But it isnt. Its about the loss of your husband, and I understand  hat. Its about you wanting to strike back, and I understand that too. But weve all lost people that we care about. And we learn to live with it.
Sesha I am sure you are aware, Admiral, of the concrete evidence... that Capricas defenses were compromised by a cylon agent who infiltrated the Ministry of Defense on the eve of the attacks.
Adama People look for complicated answers when something terrible happens. Maybe we were just caught by surprise and were beaten. And maybe we have to learn to live with that.
Sesha And maybe you are just missing the point. You were infiltrated. You. The military. And you are being infiltrated again right now. You can sit there and pretend you know what youre doing, but you do not. You are being played. And the rest of us do not want to go down with your ship. I want this air system restored right now. one person comes in alone, fixes it, leaves. Anything goes wrong, somebody gets hurt, its on your head.
Adama Keep a direct line open to Cloud Nine.
Tigh What do we do?
Adama We repair the air system. Saul, we cant give her Sharon. I hope you know that, right?
Tigh I know that. We cant start dealing with the terrorists. We start now, itll open the floodgates, and itll never stop. But by the way, its not Sharon. Its a frakkin  cylon.
Adama You dont think I know that?
Tigh I think theres part of you that looks into that things eyes and still sees that young girl that reported aboard two years ago as a rook pilot. Well, its not. It never was. Bill, its a machine.
Radio_Officer Admiral? Its captain thrace.
Adama Sitrep.
Starbuck I had one of the cloud nine techs double-check the oxygen feed in there. Theres nothing wrong with the air.
Adama Could be a glitch.
Starbuck Or maybe someone screwed with one of the CO-2 censors in the bar.
Apollo Lee. Why?
Starbuck Maybe hes giving us an opening. If I can get someone inside, get a clear idea of what were dealing with--
Adama Kara, this is a recon mission. Get someone to volunteer. Then you assess the situation. And then get the hell out of there. Do you understand?
Starbuck Yes, sir.
Maintenance Im here to repair the O-2 line.
Burrel Captain, what are you doing?
Starbuck Volunteering. Let me see that.
Sesha Close the hatch. Search her.
Starbuck You might not want to do that. Youre running out of air in here.
Page Looks clean.
Sesha Do your job. Cover her.
Vinson Wait a minute. Turn around slowly. Check the box again.
Burrel Were hot. Lets go. Get down! Get down! We gotta get out! Now! Come on!
Dualla Billy. Billy. I need shirts, towels-- anything I can use as a bandage.
Dualla Billy!
Vinson Nobody said you could move.
Billy You still want the cylon? Do you? Because if the Admirals son dies, youre not gonna get a deal, you get that? If he dies, youre not gonna get what you want.
Sesha Hes right. Let him go.
Radio_Officer Sir, its Starbuck. We got a report of gunshots.
Adama Whats happening?
Starbuck My cover was blown. I had to move. Im sorry.
Adama Any casualties?
Starbuck Two marines. Probably KIA... at least one of the gunmen... and Lee. It was crazy in there, confused.He got hit.
Adama How bad?
Starbuck I dont know.
Adama Stand by. Hold your position. Make no move unless you hear from me.
Starbuck It was friendly fire. Lee got hit by friendly fire. I think it was me.
Adama You have your orders.
Dualla I cant stop the bleeding.
Billy What can I do?
Dualla I cant stop the bleeding. I gotta stop the bleeding. I cant tell if it hit an artery, or... Lee? Dont leave me. Lee, Lee. Dont leave me, okay? Please.
Billy Hey. Hes gonna be okay. Hes gonna be okay. Hes gonna be okay. Just hang in there, come on.
Dualla Stay with me. Please, stay with me.
Adama Are you playing with us? Are you playing with me?
Boomer Ive saved the ship. Saved you. How many times now? Five? Six? You just cant believe Im not plotting against you.
Adama You know that there are cylons within this fleet. You know what they look like. You know where to find them. If I were to ask you, would you tell me who they are?
Boomer No.
Adama That I believe.
Vinson Hell be all right.
Dualla Thanks for the concern.
Billy She loses a husband, and suddenly the world owes her an explanation.
Vinson He was a good man. And he wasnt just her husband. He was my brother.
Billy My brother died on Picon. He was a good man too. Theyre all good men.
Roslin The Abinell woman sent over a manifesto to the press before they took over the bar. Its mostly a collection of rumor and conspiracy theories about cylons in the military and the government.
Tigh Bunch of crap.
Roslin Its getting a lot of attention. We gotta get our people out of there. You have marines on Cloud Nine.
Adama Pressure door to the room has been resealed. If we try blowing it open, well need so much G-4, wed risk killing everyone inside. There are no options left except for one.
Roslin No. We dont strike deals with terrorists. We cant. We give them sharon valerii, were inviting terrorism and we weaken our position  permanently, you know that. Gentlemen, everyone in that room is someones son, someones wife, someones mother. Billy is the closest thing that I have to family left in this world. And if you dont think that that... confuses  things emotionally for me-- lets not be naive.
Tigh What if theyre right? What if sharon has been playing us all, plotting our destruction with every passing day? What if the terrorists are right?
Roslin This isnt about Sharon. Its about something much bigger than that. Its about the long-term survival, its about the way we conduct ourselves in all of this.
Radio_Officer Sir? Its Abinell on the line.
Adama Hows my son?
Sesha Alive. But my friend is dead. So are two of your soldiers. And your sons dying. You know, I thought a long time about this. About what Id do... about how far Id go... and I honestly did not know until this moment... Chu.
Ellen What? What?
Chu Get on your feet.
Ellen What are you gonna do? Saul, give them what they want! Its just a machine!
Tigh Theyre gonna kill her.
Adama Hold your fire. Im giving you the cylon. But she wont be alive. What does that mean?
Sesha That is not the deal.
Adama It means that youve convinced me that we may have been played. And if that be the case, and shes been playing with me, then I cant take any more chances. So you make up your mind. If you want Sharon Valerii, you can have her. But on my terms. I give you the body, you give me the hostages.
Sesha Done.
Adama Cut the wire.
Starbuck Admiral. Let me help. Please.
Adama Let me take it from here. Lets go.
Dualla Stop looking at him, Billy. I can see you watching him. I know you think you can get that gun.
Billy Im only thinking in case something happens.
Dualla No. Youre not a soldier. Youre not trained for that. Youve got nothing to prove.
Billy I know.
Sesha Theyre right outside. We open up, theyll give us the body. Okay.
Vinson Were opening the door. But if anything goes wrong... we start killing hostages.
Sesha Do it.
Sesha Its over.
Vinson Wait-- This isnt right. This ones been dead for weeks. Their cylon is still alive.
Sesha Kill the girlfriend.
Marine_1 Down, report.
Marine_2 All clear.
Marine_3 I need help over here!
Marine_4 Medic!
Adama Lee. Lee, can you hear me? Lee! Can you hear me, Lee? Come on, son. Come on, hurry up.
Adama Thats good.
Dualla Billy. Billy. Billy. No. Billy. Billy.
Roslin Is this what you gave em?
Adama It was a calculated risk.
Roslin It wasnt worth it. Oh, dear. Well, thats better. Thats better. He was so young.
Dualla Hey.
Apollo Hey... what is it?
Dualla Nothing. When youre feeling better, we can talk.
Apollo This was a hell of a vacation.
Dualla Yeah.
Dualla Lee? Lee, you cant leave. You have to stay. You have to really stay. You understand? Its okay. Ill be here when you wake up. Ill be right here.
