sesha_abinell Aleeper...agents... within the fleet. Takeover by brute force... cylon impregnation... and reproduction... multiple models... suicide bombings... assault on natural resources.
Reporter#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode16 Speculation continues that Galactica is harboring a cylon agent. Eyewitnesses claim to have seen one of the known cylon models moving in and out of Galacticas brig. Admiral Adama has made no comment on this situation. We will continue to--
admiral_william_adama How the hell did this get out to the press?
president_laura_roslin Im surprised it didnt happen sooner. Im told youve been meeting with her regularly, allowing her to interact with members of your crew.
admiral_william_adama Shes a military asset, providing us with vital strategic intelligence.
billy_keikeya While we pray that shes not somehow... colluding with other cylons.
admiral_william_adama If I felt for one second that she posed some kind of a threat to this fleet, Id pull the trigger on her myself.
billy_keikeya I think the fleet may need to hear that, Admiral. Even more, they need to believe it.
president_laura_roslin Someone took their vitamins this morning.
billy_keikeya Yeah, I dont know what got into me.
president_laura_roslin No, youre right. Keeping Sharon Valerii alive, allowing her pregnancy to continue-- there is no road map for any of this. Somebody, somebody has got to keep asking the hard questions.
billy_keikeya I agree.
president_laura_roslin I wanna stay ahead of this. Acknowledge the cylons existence, and then make... some kind of case for her to stay aboard Galactica.
billy_keikeya I dont think thats gonna work.
president_laura_roslin What? Why?
billy_keikeya I think you need to trust the people. Use the press, tell them the truth. I mean, we barely know anything about the cylons. And until we learn more, were not gonna destroy the only source of information that we have, period.
president_laura_roslin Period. That simple, huh?
billy_keikeya Uh...well... um, could I-- could I have a minute?
president_laura_roslin Sure. Important? Mm-hmm.
billy_keikeya You were saying about the hard questions...
billy_keikeya I know its just my debate team ring, but its the best I could do. This...this really isnt how I planned it.
officer_anastasia_dualla Anyway, um... Billy...
billy_keikeya I love you. Ive loved you since-- since the first day I met you. I mean, you were half naked, granted... I know that I kind of blindsided you with this. Okay? I mean, it doesnt have to be tomorrow. We can take our time.
officer_anastasia_dualla Billy, I cant marry you. I dont know how else to say it. Im sorry.
officer_anastasia_dualla He pulled out that ring... and it was like an electric shock. I could barely say anything.
cpt_lee_adama Well, maybe youre regretting that you didnt say yes.
officer_anastasia_dualla No. No. I dont know what to make of me and Billy, but... I know I cant marry him. Then again, I dont know what to make of you and me either.
ellen_tigh Scuse me.
ellen_tigh Coming right up.
cpt_lee_adama Ellen. Its, uh... its...good to see you.
ellen_tigh Its good to see you, captain.
officer_anastasia_dualla Billy.
billy_keikeya I didnt know you were coming down here.
officer_anastasia_dualla I, um...I grabbed a two-day rotation. I thought Id grab some R & R.
billy_keikeya Im on business, as usual. Captain Adama. Oh... I really am an idiot, arent I?
officer_anastasia_dualla No, Billy--
billy_keikeya Dont. Dont bother.
officer_anastasia_dualla Can you give us a minute?
billy_keikeya No, you know what? Have a seat, captain. Be my guest.
cpt_lee_adama Billy, Im sorry.
billy_keikeya I thought if anything, we were honest with each other. But you knew you were gonna be here with him today, and you let me propose to you.
officer_anastasia_dualla I didnt--
billy_keikeya I know that giving you that ring was stupid. Thats fine. And maybe this wasnt gonna work out between us. But this...you shouldve told me about this.
cpt_lee_adama Us?
officer_anastasia_dualla Im sorry.
billy_keikeya Im here with friends.
ellen_tigh Oh...only when I came in and wondered when they were gonna start enforcing a dress code.
cpt_lee_adama Ellen, the bathrooms over here.
ellen_tigh Are you serious?
cpt_lee_adama Lets go.
cpt_lee_adama Shh.
sesha_abinell Yes.
vinson Were with you.
sesha_abinell Do it.
vinson Everybody by the bar! Now! Move!
chu You, you-- get up against the bar.
cpt_lee_adama Three men, one woman, all armed.
lt_sharon_valerii Is it true the fleet knows im on Galactica?
admiral_william_adama Im interested in navigational weaknesses. Worm holes, dark matter blind spots. Likely ambushes.
lt_sharon_valerii I would avoid these pulsar pointers because of dradis interference. If I was gonna plan an ambush, Id do it there. It depends, Admiral. They adapt to your every move. Every move triggers a counter-move.
admiral_william_adama Adapt. Thats what youre good at, right?
lt_sharon_valerii Why wont you answer my question? Does the fleet know Im on Galactica? Mm. Its the baby. Shes kicking.
admiral_william_adama The fleet knows. Thatll be all for today. Guards.
colonel_saul_tigh You know, if people knew how much youve relied on that things so-called intelligence, theyd be scared out of their wits.
admiral_william_adama What about you, Saul? Are you afraid of her?
colonel_saul_tigh You know, the truth is... I dont like the way its gotten under your skin.
ellen_tigh What are you doing? What are you doing?
cpt_lee_adama The pressure hatch can withstand explosive decompression. The only way helps getting in is with a raft of high explosives. Or we could just let these clowns open the pressure door for us. Theres bound to be a security force on its way soon.
ellen_tigh Open the door for us? Why would they do that?
cpt_lee_adama Gimme your drink.
ellen_tigh Let me talk to them.
cpt_lee_adama The ice-- I need the dry ice. Okay, stay calm. Ellen!
vinson Who are you?
ellen_tigh Ellen Tigh.
vinson Get over here. Now. Move.
sesha_abinell We are not criminals. We are members of the fleet, just like you.
ellen_tigh My husbands XO of Galactica. Youve just made the worst mistakes of your life.
petty_officer_sian Colonel Tigh, Admiral-- you need to hear this.
ellen_tigh Saul--
colonel_saul_tigh Ellen? Whats wrong?
ellen_tigh Theyre holding us hostage. Theyre threatening to kill us!
sesha_abinell My name is Sesha Abinell. I have seized control of the Cloud Nine lounge... and held the people in it hostage.
colonel_saul_tigh What do you want?
sesha_abinell What I want... this is not about... what I want. The colonial fleet has become a cylon-occupied territory. You are working in collusion with a cylon agent-- the very same model of a cylon who tried to murder you, Admiral Adama, on your own ship. We want Sharon Valerii. You have two hours.
admiral_william_adama Get me everything you can on Sesha Abinell.
lt_felix_gaeta Yes, sir.
lt_felix_gaeta Sesha Abinell... fleet records indicate shes the widow of a Ray Abinell. He was a casualty aboard the Greenleaf Freighter when the cylons hit it about ten weeks ago.
admiral_william_adama Widow. Who do we have aboard Cloud Nine?
lt_felix_gaeta Uh, rotation schedule shows... Captain Adama, half a marine squad, and starbucks already there on R & R.
admiral_william_adama Get me Starbuck right away.
petty_officer_sian Yes, sir.
cpt_lee_adama Hell, one of you beauties has got to be an O-2 sensor. And Im guessing its you. Take a sip of carbon dioxide.
vinson There was another guy at the bar. Check the back. We dont want any more mistakes.
chu Kern, theres an awful lot of military types here.
vinson And thats why were here. To get Galacticas attention, remember? Page. You go.
page No problem.
captain_kara_thrace Good to see ya, Gunny. Im gonna need some of those gorillas you call marines.
lt_terry_burrell Most of my gorillas are already here, sir. Just trying to cop a little R & R.
captain_kara_thrace Tell me about it. All right, heres what we know. We got an unknown number of shooters at least 20 hostages. And about a 90-minute window before they start throwing out bodies.
lt_terry_burrell You got a plan, sir?
captain_kara_thrace Lock and load. Lets figure out the rest as we go along.
cpt_lee_adama Tell them.
cpt_lee_adama Talk, thats it. Just talk.
sesha_abinell Theyre together. Put it down. Or she dies.
cpt_lee_adama Hey, she dies, he dies, you get it?
sesha_abinell Difference is, you wont do it. He will.
cpt_lee_adama Okay?
sesha_abinell We all have someone we care about. Its his son. Hes not gonna choose the cylon over his son.
vinson Get in line with the others. CO-2 is through the roof. Theyre trying to suffocate us.
sesha_abinell What is this, a trap?
cpt_lee_adama Theres a reason you dont just start shooting on a spaceship. You probably nicked a line. Why dont you let me talk to the Admiral, see if we cant find a way out of this?
admiral_william_adama Ive got two strike teams inbound to you. ETA ten minutes.
captain_kara_thrace Well have plenty of fire power, so thats good. But Im concerned with limited access points.
petty_officer_sian Admiral. Its Abinell.
admiral_william_adama Keep Starbuck on the line with us. Adama.
sesha_abinell Were losing oxygen. If its not restored, the hostages die.
admiral_william_adama Then youll all die. Because this is over.
sesha_abinell Not until the cylons dead. Im willing to die to see this through. You willing to risk your sons life?
captain_kara_thrace Son of a bitch.
sesha_abinell Suddenly youre listening.
ellen_tigh Gods damn it, give her what she wants! Give her the cylon!
sesha_abinell Youre all alone on this, Admiral.
admiral_william_adama Im not gonna sacrifice a military asset on your altar of revenge.
sesha_abinell What are you talking about? This isnt a--
admiral_william_adama You said this was about us being played by the cylons. But it isnt. Its about the loss of your husband, and I understand hat. Its about you wanting to strike back, and I understand that too. But weve all lost people that we care about. And we learn to live with it.
sesha_abinell I am sure you are aware, Admiral, of the concrete evidence... that Capricas defenses were compromised by a cylon agent who infiltrated the Ministry of Defense on the eve of the attacks.
admiral_william_adama People look for complicated answers when something terrible happens. Maybe we were just caught by surprise and were beaten. And maybe we have to learn to live with that.
sesha_abinell And maybe you are just missing the point. You were infiltrated. You. The military. And you are being infiltrated again right now. You can sit there and pretend you know what youre doing, but you do not. You are being played. And the rest of us do not want to go down with your ship. I want this air system restored right now. one person comes in alone, fixes it, leaves. Anything goes wrong, somebody gets hurt, its on your head.
admiral_william_adama Keep a direct line open to Cloud Nine.
colonel_saul_tigh What do we do?
admiral_william_adama We repair the air system. Saul, we cant give her Sharon. I hope you know that, right?
colonel_saul_tigh I know that. We cant start dealing with the terrorists. We start now, itll open the floodgates, and itll never stop. But by the way, its not Sharon. Its a frakkin cylon.
admiral_william_adama You dont think I know that?
colonel_saul_tigh I think theres part of you that looks into that things eyes and still sees that young girl that reported aboard two years ago as a rook pilot. Well, its not. It never was. Bill, its a machine.
petty_officer_sian Admiral? Its captain thrace.
admiral_william_adama Sitrep.
captain_kara_thrace I had one of the cloud nine techs double-check the oxygen feed in there. Theres nothing wrong with the air.
admiral_william_adama Could be a glitch.
captain_kara_thrace Or maybe someone screwed with one of the CO-2 censors in the bar.
cpt_lee_adama Lee. Why?
captain_kara_thrace Maybe hes giving us an opening. If I can get someone inside, get a clear idea of what were dealing with--
admiral_william_adama Kara, this is a recon mission. Get someone to volunteer. Then you assess the situation. And then get the hell out of there. Do you understand?
captain_kara_thrace Yes, sir.
Maintenance#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode16 Im here to repair the O-2 line.
lt_terry_burrell Captain, what are you doing?
captain_kara_thrace Volunteering. Let me see that.
sesha_abinell Close the hatch. Search her.
captain_kara_thrace You might not want to do that. Youre running out of air in here.
page Looks clean.
sesha_abinell Do your job. Cover her.
vinson Wait a minute. Turn around slowly. Check the box again.
lt_terry_burrell Were hot. Lets go. Get down! Get down! We gotta get out! Now! Come on!
officer_anastasia_dualla Billy. Billy. I need shirts, towels-- anything I can use as a bandage.
officer_anastasia_dualla Billy!
vinson Nobody said you could move.
billy_keikeya You still want the cylon? Do you? Because if the Admirals son dies, youre not gonna get a deal, you get that? If he dies, youre not gonna get what you want.
sesha_abinell Hes right. Let him go.
petty_officer_sian Sir, its Starbuck. We got a report of gunshots.
admiral_william_adama Whats happening?
captain_kara_thrace My cover was blown. I had to move. Im sorry.
admiral_william_adama Any casualties?
captain_kara_thrace Two marines. Probably KIA... at least one of the gunmen... and Lee. It was crazy in there, confused.He got hit.
admiral_william_adama How bad?
captain_kara_thrace I dont know.
admiral_william_adama Stand by. Hold your position. Make no move unless you hear from me.
captain_kara_thrace It was friendly fire. Lee got hit by friendly fire. I think it was me.
admiral_william_adama You have your orders.
officer_anastasia_dualla I cant stop the bleeding.
billy_keikeya What can I do?
officer_anastasia_dualla I cant stop the bleeding. I gotta stop the bleeding. I cant tell if it hit an artery, or... Lee? Dont leave me. Lee, Lee. Dont leave me, okay? Please.
billy_keikeya Hey. Hes gonna be okay. Hes gonna be okay. Hes gonna be okay. Just hang in there, come on.
officer_anastasia_dualla Stay with me. Please, stay with me.
admiral_william_adama Are you playing with us? Are you playing with me?
lt_sharon_valerii Ive saved the ship. Saved you. How many times now? Five? Six? You just cant believe Im not plotting against you.
admiral_william_adama You know that there are cylons within this fleet. You know what they look like. You know where to find them. If I were to ask you, would you tell me who they are?
lt_sharon_valerii No.
admiral_william_adama That I believe.
vinson Hell be all right.
officer_anastasia_dualla Thanks for the concern.
billy_keikeya She loses a husband, and suddenly the world owes her an explanation.
vinson He was a good man. And he wasnt just her husband. He was my brother.
billy_keikeya My brother died on Picon. He was a good man too. Theyre all good men.
president_laura_roslin The Abinell woman sent over a manifesto to the press before they took over the bar. Its mostly a collection of rumor and conspiracy theories about cylons in the military and the government.
colonel_saul_tigh Bunch of crap.
president_laura_roslin Its getting a lot of attention. We gotta get our people out of there. You have marines on Cloud Nine.
admiral_william_adama Pressure door to the room has been resealed. If we try blowing it open, well need so much G-4, wed risk killing everyone inside. There are no options left except for one.
president_laura_roslin No. We dont strike deals with terrorists. We cant. We give them sharon valerii, were inviting terrorism and we weaken our position permanently, you know that. Gentlemen, everyone in that room is someones son, someones wife, someones mother. Billy is the closest thing that I have to family left in this world. And if you dont think that that... confuses things emotionally for me-- lets not be naive.
colonel_saul_tigh What if theyre right? What if sharon has been playing us all, plotting our destruction with every passing day? What if the terrorists are right?
president_laura_roslin This isnt about Sharon. Its about something much bigger than that. Its about the long-term survival, its about the way we conduct ourselves in all of this.
petty_officer_sian Sir? Its Abinell on the line.
admiral_william_adama Hows my son?
sesha_abinell Alive. But my friend is dead. So are two of your soldiers. And your sons dying. You know, I thought a long time about this. About what Id do... about how far Id go... and I honestly did not know until this moment... Chu.
ellen_tigh What? What?
chu Get on your feet.
ellen_tigh What are you gonna do? Saul, give them what they want! Its just a machine!
colonel_saul_tigh Theyre gonna kill her.
admiral_william_adama Hold your fire. Im giving you the cylon. But she wont be alive. What does that mean?
sesha_abinell That is not the deal.
admiral_william_adama It means that youve convinced me that we may have been played. And if that be the case, and shes been playing with me, then I cant take any more chances. So you make up your mind. If you want Sharon Valerii, you can have her. But on my terms. I give you the body, you give me the hostages.
sesha_abinell Done.
admiral_william_adama Cut the wire.
captain_kara_thrace Admiral. Let me help. Please.
admiral_william_adama Let me take it from here. Lets go.
officer_anastasia_dualla Stop looking at him, Billy. I can see you watching him. I know you think you can get that gun.
billy_keikeya Im only thinking in case something happens.
officer_anastasia_dualla No. Youre not a soldier. Youre not trained for that. Youve got nothing to prove.
billy_keikeya I know.
sesha_abinell Theyre right outside. We open up, theyll give us the body. Okay.
vinson Were opening the door. But if anything goes wrong... we start killing hostages.
sesha_abinell Do it.
sesha_abinell Its over.
vinson Wait-- This isnt right. This ones been dead for weeks. Their cylon is still alive.
sesha_abinell Kill the girlfriend.
Marine_1#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode16 Down, report.
Marine_2#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode16 All clear.
Marine_3#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode16 I need help over here!
Marine_4#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode16 Medic!
admiral_william_adama Lee. Lee, can you hear me? Lee! Can you hear me, Lee? Come on, son. Come on, hurry up.
admiral_william_adama Thats good.
officer_anastasia_dualla Billy. Billy. Billy. No. Billy. Billy.
president_laura_roslin Is this what you gave em?
admiral_william_adama It was a calculated risk.
president_laura_roslin It wasnt worth it. Oh, dear. Well, thats better. Thats better. He was so young.
officer_anastasia_dualla Hey.
cpt_lee_adama Hey... what is it?
officer_anastasia_dualla Nothing. When youre feeling better, we can talk.
cpt_lee_adama This was a hell of a vacation.
officer_anastasia_dualla Yeah.
officer_anastasia_dualla Lee? Lee, you cant leave. You have to stay. You have to really stay. You understand? Its okay. Ill be here when you wake up. Ill be right here.
