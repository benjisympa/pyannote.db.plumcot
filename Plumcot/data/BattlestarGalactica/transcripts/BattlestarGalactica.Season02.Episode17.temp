Buster Pegasus, Buster. Dradis intercept training birds are away.
Hoshi Buster, Pegasus, roger that, take station-- be advised, communications will suffer sporadic interruptions due to stellar EMI activity. Acknowledge?
Buster Pegasus, Buster, acknowledge. Our communications suck! Is it gonna be like this all day?
Shark Big time. Those binaries are putting out so much EMI, even the dradis is barely working.
Buster Well, Im gonna a little distance between us and the fleet. Get us out of the soup. See if we can get a cleaner dradis picture.
Duck Hey! Whoevers in there, times up! Lets go, come on! Gotta a couple of tired viper jockeys out here wanna sleep.
Apollo Go hit the showers Duck! Well be gone by the time you get back. U-uh.
Dualla How you feel?
Apollo Mm, not great. But Cottles given me the thumbs-up and its been almost a month, so I guess its back to work.
Dualla So you ready to go into the belly of the beast?
Apollo The beast?
Dualla Yeah. Thats what they call the Pegasus now. Galacticas the bucket.
Apollo The bucket and the beast. Huh. Dont we make a pair? Dualla: Come on.Apollo: No, you come on. Dualla: Come on, come on, go.Apollo: Oh-- okay. Anyway, its only a temporary assignment. I should be back again in a couple of weeks. Dualla: Whyd the old man pick you? Apollo: One word. Starbuck.Dualla: Is she in hack again?Apollo: Not yet. But apparently, shes been driving commander Garner up one bulkhead and down the other ever since she took over flight training on--  whatd you call it? The beast? And since I wont be flying combat for a while, I-- mm.Apollo starts to get dressed, Dualla hugs him from behind.Dualla: Were you going to mention these? Dont all speak at once. Pilot: Sir, its been made clear that discussing flight deck situations with anyone outside Pegasus crew is not allowed. Sorry, sir.Starbuck: And whose frakkin bright idea was that? It was Garner, wasnt it? Of course it was. So barely competent and paranoid. Huh, theres a hell of a combination. Pegasus - Garners OfficeGarner: I have a problem. That problems name is Kara Thrace. Apollo: I-I know to handle her, sir. And for the record, she is one hell of a viper pilot. Garner: What? I should cut her some slack because shes good in the cockpit. Is that what youre saying? Because nobody ever cut us any slack in the engine room. I could tell you that right now. But then, uh, I dont know, maybe being a snipe is different than being a viper jockey. No flashy stunts for us. No flying by the seat of our pants down there! The engine room is like a finely tuned watch, and everything in it needs to be monitored and maintained in a very precise fashion. Nobody freelances. Everything is done in the proper way at the proper timein the proper order! Or thered be no power. No lights. No hot showers for your flyboys. You know, Major, I think some of the people around here could learn a thing or two from the snipes. Colonial oneTori: Im sorry, Madame President. But its that time. Roslin: Oh. Campaign meeting.Tori: Mm-hmm, weve been putting it off for weeks. And we do have a Presidential election coming up unless youve decided not to run. Roslin: Yeah, and to be perfectly honest with you, Tori, Ive thought about it a few times. But, um, no, Im still here. Theres so much to do. So-- lets talk politics.Tori: Great. Here are the results from our first fleet-wide poll. Roslin: How did you manage this?Tori: I was precinct Captain for the federalist party in delphi for five years. We did polls to see what the mayor should have for lunch. For what its worth, youve managed to walk a very fine line. Youre Presidential bid has the support of both the  military and the civilian fleet, and youve received enthusiastic endorsements from the Gemenese religious leaders. Roslin: Well, it helps when your only real rival is a convicted terrorist. Cloud Nine - StateroomZarek: Am I capable of leading this fleet? Absolutely. And for a time, I almost had a chance. Until Laura Roslin ascended from politician to prophet. The truth is I cant win. But you could. Baltar: You flatter me, Mr. Zarek. Really. But Im not sure Im cut out for a life in politics as I find the vice presidency and everything to do with it very tedious. Zarek: I would imagine carrying water for Roslin would get old after a time. But its the office that makes you the perfect  candidate, doctor. Youre pre-sold. Baltar: Really? To whom? Zarek: Youd be surprised how many people crave the assurances of cold science as opposed to the superstitious ravings of the Gemenese. As a scientist, you offer hope. Think about it. Baltar: And you, Tom. Youll just step aside... will you?Zarek: Im just happy to back a man of true conviction. A man...who remembers his friends. Pegasus - Briefing RoomCase: Attention on deck.Apollo: At ease. Wheres Stinger? Starbuck: Hes in hack for mouthing off to Garner. Stepped on his precious little toes. Case: Frakking Garner. Pilots: Do you have any idea what they would do to me? Please, do not send me back. Adama: Youre a stowaway. Aboard a military ship. Cottle: Some people might say she was a victim of political persecution. Hell. She could apply for asylum. Rya: Asylum. Thats it. I want asylum. Colonial onePorter: Under Gemenon law, the girl is still the property of her parents. And they can deal with her once shes safely back on her ship. To be honest, Im more concerned with the broader implications of this matter. Roslin: Sarah. Porter: I know you dont want to hear this. But my people, my voters are demanding action on this issue. Roslin: We have been through this. Abortion was legal under colonial law before the attacks, and so it is still legal today. Porter: Its obscene. The scriptures view abortion as an abomination in the eyes of the gods. You cannot equivocate on this point if want our support in the coming election. Roslin: Rya Kibbys petition for asylum is under review. Thank you, Sarah, very much for coming in. Porter leaves.Roslin: Im not turning that girl over. Im certainly not banning abortion. Tori: Then dont. But we have to move aggressively on this thing. Im arranging a conference call with you and the quorum. This is gonna get out of hand fast. Tori leaves.Adama: Shes not Billy. Roslin: No, shes not. What?Adama: I hate to say this. Because I know that this is a political issue. The fact is that that number doesnt go up very often. Roslin: I fought for a womans right to control her body my entire career. No. No.Adama: Im just remembering what you said. Right after the cylon attack. That if we really want to save the human race, wed better start having babies. Pegasus - Breifing RoomStarbuck: Nothing, nothing, and more nothing. Where... Is sharks last transmission? Case: Well...theres not much there.Starbuck: ...Eve...distress...bearing.. reek...shuns...emerge-- read. They were in distress. Case: They...give a bearing requesting instructions... its an emergency... can you read? Starbuck: Maybe, but whats this eve fragment here? ..Eve...distress. Eve...distress. Eve. Recei-received? Received distress call.Case: Okay. From who? Starbuck: I dont know. But maybe thats where they went. To go find out. Pegasus - CICApollo: Commander, Captain Thrace has a theory about our missing raptors, sir. Garner: Thats good considering she lost them. Starbuck: Excuse me?Garner: Well, they were out on one of your so-called training missions. Werent they, Captain? Starbuck: My so-called training missions. Apollo: Okay, lets just take this easy. Garner: Thats when youre not boozing or sowing mutiny amongst the crew. Starbuck: Mutiny?Apollo: Commander, we should take this to a private place. Garner: Dont you think I know whats happening on my own ship? Barely competent? And paranoid?Starbuck: That was off the record. I was just venting. Accurately. Garner: Ill have you court-martialled. Apollo: Commander. Im not defending Captain Thraces behavior. Starbuck: Thanks, Major.Garner: Captain Thrace, youre restricted to quarters. Until I can ship you back to Galactica. Youre Adamas pet. Let him deal with you.Starbuck: Gentlemen.Garner: Major?Apollo: Yes, sir.Pegasus - PIlots QuartersApollo: Youve been on board less than four days, and youre already facing charges. You dont waste any time, do you? Starbuck: Neither do you, Lee. Hows it feel being Garners new playmate? Apollo: Im here to do a job! Starbuck: Yeah. Keep a loudmouth, disobedient frak of Kara Thrace in line. Not doing such a good job, are ya? Evidently not. Apollo: We dont have much time. Those guys are running out of air. Starbuck: Yeah, well, I tried. All right? All I have done since I got to the beast is try and help, and all Ive gotten is Garners foot in my ass. Apollo: Well, maybe you need a kick in the ass! Starbuck: All right. Here we go. Finally. What is your problem anyway?Apollo: Whats my problem? Whats my problem? Well Kara, my problem is you. You keep frakking up, and I keep having to clean it up, and I am officially... sick of it.Starbuck: Poor Lee, your life is so hard, isnt it? Apollo: You mean, since I got shot.Starbuck: You wanna hear what I think happened to Buster, or not?RaptorRed Devil: Pegasus, Red Devil. Im nearing the last coordinates where our raptors went missing. Busteremergency...distress.Red Devil: Buster, is that you? Buster, this is Red Devil, man. Is that you, buddy? Come back to me. SharkGet down to the hangar deck! Starbuck: What?Apollo: Look. Youre the best pilot weve got. So, get down there. Find a viper. Starbuck: Its about time you admitted that!Apollo goes into the CICApollo: Commander, whats our sitrep? Garner: This is a rescue mission, Major. Apollo: On whose authority? Garner: Mine. Im bringing my pilots home. Apollo: With all due respect, sir.  But if this is a cylon trap, then we are entering blind! We should send a force recon-- Garner: My pilots are dying down there, Major! Im going in, Im not waiting on recon! Apollo: Commander, this is in direct violation of the Admirals orders. Garner: Major. Leave combat. Apollo: Making this an illegal action on your part, sir! Garner: You are relieved, Major! Sergeant of the guard. Apollo: I am forced to take command of this vessel! Garner: This man is in direct disobedience of an order-- under federal regulations i want him under arrest! I place you under arrest! Sergeant. Take him below. Apollo: Sergeant, the commanders been properly relieved. Escort him to his quarters. Garner: This man is not a member of this crew, and you will obey a direct order that you have been given by me, and you will do it  now.Sgt: Major. Youll come with me.Galactica - CICThe Pegasus jumps away.Geata: Admiral! The Pegasus has jumped. Theyre gone. Pegasus - CICHoshi: Dradis signals clean. Jump put is clear of any interference. Sir, I show two raptors. Transponder codes match. Theyre ours.Garner: Mr. Hoshi. Tell the CAG to launch our recovery team, and lets bring our people home. Hoshi: Aye, sir.RaptorA raptor nears the two missing raptors.Red Devil: Pegasus, Red Devil. Our two birds look intact. Cant quite see inside yet. Commander, were unable to raise the raptors on wireless. Oh, my gods. Pegasus, both raptor crews are dead. I repeat. Theyre all dead. Pegasus - CICHoshi: Sir, three cylon base ships just jumped into weapons range. Oh, my gods. Theyre launching nukes! Brace for impact.Two nukes deotnate against the hull, causing a lot of damage.Garner: Damage report?Hoshi: Two...two nuclear detonations in the stern, sir. Throton: Ftl drive inoperative, sir. Helm: Were stuck here, sir. VipersThe vipers are launched to fight off the Cylon attack.Starbuck: All right, Showboat. You take red squadron. Hit em on the right. Catbird, you take green. Hit em on the left.The rest of you, follow me. Were going straight up the gut. Pegasus - CICApollo: Sergeant, I think you have better things to do. Im gonna stay here and be Galacticas CAG. Something about wanting to keep an eye on me. Apollo: Well, you and Colonel Tigh have a lot of fun at those early morning briefings. Cause the XOs a lot of fun first thing. Starbuck: Mm, great. Congratulations. Really. Congratulations. You deserve it. Apollo: I know why I was mad at you, Kara. A simple thank you would have been sufficient. Cause you were doing what you always did. Buck authority, and get away with it. I bucked authority once. And I almost lost everything. So I guess when I showed up on Pegasus, and there you were doing it all over again-- I dont know. Pissed me off. Doesnt make a lot of sense, does it? Starbuck: You should hear the way my brain works sometimes. Are we okay?Apollo: You have a brain? Yeah. Yeah were okay.Starbuck gives Apollo a friendly smack after the brain remark. They laugh and hug each other. During the hug, many fans claim to hear Apollo whisper forever after he says that they are okay. Some only hear a deep breath from Apollo or Starbuck. Either way, Starbuck follows the remark with a smile.Colonial onePlaya: Madame President, your decision to criminalize abortion has created a furor. Do you think thats hurt your standing in the polls? Roslin: Absolutely.Baltar: If I may, Madame President. It is true in the light of recent events, the President may have lost support in some quarters. I  would ask the people to understand that if this is an extreme decision, we live in extreme times. The decision has been made with good faith. I, however, cannot with good conscience support it. I am so sorry, Madame President. But the cylon have no understanding of the meaning of the word freedom. How could they? Theyre programmed. Machines. Every time you take away one of our freedoms, every time you restrict or curtail one of our rights, we become one step closer to being like them. As the Vice President, I am bound to follow the administrations lead. As President... I should have no such strictures. Given the current situation, Im afraid that I have no alternative but to announce that I am, as of now, a candidate for the presidency.Roslin and her staff walk out of the press room. In the back #6 is giving Baltar a slow clap.Reporters: Are you you resigning the vice presidency? Are you a one-issue candidate? Are you being disloyal to the President?
Dualla Come on.
Apollo No, you come on.
Dualla Come on, come on, go.
Apollo Oh-- okay. Anyway, its only a temporary assignment. I should be back again in a couple of weeks.
Dualla Whyd the old man pick you?
Apollo One word. Starbuck.
Dualla Is she in hack again?
Apollo Not yet. But apparently, shes been driving commander Garner up one bulkhead and down the other ever since she took over flight training on--  whatd you call it? The beast? And since I wont be flying combat for a while, I-- mm.
Dualla Were you going to mention these?
Apollo Oh, yeah. Got promoted to Major.
Dualla Well, dont sound so happy!
Apollo It doesnt mean much.
Dualla I think it means a lot.
Apollo Oh, well, if you say so, then it must be true. Mm. Mm.
Tyrol Callie, whats going on?
Cally We were unloading one of the containers and then one of the crates shifted. So, we looked inside, and saw that something was moving.
Tyrol Did you call it in?
Cally Yeah, we shut door, and the marines are on their way.
Tyrol Give me a light.
Cally Chief, we dont know what were dealing with here. Dont you think we should wait? Chief!
Rya Is this the Galactica?
Tyrol Yeah.
Rya Are you Dr. Cottle?
Buster What the hell was that?
Shark I dont know. We should call it in.
Buster All right if you can. I gonna spin up the ftl drive just in case.
Shark Pegasus, this is Raptor 718.  Emergency. Request instructions.
Hoshi Say again, Shark.
Shark Pegasus...distress.
Hoshi Shark, repeat your last. Did you declare an emergency? Buster, Shark, do you read? Shark, repeat your last. Did you declare an emergency?
Sgt Commander Garner on deck.
Shark Buster, Shark, do you read?
Garner What have you got, Mr. Hoshi?
Hoshi Im not sure, sir. I think Buster and Shark are declaring an emergency, but their transmissions garbled. Weve lost them, sir.
Starbuck Welcome aboard, Major.
Apollo I didnt expect a welcoming committee.
Starbuck Dont flatter yourself. I was in the neighborhood.
Sgt Major Adama, sir.
Garner Major Adama.
Apollo Commander Garner.
Garner Glad to see you, Major. Although I wish it was under better circumstances. We have just lost contact with two of our raptors out on a training mission.
Starbuck What? When did that happen?
Garner Captain Thrace. Perhaps if you were actually down on the flight deck and monitoring your raptors the way any training officer worth a damn would have done, you would know that four of our pilots were missing. Major? You with me, Major?
Apollo Yes, sir.
Garner The disappeared from the dradis about an hour ago. Theyre gone.
Starbuck Shut the hell up! We lose two raptors in a training mission, and I only find out when the commander throws it in my face. Dont all speak at once.
Pilot Sir, its been made clear that discussing flight deck situations with anyone outside Pegasus crew is not allowed. Sorry, sir.
Starbuck And whose frakkin bright idea was that? It was Garner, wasnt it? Of course it was. So barely competent and paranoid. Huh, theres a hell of a combination.
Garner I have a problem. That problems name is Kara Thrace.
Apollo I-I know to handle her, sir. And for the record, she is one hell of a viper pilot.
Garner What? I should cut her some slack because shes good in the cockpit. Is that what youre saying? Because nobody ever cut us any slack in the engine room. I could tell you that right now. But then, uh, I dont know, maybe being a snipe is different than being a viper jockey. No flashy stunts for us. No flying by the seat of our pants down there!

You know, Major, I think some of the people around here could learn a thing or two from the snipes.
Tori Im sorry, Madame President. But its that time.
Roslin Oh. Campaign meeting.
Tori Mm-hmm, weve been putting it off for weeks. And we do have a Presidential election coming up unless youve decided not to run.
Roslin Yeah, and to be perfectly honest with you, Tori, Ive thought about it a few times. But, um, no, Im still here. Theres so much to do. So-- lets talk politics.
Tori Great. Here are the results from our first fleet-wide poll.
Roslin How did you manage this?
Tori I was precinct Captain for the federalist party in delphi for five years. We did polls to see what the mayor should have for lunch. For what its worth, youve managed to walk a very fine line. Youre Presidential bid has the support of both the  military and the civilian fleet, and youve received enthusiastic endorsements from the Gemenese religious leaders.
Roslin Well, it helps when your only real rival is a convicted terrorist.
Zarek Am I capable of leading this fleet? Absolutely. And for a time, I almost had a chance. Until Laura Roslin ascended from politician to prophet. The truth is I cant win. But you could.
Baltar You flatter me, Mr. Zarek. Really. But Im not sure Im cut out for a life in politics as I find the vice presidency and everything to do with it very tedious.
Zarek I would imagine carrying water for Roslin would get old after a time. But its the office that makes you the perfect  candidate, doctor. Youre pre-sold.
Baltar Really? To whom?
Zarek Youd be surprised how many people crave the assurances of cold science as opposed to the superstitious ravings of the Gemenese. As a scientist, you offer hope. Think about it.
Baltar And you, Tom. Youll just step aside... will you?
Zarek Im just happy to back a man of true conviction. A man...who remembers his friends.
Case Attention on deck.
Apollo At ease. Wheres Stinger?
Starbuck Hes in hack for mouthing off to Garner. Stepped on his precious little toes.
Case Frakking Garner.
Case Hes such an idiot.
Apollo All right, lock that up! Get something straight. We got two missing raptor crews who are gonna be out of oxygen in 36 hours. Thats all that matters. So, everyone knock off the schoolyard crap and start doing your frakkin jobs. Now... we need to start thinking outside the box. Which is supposed to be what you do best.
Starbuck Sorry, Major.
Apollo All right. I wanna know everything there is to know about these missing raptors and their crews. I wanna know personal quirks, aircraft squawks, wireless transmissions, anything that might help. Good. Get to it.
Adama How is she?
Cottle Ryas four months pregnant and doesnt want to be. I understand the Gemenese have a problem with women terminating their pregnancies.
Adama Tyrol said that she asked for you by name. Do you want to tell me what thats really all about?
Cottle Pretty straightforward, really. I get a note that a girls on the way. She arrives. I do my work. And then she leaves. I dont ask a lot of questions. Youre gonna start. I wanna talk to her.
Adama Im Admiral Adama. Dont worry, Ive just come to talk.
Cottle It doesnt matter what you say. Im not gonna change my mind.
Adama Your parents are a little worried about you. Theyve contacted me through the Gemenon representative.
Rya My parents. Gods. Do you have any idea what they would do to me? Please, do not send me back.
Adama Youre a stowaway. Aboard a military ship.
Cottle Some people might say she was a victim of political persecution. Hell. She could apply for asylum.
Rya Asylum. Thats it. I want asylum.
Porter Under Gemenon law, the girl is still the property of her parents. And they can deal with her once shes safely back on her ship. To be honest, Im more concerned with the broader implications of this matter.
Roslin Sarah.
Porter I know you dont want to hear this. But my people, my voters are demanding action on this issue.

Roslin Im not turning that girl over. Im certainly not banning abortion.
Tori Then dont. But we have to move aggressively on this thing. Im arranging a conference call with you and the quorum. This is gonna get out of hand fast.
Adama Shes not Billy.
Roslin No, shes not. What?
Adama I hate to say this. Because I know that this is a political issue. The fact is that that number doesnt go up very often.
Roslin I fought for a womans right to control her body my entire career. No. No.
Adama Im just remembering what you said. Right after the cylon attack. That if we really want to save the human race, wed better start having babies.
Starbuck Nothing, nothing, and more nothing. Where... Is sharks last transmission?
Case Well...theres not much there.
Starbuck ...Eve...distress...bearing.. reek...shuns...emerge-- read. They were in distress.
Case They...give a bearing requesting instructions... its an emergency... can you read?
Starbuck Maybe, but whats this eve fragment here? ..Eve...distress. Eve...distress. Eve. Recei-received? Received distress call.
Case Okay. From who?
Starbuck I dont know. But maybe thats where they went. To go find out.
Apollo Commander, Captain Thrace has a theory about our missing raptors, sir.
Garner Thats good considering she lost them.
Starbuck Excuse me?
Garner Well, they were out on one of your so-called training missions. Werent they, Captain?
Starbuck My so-called training missions.
Apollo Okay, lets just take this easy.
Garner Thats when youre not boozing or sowing mutiny amongst the crew.
Starbuck Mutiny?
Apollo Commander, we should take this to a private place.
Garner Dont you think I know whats happening on my own ship? Barely competent? And paranoid?
Starbuck That was off the record. I was just venting. Accurately.
Garner Ill have you court-martialled.
Apollo Commander. Im not defending Captain Thraces behavior.
Starbuck Thanks, Major.
Garner Captain Thrace, youre restricted to quarters. Until I can ship you back to Galactica. Youre Adamas pet. Let him deal with you.
Starbuck Gentlemen.
Garner Major?
Apollo Yes, sir.
Apollo Youve been on board less than four days, and youre already facing charges. You dont waste any time, do you?
Starbuck Neither do you, Lee. Hows it feel being Garners new playmate?
Apollo Im here to do a job!
Starbuck Yeah. Keep a loudmouth, disobedient frak of Kara Thrace in line. Not doing such a good job, are ya? Evidently not.
Apollo We dont have much time. Those guys are running out of air.
Starbuck Yeah, well, I tried. All right? All I have done since I got to the beast is try and help, and all Ive gotten is Garners foot in my ass.
Apollo Well, maybe you need a kick in the ass!
Starbuck All right. Here we go. Finally. What is your problem anyway?
Apollo Whats my problem? Whats my problem? Well Kara, my problem is you. You keep frakking up, and I keep having to clean it up, and I am officially... sick of it.
Starbuck Poor Lee, your life is so hard, isnt it?
Apollo You mean, since I got shot.
Starbuck You wanna hear what I think happened to Buster, or not?
Red_Devil Pegasus, Red Devil. Im nearing the last coordinates where our raptors went missing.
Red_Devil Buster, is that you? Buster, this is Red Devil, man. Is that you, buddy? Come back to me.
Shark Power failure...oxygens almost out...help us. For love of the gods, help.
Apollo Sir! one of our search raptors just picked up a possible distress signal from near where Pegasus lost communications with Busters ship.
Garner Finally.
Apollo Possible distress signal. Theres a theory that Buster himself might have jumped away to run down a phony distress call. It could be a trap.
Garner A theory? Is this your theory, Major? This is Captain Thraces theory, is it not? Mr. Thornton. Can you give us a fix on where this distress signal is coming from?
Thorton Yes, sir, its long range, over 40 SU away.
Garner Then spin up the ftl drive, and prepare to jump the ship.
Thorton Yes, sir.
Apollo Sir! This isnt just Captain Thraces theory. I think this is a cylon trap, and--
Garner And I disagree. Now get Admiral Adama on the line. Im going to get our men.
Garner Admiral, we finally got the break weve been looking for bearing on the distress signal. I can jump there inside of two minutes.
Adama Commander, believe me, I understand how you feel. But the cylons have been known to lure ships into traps. Using fake distressed calls. Have you considered that?
Garner We have, sir. Its a scenario we dont think likely.
Adama We? Major Adama, do you concur?
Apollo Sir-- Captain Thrace and I are of the opinion that the first two raptors may very well have been lured away by just such a trick.
Garner An opinion I do not share, sir.
Adama Well send a recon mission in full force. Five raptors. Three escort, two rescue. You have your orders, Commander.
Garner Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Thank you, Major. Im sure your expertise is needed elsewhere.
Apollo Yes, sir.
Baltar Yes, I am curious. Why the sudden interest in the fleets demographic projections?
Roslin An issue has emerged that may prove divisive to our administration. I would like all the facts in hand before making my decision.
#6 So, now its our administration? She must be desperate.
Baltar Well, Im a very busy man. Luckily, I made an initial calculation on these figures over seven months ago when nobody seemed interested or concerned. All I had to do was factor in the numbers from the Pegasus crew. It took me hardly any time at all, and I didnt mind. Look, Ill save you the bother, you neednt read the report. If we continue on our present course, within the next 18 years, the human race will simply be... extinct.
Roslin Since assuming the presidency, Ive made it my mission to maintain the rights and freedoms we so enjoyed prior to the attack. one of these rights has now come into direct conflict with the survival of the species. And I find myself forced to make a very difficult decision. The issue is stark. The fact is that if the civilization is to survive, we must, must repopulate this fleet. Therefore, Im issuing an executive order. From this day forward, anyone seeking to interfere with a birth of child, whether it be the mother... or a medical practitioner-- Shall be subject to criminal penalty. Thank you.
Thorton All flight deck personnel, please report to stations.
Case All right, come on, lets go, lets go!
Apollo Captain Case, whats going on?
Case Weve been ordered to scramble, condition one. Ships getting ready to jump. Were gonna launch on the other side.
Apollo Get down to the hangar deck!
Starbuck What?
Apollo Look. Youre the best pilot weve got. So, get down there. Find a viper.
Starbuck Its about time you admitted that!
Apollo Commander, whats our sitrep?
Garner This is a rescue mission, Major.
Apollo On whose authority?
Garner Mine. Im bringing my pilots home.
Apollo With all due respect, sir.  But if this is a cylon trap, then we are entering blind! We should send a force recon--
Garner My pilots are dying down there, Major! Im going in, Im not waiting on recon!
Apollo Commander, this is in direct violation of the Admirals orders.
Garner Major. Leave combat.
Apollo Making this an illegal action on your part, sir!
Garner You are relieved, Major! Sergeant of the guard.
Apollo I am forced to take command of this vessel!
Garner This man is in direct disobedience of an order-- under federal regulations i want him under arrest! I place you under arrest! Sergeant. Take him below.
Apollo Sergeant, the commanders been properly relieved. Escort him to his quarters.
Garner This man is not a member of this crew, and you will obey a direct order that you have been given by me, and you will do it  now.
Sgt Major. Youll come with me.
Geata Admiral! The Pegasus has jumped. Theyre gone.
Hoshi Dradis signals clean. Jump put is clear of any interference. Sir, I show two raptors. Transponder codes match. Theyre ours.
Garner Mr. Hoshi. Tell the CAG to launch our recovery team, and lets bring our people home.
Hoshi Aye, sir.
Red_Devil Pegasus, Red Devil. Our two birds look intact. Cant quite see inside yet. Commander, were unable to raise the raptors on wireless. Oh, my gods. Pegasus, both raptor crews are dead. I repeat. Theyre all dead.
Hoshi Sir, three cylon base ships just jumped into weapons range. Oh, my gods. Theyre launching nukes! Brace for impact.
Garner Damage report?
Hoshi Two...two nuclear detonations in the stern, sir.
Throton Ftl drive inoperative, sir.
Helm Were stuck here, sir.
Starbuck All right, Showboat. You take red squadron. Hit em on the right. Catbird, you take green. Hit em on the left.The rest of you, follow me. Were going straight up the gut.
Apollo Sergeant, I think you have better things to do.
Garner Oh, then the spinners fine? Its gotta be a sensor. Just pull it. No, no, listen to me. Listen to me. Just pull it, pull it!
Hoshi Nuclear detonation. We have structural damage along the topside heat exchanger. We cant take much more of this.
Apollo How long before those drives are back up?
Garner I dont know. They dont seem to understand. I need to go down there. You have the con.
Apollo Yes, sir. I have the con. Make for the nearest base ship. And roll us over to keep our top side out of their line of fire. Hoshi, contact Starbuck in case-- tell them Ive assumed command. And to concentrate on protecting our top side.
Hoshi Aye, sir.
Starbuck Wilco, Pegasus. We got your back.
Adama Mr. Gaeta, any contact?
Geata Negative, sir.
Garner Can I get through there?
Thorton Base ship dead ahead, were closing rapidly! We cant keep taking hits like this, Major.
Apollo Helm. Steady as you go. Have the bow battery stand by for a salvo fire. Target their center axis.
Helm Yes, sir.
Apollo See if we cant cut down the odds. We need those FTLs fixed soon. Or were dead.
Throton Twenty-two hundred. Main battery has a firing solution.
Apollo And fire.
Crewman Coolant pressures off-scale low.
Garner Primary inlets choked.
Crewman Pressures dropping. We gotta hull breach in there somewhere.
Garner Well, we gotta get in there, and open the auxiliary valve!
Crewman We cant do that, sir!
Garner We have to!
Crewman Sir, that breach can vent all our oxygen into space.
Garner We dont have a choice. Now, open the hatch. Breathing gear?
Crewman We used it all up fighting the fires, sir.
Garner Give me sledge and a number 12 spanner. All right. Now close this hatch behind me. Were losing air, close the gods damn  hatch. Close it!
Hoshi Starbuck reports vipers are skosh ammo, Major. Were down to throwing rocks at the bastards. We gotta haul ass outta here now, sir! Sir!
Apollo Come on, Garner.
Crewman O2s in the red, skipper. Youre almost out of air.
Crewman You got it! The pressures coming back up. Now get the frak outta there, come on! Youre air is gone, skipper! Get outta  there! Skipper? Skipper?
Hoshi Engineerings reporting a green board. FTL drive online and ready.
Apollo Okay, commence jump prep. Bring our birds home.
Starbuck Pegasus, Starbuck. Nobody behind me but toasters. Now get us outta here!
Hoshi Air wings back on board. Landing bays secure.
Apollo Jump!
Adama You give Garner a lot of credit. Well, its all true.
Apollo He gave his life to save the ship.
Adama Starbucks report wasnt so kind.
Apollo Well, she had her perspective. And I had mine.
Adama In your opinion, off the record... what was Garners flaw?
Apollo He was used to working with machines. Command is about people.
Adama Remember that. I want you to take command... of the beast. Garner was my decision. His failures my responsibility. Dont let me fail a second time. Congratulations, Commander.
Porter Madame President? Word has it that you do not intend to prosecute the Gemenese girl on Galactica.
Roslin She has a name, Sarah. I think that Rya has suffered enough. Shes just been through an abortion. Ive granted her asylum aboard Galactica.
Porter This is in total violation of the law.
Roslin My order came after she sought her procedure. No laws have been broken.
Porter The girl belongs at home, with her parents. I insist.
Roslin You have your pound of flesh. And I suggest you take your victory, and you move on.
Tori Maam?
Starbuck You realize youre screwed, right? All the pressure, the responsibility, the sleepless nights, all the officers giving you a hard time.
Apollo Yeah, well, it could be worse. You could be my CAG.
Starbuck Im gonna stay here and be Galacticas CAG. Something about wanting to keep an eye on me.
Apollo Well, you and Colonel Tigh have a lot of fun at those early morning briefings. Cause the XOs a lot of fun first thing.
Starbuck Mm, great. Congratulations. Really. Congratulations. You deserve it.
Apollo I know why I was mad at you, Kara. A simple thank you would have been sufficient. Cause you were doing what you always did. Buck authority, and get away with it. I bucked authority once. And I almost lost everything. So I guess when I showed up on Pegasus, and there you were doing it all over again-- I dont know. Pissed me off. Doesnt make a lot of sense, does it?
Starbuck You should hear the way my brain works sometimes. Are we okay?
Apollo You have a brain? Yeah. Yeah were okay.
Playa Madame President, your decision to criminalize abortion has created a furor. Do you think thats hurt your standing in the polls?
Roslin Absolutely.
Baltar If I may, Madame President. It is true in the light of recent events, the President may have lost support in some quarters. I  would ask the people to understand that if this is an extreme decision, we live in extreme times. The decision has been made with good faith. I, however, cannot with good conscience support it. I am so sorry, Madame President. But the cylon have no understanding of the meaning of the word freedom. How could they? Theyre programmed. Machines. Every time you take away one of our freedoms, every time you restrict or curtail one of our rights, we become one step closer to being like them. As the Vice President, I am bound to follow the administrations lead. As President... I should have no such strictures. Given the current situation, Im afraid that I have no alternative but to announce that I am, as of now, a candidate for the presidency.
Reporters Are you you resigning the vice presidency? Are you a one-issue candidate? Are you being disloyal to the President?
