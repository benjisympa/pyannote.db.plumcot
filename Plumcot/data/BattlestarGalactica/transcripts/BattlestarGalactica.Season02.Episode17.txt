lt_richard_baier Pegasus, Buster. Dradis intercept training birds are away.
lt_louis_hoshi Buster, Pegasus, roger that, take station-- be advised, communications will suffer sporadic interruptions due to stellar EMI activity. Acknowledge?
lt_richard_baier Pegasus, Buster, acknowledge. Our communications suck! Is it gonna be like this all day?
eco_lyla_ellway Big time. Those binaries are putting out so much EMI, even the dradis is barely working.
lt_richard_baier Well, Im gonna a little distance between us and the fleet. Get us out of the soup. See if we can get a cleaner dradis picture.
tucker_clellan Hey! Whoevers in there, times up! Lets go, come on! Gotta a couple of tired viper jockeys out here wanna sleep.
cpt_lee_adama Go hit the showers Duck! Well be gone by the time you get back. U-uh.
officer_anastasia_dualla How you feel?
cpt_lee_adama Mm, not great. But Cottles given me the thumbs-up and its been almost a month, so I guess its back to work.
officer_anastasia_dualla So you ready to go into the belly of the beast?
cpt_lee_adama The beast?
officer_anastasia_dualla Yeah. Thats what they call the Pegasus now. Galacticas the bucket.
cpt_lee_adama The bucket and the beast. Huh. Dont we make a pair? Dualla: Come on.Apollo: No, you come on. Dualla: Come on, come on, go.Apollo: Oh-- okay. Anyway, its only a temporary assignment. I should be back again in a couple of weeks. Dualla: Whyd the old man pick you? Apollo: One word. Starbuck.Dualla: Is she in hack again?Apollo: Not yet. But apparently, shes been driving commander Garner up one bulkhead and down the other ever since she took over flight training on-- whatd you call it? The beast? And since I wont be flying combat for a while, I-- mm.Apollo starts to get dressed, Dualla hugs him from behind.Dualla: Were you going to mention these? Dont all speak at once. Pilot: Sir, its been made clear that discussing flight deck situations with anyone outside Pegasus crew is not allowed. Sorry, sir.Starbuck: And whose frakkin bright idea was that? It was Garner, wasnt it? Of course it was. So barely competent and paranoid. Huh, theres a hell of a combination. Pegasus - Garners OfficeGarner: I have a problem. That problems name is Kara Thrace. Apollo: I-I know to handle her, sir. And for the record, she is one hell of a viper pilot. Garner: What? I should cut her some slack because shes good in the cockpit. Is that what youre saying? Because nobody ever cut us any slack in the engine room. I could tell you that right now. But then, uh, I dont know, maybe being a snipe is different than being a viper jockey. No flashy stunts for us. No flying by the seat of our pants down there! The engine room is like a finely tuned watch, and everything in it needs to be monitored and maintained in a very precise fashion. Nobody freelances. Everything is done in the proper way at the proper timein the proper order! Or thered be no power. No lights. No hot showers for your flyboys. You know, Major, I think some of the people around here could learn a thing or two from the snipes. Colonial oneTori: Im sorry, Madame President. But its that time. Roslin: Oh. Campaign meeting.Tori: Mm-hmm, weve been putting it off for weeks. And we do have a Presidential election coming up unless youve decided not to run. Roslin: Yeah, and to be perfectly honest with you, Tori, Ive thought about it a few times. But, um, no, Im still here. Theres so much to do. So-- lets talk politics.Tori: Great. Here are the results from our first fleet-wide poll. Roslin: How did you manage this?Tori: I was precinct Captain for the federalist party in delphi for five years. We did polls to see what the mayor should have for lunch. For what its worth, youve managed to walk a very fine line. Youre Presidential bid has the support of both the military and the civilian fleet, and youve received enthusiastic endorsements from the Gemenese religious leaders. Roslin: Well, it helps when your only real rival is a convicted terrorist. Cloud Nine - StateroomZarek: Am I capable of leading this fleet? Absolutely. And for a time, I almost had a chance. Until Laura Roslin ascended from politician to prophet. The truth is I cant win. But you could. Baltar: You flatter me, Mr. Zarek. Really. But Im not sure Im cut out for a life in politics as I find the vice presidency and everything to do with it very tedious. Zarek: I would imagine carrying water for Roslin would get old after a time. But its the office that makes you the perfect candidate, doctor. Youre pre-sold. Baltar: Really? To whom? Zarek: Youd be surprised how many people crave the assurances of cold science as opposed to the superstitious ravings of the Gemenese. As a scientist, you offer hope. Think about it. Baltar: And you, Tom. Youll just step aside... will you?Zarek: Im just happy to back a man of true conviction. A man...who remembers his friends. Pegasus - Briefing RoomCase: Attention on deck.Apollo: At ease. Wheres Stinger? Starbuck: Hes in hack for mouthing off to Garner. Stepped on his precious little toes. Case: Frakking Garner. Pilots: Do you have any idea what they would do to me? Please, do not send me back. Adama: Youre a stowaway. Aboard a military ship. Cottle: Some people might say she was a victim of political persecution. Hell. She could apply for asylum. Rya: Asylum. Thats it. I want asylum. Colonial onePorter: Under Gemenon law, the girl is still the property of her parents. And they can deal with her once shes safely back on her ship. To be honest, Im more concerned with the broader implications of this matter. Roslin: Sarah. Porter: I know you dont want to hear this. But my people, my voters are demanding action on this issue. Roslin: We have been through this. Abortion was legal under colonial law before the attacks, and so it is still legal today. Porter: Its obscene. The scriptures view abortion as an abomination in the eyes of the gods. You cannot equivocate on this point if want our support in the coming election. Roslin: Rya Kibbys petition for asylum is under review. Thank you, Sarah, very much for coming in. Porter leaves.Roslin: Im not turning that girl over. Im certainly not banning abortion. Tori: Then dont. But we have to move aggressively on this thing. Im arranging a conference call with you and the quorum. This is gonna get out of hand fast. Tori leaves.Adama: Shes not Billy. Roslin: No, shes not. What?Adama: I hate to say this. Because I know that this is a political issue. The fact is that that number doesnt go up very often. Roslin: I fought for a womans right to control her body my entire career. No. No.Adama: Im just remembering what you said. Right after the cylon attack. That if we really want to save the human race, wed better start having babies. Pegasus - Breifing RoomStarbuck: Nothing, nothing, and more nothing. Where... Is sharks last transmission? Case: Well...theres not much there.Starbuck: ...Eve...distress...bearing.. reek...shuns...emerge-- read. They were in distress. Case: They...give a bearing requesting instructions... its an emergency... can you read? Starbuck: Maybe, but whats this eve fragment here? ..Eve...distress. Eve...distress. Eve. Recei-received? Received distress call.Case: Okay. From who? Starbuck: I dont know. But maybe thats where they went. To go find out. Pegasus - CICApollo: Commander, Captain Thrace has a theory about our missing raptors, sir. Garner: Thats good considering she lost them. Starbuck: Excuse me?Garner: Well, they were out on one of your so-called training missions. Werent they, Captain? Starbuck: My so-called training missions. Apollo: Okay, lets just take this easy. Garner: Thats when youre not boozing or sowing mutiny amongst the crew. Starbuck: Mutiny?Apollo: Commander, we should take this to a private place. Garner: Dont you think I know whats happening on my own ship? Barely competent? And paranoid?Starbuck: That was off the record. I was just venting. Accurately. Garner: Ill have you court-martialled. Apollo: Commander. Im not defending Captain Thraces behavior. Starbuck: Thanks, Major.Garner: Captain Thrace, youre restricted to quarters. Until I can ship you back to Galactica. Youre Adamas pet. Let him deal with you.Starbuck: Gentlemen.Garner: Major?Apollo: Yes, sir.Pegasus - PIlots QuartersApollo: Youve been on board less than four days, and youre already facing charges. You dont waste any time, do you? Starbuck: Neither do you, Lee. Hows it feel being Garners new playmate? Apollo: Im here to do a job! Starbuck: Yeah. Keep a loudmouth, disobedient frak of Kara Thrace in line. Not doing such a good job, are ya? Evidently not. Apollo: We dont have much time. Those guys are running out of air. Starbuck: Yeah, well, I tried. All right? All I have done since I got to the beast is try and help, and all Ive gotten is Garners foot in my ass. Apollo: Well, maybe you need a kick in the ass! Starbuck: All right. Here we go. Finally. What is your problem anyway?Apollo: Whats my problem? Whats my problem? Well Kara, my problem is you. You keep frakking up, and I keep having to clean it up, and I am officially... sick of it.Starbuck: Poor Lee, your life is so hard, isnt it? Apollo: You mean, since I got shot.Starbuck: You wanna hear what I think happened to Buster, or not?RaptorRed Devil: Pegasus, Red Devil. Im nearing the last coordinates where our raptors went missing. Busteremergency...distress.Red Devil: Buster, is that you? Buster, this is Red Devil, man. Is that you, buddy? Come back to me. SharkGet down to the hangar deck! Starbuck: What?Apollo: Look. Youre the best pilot weve got. So, get down there. Find a viper. Starbuck: Its about time you admitted that!Apollo goes into the CICApollo: Commander, whats our sitrep? Garner: This is a rescue mission, Major. Apollo: On whose authority? Garner: Mine. Im bringing my pilots home. Apollo: With all due respect, sir. But if this is a cylon trap, then we are entering blind! We should send a force recon-- Garner: My pilots are dying down there, Major! Im going in, Im not waiting on recon! Apollo: Commander, this is in direct violation of the Admirals orders. Garner: Major. Leave combat. Apollo: Making this an illegal action on your part, sir! Garner: You are relieved, Major! Sergeant of the guard. Apollo: I am forced to take command of this vessel! Garner: This man is in direct disobedience of an order-- under federal regulations i want him under arrest! I place you under arrest! Sergeant. Take him below. Apollo: Sergeant, the commanders been properly relieved. Escort him to his quarters. Garner: This man is not a member of this crew, and you will obey a direct order that you have been given by me, and you will do it now.Sgt: Major. Youll come with me.Galactica - CICThe Pegasus jumps away.Geata: Admiral! The Pegasus has jumped. Theyre gone. Pegasus - CICHoshi: Dradis signals clean. Jump put is clear of any interference. Sir, I show two raptors. Transponder codes match. Theyre ours.Garner: Mr. Hoshi. Tell the CAG to launch our recovery team, and lets bring our people home. Hoshi: Aye, sir.RaptorA raptor nears the two missing raptors.Red Devil: Pegasus, Red Devil. Our two birds look intact. Cant quite see inside yet. Commander, were unable to raise the raptors on wireless. Oh, my gods. Pegasus, both raptor crews are dead. I repeat. Theyre all dead. Pegasus - CICHoshi: Sir, three cylon base ships just jumped into weapons range. Oh, my gods. Theyre launching nukes! Brace for impact.Two nukes deotnate against the hull, causing a lot of damage.Garner: Damage report?Hoshi: Two...two nuclear detonations in the stern, sir. Throton: Ftl drive inoperative, sir. Helm: Were stuck here, sir. VipersThe vipers are launched to fight off the Cylon attack.Starbuck: All right, Showboat. You take red squadron. Hit em on the right. Catbird, you take green. Hit em on the left.The rest of you, follow me. Were going straight up the gut. Pegasus - CICApollo: Sergeant, I think you have better things to do. Im gonna stay here and be Galacticas CAG. Something about wanting to keep an eye on me. Apollo: Well, you and Colonel Tigh have a lot of fun at those early morning briefings. Cause the XOs a lot of fun first thing. Starbuck: Mm, great. Congratulations. Really. Congratulations. You deserve it. Apollo: I know why I was mad at you, Kara. A simple thank you would have been sufficient. Cause you were doing what you always did. Buck authority, and get away with it. I bucked authority once. And I almost lost everything. So I guess when I showed up on Pegasus, and there you were doing it all over again-- I dont know. Pissed me off. Doesnt make a lot of sense, does it? Starbuck: You should hear the way my brain works sometimes. Are we okay?Apollo: You have a brain? Yeah. Yeah were okay.Starbuck gives Apollo a friendly smack after the brain remark. They laugh and hug each other. During the hug, many fans claim to hear Apollo whisper forever after he says that they are okay. Some only hear a deep breath from Apollo or Starbuck. Either way, Starbuck follows the remark with a smile.Colonial onePlaya: Madame President, your decision to criminalize abortion has created a furor. Do you think thats hurt your standing in the polls? Roslin: Absolutely.Baltar: If I may, Madame President. It is true in the light of recent events, the President may have lost support in some quarters. I would ask the people to understand that if this is an extreme decision, we live in extreme times. The decision has been made with good faith. I, however, cannot with good conscience support it. I am so sorry, Madame President. But the cylon have no understanding of the meaning of the word freedom. How could they? Theyre programmed. Machines. Every time you take away one of our freedoms, every time you restrict or curtail one of our rights, we become one step closer to being like them. As the Vice President, I am bound to follow the administrations lead. As President... I should have no such strictures. Given the current situation, Im afraid that I have no alternative but to announce that I am, as of now, a candidate for the presidency.Roslin and her staff walk out of the press room. In the back #6 is giving Baltar a slow clap.Reporters: Are you you resigning the vice presidency? Are you a one-issue candidate? Are you being disloyal to the President?
officer_anastasia_dualla Come on.
cpt_lee_adama No, you come on.
officer_anastasia_dualla Come on, come on, go.
cpt_lee_adama Oh-- okay. Anyway, its only a temporary assignment. I should be back again in a couple of weeks.
officer_anastasia_dualla Whyd the old man pick you?
cpt_lee_adama One word. Starbuck.
officer_anastasia_dualla Is she in hack again?
cpt_lee_adama Not yet. But apparently, shes been driving commander Garner up one bulkhead and down the other ever since she took over flight training on-- whatd you call it? The beast? And since I wont be flying combat for a while, I-- mm.
officer_anastasia_dualla Were you going to mention these?
cpt_lee_adama Oh, yeah. Got promoted to Major.
officer_anastasia_dualla Well, dont sound so happy!
cpt_lee_adama It doesnt mean much.
officer_anastasia_dualla I think it means a lot.
cpt_lee_adama Oh, well, if you say so, then it must be true. Mm. Mm.
chief_galen_tyrol Callie, whats going on?
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson We were unloading one of the containers and then one of the crates shifted. So, we looked inside, and saw that something was moving.
chief_galen_tyrol Did you call it in?
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Yeah, we shut door, and the marines are on their way.
chief_galen_tyrol Give me a light.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Chief, we dont know what were dealing with here. Dont you think we should wait? Chief!
rya_kibby Is this the Galactica?
chief_galen_tyrol Yeah.
rya_kibby Are you Dr. Cottle?
lt_richard_baier What the hell was that?
eco_lyla_ellway I dont know. We should call it in.
lt_richard_baier All right if you can. I gonna spin up the ftl drive just in case.
eco_lyla_ellway Pegasus, this is Raptor 718. Emergency. Request instructions.
lt_louis_hoshi Say again, Shark.
eco_lyla_ellway Pegasus...distress.
lt_louis_hoshi Shark, repeat your last. Did you declare an emergency? Buster, Shark, do you read? Shark, repeat your last. Did you declare an emergency?
pegasus_sergeant Commander Garner on deck.
eco_lyla_ellway Buster, Shark, do you read?
commander_barry_garner What have you got, Mr. Hoshi?
lt_louis_hoshi Im not sure, sir. I think Buster and Shark are declaring an emergency, but their transmissions garbled. Weve lost them, sir.
captain_kara_thrace Welcome aboard, Major.
cpt_lee_adama I didnt expect a welcoming committee.
captain_kara_thrace Dont flatter yourself. I was in the neighborhood.
pegasus_sergeant Major Adama, sir.
commander_barry_garner Major Adama.
cpt_lee_adama Commander Garner.
commander_barry_garner Glad to see you, Major. Although I wish it was under better circumstances. We have just lost contact with two of our raptors out on a training mission.
captain_kara_thrace What? When did that happen?
commander_barry_garner Captain Thrace. Perhaps if you were actually down on the flight deck and monitoring your raptors the way any training officer worth a damn would have done, you would know that four of our pilots were missing. Major? You with me, Major?
cpt_lee_adama Yes, sir.
commander_barry_garner The disappeared from the dradis about an hour ago. Theyre gone.
captain_kara_thrace Shut the hell up! We lose two raptors in a training mission, and I only find out when the commander throws it in my face. Dont all speak at once.
Pilot#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode17 Sir, its been made clear that discussing flight deck situations with anyone outside Pegasus crew is not allowed. Sorry, sir.
captain_kara_thrace And whose frakkin bright idea was that? It was Garner, wasnt it? Of course it was. So barely competent and paranoid. Huh, theres a hell of a combination.
commander_barry_garner I have a problem. That problems name is Kara Thrace.
cpt_lee_adama I-I know to handle her, sir. And for the record, she is one hell of a viper pilot.
commander_barry_garner What? I should cut her some slack because shes good in the cockpit. Is that what youre saying? Because nobody ever cut us any slack in the engine room.

tory_foster Im sorry, Madame President. But its that time.
president_laura_roslin Oh. Campaign meeting.
tory_foster Mm-hmm, weve been putting it off for weeks. And we do have a Presidential election coming up unless youve decided not to run.
president_laura_roslin Yeah, and to be perfectly honest with you, Tori, Ive thought about it a few times. But, um, no, Im still here. Theres so much to do. So-- lets talk politics.
tory_foster Great. Here are the results from our first fleet-wide poll.
president_laura_roslin How did you manage this?
tory_foster I was precinct Captain for the federalist party in delphi for five years. We did polls to see what the mayor should have for lunch. For what its worth, youve managed to walk a very fine line. Youre Presidential bid has the support of both the military and the civilian fleet, and youve received enthusiastic endorsements from the Gemenese religious leaders.

tom_zarek Am I capable of leading this fleet? Absolutely. And for a time, I almost had a chance. Until Laura Roslin ascended from politician to prophet. The truth is I cant win. But you could.
dr_gaius_baltar You flatter me, Mr. Zarek. Really. But Im not sure Im cut out for a life in politics as I find the vice presidency and everything to do with it very tedious.
tom_zarek I would imagine carrying water for Roslin would get old after a time. But its the office that makes you the perfect candidate, doctor. Youre pre-sold.
dr_gaius_baltar Really? To whom?
tom_zarek Youd be surprised how many people crave the assurances of cold science as opposed to the superstitious ravings of the Gemenese. As a scientist, you offer hope. Think about it.
dr_gaius_baltar And you, Tom. Youll just step aside... will you?
tom_zarek Im just happy to back a man of true conviction. A man...who remembers his friends.
cpt_marcia_case Attention on deck.
cpt_lee_adama At ease. Wheres Stinger?
captain_kara_thrace Hes in hack for mouthing off to Garner. Stepped on his precious little toes.
cpt_marcia_case Frakking Garner.
cpt_marcia_case Hes such an idiot.
cpt_lee_adama All right, lock that up! Get something straight. We got two missing raptor crews who are gonna be out of oxygen in 36 hours. Thats all that matters. So, everyone knock off the schoolyard crap and start doing your frakkin jobs. Now... we need to start thinking outside the box. Which is supposed to be what you do best.
captain_kara_thrace Sorry, Major.
cpt_lee_adama All right. I wanna know everything there is to know about these missing raptors and their crews. I wanna know personal quirks, aircraft squawks, wireless transmissions, anything that might help. Good. Get to it.
admiral_william_adama How is she?
dr_cottle Ryas four months pregnant and doesnt want to be. I understand the Gemenese have a problem with women terminating their pregnancies.
admiral_william_adama Tyrol said that she asked for you by name. Do you want to tell me what thats really all about?
dr_cottle Pretty straightforward, really. I get a note that a girls on the way. She arrives. I do my work. And then she leaves. I dont ask a lot of questions. Youre gonna start. I wanna talk to her.
admiral_william_adama Im Admiral Adama. Dont worry, Ive just come to talk.
dr_cottle It doesnt matter what you say. Im not gonna change my mind.
admiral_william_adama Your parents are a little worried about you. Theyve contacted me through the Gemenon representative.
rya_kibby My parents. Gods. Do you have any idea what they would do to me? Please, do not send me back.
admiral_william_adama Youre a stowaway. Aboard a military ship.
dr_cottle Some people might say she was a victim of political persecution. Hell. She could apply for asylum.
rya_kibby Asylum. Thats it. I want asylum.
sarah_porter Under Gemenon law, the girl is still the property of her parents. And they can deal with her once shes safely back on her ship. To be honest, Im more concerned with the broader implications of this matter.
president_laura_roslin Sarah.
sarah_porter I know you dont want to hear this. But my people, my voters are demanding action on this issue.

tory_foster Then dont. But we have to move aggressively on this thing. Im arranging a conference call with you and the quorum. This is gonna get out of hand fast.
admiral_william_adama Shes not Billy.
president_laura_roslin No, shes not. What?
admiral_william_adama I hate to say this. Because I know that this is a political issue. The fact is that that number doesnt go up very often.
president_laura_roslin I fought for a womans right to control her body my entire career. No. No.
admiral_william_adama Im just remembering what you said. Right after the cylon attack. That if we really want to save the human race, wed better start having babies.
captain_kara_thrace Nothing, nothing, and more nothing. Where... Is sharks last transmission?
cpt_marcia_case Well...theres not much there.
captain_kara_thrace ...Eve...distress...bearing.. reek...shuns...emerge-- read. They were in distress.
cpt_marcia_case They...give a bearing requesting instructions... its an emergency... can you read?
captain_kara_thrace Maybe, but whats this eve fragment here? ..Eve...distress. Eve...distress. Eve. Recei-received? Received distress call.
cpt_marcia_case Okay. From who?
captain_kara_thrace I dont know. But maybe thats where they went. To go find out.
cpt_lee_adama Commander, Captain Thrace has a theory about our missing raptors, sir.
commander_barry_garner Thats good considering she lost them.
captain_kara_thrace Excuse me?
commander_barry_garner Well, they were out on one of your so-called training missions. Werent they, Captain?
captain_kara_thrace My so-called training missions.
cpt_lee_adama Okay, lets just take this easy.
commander_barry_garner Thats when youre not boozing or sowing mutiny amongst the crew.
captain_kara_thrace Mutiny?
cpt_lee_adama Commander, we should take this to a private place.
commander_barry_garner Dont you think I know whats happening on my own ship? Barely competent? And paranoid?
captain_kara_thrace That was off the record. I was just venting. Accurately.
commander_barry_garner Ill have you court-martialled.
cpt_lee_adama Commander. Im not defending Captain Thraces behavior.
captain_kara_thrace Thanks, Major.
commander_barry_garner Captain Thrace, youre restricted to quarters. Until I can ship you back to Galactica. Youre Adamas pet. Let him deal with you.
captain_kara_thrace Gentlemen.
commander_barry_garner Major?
cpt_lee_adama Yes, sir.
cpt_lee_adama Youve been on board less than four days, and youre already facing charges. You dont waste any time, do you?
captain_kara_thrace Neither do you, Lee. Hows it feel being Garners new playmate?
cpt_lee_adama Im here to do a job!
captain_kara_thrace Yeah. Keep a loudmouth, disobedient frak of Kara Thrace in line. Not doing such a good job, are ya? Evidently not.
cpt_lee_adama We dont have much time. Those guys are running out of air.
captain_kara_thrace Yeah, well, I tried. All right? All I have done since I got to the beast is try and help, and all Ive gotten is Garners foot in my ass.
cpt_lee_adama Well, maybe you need a kick in the ass!
captain_kara_thrace All right. Here we go. Finally. What is your problem anyway?
cpt_lee_adama Whats my problem? Whats my problem? Well Kara, my problem is you. You keep frakking up, and I keep having to clean it up, and I am officially... sick of it.
captain_kara_thrace Poor Lee, your life is so hard, isnt it?
cpt_lee_adama You mean, since I got shot.
captain_kara_thrace You wanna hear what I think happened to Buster, or not?
Red_Devil#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode17 Pegasus, Red Devil. Im nearing the last coordinates where our raptors went missing.
Red_Devil#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode17 Buster, is that you? Buster, this is Red Devil, man. Is that you, buddy? Come back to me.
eco_lyla_ellway Power failure...oxygens almost out...help us. For love of the gods, help.
cpt_lee_adama Sir! one of our search raptors just picked up a possible distress signal from near where Pegasus lost communications with Busters ship.
commander_barry_garner Finally.
cpt_lee_adama Possible distress signal. Theres a theory that Buster himself might have jumped away to run down a phony distress call. It could be a trap.
commander_barry_garner A theory? Is this your theory, Major? This is Captain Thraces theory, is it not? Mr. Thornton. Can you give us a fix on where this distress signal is coming from?
ensign_abel_thornton Yes, sir, its long range, over 40 SU away.
commander_barry_garner Then spin up the ftl drive, and prepare to jump the ship.
ensign_abel_thornton Yes, sir.
cpt_lee_adama Sir! This isnt just Captain Thraces theory. I think this is a cylon trap, and--
commander_barry_garner And I disagree. Now get Admiral Adama on the line. Im going to get our men.
commander_barry_garner Admiral, we finally got the break weve been looking for bearing on the distress signal. I can jump there inside of two minutes.
admiral_william_adama Commander, believe me, I understand how you feel. But the cylons have been known to lure ships into traps. Using fake distressed calls. Have you considered that?
commander_barry_garner We have, sir. Its a scenario we dont think likely.
admiral_william_adama We? Major Adama, do you concur?
cpt_lee_adama Sir-- Captain Thrace and I are of the opinion that the first two raptors may very well have been lured away by just such a trick.
commander_barry_garner An opinion I do not share, sir.
admiral_william_adama Well send a recon mission in full force. Five raptors. Three escort, two rescue. You have your orders, Commander.
commander_barry_garner Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Thank you, Major. Im sure your expertise is needed elsewhere.
cpt_lee_adama Yes, sir.
dr_gaius_baltar Yes, I am curious. Why the sudden interest in the fleets demographic projections?
president_laura_roslin An issue has emerged that may prove divisive to our administration. I would like all the facts in hand before making my decision.
number_six So, now its our administration? She must be desperate.
dr_gaius_baltar Well, Im a very busy man. Luckily, I made an initial calculation on these figures over seven months ago when nobody seemed interested or concerned. All I had to do was factor in the numbers from the Pegasus crew. It took me hardly any time at all, and I didnt mind. Look, Ill save you the bother, you neednt read the report. If we continue on our present course, within the next 18 years, the human race will simply be... extinct.
president_laura_roslin Since assuming the presidency, Ive made it my mission to maintain the rights and freedoms we so enjoyed prior to the attack. one of these rights has now come into direct conflict with the survival of the species. And I find myself forced to make a very difficult decision. The issue is stark. The fact is that if the civilization is to survive, we must, must repopulate this fleet. Therefore, Im issuing an executive order.

cpt_lee_adama With all due respect, sir. But if this is a cylon trap, then we are entering blind! We should send a force recon--
commander_barry_garner My pilots are dying down there, Major! Im going in, Im not waiting on recon!
cpt_lee_adama Commander, this is in direct violation of the Admirals orders.
commander_barry_garner Major. Leave combat.
cpt_lee_adama Making this an illegal action on your part, sir!

pegasus_sergeant Major. Youll come with me.
lt_felix_gaeta Admiral! The Pegasus has jumped. Theyre gone.
lt_louis_hoshi Dradis signals clean. Jump put is clear of any interference. Sir, I show two raptors. Transponder codes match. Theyre ours.
commander_barry_garner Mr. Hoshi. Tell the CAG to launch our recovery team, and lets bring our people home.
lt_louis_hoshi Aye, sir.
Red_Devil#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode17 Pegasus, Red Devil. Our two birds look intact. Cant quite see inside yet. Commander, were unable to raise the raptors on wireless. Oh, my gods. Pegasus, both raptor crews are dead. I repeat. Theyre all dead.

cpt_lee_adama Sergeant, I think you have better things to do.
commander_barry_garner Oh, then the spinners fine? Its gotta be a sensor. Just pull it. No, no, listen to me. Listen to me. Just pull it, pull it!
lt_louis_hoshi Nuclear detonation. We have structural damage along the topside heat exchanger. We cant take much more of this.
cpt_lee_adama How long before those drives are back up?
commander_barry_garner I dont know. They dont seem to understand. I need to go down there. You have the con.
cpt_lee_adama Yes, sir. I have the con. Make for the nearest base ship. And roll us over to keep our top side out of their line of fire. Hoshi, contact Starbuck in case-- tell them Ive assumed command. And to concentrate on protecting our top side.
lt_louis_hoshi Aye, sir.
captain_kara_thrace Wilco, Pegasus. We got your back.
admiral_william_adama Mr. Gaeta, any contact?

ensign_abel_thornton Base ship dead ahead, were closing rapidly! We cant keep taking hits like this, Major.
cpt_lee_adama Helm. Steady as you go. Have the bow battery stand by for a salvo fire. Target their center axis.
Helm#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode17 Yes, sir.
cpt_lee_adama See if we cant cut down the odds. We need those FTLs fixed soon. Or were dead.
ensign_abel_thornton Twenty-two hundred. Main battery has a firing solution.
cpt_lee_adama And fire.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Coolant pressures off-scale low.
commander_barry_garner Primary inlets choked.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Pressures dropping. We gotta hull breach in there somewhere.
commander_barry_garner Well, we gotta get in there, and open the auxiliary valve!
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson We cant do that, sir!
commander_barry_garner We have to!
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Sir, that breach can vent all our oxygen into space.
commander_barry_garner We dont have a choice. Now, open the hatch. Breathing gear?
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson We used it all up fighting the fires, sir.
commander_barry_garner Give me sledge and a number 12 spanner. All right. Now close this hatch behind me. Were losing air, close the gods damn hatch. Close it!
lt_louis_hoshi Starbuck reports vipers are skosh ammo, Major. Were down to throwing rocks at the bastards. We gotta haul ass outta here now, sir! Sir!
cpt_lee_adama Come on, Garner.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson O2s in the red, skipper. Youre almost out of air.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson You got it! The pressures coming back up. Now get the frak outta there, come on! Youre air is gone, skipper! Get outta there! Skipper? Skipper?
lt_louis_hoshi Engineerings reporting a green board. FTL drive online and ready.

captain_kara_thrace Pegasus, Starbuck. Nobody behind me but toasters. Now get us outta here!
lt_louis_hoshi Air wings back on board. Landing bays secure.
cpt_lee_adama Jump!
admiral_william_adama You give Garner a lot of credit. Well, its all true.
cpt_lee_adama He gave his life to save the ship.
admiral_william_adama Starbucks report wasnt so kind.
cpt_lee_adama Well, she had her perspective. And I had mine.
admiral_william_adama In your opinion, off the record... what was Garners flaw?
cpt_lee_adama He was used to working with machines. Command is about people.
admiral_william_adama Remember that. I want you to take command... of the beast. Garner was my decision. His failures my responsibility. Dont let me fail a second time. Congratulations, Commander.
sarah_porter Madame President? Word has it that you do not intend to prosecute the Gemenese girl on Galactica.
president_laura_roslin She has a name, Sarah. I think that Rya has suffered enough. Shes just been through an abortion. Ive granted her asylum aboard Galactica.
sarah_porter This is in total violation of the law.
president_laura_roslin My order came after she sought her procedure. No laws have been broken.
sarah_porter The girl belongs at home, with her parents. I insist.
president_laura_roslin You have your pound of flesh. And I suggest you take your victory, and you move on.
tory_foster Maam?
captain_kara_thrace You realize youre screwed, right? All the pressure, the responsibility, the sleepless nights, all the officers giving you a hard time.
cpt_lee_adama Yeah, well, it could be worse. You could be my CAG.
captain_kara_thrace Im gonna stay here and be Galacticas CAG. Something about wanting to keep an eye on me.
cpt_lee_adama Well, you and Colonel Tigh have a lot of fun at those early morning briefings. Cause the XOs a lot of fun first thing.
captain_kara_thrace Mm, great. Congratulations. Really. Congratulations. You deserve it.
cpt_lee_adama I know why I was mad at you, Kara. A simple thank you would have been sufficient. Cause you were doing what you always did. Buck authority, and get away with it. I bucked authority once. And I almost lost everything. So I guess when I showed up on Pegasus, and there you were doing it all over again-- I dont know. Pissed me off. Doesnt make a lot of sense, does it?
captain_kara_thrace You should hear the way my brain works sometimes. Are we okay?
cpt_lee_adama You have a brain? Yeah. Yeah were okay.
playa_palacios Madame President, your decision to criminalize abortion has created a furor. Do you think thats hurt your standing in the polls?
president_laura_roslin Absolutely.
dr_gaius_baltar If I may, Madame President. It is true in the light of recent events, the President may have lost support in some quarters. I would ask the people to understand that if this is an extreme decision, we live in extreme times. The decision has been made with good faith. I, however, cannot with good conscience support it. I am so sorry, Madame President. But the cylon have no understanding of the meaning of the word freedom. How could they? Theyre programmed. Machines. Every time you take away one of our freedoms, every time you restrict or curtail one of our rights, we become one step closer to being like them. As the Vice President, I am bound to follow the administrations lead. As President... I should have no such strictures. Given the current situation, Im afraid that I have no alternative but to announce that I am, as of now, a candidate for the presidency.
Reporters#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode17 Are you you resigning the vice presidency? Are you a one-issue candidate? Are you being disloyal to the President?
