Baltar Wait, there has to be another way out of here! I mean--I mean you--you must have an escape plan. Youre not about to be destroyed by your own bombs, are you? How are you leaving? Oh!
#6 Gaius, I cant die. When this bodys destroyed, my memory, my consciousness will be transmitted to a new one. Ill just wake up somewhere else in an identical body.
Baltar You mean theres more out there like you?
#6 There are 12 models. Im number 6.
Baltar I dont want to die.
#6 Get down.
#6 Do you love me?
#6 Where--where-- I was in a house.
Biers But youre not in a house any longer. Youre back with us. Youve been reborn.
#6 I died. I died.
Biers Thats right. You were in a house. It was destroyed. A nuclear blast. But that is all over now. You have been downloaded into aa new body.
#6 Gaius. Gaius was in the house.
Biers Gaius Baltar?
#6 Yes. Is he alive? Is he?
Baltar Shhhhhh. Im not really here. No one can see me but you. Dont let them know.
Biers Six. Would it trouble you if doctor Baltar were dead?
Baltar If they know how you feel about me, itll be a problem.
#6 It would be unfortunate if he died. He was so helpful.
Biers Very helpful. Your mission was a resounding success. It completely disabled the colonial defenses. The attack succeeded beyond our most optimistic projections, thanks to you.
Tyrol Im not a cylon. Youre a machine, Im not.
Biers I know theres pain, but breathe-- ride through it. Youre going to be okay. Trust me. Youre in gods hands. Were all here
Biers This will pass. Trust me. Everythings gonna be all right.
#6 Welcome home, sister. Were here. Were going to take care of you.
Doral Were proud of you, sharon.
Boomer And we love you.
Boomer Noooooo! Noooooooooooooo!
#6 I was thinking it symbolized rebirth, a new beginning.
Baltar Its a memorial. Do you know how many people died in this park during the attack? How many people in this park alone?
Biers Its gonna be lovely, isnt it?
#6 Sorry.
Biers A place to relax and collect your thoughts. How are you doing?
#6 Im a little stiff. Im still trying to get used to this body. I mean, I know its identical, but... even after all this time, I still feel awkward.
Biers I was a klutz too. Always knock things over. Forever tripping over things. And, you know what? You get over it. And you know what, this is a great chance to cleanse. You got a new body, a new life. And anything that youve built up like anxieties or remorse or guilt, just let it wash away.
#6 I cant tell you how thankful I am. Youve--youve been a really big help to me.
Biers No, its me whos thankful. We all are. You are a warrior. We could not have won without you.
Doral Excuse me. I just wanted to say its an honor to have you here on Caprica with us. What you did, well, its inspiring. Thank you.
Helo Hey. How you doing?
Boomer Freezing. I cant feel my legs.
Helo Thats the epidural.
Boomer What happened?
Helo You passed out and started bleeding again, but everythings going to be all right.
Cottle Like hell it is. I find it absolutely amazing. You people went to all the trouble to appear human and didnt upgrade the plumbing. You have a detached placenta. Babys gotta come out now or we will lose you both.
Ishay Okay, sir, Im going to have to ask you to step back, please. Shes tachycardiac, and her blood pressures dropping. Yeah, shes hemorrhaging again. Were gonna have to make the cut now.
Helo Sharon, can you hear me?
Boomer Helo.
#6 Still cant get used to this.
Biers Well, youre a hero of the cylon now. Youre our first celebrity.
#6 No, Im just another Six.
Biers Youre too modest. Im just another Three. And there are Fives and--or Eights. But you, everyone calls you Caprica Six like youre the only Six on the planet. And--and what you did was incredibly difficult. Seduce a man, so emotionally and physically so that he grants you access to all the most closely guarded secrets of his people. That mission could be profoundly disturbing.
Baltar Disturbing? She sleeping with me and killing billions of people? Cause I rather thought you enjoyed sleeping with me.
#6 It was difficult at times.
Biers So nobody here can possibly understand what youve been through. Which is why we need your help. Theres another cylon whos been having trouble re-integrating after a download. Another hero, actually. An Eight. She still insists on calling herself Sharon.
#6 And you thought I could help. Im still having... Im having problems of my own.
Biers Caprica, you dont understand. She really needs your help. If we dont turn her around soon, theres talk of boxing her.
#6 Putting her memories in cold storage? You cant be serious.
Baltar Well, thats a charming way to deal with emotional problems. one might almost call it inhuman. Oh, thats right, you are.
Biers All right, look, it is a last resort, but she has been regressing. Please. Shes living up there in that apartment. Its the one she had when she thought she was human.
Hilliard Securitys minimal. Two centurions patrol out front. The third bullet-head watch the perimeter. Bullet-head walking perimeter makes random changes to his patrol. Be tough to get past him.
Anders All right, so we go under him. The storm drain leads directly to the garage underneath the cafe. Theyll be dozens of skin jobs inside.
Helo Shes not breathing.
Cottle Suction it.
Helo Whats going on? Where are you taking her?
Cottle Her lungs arent fully developed. She needs oxygen support. But shes alive, right? Right?
Cottle Theres your answer. Now you get the hell out of here. We have to stop the mother bleeding or she wont be alive.
#6 No.
Boomer Youre here to help me with my adjustment problems. I could save you some time. Ah! This is home. Im not leaving.
#6 I lived on caprica for two years. I knew what I was-- pretended to be human, but I knew.
Boomer If you knew what you were and you lived on Caprica, you know what that makes you. A really good liar.
Baltar Start with the elephants.
#6 These are beautiful. Ithacan?
Boomer Hand-carved. My mother gave them to me the day I left for the fleet academy.
#6 Is this her?
Boomer Supposed to be. Course none of its real. All fabricated for my mission. Its all a lie.
#6 Following gods path is never easy.
Baltar Dont get religious with this one.
Boomer What are you thinking? Do you think I care about your god?
#6 Look, god loves you.
Boomer This is love. These people love me. I love them. I didnt pretend to feel something so I could screw people over. I loved them. And then I betrayed them. I shot a man I loved. Frakked over another man, ruined his life. And why? Because im a lying machine. Im a frakking cylon!
Boomer Sorry. I didnt mean to... Ive got bandages in there.
Baltar Nicely done. You timed it perfectly. Scratch your face with the side of your fingernail the moment the glass hits the wall.
Boomer Never saw a cylon show fear before. Especially the Sixes. Usually so hardcore.
Baltar Feign fear and emotional vulnerability. Youre very good, you know. But Im better. Let me help you. Im different.
#6 Im different.
Baltar Im more like you.
#6 Im more like you.
Baltar_and_#6 I had someone I met here. A man. I loved him and I think he couldve loved me eventually.
Hilliard Half a cigarette should give us two or three minutes to get the frak out of there. Any longer and we risk them finding the charges before they go off.
Ander Is it two minutes or three?
Hilliard About to find out.
Resistance_Member This is a risky operation just to nail a couple dozen skin jobs. I mean, we cant kill them. Theyll just download into a new body and... I mean, whats the point?
Anders That skin job with Starbuck-- Sharon they called her-- she said that when they download, they remembered everything. Right up until the end. These skin jobs are going to remember being blown into tiny little pieces.
Resistance_Member Its gotta hurt.
Anders Yeah. I hope it hurts a lot. Because sooner or later, the message sinks in. There is no safe place, not even a cafe. So if you want to quit living through hell and dying over and over again, then get the frak off our planet.
Hilliard Three minutes, ten seconds.
Anders Boom.
#6 This house was on a bluff over a lake. I always loved the view. Sunlight on the water. Its my favorite spot in the universe.
Baltar Yeah, its magical. Too bad you nuked it.
#6 After I downloaded, I went back to the ruins of his house.
Boomer Why?
#6 Like you, I was looking for some sort of connection to him. Found a few of his things. Even held onto them for awhile. But I realized they were keeping me from truly embracing my new life.
Boomer So whatd you do with them?
#6 I burned them. But I felt liberated.
Baltar Yeah, its a beautiful story, isnt it? Shame its all a pack of lies.
Boomer So who was he? This man you loved.
#6 Maybe youve heard of him. Gaius Baltar.
Boomer Doctor Baltar?
#6 Yeah.
Boomer He gave you access to the colonial defense grid. He was the one who betrayed us?
Baltar Us. Oh, I love it. This one thinks shes more human than cylon. Just like someone else I know.
Boomer Does he still work for the cylons?
#6 What?
Boomer On Galactica?
#6 Hes-- hes alive?
Boomer Hes the vice-president of the colonies. You didnt know that?
Roslin If her baby does survive, the question is what do we do with it?
Baltar Do? What are you suggesting? That we throw it out of an air lock?
Roslin I dont make suggestions, Mr. Baltar. If I want to toss a baby out an air lock, Id say so.
Baltar Well, its really gratifying to know that infanticides not on the table.
Tigh Do I have to point out that this is not a baby? Its a machine.
Baltar No, its half machine, half human. I suggest we all keep that half in mind.
Adama Cylons went through a great deal of trouble to create this thing. Should go without saying that if its good for them, its gonna be bad for us.
Roslin I completely agree. And I take it as a given we cant turn it over to Sharon to raise. That would be disastrous.
Adama Theres still another factor to consider here. Theres cylons aboard this fleet. If they find out this things been born, theyre gonna make a play for it.
#6 You can see where this is headed, Gaius. Were going to have to take our child.
Boomer Hello, Hera. Shes got quite a grip on her.
Helo You dont like it in there, do you, Hera? You gotta stay in till your lungs get stronger.
Boomer Shes our little girl. We made her.
Helo It almost makes you want to believe in the cylon god. Almost.
Boomer I love you so completely.
Anders Its clear. Lets move.
Doral Here you go.
Baltar Is the wrong question.
#6 The right question is why did she get me to work with you knowing that youd tell me the truth? She knew I had feelings for Gaius. Knew that I had trouble letting go of him.
Boomer She mustve known it would trigger those feelings and those memories. Shes frakking with you. Cant you see that?
#6 But why?
Baltar Oh, its so perfectly obvious. You know, for a self-aware cybernetic life-form, sometimes you can be unbearably obtuse.
#6 Oh for god sake.
Baltar Careful.
Biers Everything okay?
#6 Fine. Just talking with Sharon here.
Biers Yeah? What about?
Boomer She... asked me to move out.
Biers You know what? Which is what weve been asking her for weeks. I was kind of hoping that youd see the light after talking to our friend here.
Baltar She is lying, unfortunately. She has no wish to see Sharon cured. Theyre just going to do it. Theyre going to box her.
Anders How many cylons up in the cafe?
Hilliard Full house. At least 40. Three minutes, ten seconds.
Biers Weve just made a breakthrough. Shes agreed to move out of her apartment. Didnt you, Sharon?
Boomer Yeah. Im moving out of the apartment.
Biers When?
Boomer Whenever.
Biers What about now? Ill help. The apartment is right upstairs.
Boomer Sure. Let me--let me just get some things.
Biers Six, mustve been some chat, huh?
#6 Yes, we had a lot to talk about.
Baltar Shes right behind you.
#6 I know.
Roslin This is not a debate. This child will not be raised by the cylon, and I cannot risk cylon agents getting their hands on it. Ive made my decision. What I need from you, Doctor, is your help.
Cottle Fine. I dont like it, but have it your way.
Roslin I need it immediately.
Cottle Well have to find somebody suitable. Ill have to work up a list of names.
Tori Each of them is capable. Each of them is anonymous. And each can be trusted.
Cottle Thought of everything, havent you?
Roslin I hope so.
Biers Are you all right, Sharon?
Boomer What happened?
Biers An explosion. Building came down on us. Looks like the stairwell saved us.
Boomer Wheres Six?
Biers Her bodys dead.
#6 No, not yet.
Biers Help me out here.
Biers Wouldve been better if the explosion had killed her. Theres nothing we can do about the pain until we get her out of here. Six. I can get a cross beam and put you out of your misery.
#6 Im not going to get my own life again.
Biers Its your choice.
#6 Aaah!
Biers Where the heck are we anyway?
Boomer Must be in the garage. North entrance must be that way.
Biers Im going to start digging.
Boomer Hang in there. Youre gonna be okay.
Anders Over here! Help me!
Biers A survivor. Hang on, buddy. Well get you out.
Boomer Fresh air coming from down there.
Anders Thanks.
Biers Frakkin human. You know he probably set that explosion.
Boomer What, from the resistance? Why? No military value to the cafe.
Biers But humans dont respect life the way we do.
Boomer No! I wont let you kill him.
#6 Shes right. Dont kill him.
Biers Why not?
Baltar Mm. Why not kill him? Youve already killed billions of people. Do you honestly believe one more bodys going to weigh any heavier on your conscience, which is something that you dont have, do you?
#6 We should interrogate him. Find his accomplices.
Biers Okay. You can let go now, Sharon. Whats this?
Boomer Looks like colonial fleet id.
Biers Thrace, kara.
Boomer Starbuck?
Biers She was on caprica a couple of weeks ago. She escaped with the help of another Sharon.
Boomer If she gave him this, he meant something to her.
Biers Well, then its sweet.
Baltar You have it in your hand. Hard physical proof of one persons love for another. If only you felt this deeply about us.
#6 I did. I do. I love you, Gaius.
Baltar Wheres the tangible proof?
Helo I dont understand. She was doing so well.
Cottle No, she wasnt. I tried to tell you that. Her lungs never fully developed. She finally went into respiratory  distress. We couldnt get her intubated in time. We lost her. Im sorry.
Boomer I shouldve been here.
Helo Sharon. Sharon, listen.
Helo Youve lost a lot of blood.
Boomer You murdered her.
Helo Sharon. Come on.
Boomer Who ordered it? Adama? The President? Who?
Cottle I dont kill patients. We did the best we could, but shes dead. And thats all there is to it. I should be able to release the ashes to you in a few hours.
Boomer Murderer.
Helo Sharon!
Boomer Die!
Helo Sharon.
Cottle Ah!
Boomer Youre all murderers! Youre all murderers!
Cottle Get her out of here.
Boomer Ah! Give me my baby!
#6 You let them murder our child.
Baltar I am so sorry. I tried. I tried my best.
#6 Gods will was that our child should survive. His will was that she would lead the next generation of gods children. His will was that you would protect her.
Baltar Yes. Oh!
#6 You have committed a monstrous and unforgivable sin and now you and your entire wretched race are going to suffer gods vengeance.
Maya Shes so beautiful. I dont know how to thank you. When I lost my baby, I didnt know how I could go on.
Cottle Well, Im glad things worked out for you and this little girl.
Maya I cant believe somebody would give up this little angel.
Tori You understand, Maya, that this adoption requires absolute secrecy. The mother is a pegasus officer and must remain anonymous for political and religious reasons.
Maya You have my word.
Roslin Maya, you wont mind if I drop in occasionally.
Maya Oh, of course not.
Roslin Good. Go.
Biers Is this what youre looking for? You can have it. Here.
Boomer What are you doing?
Biers Just making it easy for him to get what he wants. Come on. Ill give you a head start.
Anders Im fine where I am.
Biers Hey, theyre coming for us. And you. Theyre very interested in you, arent they?
Boomer Leave him alone.
Biers Sharon. Youre a hero of the cylon. Now youre just a broken machine who thinks shes a human. But youre not a human, Sharon, and you never will be.
Boomer Yeah, well at least Im not a murderer. I have a conscience. And I know the difference between right and wrong. A murderer is exactly what you are.
Baltar Life is short. But the next ones not. Let your heart adrift and your soul will get caught.
#6 I love you, Gaius. My heart and soul are yours.
Biers Theyre nearly here.
Baltar You know why they wanted you to work with Sharon? So youd lose your mind. Theyre gonna box you, darling, just like theyre going to box Sharon.
#6 Were dangerous.
Biers What?
#6 Sharon and I. Were celebrities in a culture based on unity.
Biers No.
#6 Our voices count. More than hers. More than others. Were two heroes of the cylon, right? Two heroes with different perspectives on the war. Perspectives based by our love of two human beings. Thats why she wanted me to work with you so that youd tell me that Gaius was still alive. She wanted me to lose my mind.
Biers No, youre corrupted by your experiences. Youre a waste.
Baltar Believe the lies. Ignore the truth. Listen to me. I will show you the proof. Speak from your heart. Say the things that you know to be true.
#6 Jealously, murder, vengeance-- theyre all sins in the eyes of god. Thats what you and I know. Thats what they dont want to hear.
Boomer Because then theyd have to rethink what theyre doing. Theyd have to consider that maybe the slaughter of mankind was a mistake!
Biers God loves me.
#6 See you again soon.
Boomer Looks like theyre almost here.
#6 You should get out of here while you can. The fresh air coming in should lead you out.
Anders Is this some kind of trick?
#6 You can stay and be tortured if you want. Your call.
Anders Who are you? What kind of people are you?
#6 I dont know.
Boomer Hey, wait!
#6 We had a lot of people in the cafe. At least 36 hours till they get to her. Long enough.
Boomer Long enough for what?
#6 To change things for the better.
Boomer What are you talking about?
Baltar I have never loved anyone more in my life than I love you now.
#6 Our people need a new beginning. A new way to live in Gods love. Without hate. Without all the lies. All they need is for  someone to show them the way. Someone like two heroes of the cylons.
Boomer Im with you.
Doral We found them! Theyre alive!
Boomer Yes, we are.
#6 Were alive.
