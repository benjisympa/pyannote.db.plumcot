dr_gaius_baltar Wait, there has to be another way out of here! I mean--I mean you--you must have an escape plan. Youre not about to be destroyed by your own bombs, are you? How are you leaving? Oh!
number_six Gaius, I cant die. When this bodys destroyed, my memory, my consciousness will be transmitted to a new one. Ill just wake up somewhere else in an identical body.
dr_gaius_baltar You mean theres more out there like you?
number_six There are 12 models. Im number 6.
dr_gaius_baltar I dont want to die.
number_six Get down.
number_six Do you love me?
number_six Where--where-- I was in a house.
danna_biers But youre not in a house any longer. Youre back with us. Youve been reborn.
number_six I died. I died.
danna_biers Thats right. You were in a house. It was destroyed. A nuclear blast. But that is all over now. You have been downloaded into aa new body.
number_six Gaius. Gaius was in the house.
danna_biers Gaius Baltar?
number_six Yes. Is he alive? Is he?
dr_gaius_baltar Shhhhhh. Im not really here. No one can see me but you. Dont let them know.
danna_biers Six. Would it trouble you if doctor Baltar were dead?
dr_gaius_baltar If they know how you feel about me, itll be a problem.
number_six It would be unfortunate if he died. He was so helpful.
danna_biers Very helpful. Your mission was a resounding success. It completely disabled the colonial defenses. The attack succeeded beyond our most optimistic projections, thanks to you.
chief_galen_tyrol Im not a cylon. Youre a machine, Im not.
danna_biers I know theres pain, but breathe-- ride through it. Youre going to be okay. Trust me. Youre in gods hands. Were all here
danna_biers This will pass. Trust me. Everythings gonna be all right.
number_six Welcome home, sister. Were here. Were going to take care of you.
aaron_doral Were proud of you, sharon.
lt_sharon_valerii And we love you.
lt_sharon_valerii Noooooo! Noooooooooooooo!
number_six I was thinking it symbolized rebirth, a new beginning.
dr_gaius_baltar Its a memorial. Do you know how many people died in this park during the attack? How many people in this park alone?
danna_biers Its gonna be lovely, isnt it?
number_six Sorry.
danna_biers A place to relax and collect your thoughts. How are you doing?
number_six Im a little stiff. Im still trying to get used to this body. I mean, I know its identical, but... even after all this time, I still feel awkward.
danna_biers I was a klutz too. Always knock things over. Forever tripping over things. And, you know what? You get over it. And you know what, this is a great chance to cleanse. You got a new body, a new life. And anything that youve built up like anxieties or remorse or guilt, just let it wash away.
number_six I cant tell you how thankful I am. Youve--youve been a really big help to me.
danna_biers No, its me whos thankful. We all are. You are a warrior. We could not have won without you.
aaron_doral Excuse me. I just wanted to say its an honor to have you here on Caprica with us. What you did, well, its inspiring. Thank you.
captain_karl_agathon Hey. How you doing?
lt_sharon_valerii Freezing. I cant feel my legs.
captain_karl_agathon Thats the epidural.
lt_sharon_valerii What happened?
captain_karl_agathon You passed out and started bleeding again, but everythings going to be all right.
dr_cottle Like hell it is. I find it absolutely amazing. You people went to all the trouble to appear human and didnt upgrade the plumbing. You have a detached placenta. Babys gotta come out now or we will lose you both.
medic_layne_ishay Okay, sir, Im going to have to ask you to step back, please. Shes tachycardiac, and her blood pressures dropping. Yeah, shes hemorrhaging again. Were gonna have to make the cut now.
captain_karl_agathon Sharon, can you hear me?
lt_sharon_valerii Helo.
number_six Still cant get used to this.
danna_biers Well, youre a hero of the cylon now. Youre our first celebrity.
number_six No, Im just another Six.
danna_biers Youre too modest. Im just another Three. And there are Fives and--or Eights. But you, everyone calls you Caprica Six like youre the only Six on the planet. And--and what you did was incredibly difficult. Seduce a man, so emotionally and physically so that he grants you access to all the most closely guarded secrets of his people. That mission could be profoundly disturbing.
dr_gaius_baltar Disturbing? She sleeping with me and killing billions of people? Cause I rather thought you enjoyed sleeping with me.
number_six It was difficult at times.
danna_biers So nobody here can possibly understand what youve been through. Which is why we need your help. Theres another cylon whos been having trouble re-integrating after a download. Another hero, actually. An Eight. She still insists on calling herself Sharon.
number_six And you thought I could help. Im still having... Im having problems of my own.
danna_biers Caprica, you dont understand. She really needs your help. If we dont turn her around soon, theres talk of boxing her.
number_six Putting her memories in cold storage? You cant be serious.
dr_gaius_baltar Well, thats a charming way to deal with emotional problems. one might almost call it inhuman. Oh, thats right, you are.
danna_biers All right, look, it is a last resort, but she has been regressing. Please. Shes living up there in that apartment. Its the one she had when she thought she was human.
hillard Securitys minimal. Two centurions patrol out front. The third bullet-head watch the perimeter. Bullet-head walking perimeter makes random changes to his patrol. Be tough to get past him.
samuel_anders All right, so we go under him. The storm drain leads directly to the garage underneath the cafe. Theyll be dozens of skin jobs inside.
captain_karl_agathon Shes not breathing.
dr_cottle Suction it.
captain_karl_agathon Whats going on? Where are you taking her?
dr_cottle Her lungs arent fully developed. She needs oxygen support. But shes alive, right? Right?
dr_cottle Theres your answer. Now you get the hell out of here. We have to stop the mother bleeding or she wont be alive.
number_six No.
lt_sharon_valerii Youre here to help me with my adjustment problems. I could save you some time. Ah! This is home. Im not leaving.
number_six I lived on caprica for two years. I knew what I was-- pretended to be human, but I knew.
lt_sharon_valerii If you knew what you were and you lived on Caprica, you know what that makes you. A really good liar.
dr_gaius_baltar Start with the elephants.
number_six These are beautiful. Ithacan?
lt_sharon_valerii Hand-carved. My mother gave them to me the day I left for the fleet academy.
number_six Is this her?
lt_sharon_valerii Supposed to be. Course none of its real. All fabricated for my mission. Its all a lie.
number_six Following gods path is never easy.
dr_gaius_baltar Dont get religious with this one.
lt_sharon_valerii What are you thinking? Do you think I care about your god?
number_six Look, god loves you.
lt_sharon_valerii This is love. These people love me. I love them. I didnt pretend to feel something so I could screw people over. I loved them. And then I betrayed them. I shot a man I loved. Frakked over another man, ruined his life. And why? Because im a lying machine. Im a frakking cylon!
lt_sharon_valerii Sorry. I didnt mean to... Ive got bandages in there.
dr_gaius_baltar Nicely done. You timed it perfectly. Scratch your face with the side of your fingernail the moment the glass hits the wall.
lt_sharon_valerii Never saw a cylon show fear before. Especially the Sixes. Usually so hardcore.
dr_gaius_baltar Feign fear and emotional vulnerability. Youre very good, you know. But Im better. Let me help you. Im different.
number_six Im different.
dr_gaius_baltar Im more like you.
number_six Im more like you.
Baltar_and_#6#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode18 I had someone I met here. A man. I loved him and I think he couldve loved me eventually.
hillard Half a cigarette should give us two or three minutes to get the frak out of there. Any longer and we risk them finding the charges before they go off.
samuel_anders Is it two minutes or three?
hillard About to find out.
Resistance_Member#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode18 This is a risky operation just to nail a couple dozen skin jobs. I mean, we cant kill them. Theyll just download into a new body and... I mean, whats the point?
samuel_anders That skin job with Starbuck-- Sharon they called her-- she said that when they download, they remembered everything. Right up until the end. These skin jobs are going to remember being blown into tiny little pieces.
Resistance_Member#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode18 Its gotta hurt.
samuel_anders Yeah. I hope it hurts a lot. Because sooner or later, the message sinks in. There is no safe place, not even a cafe. So if you want to quit living through hell and dying over and over again, then get the frak off our planet.
hillard Three minutes, ten seconds.
samuel_anders Boom.
number_six This house was on a bluff over a lake. I always loved the view. Sunlight on the water. Its my favorite spot in the universe.
dr_gaius_baltar Yeah, its magical. Too bad you nuked it.
number_six After I downloaded, I went back to the ruins of his house.
lt_sharon_valerii Why?
number_six Like you, I was looking for some sort of connection to him. Found a few of his things. Even held onto them for awhile. But I realized they were keeping me from truly embracing my new life.
lt_sharon_valerii So whatd you do with them?
number_six I burned them. But I felt liberated.
dr_gaius_baltar Yeah, its a beautiful story, isnt it? Shame its all a pack of lies.
lt_sharon_valerii So who was he? This man you loved.
number_six Maybe youve heard of him. Gaius Baltar.
lt_sharon_valerii Doctor Baltar?
number_six Yeah.
lt_sharon_valerii He gave you access to the colonial defense grid. He was the one who betrayed us?
dr_gaius_baltar Us. Oh, I love it. This one thinks shes more human than cylon. Just like someone else I know.
lt_sharon_valerii Does he still work for the cylons?
number_six What?
lt_sharon_valerii On Galactica?
number_six Hes-- hes alive?
lt_sharon_valerii Hes the vice-president of the colonies. You didnt know that?
president_laura_roslin If her baby does survive, the question is what do we do with it?
dr_gaius_baltar Do? What are you suggesting? That we throw it out of an air lock?
president_laura_roslin I dont make suggestions, Mr. Baltar. If I want to toss a baby out an air lock, Id say so.
dr_gaius_baltar Well, its really gratifying to know that infanticides not on the table.
colonel_saul_tigh Do I have to point out that this is not a baby? Its a machine.
dr_gaius_baltar No, its half machine, half human. I suggest we all keep that half in mind.
admiral_william_adama Cylons went through a great deal of trouble to create this thing. Should go without saying that if its good for them, its gonna be bad for us.
president_laura_roslin I completely agree. And I take it as a given we cant turn it over to Sharon to raise. That would be disastrous.
admiral_william_adama Theres still another factor to consider here. Theres cylons aboard this fleet. If they find out this things been born, theyre gonna make a play for it.
number_six You can see where this is headed, Gaius. Were going to have to take our child.
lt_sharon_valerii Hello, Hera. Shes got quite a grip on her.
captain_karl_agathon You dont like it in there, do you, Hera? You gotta stay in till your lungs get stronger.
lt_sharon_valerii Shes our little girl. We made her.
captain_karl_agathon It almost makes you want to believe in the cylon god. Almost.
lt_sharon_valerii I love you so completely.
samuel_anders Its clear. Lets move.
aaron_doral Here you go.
dr_gaius_baltar Is the wrong question.
number_six The right question is why did she get me to work with you knowing that youd tell me the truth? She knew I had feelings for Gaius. Knew that I had trouble letting go of him.
lt_sharon_valerii She mustve known it would trigger those feelings and those memories. Shes frakking with you. Cant you see that?
number_six But why?
dr_gaius_baltar Oh, its so perfectly obvious. You know, for a self-aware cybernetic life-form, sometimes you can be unbearably obtuse.
number_six Oh for god sake.
dr_gaius_baltar Careful.
danna_biers Everything okay?
number_six Fine. Just talking with Sharon here.
danna_biers Yeah? What about?
lt_sharon_valerii She... asked me to move out.
danna_biers You know what? Which is what weve been asking her for weeks. I was kind of hoping that youd see the light after talking to our friend here.
dr_gaius_baltar She is lying, unfortunately. She has no wish to see Sharon cured. Theyre just going to do it. Theyre going to box her.
samuel_anders How many cylons up in the cafe?
hillard Full house. At least 40. Three minutes, ten seconds.
danna_biers Weve just made a breakthrough. Shes agreed to move out of her apartment. Didnt you, Sharon?
lt_sharon_valerii Yeah. Im moving out of the apartment.
danna_biers When?
lt_sharon_valerii Whenever.
danna_biers What about now? Ill help. The apartment is right upstairs.
lt_sharon_valerii Sure. Let me--let me just get some things.
danna_biers Six, mustve been some chat, huh?
number_six Yes, we had a lot to talk about.
dr_gaius_baltar Shes right behind you.
number_six I know.
president_laura_roslin This is not a debate. This child will not be raised by the cylon, and I cannot risk cylon agents getting their hands on it. Ive made my decision. What I need from you, Doctor, is your help.
dr_cottle Fine. I dont like it, but have it your way.
president_laura_roslin I need it immediately.
dr_cottle Well have to find somebody suitable. Ill have to work up a list of names.
tory_foster Each of them is capable. Each of them is anonymous. And each can be trusted.
dr_cottle Thought of everything, havent you?
president_laura_roslin I hope so.
danna_biers Are you all right, Sharon?
lt_sharon_valerii What happened?
danna_biers An explosion. Building came down on us. Looks like the stairwell saved us.
lt_sharon_valerii Wheres Six?
danna_biers Her bodys dead.
number_six No, not yet.
danna_biers Help me out here.
danna_biers Wouldve been better if the explosion had killed her. Theres nothing we can do about the pain until we get her out of here. Six. I can get a cross beam and put you out of your misery.
number_six Im not going to get my own life again.
danna_biers Its your choice.
number_six Aaah!
danna_biers Where the heck are we anyway?
lt_sharon_valerii Must be in the garage. North entrance must be that way.
danna_biers Im going to start digging.
lt_sharon_valerii Hang in there. Youre gonna be okay.
samuel_anders Over here! Help me!
danna_biers A survivor. Hang on, buddy. Well get you out.
lt_sharon_valerii Fresh air coming from down there.
samuel_anders Thanks.
danna_biers Frakkin human. You know he probably set that explosion.
lt_sharon_valerii What, from the resistance? Why? No military value to the cafe.
danna_biers But humans dont respect life the way we do.
lt_sharon_valerii No! I wont let you kill him.
number_six Shes right. Dont kill him.
danna_biers Why not?
dr_gaius_baltar Mm. Why not kill him? Youve already killed billions of people. Do you honestly believe one more bodys going to weigh any heavier on your conscience, which is something that you dont have, do you?
number_six We should interrogate him. Find his accomplices.
danna_biers Okay. You can let go now, Sharon. Whats this?
lt_sharon_valerii Looks like colonial fleet id.
danna_biers Thrace, kara.
lt_sharon_valerii Starbuck?
danna_biers She was on caprica a couple of weeks ago. She escaped with the help of another Sharon.
lt_sharon_valerii If she gave him this, he meant something to her.
danna_biers Well, then its sweet.
dr_gaius_baltar You have it in your hand. Hard physical proof of one persons love for another. If only you felt this deeply about us.
number_six I did. I do. I love you, Gaius.
dr_gaius_baltar Wheres the tangible proof?
captain_karl_agathon I dont understand. She was doing so well.
dr_cottle No, she wasnt. I tried to tell you that. Her lungs never fully developed. She finally went into respiratory distress. We couldnt get her intubated in time. We lost her. Im sorry.
lt_sharon_valerii I shouldve been here.
captain_karl_agathon Sharon. Sharon, listen.
captain_karl_agathon Youve lost a lot of blood.
lt_sharon_valerii You murdered her.
captain_karl_agathon Sharon. Come on.
lt_sharon_valerii Who ordered it? Adama? The President? Who?
dr_cottle I dont kill patients. We did the best we could, but shes dead. And thats all there is to it. I should be able to release the ashes to you in a few hours.
lt_sharon_valerii Murderer.
captain_karl_agathon Sharon!
lt_sharon_valerii Die!
captain_karl_agathon Sharon.
dr_cottle Ah!
lt_sharon_valerii Youre all murderers! Youre all murderers!
dr_cottle Get her out of here.
lt_sharon_valerii Ah! Give me my baby!
number_six You let them murder our child.
dr_gaius_baltar I am so sorry. I tried. I tried my best.
number_six Gods will was that our child should survive. His will was that she would lead the next generation of gods children. His will was that you would protect her.
dr_gaius_baltar Yes. Oh!
number_six You have committed a monstrous and unforgivable sin and now you and your entire wretched race are going to suffer gods vengeance.
maya Shes so beautiful. I dont know how to thank you. When I lost my baby, I didnt know how I could go on.
dr_cottle Well, Im glad things worked out for you and this little girl.
maya I cant believe somebody would give up this little angel.
tory_foster You understand, Maya, that this adoption requires absolute secrecy. The mother is a pegasus officer and must remain anonymous for political and religious reasons.
maya You have my word.
president_laura_roslin Maya, you wont mind if I drop in occasionally.
maya Oh, of course not.
president_laura_roslin Good. Go.
danna_biers Is this what youre looking for? You can have it. Here.
lt_sharon_valerii What are you doing?
danna_biers Just making it easy for him to get what he wants. Come on. Ill give you a head start.
samuel_anders Im fine where I am.
danna_biers Hey, theyre coming for us. And you. Theyre very interested in you, arent they?
lt_sharon_valerii Leave him alone.
danna_biers Sharon. Youre a hero of the cylon. Now youre just a broken machine who thinks shes a human. But youre not a human, Sharon, and you never will be.
lt_sharon_valerii Yeah, well at least Im not a murderer. I have a conscience. And I know the difference between right and wrong. A murderer is exactly what you are.
dr_gaius_baltar Life is short. But the next ones not. Let your heart adrift and your soul will get caught.
number_six I love you, Gaius. My heart and soul are yours.
danna_biers Theyre nearly here.
dr_gaius_baltar You know why they wanted you to work with Sharon? So youd lose your mind. Theyre gonna box you, darling, just like theyre going to box Sharon.
number_six Were dangerous.
danna_biers What?
number_six Sharon and I. Were celebrities in a culture based on unity.
danna_biers No.
number_six Our voices count. More than hers. More than others. Were two heroes of the cylon, right? Two heroes with different perspectives on the war. Perspectives based by our love of two human beings. Thats why she wanted me to work with you so that youd tell me that Gaius was still alive. She wanted me to lose my mind.
danna_biers No, youre corrupted by your experiences. Youre a waste.
dr_gaius_baltar Believe the lies. Ignore the truth. Listen to me. I will show you the proof. Speak from your heart. Say the things that you know to be true.
number_six Jealously, murder, vengeance-- theyre all sins in the eyes of god. Thats what you and I know. Thats what they dont want to hear.
lt_sharon_valerii Because then theyd have to rethink what theyre doing. Theyd have to consider that maybe the slaughter of mankind was a mistake!
danna_biers God loves me.
number_six See you again soon.
lt_sharon_valerii Looks like theyre almost here.
number_six You should get out of here while you can. The fresh air coming in should lead you out.
samuel_anders Is this some kind of trick?
number_six You can stay and be tortured if you want. Your call.
samuel_anders Who are you? What kind of people are you?
number_six I dont know.
lt_sharon_valerii Hey, wait!
number_six We had a lot of people in the cafe. At least 36 hours till they get to her. Long enough.
lt_sharon_valerii Long enough for what?
number_six To change things for the better.
lt_sharon_valerii What are you talking about?
dr_gaius_baltar I have never loved anyone more in my life than I love you now.
number_six Our people need a new beginning. A new way to live in Gods love. Without hate. Without all the lies. All they need is for someone to show them the way. Someone like two heroes of the cylons.
lt_sharon_valerii Im with you.
aaron_doral We found them! Theyre alive!
lt_sharon_valerii Yes, we are.
number_six Were alive.
