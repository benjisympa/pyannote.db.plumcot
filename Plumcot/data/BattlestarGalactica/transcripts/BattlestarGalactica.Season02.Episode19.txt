dr_gaius_baltar Im going to lose.
president_laura_roslin Come in, please.
tory_foster nute, Madam President.
president_laura_roslin Thank you, Tory.
captain_kara_thrace No one should be under any illusions about what were going to face here. Our final jump will take us intra-atmosphere less than two klicks above the surface. Were also expecting to take heavy fire. Simulations indicate losses of up to 20% can be expected. Thats why this mission has been designated as 2-alpha by the command authority. Its volunteer only. You want out, nows the time.
number_six I know its hard to believe right now, but if you have faith, everything will turn out exactly as it should.
dr_gaius_baltar I dont like to lose.
number_six Have faith.
dr_gaius_baltar I am about to face public humiliation. And you are singing the same old song. Im a little tired of the melody.
president_laura_roslin Um...sorry about the mess. Its, um... bit of a ritual-- superstition, really. I used to do this before testifying at committee hearings. This is what I do. I take one, memorize a talking point, then tear the card, and let the pieces fall as they may. It helps.
admiral_william_adama Yeah, my father used to break pencils before he went into court, then borrow one from the clerk. Break preconceptions, work with what you have.
president_laura_roslin You know, I like that. Let me see. I like it. Its good.
admiral_william_adama Feel better?
president_laura_roslin Yeah. But what happens if the, uh, moderator doesnt have a pencil?
admiral_william_adama Then youre pretty screwed.
president_laura_roslin Oh, no. I used to get the giggles before debating in high school. Oh, yes.
president_laura_roslin Thank you, Tory.
lt_felix_gaeta What many of you dont know is that the captured cylon heavy raider is capable of much longer jumps than our raptors. In fact, we realized early on that if we could install a heavy raider navigational system aboard one of our raptors, a strike team could make the entire trip back to Caprica in less than ten jumps. Now, the limiting factor up until now has been our inability in install the cylon computer with our computer. That obstacle has now been overcome.
captain_kara_thrace Shes here to help us. Shes gonna lay out our navigational markers and update our jump coordinates. Does anyone have a problem with that?
number_six Youve been chosen to lead these people by almighty god. It will happen.
dr_gaius_baltar Like the baby happened? The one I was destined to protect?
number_six Dont let your anger drive you into blasphemy, Gaius. The elections still two weeks away. Get your act together.
tom_zarek You ready?
dr_gaius_baltar Yeah, I was just taking a little nap.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Chief.
captain_kara_thrace This is our mission. Its our duty to the people we left behind. And if we need to use a cylon to get them back, then so be it. This is about trying to get as many survivors off Caprica as we can. Even so, its still 2-alpha. Anyone want to eject?
captain_karl_agathon Commander on deck.
cpt_lee_adama Dont worry. I wont be long. I want to hear it too.
admiral_william_adama You just have to really try to think about something serious. That always helps. Right?
president_laura_roslin Like what?
admiral_william_adama Well, like, uh...
tory_foster Great.
cpt_lee_adama No one has ever attempted a rescue mission from this distance, much less behind enemy lines. Youll be making history just by making the attempt. But bring these people back from Caprica... and youll be making part of the future. Questions.
racetrack If you guys find earth before we get back, will you save us a few seats?
cpt_lee_adama Earth? Hell, if we find any rock with food and water, Ill build you guys a bar. All right. See, I told you i wouldnt be long. Mr. Gaeta, turn on the wireless. Lets give these people a chance to hear what kind of fun theyll be missing for the next five days.
Jim#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode19 We are just minutes from the start of the first Presidential debate... you okay? Between President Laura Roslin and her oppenent Vice President Giaus Baltar...
lt_sharon_valerii Can I go now?
captain_kara_thrace Yeah. Coporal Masters
Jim#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode19 ....All questions that will be asked have been submitted by members of the civilian fleet covering a wide range of topics. So please stay tuned as we get set for the first of two Presidential debates. The atmosphere in the auditorium is tense as we await the arival of the two candidates and their aides. The real pressure will be on Vice President Baltar tonight.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Chief.
Jim#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode19 Now here comes Vice President Gaius Baltar into the room, uh, as we, uh, we await Madam President. Laura Roslin is very much ahead in the polls at this point. We believe that, uh... shes entering the room shortly, but still--still, of course, waiting for her. Vice President Blatar blindsighted her by announcing his candidacy a month ago. Dr. Baltar of course is one of the most admired and brilliant scientistific minds of our generation and played a critical role in saving the human race from the cylon threat. Yes, here comes the President now. Laura Roslin, the President, has entered the room.
president_laura_roslin Im going to wipe the floor with you, Gaius.
dr_gaius_baltar You must be losing your mind again.
president_laura_roslin If thats the best you can come up with, youre in a lot of trouble. Good luck.
captain_karl_agathon How you doing? You okay? Sharon. Dont shut me out. Not now.
lt_sharon_valerii Something dark is coming, Helo. I can feel it. I can feel it lurking out there, waiting.
captain_karl_agathon What do you mean? Back on Caprica?
lt_sharon_valerii No. Not on the mission. Not any specific thing. Its more like a dark time.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Chief. Chief.
chief_galen_tyrol Ah!
chief_galen_tyrol Help!
john_cavil Chief Tyrol, I am Brother Cavill. I understand youve asked for religious counseling.
chief_galen_tyrol I never really believed in psych therapy. My father was a priest.
john_cavil I see. You thought youd have an easier time with a priest than a real doctor.
chief_galen_tyrol Okay. I pray to gods every night. But I dont think they listen to me.
john_cavil Do you know how useless prayer is? Chanting and singing and mucking about with old half-remembered lines of bad poetry. And you know what it gets you? Exactly nothing.
chief_galen_tyrol Are you sure youre a priest?
john_cavil Ive been preaching longer than youve been sucking down oxygen. And in that time, Ive learned enough to know that the gods dont answer prayers. Were here on our own. Thats the way they set things up. We have to find our own answers, our own way out of the wilderness without a nice little sunny path all laid out in front of us in advance.
chief_galen_tyrol Thats what Im trying to do. Im trying to find my way.
john_cavil Well, its not going to get better until you see what the problem is. And the problem is, youre screwed up, heart and mind. You. Not the--not the gods or fate or the universe. You.
chief_galen_tyrol Thanks for the pep talk.
cpt_lee_adama Hey.
captain_kara_thrace Hey.
cpt_lee_adama Um... I just wanted to say, um... uh... good hunting.
captain_kara_thrace Thank you, sir.
cpt_lee_adama Yeah, its a good plan. Its a good plan. Sharon should be able to jump you into the atmosphere a couple of klicks above the surface. Down below the cylon dradis.
captain_kara_thrace I know the plan, Lee. I wrote it. I-I gotta go.
cpt_lee_adama I hope you find him, Kara. I really do.
captain_kara_thrace So do I.
tory_foster From the Colonial Dispatch. Last nights debate only solidified the perception--
president_laura_roslin Ill do that later.
tory_foster That doctor baltar, for all his charm, is essentially an empty suit when it comes to matters of substantial policy.
president_laura_roslin Its nice to see the press is getting it right for a change.
tory_foster Dont forget, the radical religious charge is dangerous. It may be a low blow from a desperate man, but its the only issue hes managed to get any traction on. He will keep exploiting it.
president_laura_roslin Hes gotta come up with something much, much bigger than that. If he wants to make it the central issue of his campaign, its not going to work.
tom_zarek You gotta keep hitting her on the religious thing. Every time we go there, you score points and we move the polls in our direction.
dr_gaius_baltar Im not sure if youre aware, Tom, but the mob isnt usually in the habit of electing ungodly apostates who denigrate people of faith.
tom_zarek Things are going to turn around. Youll see.
number_six Hes right. Listen to him.
dr_gaius_baltar Of course. Of course, how blind im being. Thank you. Yes. Um, things are going to turn around, youll see. What is that, advice? Well, thank you. Thank for your keen nsight, your astounding political acumen. You know, Im so assured right now, Tom, Im just going to sit right back and wait for the hand of god to reach down and change
captain_kara_thrace Galactica, Starbuck. Sar squadron confirms readiness check. And we are spun up out here and ready for the first jump.
officer_anastasia_dualla You are go for the jump, Starbuck.
captain_kara_thrace Roger that. Jump in ten minutes. Mark. Galactica, Id like to speak with actual.
officer_anastasia_dualla Sir.
admiral_william_adama Actual. Go.
captain_kara_thrace Did I ever say thank you?
admiral_william_adama No. Then again, that would be a first, wouldnt it?
captain_kara_thrace Thank you.
admiral_william_adama Just come back in one piece. Thatll be thank you enough. Good hunting. Actual out.
captain_kara_thrace Sar team, Starbuck. Set navcon inputs to coordinate recheck. Standby for bounce back and stabilization routines. Lets do a final check, people.
lt_sharon_valerii I still cant believe you talked me into this.
captain_karl_agathon Its important. And Ill be with you there and back. Its you and me from now on, no matter what. Just like we agreed.
lt_sharon_valerii I know. I know. I really appreciate it, Helo, I really do. I just cant get her out of my head. Our little girl.
captain_karl_agathon Is there a problem?
racetrack Racetrack, check.
Callon#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode19 Callon Chedk.
captain_kara_thrace Wireless check complete. Board is green and we are set. Sharon, youre on.
lt_sharon_valerii Ready.
captain_kara_thrace Sar team, Starbuck. Standby to jump on my mark. Five...
racetrack Here we go.
captain_kara_thrace Four, three, two, one. Commence the first jump.
racetrack This doesnt look right.
lt_hamish_mccall No other contacts on dradis.
racetrack What?
lt_hamish_mccall Oh, man. Were at the wrong jump coordinates.
captain_kara_thrace Frak. Helo, weve lost someone already. Its Racetrack.
captain_karl_agathon So do we go back?
captain_kara_thrace Mission rules say we keep going unless we lose three. So we keep going. Racetrack will just have to find her way back to base. Its a hell of a way to start, though.
john_cavil Lets, uh, lets talk about what happened.
chief_galen_tyrol I cant really believe it. Cally. I-I-I dont understand how I could do that to Cally. Its like its a nightmare.
john_cavil She said you were asleep when she found you. Were you having a nightmare when she woke you up?
chief_galen_tyrol I dont remember.
john_cavil Oh. Been having any recurring dreams lately?
chief_galen_tyrol No.
john_cavil Okay. Thats what we in the pray trade call a lie. And lies arent going to get you anywhere, my friend. So skip over the denials and the deceptions and lets get right down to it, shall we? Youre having dreams. What are they? Tell me about your dream, Chief.
chief_galen_tyrol Every night--every night, its the same.
john_cavil For how long?
chief_galen_tyrol Couple weeks.
john_cavil And you were having the same dream when Cally woke you up, werent you?
chief_galen_tyrol I dont know. I dont remember. Maybe. It doesnt matter, does it? All I remember is Cally on the ground and the blood.
john_cavil She stopped you. By waking you up, she prevented you from carrying out your secret desire to kill yourself.
chief_galen_tyrol I dont have a secret desire to kill myself.
john_cavil Well, actually, youre right. Its not a secret. You obviously want to kill yourself. Question is why.
lt_hamish_mccall I think there was some kind of glitch in the navcon firmware. Hey botTom line, were to hell and gone from where were supposed to be, skipper.
racetrack Okay, um, any chance that we can still catch up with them?
lt_hamish_mccall Not a chance. Mission rules say we head back.
racetrack Frak me! It was the first jump!
lt_hamish_mccall Hey, look, you gave me these coordinates.
racetrack Back to the barn.
lt_hamish_mccall Hey. I am picking up a large planetary body. Its frakkin close.
racetrack Whered that come from?
lt_hamish_mccall Hell if I know. So much dradis interference here, it didnt even register.
racetrack Hey, check this out. Atmosphere is nitrogen/oxygen. Organic molecular spectra. Fresh water? Hey, you know what this is? Its habitable. We may have just found a world that can support human life. Maybe were not just a bunch of frak-ups after all.
lt_felix_gaeta Climate readings overall are within human norms. Uh, theres some extremes at the poles that we couldnt withstand but thats not unusual.
admiral_william_adama Well done.
Skull_and_Racetrack#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode19 Thank you, sir.
cpt_lee_adama We got a mottled area here at the river mouth. So its probably a delta. And the chances are, weve got significant plant and animal life. So I want a lot of nice, low passes across here.
officer_anastasia_dualla Heard the Pegasus survey mission found wildlife. Fruit trees. Rivers of milk and honey.
lt_felix_gaeta Yeah. You forgot the lakes of ambrosia. Most of the planets actually pretty barren. Plant and animal life located in a temperate belt around the equator. But the best part is with all the dradis interference from the nebula the cylons will probably never find it.
dr_gaius_baltar Who cares about this stupid planet anyway? Song and dance over nothing. Less than 20% of that place actually supports human life so...
number_six Youre not seeing the big picture. This is your new home. The place where you will lead a new life. This is the future, Gaius.
dr_gaius_baltar Now theres a difference in thought.
tom_zarek Whats that?
dr_gaius_baltar Oh, nothing, Tom. Just, uh... can you imagine if we actually had to live on that thing.
tom_zarek You... are a genius.
dr_gaius_baltar And?
number_six Pay attention. Youre about to win the election.
dr_gaius_baltar Im sorry. What were you saying, Tom?
tom_zarek We needed an issue. Something to set us apart from Roslin. Something to put her clearly on the wrong side of a major issue that people care passionately about. This is it. Permanent settlement on this planet.
dr_gaius_baltar Permanent settlement here. Have you lost your marbles?
tom_zarek It may look dreary, it may be dreary, but its solid ground under your feet and a real sky over your head. Youd be surprised what a powerful idea that is to people cooped up in metal boxes for nine months.
number_six You should listen to him, Gaius. Hes a smart, sexy man, just like you.
dr_gaius_baltar Oh, give up.
tom_zarek What?
dr_gaius_baltar Give up on earth.
tom_zarek Yes.
dr_gaius_baltar So wed settle here.
tom_zarek Yes.
dr_gaius_baltar Yeah, its starting to look like a lovely little planet after all.
president_laura_roslin This is a rest stop. A place to load up on food and water. Were not settling here, obviously.
tory_foster Youve heard the captains reports. Every ship in the fleet has people begging, pleading, demanding they get time down on the surface. Even if its only for a few hours.
president_laura_roslin Well, a few hours is one thing. But permanent settlements quite another.
tory_foster Suddenly Baltars holding out hope for breathing real air, growing real food, sleeping in a bed instead of a bunk. Living in a house instead of a ship.
president_laura_roslin Its a fantasy. Look at the mission reports. All the data indicate that life on this planet would be hard. It would be a struggle to even eke a living out for a few years.
tory_foster Todays polls show that hes also making headway with the idea that because the planet is hidden in a nebula, it will provide a refuge from the cylons.
president_laura_roslin What, are we now assuming that cylon technology is not sufficient enough to find this planet? We just found it.
tory_foster Madam President, in my opinion, people vote their hopes, not their fears. Baltar is offering them what they want to hear, and youre offering them a bitter reality.
president_laura_roslin Im offering them the truth.
tory_foster They dont want to hear the truth. Theyre tried, exhausted. The idea of stopping, laying down their burdens, and starting a new life right now is what is resonating with the voters.
president_laura_roslin How well is it resonating?
tory_foster It could turn the entire election around.
john_cavil Why are you running?
chief_galen_tyrol Im not.
john_cavil How long are you going to do this? How long are you going to refuse to see whats right in front of your face? Forget it. Im done.
chief_galen_tyrol What, youre-- youre leaving?
john_cavil Thats right. Im done. Im done dancing around the truth with you. You know whats going on. But you cant or you wont face it, so... Im not a therapist. Im not going to hold your hand and help you along. Im just trying to get you right with yourself and with your gods, but youre not willing to do it.
chief_galen_tyrol I dont even know what youre talking about.
john_cavil Oh for gods sake, chief! Come on! You think youre a cylon.
chief_galen_tyrol I am not a cylon.
john_cavil Well, of course youre not. But thats what youre afraid of, isnt it? That you might be a cylon and not even know it just--just like Boomer, right? Right? Thats the thought thats torturing your dreams and crippling your soul. Im a cylon, just like Sharon, and I deserve to die.
chief_galen_tyrol Sharon didnt know what she was. She just kept thinking-- feeling that she was going to do this terrible thing. But she knew that she had to stop herself before she did.
john_cavil And you think thats what youre going to do. Some terrible thing. Well, the truth is, you might. But not because youre a cylon. Because youre a human being, and human beings do terrible things all the time.
chief_galen_tyrol But how do you know Im human?
john_cavil Oh, well, maybe because Tm a cylon, and Ive never seen you at any of the meetings. Theres not much more I can do for you. Youre going to have to go back to work and try and leave all of this behind you.
chief_galen_tyrol No. I-- I cant. I cant go back and face the deck people again. And Cally?
john_cavil Well, youd better. Thats the only family youve got. Just know that thats your family and that they love you. Even Cally. Especially Cally. If you doubt your humanity and your essential nature as a human being, all you need to do is look to them for the salvation youve been seeking from the gods. The gods lift up those who lift each other, Chief.
captain_kara_thrace Sar team, Starbuck. We are set here. Stand by for final jump to Caprica. Remember, we are going very low to the surface. Be prepared for wind shear, rain, storms... anything.
Scumball#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode19 Roger that, Starbuck.
lt_sharon_valerii Ready. Ready.
captain_kara_thrace Here we go. Jump.
captain_kara_thrace Sar team, Starbuck. Form up on me.
Scumball#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode19 Roger that skipper.
captain_kara_thrace Any cylons, Helo?
captain_karl_agathon Nothing on dradis. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Missing a raptor. Im only reading 17 out there. Were missing raptor 6-12. Thats toughguy and carousel.
captain_kara_thrace What, they jumped to the wrong coordinates?
captain_karl_agathon No. No, no. Im picking up their transponder, so they made it. Bearing 827, carom 443. About half a klick from here. That would put them...oh, my gods.
captain_kara_thrace Where, Helo? Talk to me.
captain_karl_agathon They jumped inside the mountain.
captain_kara_thrace Damn. Sar team, Starbuck. Weve lost raptor 6-12. We are proceeding without them. Follow me.
Scumball#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode19 Roger that Starbuck.
dr_gaius_baltar I would think that my position and the position of my campaign is abundantly clear.
Jim#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode19 Madam President, you have 30 seconds to respond.
president_laura_roslin Well, my initial response is there he goes again. once again, ladies and gentlemen, Doctor Baltar is distorting the real issues before us. The issue here-- the real question-- is not allowing the scriptures to dictate the policy of this government. The question is do the scriptures contain real world relevance? Do they contain the information necessary to guide us to a safer home than some completely unknown planet that weve just now discovered? Obviously, my answer to that question is yes. I have always and will continue to feel the scriptures hold real world relevance.
Jim#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode19 Mr. Vice President, the next question is for you. Uh, how do you respond to the charges that you seized the idea of permanent settlement on this planet as an opportunistic gamble, um, some would say as to be construed as a desperate move from a campaign, uh, that was falling behind on every poll?
dr_gaius_baltar Well, you know that is, um, that is an excellent question, in fact, Jim. Thank you. And Im only too glad to have the opportunity to respond to it. You see, I have long been a proponent in the search for earth. The promise of perhaps finding not only a new home, but also the prospect of discovering our long lost brothers and sisters of the 13th colony is a powerful one and one I have believed in heart and soul. But the trouble is, the cylons continue to follow us as they have done every step of the way since the destruction of the colonies. And if we have a chance to change this dynamic, to stop this deadly chase, should we take it? My answer is yes.
Jim#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode19 Thank you. Madam President, 30 seconds.
president_laura_roslin Theres no assurance-- none whatsoever-- that the cylons dont already know about this planet, that they dont make regular stops here looking for us, and that in fact they arent simply waiting for us to settle on the surface so they can--
dr_gaius_baltar I have to respond to that. I simply have to respond to that.
Jim#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode19 Ill give you 15 seconds.
dr_gaius_baltar What youve seen right now, ladies and gentlemen, is another example of the President using fear to drive her campaign. Fear. Fear of the gods. Fear of the cylon. Fear of fear itself. Is it not time to stop being afraid? Im asking all of us to stop running from our lives and start living them. Thank you.
Jim#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode19 Thank you. That is all we have time for today. Id like to thank, uh, both the candidates for their frankness today. Very lively debate. Very exciting debate. This concludes the cycle of the debates for the presidency. The polls will be open in three days. Please vote. Thank you and good night.
dr_gaius_baltar Not your night, I guess.
president_laura_roslin Why dont you go frak yourself.
Jim#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode19 With me now is campaign manager for Doctor Baltar, Mr. Tom Zarek. Tom, welcome. Uh, you were in there with us today. What was your impression?
tom_zarek Well, I thought Doctor Baltar did exceptionally well. Laid out his vision of the future and offered the people a way to end the suffering and terror that defines so many of their lives. on the other hand, I found myself wondering how Roslins arguments against settlement could possibly win.
captain_kara_thrace Lets figure out where we are, Karl.
captain_karl_agathon Resistance base camp. Were still another klick ahead.
lt_sharon_valerii Movement. 11:00.
captain_kara_thrace Friendlies?
captain_karl_agathon You got a Samuel T. Anders there?
Hilliard#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode19 Is there a Kara Thrace there?
samuel_anders If there is, you tell her she took her good, sweet time getting here.
captain_karl_agathon Friendlies.
samuel_anders What took you so long?
captain_kara_thrace We have marines in raptors. Were gonna get you and your people out of here, okay?
samuel_anders As good as your word, huh?
captain_kara_thrace Yeah, good as my frakkin word. What, did you think I was going to leave you here? Now you feel like a big frakkin idiot, dont you?
samuel_anders All right, just shut up and save us already, okay?
Hilliard#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode19 People, this is nice, but we have toasters on our ass.
captain_kara_thrace Where are the rest of your people?
samuel_anders This is it. Toasters hit our base camp this morning. I lost half my crew.
lt_sharon_valerii Incoming!
captain_kara_thrace Back to the raptors!
lt_sharon_valerii No!
captain_karl_agathon Shell trajectories are coming between us and the raptors. Were cut off!
