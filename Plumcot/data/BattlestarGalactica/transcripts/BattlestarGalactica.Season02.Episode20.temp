Starbuck Theyve got us zeroed in. If we stay here, theyre gonna chew us up.
Anders All right, we gotta fall back. Position up this hill. Lets go!
Starbuck All right, lets go, people!
Cottle Jaw set nicely. Youre done here. Im kicking you out of here and sending you back to work.
Cally Work like this?
Cottle You gotta love a woman who can complain even with her jaw wired shut. You got a visitor.
Tyrol Im sorry. What I did was... unforgivable, inexcusable. I didnt come here to--
Cally I forgive you.
Tyrol No. Cally. No.
Cally It wasnt you. I know that. It wasnt you.
Tyrol It was me. I... may have been out of my mind and not know where I was doing or anything, but it was me.
Cally Youre in pain. You have been in pain for a really long time.
Tyrol Dont feel sorry for me.
Cally I care about you. I always have. And I always will.
Starbuck Lets move! Lets go, lets go.
Anders Move it, move it, move it.
Casualty Ah!
Man Get a medic!
Starbuck Sharon, take the gun! They got us blocked in here really good!
Helo Frak! Cant raise the raptors. The cylons have jammed the freqs.
Starbuck Frak.
Helo Still out there?
Starbuck Watch yourself. Yeah. Theyre holding back though.
Anders Yeah, but why?
Boomer Theyre holding position. Sending for nonlethal weapons. They want some prisoners for interrogation. The rest theyre gonna send to the farm.
Starbuck Im not going back to one of those farms.
Boomer Yeah, well, you wont have any choice. None of us will. Theyre gonna lob some gas in here and then well all wake up somewhere else.
Starbuck Damn.
Anders So what do you want to do here?
Starbuck Sit it out. Wait and see if shes right. If she is, then you and me, we gotta have an agreement.
Anders An agreement?
Starbuck Not going back to one of those farms, Sam. Im not. So if shes right and they throw gas in here... you do me, I do you.
Anders What are you talking about?
Starbuck This is what Im talking about, okay?
Anders Yeah, okay.
Starbuck Okay.
Roslin Down two more points. And this after hearing his notions of social policy. Not to mention his wishful thinking that he is  calling security policy. Are people really going to be that stupid? Are they really going to be that short-sighted?
Tory Hes got the only issue people care about.
Roslin Oh, I know. The planet. Thats all anybody wants to talk about is that frakkin planet. Excuse my--my language, Tory, Im sorry. I know in my gut that settling on this planets gonna mean disaster for humanity. And I will not say otherwise just to win an election.
Tory As you wish, Madam President.
Roslin So I guess I should start packing up my office unless you have some super secret backup plan for victory in your pocket.
Tory Theres always a backup plan for victory. Just in time for the priest.
Roslin Oh, good. Send him in.
Anders Eighteen hours. Theyre taking their good sweet time out there. They couldve overrun us at any point during the night.
Starbuck Theyre up to something.
Anders What are we up to? Got any brilliant ideas in that military brain of yours.
Starbuck Do the same thing we always do. Fight em till we cant.
Helo What do you think?
Starbuck Lets get a recon crew together. Scout the area. Figure out whats going on out there.
Starbuck Theyre gone. They just left.
Cavil Thank the gods! Its a miracle. Let us pray.
Cavil Lords of kobol, we trust in your benevolence and praise your righteousness. Give the people of this fleet the wisdom to see the goodness and the strength of your servant, Laura Roslin. Amen.
Baltar Admiral? Madam President.
Roslin The Admirals not here. This is my meeting. I wanted us to talk privately without the press getting wind of it. Please have a seat.
Baltar Well, you must have something very interesting to say to resort to such pedestrian methods of deception.
Roslin The question of permanent settlement may well be the most important issue we face since the attack.
Baltar I agree.
Roslin Good. The question should be carefully studied before making a final decision. In the middle of an election campaign is hardly the time for careful study. Therefore I propose a truce. You and I will issue a joint statement declaring that the  question be tabled till after this election. We will both pledge that regardless of who is elected, the decision will be made only after careful deliberation involving all elements of the public and after consultation with the military and the Quorum of Twelve. Doctor, I know weve had our disagreements, but this issue transcends personal disagreement as well as politics. I am appealing here to your sense of patriotism.
Baltar Let me tell you my sense of patriotism is doing just fine. Thank you very much for asking. I see it as my patriotic duty to lead this fleet to a new world. That new world is unquestionably New Caprica. But thank you, Madam President, for demonstrating to me just how desperate your campaign for re-election has become.
Roslin Were you with a blond woman on Caprica just prior to the attack?
Baltar A what?
#6 She knows.
Roslin Were you with a tall, blond woman in the river walk section of Caprica City just prior to the attack?
#6 She can see right through you. Get out of here now.
Baltar Youll resort to anything at this stage, wont you? Im afraid my affairs on Caprica and who I chose to consort with are none of your business. I saved your life. I wont save your political career.
Tigh We are not moving down to that planet.
Ellen If Baltar wins the election--
Tigh Baltar wont win the gods-damn--
Ellen If he does, then what? Were going to just sit on this ship and rot while everyone else gets to start a new life?
Tigh Ellen, my job is to protect the fleet from the cylons and thats exactly what Ill be doing. If you want to move down there, go ahead, be my guest. Go down and cat around with all the men. Have yourself a good old time.
Ellen Saul, I want you.
Tigh XO. You gotta be kidding me. Ill be right down. Starbucks back. I gotta get down there.
Refugee Ah!
Medic Youre going to be okay. Were almost there.
Tyrol Hey, hey, guys, take it easy with it. Come on.
Starbuck Am I good or what?
Tigh Theres gonna be no living with her now.
Adama Its good to see you. Welcome back.
Starbuck Thank you, sir. I brought some friends with me.
Adama I see.
Starbuck Right. Right. Um... this is, um... wow, um, this is Samuel T. Anders.
Adama I know who he is.
Anders Damn good to meet you, sir.
Adama Caprica Buccaneers.
Anders Thats right.
Adama Hell of a player. Im a Picon Panther fan myself.
Anders We enjoyed beating them too.
Adama Its good to have you aboard.
Anders Thank you.
Starbuck I have news. Good news, actually. The cylon occupation is over. They left. Theyre gone.
Adama What are you talking about?
Cavil Its true. The cylons have left the colonies. Theyre headed for greener pastures.
Tyrol Security!
Starbuck What the hell?
Tyrol Dont move! Hes a cylon.
Adama Back off, chief. We got it.
Cavil Well, this is an awkward moment. Yes, uh, hes right. Im a cylon. And I have a message. So take me to your leader.
Adama Take him to the brig. Take that to the brig too.
Helo What? Admiral, she didnt know.
Adama Dont even start, Helo! Of course she knew.
Starbuck Welcome to Galactica.
Helo Why the frak didnt you say anything?
Boomer I dont know. Maybe I didnt want to. Maybe I wanted him to come here and blow up the whole ship. Is that what youre looking for?
Helo You dont mean that. Sharon, we finally got the Admiral to start trusting us. Finally! And what?
Boomer They killed my baby. You think I care about you or us or whether the Admiral trusts me anymore?
Helo Hey! Sharon! I love you! And Im not giving up this frakkin easy! Not after everything!
Starbuck You ready?
Anders All right.
Starbuck Ah.
Anders Ugh. No, no, no.
Starbuck Yes, yes, yes.
Anders Hey, hey, hey. Listen. You dont have to get me drunk. I will sleep with you, okay? I figure I owe you one what with you  saving me and all.
Starbuck Little slut.
Anders Shut up.
Starbuck Come here. Oh ho ho ho. Now youre going to play hard to get.
Anders Yeah.
Starbuck Yeah.
Anders My hero.
Apollo Gods, I guess theyll let anybody in here these days.
Starbuck Hey.
Apollo Hey. Hi. Welcome back.
Starbuck Do you want to meet my man?
Apollo Your man.
Starbuck My personal property. Right, Sammy?
Anders Dont call me Sammy.
Starbuck Oh ho ho. How does it feel to be my personal property?
Anders Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Starbuck And before you answer... he loves it.
Apollo Ill bet he does. Im Lee, by the way.
Anders Hey. Sammy. Im sorry.
Apollo Ive heard a lot about you.
Anders Pleasure. Shot?
Apollo Sure. Why not?
Starbuck Lee, when are you gonna get yourself a girl?
Apollo Im doing fine, thank you.
Starbuck Youre not still frakkin Dualla, are you?
Apollo Thanks a lot.
Starbuck I mean, Im not one to like, you know, lecture or anything cause Ill do just about anything to get into the pants of some hot little young thing.
Anders Hey. Hey! Is that all I am to you?
Starbuck Yes. But you love it.
Anders Thats all right. I dont mind doing charity work.
Starbuck Where did he go?
Cavil Im here to deliver a message. After that, you can do whatever you want with me. I dont care.
Cavil Would you mind telling me whats going on? Im not a frakking cylon. Im not-- oh. Well... okay then.
Cavil Sorry to bust up your day, brother. But theres been a change of plans. Its been decided that the occupation of the colonies was an error.
Cavil I couldve told them that. Bad thinking. Faulty logic. Our first major error of judgment.
Cavil Live and learn. But the war heroes have managed to swing opinion over to their side.
Adama What heroes?
Cavil A six and an eight. one of the eights you know as Sharon Valerii. Their voices carry a lot of weight. So when they started talking about our mistakes and our corruption and our need for a new beginning, the rest of us listened.
Cavil You see, were not like you. We can admit our mistakes and were not afraid of change.
Roslin So you abandoned the colonies leaving behind a devastated nuclear wasteland.
Adama And were supposed to be grateful.
Cavil Our pursuit of this fleet of yours was another error. Thats two for anyone whos keeping score. Both errors led to the same result. We became what we beheld. We became you.
Cavil Amen. People should be true to who and what they are. Were machines. We should be true to that. Be the best machines the universe has ever seen. But we got it into our heads that we were the children of humanity. So instead of perusing our own destiny of trying to find our own path to enlightenment, we hijacked yours.
Cavil You said it, brother. My mission here is simple. Im to tell you that youve been given a reprieve. Cylon and man will now go their separate ways, no harm done.
Adama No harm. You completely annihilated our race and destroyed our civilization.
Cavil Now if you going to start pointing fingers...
Roslin Where did the cylons go? Back to their home world?
Cavil Well, Id rather not say just now. Uh, lets just say we have other plans.
Adama New marching orders by your one true god.
Cavil There is no god.
Cavil Supernatural divinities are the primitives answer for why the sun goes down at night.
Cavil At least thats what weve been telling the others for years. Cant really prove it one way or the other, of course.
Roslin I know a way to prove it. Throw them both out the air lock. Let them see if there really is a cylon god.
Gaeta Ballots from the Adriatic. D? This way.
Tory Yeah, its me. Is this a secure line? Okay. There are only five ships left to report in. We need to move now.
Tigh Ill take care of it.
Dualla Lieutenant, Ill be right back.
Dualla Are those the ballots from the Zephyr?
Crewman Yes, sir.
Dualla All right, well take it from here.
Crewman We were told to take these to the ballot room, sir.
Dualla Counting has already begun. Well take it from here.
Gaeta D. Last one. one, two, three.
Dualla Got it.
McManus Uh, we have some more results have come in here now. Its all been taken care of. Wow. Okay. 8,593 for Roslin, which puts her over the top. Thats 24,265 for Laura Roslin. Is that correct? And 22,366 for Gaius Baltar. Were going to check these again because that has put her over the top. She--she has done it. She has retained the presidency in an improbable comeback in the final hours of the campaign. Uh, again, we--we would, of course, like to check those numbers, if we could. But it appears that Laura Roslin has retained the presidency in defiance of the polls, the pundits, and the surveyors of gloom and doom. Ive never seen a political race end like this, but it has just happened. I am James McManus. Well check those numbers and well be back to you very shortly. Thank you.
Zarek Ive seen a lot of elections, Gaius. Most honest, a few fixed. And you can always tell the fixed ones because they dont make sense. And this doesnt make sense.
Baltar Laura Roslin is many things. But shes not corrupt. And shes not dishonest. Its over.
Adama Congratulations, Madam President.
Roslin Oh, thank you.
Adama I hope you dont take this the wrong way, but are you as shocked as I am?
Roslin Im relieved.
Adama Well, you dont sound it.
Roslin Im just tired. Its been a long campaign.
Gaeta Colonel, may I speak to you for a moment?
Tigh Whats up?
Gaeta Sir, Im afraid these ballots from the Zephyr are wrong.
Tigh What the hell are you talking about?
Gaeta Doctor Baltars name is spelled correctly on these ballots. But this morning, the Zephyr called me and told me their ballots had a misprint. They misspelled Baltars first name. We didnt have time to print new ballots, so I told them on my authority to go ahead and use them anyway. Baltars name is spelled correctly here, so they couldnt have come from the Zephyr. Theyre frauds. Now theres a complete chain of custody from the Zephyr all the way into this room. So someone in the chain is either a perpetrator or at least a willing ally.
Tigh Thank you for bringing this to my attention. Ill take care of it from here.
Gaeta Sir. We should at least notify the civilian observers and the press that these ballots--
Tigh I said Ill take care of it from here.
Gaeta Yes, sir.
Adama Madam President, you should celebrate. Its a great victory and youve earned it. Excuse me.
Roslin Admiral, well talk later. Thank you.
Adama Adama.
Gaeta Yes, sir. This is Lieutenant Geata. Sir... I dont know how to say this.
Adama Fast and straight, Id advise.
Gaeta Yes, sir. Admiral, I believe that Colonel Tigh is involved in a conspiracy to rig the election for President Roslin.
Adama When I confronted the colonel, he admitted his guilt. He said he acted in collusion with your campaign manager, Tory Foster. Saul said tory contacted him a few days ago. He did it because he felt that Baltar as President would be a disaster. I said I agreed, but that what he had done was illegal. A judicial tribunal may have to be convened.
Roslin Stop. I gave tory the go-ahead. I didnt know exactly what she was planning. I certainly did not know about Colonel Tigh. Oh, my gods. But I did know that she was planning to fix the vote.
Adama You tried to steal an election?
Roslin Yes, I did. And I got caught. But Gaius Baltar cannot become President of the Colonies, Bill. It cannot happen.
Adama Laura... I dont want him as President either, but--
Roslin Hes working with the cylons. I saw him just before the attack in Caprica with a copy of the tall blond cylon woman. The same model who accused Baltar of treason before disappearing from Galactica.
Adama What the hell are you saying? Why didnt you say something before this?
Roslin Because I didnt remember seeing him with that woman until I remembered it when I was dying. I know how that sounds, but its real. The same way Kobol is real, and the Tomb of Athena is real, and the map to earth is real. Baltar is working with the cylons.
Adama Even if thats true, you have no proof.
Roslin No, I dont.
Adama Do we steal the results of a democratic election or not? Thats the decision. Because if we do this, were criminals. Unindicted, maybe, but criminals just the same.
Roslin Yes, we are.
Adama You wont do it. Weve gone this far, but thats it.
Roslin Scuse me?
Adama You try to steal this election, youll die inside likely move your cancer right to your heart. The people made their choice. Were gonna have to live with it.
Roslin Its the wrong choice.
Adama Yes, it is.
Roslin All right. All right. All right. So thats it. We just give it up, just like that.
Adama The battle, perhaps. But not the war.
Adama Well, the important thing is the error was discovered and corrected. Youve been elected President. Congratulations.
Baltar Thank you very much, Admiral. Now about this error. Exactly what kind of a tabulating error could have occurred on your ship that couldve swung several thousand votes away from me in favor of your preferred candidate, Admiral? As soon as I have the time, there will be an investigation.
Adama I suggest that you take your victory and you leave it at that, Doctor.
Baltar I think youll find I can be magnanimous in victory, Admiral. And I believe the correct honorific at this time is Mr. President elect. Set course for New Caprica.
Gaeta Jump completed. We are in orbit around New Caprica.
Dualla We have all ships present and accounted for, sir.
Adama Send word to the Pegasus to launch their initial ground team onto the surface. Lets get a good look at our new home. Gods help us all.
Baltar Well... well, I think my ability to see you  will no doubt be constrained by the responsibilities and the requirements of my new position. Listen to me. My--my new position. Um... but obviously, we, um, we will have the chance to connect, to, uh, to get together again on New Caprica once--
Gina Im not going to New Caprica.
Baltar What? What are you talking about?
Gina Im not going to New Caprica.
Baltar Were all going to New Caprica. All of us. Every last, single one of us! Its our chance to be together. To be together again.
Gina No.
Baltar I cant do this anymore.
Gina Stay.
Priest If youll raise your right hand and repeat after me. I, Gaius Baltar, do now avow and affirm.
Baltar I, Gaius Baltar, do now avow and affirm.
Priest That I take the office of the President of the Twelve Colonies of Kobol without any moral reservation or mental evasion.
Baltar That I take the office of President of the Twelve Colonies of Kobol without any moral reservation or mental evasion.
Priest That I will protect and defend the articles of colonization.
Baltar That I will protect and defend the articles of colonization.
Priest With every fiber of my being.
Baltar With every fiber of my being.
Priest Congratulations, Mr. President.
Baltar Thank you. I accept the role offered to me by the Colonies with humility and gratitude. Thank you. Wait, wait. No, no, wait.And now... because it was the first will of the people, Im going to sign my first executive order requiring the fleet to immediately establish settlements on the planet we have come to know as New Caprica. Admiral Adama. You have your orders.
Adama We suspect the warhead was stolen from your lab. Then smuggled aboard cloud 9 by a cylon agent.
Baltar I dont suppose I could  interest you in a cup of tea, Admiral?
Adama Mr. President. This may be the first step in a coordinated cylon attack. I suggest our first priority would be to focus in on internal security.
Baltar No. No, I dont think so. Our first priority is to the people. See that they are safely established on New Caprica. once  thats accomplished... We can put this tragedy behind us.
Adama Youre not listening.
Baltar I dont have to listen. Im the President. The settlement begins and it begins now.
Gaeta Mr. President. President Baltar. Good morning, sir. Good morning, sir. Mr. President, the Union needs their answer.
Baltar The union. If its not the union, its the Quorum. If its not the Quorum, its the peoples council. We survived a nuclear holocaust, Mr. Gaeta. And the people complain about the weather.
Gaeta Sir, its hardly the weather--
Baltar Well, whatever it is. How many cylon attacks have there been since I took office? How many?
Gaeta None, sir.
Baltar None. Precisely. So why do the people complain? Tell the union to get off their fat asses and do some frakking work for a change or Ill start rounding up their leaders and holding them in detention. I doubt theyll like that very much.
Gaeta Ill tell them, Mr. President.
Baltar Thank you. Morning. Wheres my, wheres my pills?
Adama Im telling you to go, okay?
Tigh No, its not okay. I feel like Im abandoning my post.
Adama Its time to pack it in, Saul. You know it. More than half the crew is down there on the ground already. We can barely put a squadron in the air to train, much less fly a decent cap. Were not really doing too much up here anymore.
Tigh Youre staying.
Adama Yeah, well, someone has to take care of the lighthouse. Then Ill stay and take care of it with you. I appreciate that. But you know theres only one person per lighthouse.
Tigh We both know the cylons could still show up.
Adama Anythings possible. Weve been orbiting New Caprica longer than we ran after the attack. I dont think theyre coming back anymore. Colonel... good luck. If she gives you too much trouble, find yourself a younger one.
Announcer Attention, all section four residents. Please report to supply depots to pick up weekly food rations. Supplies are limited. Please report as soon as possible.
Starbuck Hey, you seen Sam?
Man I think hes over there playing pyrimid.
Starbuck Thanks.
Anders Set her up.
Starbuck Sam, you idiot! Ive been looking for you everywhere.
Anders Ah.
Starbuck What the hell are you thinking?
Anders Looks like Im in trouble.
Starbuck Doc Cottle is here. Youre sick. Youre supposed to be in bed.
Anders I would rather work this out of my system right here than lie in bed all day.
Player_1 Sam, come on. Come on.
Anders Duty calls.
Player_2 Hey you gotta be tough.
Player_3 Lets go, Anders.
Player_4 Tomorrow, man. Same time, same score.
Starbuck Cant believe I married a moron. Are you okay?
Anders Fine. Im fine.
Anders Its okay.
Starbuck Ill be right back, okay? Hey, doc, wait. So?
Cottle Theres fluid in the lungs. Its probably pneumonia.
Starbuck So give him something.
Cottle Id love to. Ive been out of antibiotics for months.
Starbuck So what, thats it?
Cottle I have a lot of patients to see. But hes young and hes strong. So make him rest. Keep him warm. And with a little luck, hell make it.
Starbuck Son of a bitch.
Tyrol Everybody, please. Just calm down.
Tyrol Please just calm down. Everybody listen just for a second.
Tyrol Please. Please. Be quiet!
Cally Hey, shut the frak up!
Tyrol When you elected me union President, I promised I would keep us working, keep benefits flowing. But most of all, keep this city alive.
Starbuck Colonel.
Tyrol I promised we would stay on the job. And well hey. And building a better tomorrow.
Tigh Wow, look at you.
Ellen Hi.
Starbuck Oh, Im so glad you guys are here.
Ellen Me too. Its pretty-- pretty exciting.
Starbuck Yeah, that wears off.
Tigh So whats going on here?
Starbuck President Baltar. Sir, Anders is really sick. But Doc Cottles giving me the runaround and says theres no antibiotics. And thats a load of crap. Anything you can do to help me cut through the red tape.
Tigh You should give Apollo a call. Pegasus is sitting on the backup meds. Hed spring some for you.
Starbuck Yeah. I doubt that.
Tigh That was a long time ago. People change.
Starbuck Okay.
Tyrol But there comes a time when you realize that the engine youve built with your blood and your sweat and your tears is being used for something so foul, so perverted that it makes you sick in your heart. And its then that you must throw your body on the gears and on the levers and on the machine itself and make it stop. And you have to show the people who run it, the people who control it, that unless were free, that machine will be prevented from working at all.
All Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike!
Roslin Okay. Everybody have that so far?
Children Yes.
Roslin Good, youre listening.
Maya Think the President has a bit of a problem on his hands.
Roslin I also want you to look at chapter ten. Its the history of the twelve colonies. Its really interesting. The Presidents problems are not our problems, are they?
Maya Thats right. Our problems are homework for everyone tonight.
Roslin Now some of you are going to stay and help me with the art project for the presentation. Everyone else, your parents are here. Get your stuff, lets go. Go on. Get out of here. Good job. Yeah. Okay. Bye, honey. Thanks. Good job. Good job. Thank you, parents. You know what, why dont you and the baby go on, okay? Ill finish up here.
Maya You sure?
Roslin Yes. Yes. Go ahead. Thank you. Bubble head. A bubble head. I love this.
Maya Hello. Hello, Isis.
Apollo Oh. Hey, whats going on?
Dualla Its for you.
Apollo Who is it?
Dualla Its for you.
Apollo Who is it? Right. What do you want?
Starbuck I need a favor.
Apollo Is that right?
Starbuck I hear that youre, uh, hoarding a bunch of antibiotics for the pilots.
Apollo Where did you hear that?
Starbuck Anders is sick. He has pneumonia, Lee. I think that he might die.
Dualla Commander.
Apollo Wait. Yeah, lieutenant. What is it?
Dualla Im not sure. Picking up something on dradis.
Apollo Dradis? How can you see anything in that soup?
Dualla There it is.
Apollo What is it?  Wait, what is that?
Dualla Oh, my gods, its a cylon fleet. They found us. They found us.
Apollo We have to get out of here, sir.
Adama We cant just leave all those people behind.
Apollo Theres nothing we can do. Its taken us forever just to get to action stations over here. Were in no shape for a fight, sir.
Adama Theyll be wiped out.
Apollo We dont have a choice. We need to get out of here right now.
Helo All decks finally report condition one, sir. Should we launch the alert fighters?
Adama Begin jump prep. Were leaving. But well be back. Start your prep.
Gaeta Mr. President! Mr. President!
Baltar Dont you knock?
Gaeta Gaius. Gaius!
Baltar Yeah, what is it?
Gaeta The cylons just jumped into orbit and the fleets jumped away.
#6 Judgment day.
Leoben Im looking for Kara Thrace.
Baltar Im Gaius Baltar. President of the Colonies.
#6 I know who you are, Gaius. I know very well.
Boomer As long as you offer no resistance, you wont be harmed.
Baltar How do I know that?
Doral You dont. You also dont have any choice.
Baltar How did you find us?
Doral Oh, it was quite by accident, actually. We were over a light-year away from here when we detected the radiation signature of a nuclear detonation.
Baltar Very well. on behalf of the people of the Twelve Colonies, I surrender.
Tyrol What do you want to do now Captian.
Starbuck The same thing we always do, fight them until we cant.
