captain_kara_thrace Theyve got us zeroed in. If we stay here, theyre gonna chew us up.
samuel_anders All right, we gotta fall back. Position up this hill. Lets go!
captain_kara_thrace All right, lets go, people!
dr_cottle Jaw set nicely. Youre done here. Im kicking you out of here and sending you back to work.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Work like this?
dr_cottle You gotta love a woman who can complain even with her jaw wired shut. You got a visitor.
chief_galen_tyrol Im sorry. What I did was... unforgivable, inexcusable. I didnt come here to--
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson I forgive you.
chief_galen_tyrol No. Cally. No.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson It wasnt you. I know that. It wasnt you.
chief_galen_tyrol It was me. I... may have been out of my mind and not know where I was doing or anything, but it was me.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Youre in pain. You have been in pain for a really long time.
chief_galen_tyrol Dont feel sorry for me.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson I care about you. I always have. And I always will.
captain_kara_thrace Lets move! Lets go, lets go.
samuel_anders Move it, move it, move it.
Casualty#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode20 Ah!
Man#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode20 Get a medic!
captain_kara_thrace Sharon, take the gun! They got us blocked in here really good!
captain_karl_agathon Frak! Cant raise the raptors. The cylons have jammed the freqs.
captain_kara_thrace Frak.
captain_karl_agathon Still out there?
captain_kara_thrace Watch yourself. Yeah. Theyre holding back though.
samuel_anders Yeah, but why?
lt_sharon_valerii Theyre holding position. Sending for nonlethal weapons. They want some prisoners for interrogation. The rest theyre gonna send to the farm.
captain_kara_thrace Im not going back to one of those farms.
lt_sharon_valerii Yeah, well, you wont have any choice. None of us will. Theyre gonna lob some gas in here and then well all wake up somewhere else.
captain_kara_thrace Damn.
samuel_anders So what do you want to do here?
captain_kara_thrace Sit it out. Wait and see if shes right. If she is, then you and me, we gotta have an agreement.
samuel_anders An agreement?
captain_kara_thrace Not going back to one of those farms, Sam. Im not. So if shes right and they throw gas in here... you do me, I do you.
samuel_anders What are you talking about?
captain_kara_thrace This is what Im talking about, okay?
samuel_anders Yeah, okay.
captain_kara_thrace Okay.
president_laura_roslin Down two more points. And this after hearing his notions of social policy. Not to mention his wishful thinking that he is calling security policy. Are people really going to be that stupid? Are they really going to be that short-sighted?
tory_foster Hes got the only issue people care about.
president_laura_roslin Oh, I know. The planet. Thats all anybody wants to talk about is that frakkin planet. Excuse my--my language, Tory, Im sorry. I know in my gut that settling on this planets gonna mean disaster for humanity. And I will not say otherwise just to win an election.
tory_foster As you wish, Madam President.
president_laura_roslin So I guess I should start packing up my office unless you have some super secret backup plan for victory in your pocket.
tory_foster Theres always a backup plan for victory. Just in time for the priest.
president_laura_roslin Oh, good. Send him in.
samuel_anders Eighteen hours. Theyre taking their good sweet time out there. They couldve overrun us at any point during the night.
captain_kara_thrace Theyre up to something.
samuel_anders What are we up to? Got any brilliant ideas in that military brain of yours.
captain_kara_thrace Do the same thing we always do. Fight em till we cant.
captain_karl_agathon What do you think?
captain_kara_thrace Lets get a recon crew together. Scout the area. Figure out whats going on out there.
captain_kara_thrace Theyre gone. They just left.
john_cavil Thank the gods! Its a miracle. Let us pray.
john_cavil Lords of kobol, we trust in your benevolence and praise your righteousness. Give the people of this fleet the wisdom to see the goodness and the strength of your servant, Laura Roslin. Amen.
dr_gaius_baltar Admiral? Madam President.
president_laura_roslin The Admirals not here. This is my meeting. I wanted us to talk privately without the press getting wind of it. Please have a seat.
dr_gaius_baltar Well, you must have something very interesting to say to resort to such pedestrian methods of deception.
president_laura_roslin The question of permanent settlement may well be the most important issue we face since the attack.
dr_gaius_baltar I agree.
president_laura_roslin Good. The question should be carefully studied before making a final decision. In the middle of an election campaign is hardly the time for careful study. Therefore I propose a truce. You and I will issue a joint statement declaring that the question be tabled till after this election. We will both pledge that regardless of who is elected, the decision will be made only after careful deliberation involving all elements of the public and after consultation with the military and the Quorum of Twelve. Doctor, I know weve had our disagreements, but this issue transcends personal disagreement as well as politics. I am appealing here to your sense of patriotism.
dr_gaius_baltar Let me tell you my sense of patriotism is doing just fine. Thank you very much for asking. I see it as my patriotic duty to lead this fleet to a new world. That new world is unquestionably New Caprica. But thank you, Madam President, for demonstrating to me just how desperate your campaign for re-election has become.
president_laura_roslin Were you with a blond woman on Caprica just prior to the attack?
dr_gaius_baltar A what?
number_six She knows.
president_laura_roslin Were you with a tall, blond woman in the river walk section of Caprica City just prior to the attack?
number_six She can see right through you. Get out of here now.
dr_gaius_baltar Youll resort to anything at this stage, wont you? Im afraid my affairs on Caprica and who I chose to consort with are none of your business. I saved your life. I wont save your political career.
colonel_saul_tigh We are not moving down to that planet.
ellen_tigh If Baltar wins the election--
colonel_saul_tigh Baltar wont win the gods-damn--
ellen_tigh If he does, then what? Were going to just sit on this ship and rot while everyone else gets to start a new life?
colonel_saul_tigh Ellen, my job is to protect the fleet from the cylons and thats exactly what Ill be doing. If you want to move down there, go ahead, be my guest. Go down and cat around with all the men. Have yourself a good old time.
ellen_tigh Saul, I want you.
colonel_saul_tigh XO. You gotta be kidding me. Ill be right down. Starbucks back. I gotta get down there.
Refugee#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode20 Ah!
Medic#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode20 Youre going to be okay. Were almost there.
chief_galen_tyrol Hey, hey, guys, take it easy with it. Come on.
captain_kara_thrace Am I good or what?
colonel_saul_tigh Theres gonna be no living with her now.
admiral_william_adama Its good to see you. Welcome back.
captain_kara_thrace Thank you, sir. I brought some friends with me.
admiral_william_adama I see.
captain_kara_thrace Right. Right. Um... this is, um... wow, um, this is Samuel T. Anders.
admiral_william_adama I know who he is.
samuel_anders Damn good to meet you, sir.
admiral_william_adama Caprica Buccaneers.
samuel_anders Thats right.
admiral_william_adama Hell of a player. Im a Picon Panther fan myself.
samuel_anders We enjoyed beating them too.
admiral_william_adama Its good to have you aboard.
samuel_anders Thank you.
captain_kara_thrace I have news. Good news, actually. The cylon occupation is over. They left. Theyre gone.
admiral_william_adama What are you talking about?
john_cavil Its true. The cylons have left the colonies. Theyre headed for greener pastures.
chief_galen_tyrol Security!
captain_kara_thrace What the hell?
chief_galen_tyrol Dont move! Hes a cylon.
admiral_william_adama Back off, chief. We got it.
john_cavil Well, this is an awkward moment. Yes, uh, hes right. Im a cylon. And I have a message. So take me to your leader.
admiral_william_adama Take him to the brig. Take that to the brig too.
captain_karl_agathon What? Admiral, she didnt know.
admiral_william_adama Dont even start, Helo! Of course she knew.
captain_kara_thrace Welcome to Galactica.
captain_karl_agathon Why the frak didnt you say anything?
lt_sharon_valerii I dont know. Maybe I didnt want to. Maybe I wanted him to come here and blow up the whole ship. Is that what youre looking for?
captain_karl_agathon You dont mean that. Sharon, we finally got the Admiral to start trusting us. Finally! And what?
lt_sharon_valerii They killed my baby. You think I care about you or us or whether the Admiral trusts me anymore?
captain_karl_agathon Hey! Sharon! I love you! And Im not giving up this frakkin easy! Not after everything!
captain_kara_thrace You ready?
samuel_anders All right.
captain_kara_thrace Ah.
samuel_anders Ugh. No, no, no.
captain_kara_thrace Yes, yes, yes.
samuel_anders Hey, hey, hey. Listen. You dont have to get me drunk. I will sleep with you, okay? I figure I owe you one what with you saving me and all.
captain_kara_thrace Little slut.
samuel_anders Shut up.
captain_kara_thrace Come here. Oh ho ho ho. Now youre going to play hard to get.
samuel_anders Yeah.
captain_kara_thrace Yeah.
samuel_anders My hero.
cpt_lee_adama Gods, I guess theyll let anybody in here these days.
captain_kara_thrace Hey.
cpt_lee_adama Hey. Hi. Welcome back.
captain_kara_thrace Do you want to meet my man?
cpt_lee_adama Your man.
captain_kara_thrace My personal property. Right, Sammy?
samuel_anders Dont call me Sammy.
captain_kara_thrace Oh ho ho. How does it feel to be my personal property?
samuel_anders Yeah, yeah, yeah.
captain_kara_thrace And before you answer... he loves it.
cpt_lee_adama Ill bet he does. Im Lee, by the way.
samuel_anders Hey. Sammy. Im sorry.
cpt_lee_adama Ive heard a lot about you.
samuel_anders Pleasure. Shot?
cpt_lee_adama Sure. Why not?
captain_kara_thrace Lee, when are you gonna get yourself a girl?
cpt_lee_adama Im doing fine, thank you.
captain_kara_thrace Youre not still frakkin Dualla, are you?
cpt_lee_adama Thanks a lot.
captain_kara_thrace I mean, Im not one to like, you know, lecture or anything cause Ill do just about anything to get into the pants of some hot little young thing.
samuel_anders Hey. Hey! Is that all I am to you?
captain_kara_thrace Yes. But you love it.
samuel_anders Thats all right. I dont mind doing charity work.
captain_kara_thrace Where did he go?
john_cavil Im here to deliver a message. After that, you can do whatever you want with me. I dont care.
john_cavil Would you mind telling me whats going on? Im not a frakking cylon. Im not-- oh. Well... okay then.
john_cavil Sorry to bust up your day, brother. But theres been a change of plans. Its been decided that the occupation of the colonies was an error.
john_cavil I couldve told them that. Bad thinking. Faulty logic. Our first major error of judgment.
john_cavil Live and learn. But the war heroes have managed to swing opinion over to their side.
admiral_william_adama What heroes?
john_cavil A six and an eight. one of the eights you know as Sharon Valerii. Their voices carry a lot of weight. So when they started talking about our mistakes and our corruption and our need for a new beginning, the rest of us listened.
john_cavil You see, were not like you. We can admit our mistakes and were not afraid of change.
president_laura_roslin So you abandoned the colonies leaving behind a devastated nuclear wasteland.
admiral_william_adama And were supposed to be grateful.
john_cavil Our pursuit of this fleet of yours was another error. Thats two for anyone whos keeping score. Both errors led to the same result. We became what we beheld. We became you.
john_cavil Amen. People should be true to who and what they are. Were machines. We should be true to that. Be the best machines the universe has ever seen. But we got it into our heads that we were the children of humanity. So instead of perusing our own destiny of trying to find our own path to enlightenment, we hijacked yours.
john_cavil You said it, brother. My mission here is simple. Im to tell you that youve been given a reprieve. Cylon and man will now go their separate ways, no harm done.
admiral_william_adama No harm. You completely annihilated our race and destroyed our civilization.
john_cavil Now if you going to start pointing fingers...
president_laura_roslin Where did the cylons go? Back to their home world?
john_cavil Well, Id rather not say just now. Uh, lets just say we have other plans.
admiral_william_adama New marching orders by your one true god.
john_cavil There is no god.
john_cavil Supernatural divinities are the primitives answer for why the sun goes down at night.
john_cavil At least thats what weve been telling the others for years. Cant really prove it one way or the other, of course.
president_laura_roslin I know a way to prove it. Throw them both out the air lock. Let them see if there really is a cylon god.
lt_felix_gaeta Ballots from the Adriatic. D? This way.
tory_foster Yeah, its me. Is this a secure line? Okay. There are only five ships left to report in. We need to move now.
colonel_saul_tigh Ill take care of it.
officer_anastasia_dualla Lieutenant, Ill be right back.
officer_anastasia_dualla Are those the ballots from the Zephyr?
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Yes, sir.
officer_anastasia_dualla All right, well take it from here.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson We were told to take these to the ballot room, sir.
officer_anastasia_dualla Counting has already begun. Well take it from here.
lt_felix_gaeta D. Last one. one, two, three.
officer_anastasia_dualla Got it.
james_mcmanus Uh, we have some more results have come in here now. Its all been taken care of. Wow. Okay. 8,593 for Roslin, which puts her over the top. Thats 24,265 for Laura Roslin. Is that correct? And 22,366 for Gaius Baltar. Were going to check these again because that has put her over the top. She--she has done it. She has retained the presidency in an improbable comeback in the final hours of the campaign. Uh, again, we--we would, of course, like to check those numbers, if we could. But it appears that Laura Roslin has retained the presidency in defiance of the polls, the pundits, and the surveyors of gloom and doom. Ive never seen a political race end like this, but it has just happened. I am James McManus. Well check those numbers and well be back to you very shortly. Thank you.
tom_zarek Ive seen a lot of elections, Gaius. Most honest, a few fixed. And you can always tell the fixed ones because they dont make sense. And this doesnt make sense.
dr_gaius_baltar Laura Roslin is many things. But shes not corrupt. And shes not dishonest. Its over.
admiral_william_adama Congratulations, Madam President.
president_laura_roslin Oh, thank you.
admiral_william_adama I hope you dont take this the wrong way, but are you as shocked as I am?
president_laura_roslin Im relieved.
admiral_william_adama Well, you dont sound it.
president_laura_roslin Im just tired. Its been a long campaign.
lt_felix_gaeta Colonel, may I speak to you for a moment?
colonel_saul_tigh Whats up?
lt_felix_gaeta Sir, Im afraid these ballots from the Zephyr are wrong.
colonel_saul_tigh What the hell are you talking about?
lt_felix_gaeta Doctor Baltars name is spelled correctly on these ballots. But this morning, the Zephyr called me and told me their ballots had a misprint. They misspelled Baltars first name. We didnt have time to print new ballots, so I told them on my authority to go ahead and use them anyway. Baltars name is spelled correctly here, so they couldnt have come from the Zephyr. Theyre frauds. Now theres a complete chain of custody from the Zephyr all the way into this room. So someone in the chain is either a perpetrator or at least a willing ally.
colonel_saul_tigh Thank you for bringing this to my attention. Ill take care of it from here.
lt_felix_gaeta Sir. We should at least notify the civilian observers and the press that these ballots--
colonel_saul_tigh I said Ill take care of it from here.
lt_felix_gaeta Yes, sir.
admiral_william_adama Madam President, you should celebrate. Its a great victory and youve earned it. Excuse me.
president_laura_roslin Admiral, well talk later. Thank you.
admiral_william_adama Adama.
lt_felix_gaeta Yes, sir. This is Lieutenant Geata. Sir... I dont know how to say this.
admiral_william_adama Fast and straight, Id advise.
lt_felix_gaeta Yes, sir. Admiral, I believe that Colonel Tigh is involved in a conspiracy to rig the election for President Roslin.
admiral_william_adama When I confronted the colonel, he admitted his guilt. He said he acted in collusion with your campaign manager, Tory Foster. Saul said tory contacted him a few days ago. He did it because he felt that Baltar as President would be a disaster. I said I agreed, but that what he had done was illegal. A judicial tribunal may have to be convened.
president_laura_roslin Stop. I gave tory the go-ahead. I didnt know exactly what she was planning. I certainly did not know about Colonel Tigh. Oh, my gods. But I did know that she was planning to fix the vote.
admiral_william_adama You tried to steal an election?
president_laura_roslin Yes, I did. And I got caught. But Gaius Baltar cannot become President of the Colonies, Bill. It cannot happen.
admiral_william_adama Laura... I dont want him as President either, but--
president_laura_roslin Hes working with the cylons. I saw him just before the attack in Caprica with a copy of the tall blond cylon woman. The same model who accused Baltar of treason before disappearing from Galactica.
admiral_william_adama What the hell are you saying? Why didnt you say something before this?
president_laura_roslin Because I didnt remember seeing him with that woman until I remembered it when I was dying. I know how that sounds, but its real. The same way Kobol is real, and the Tomb of Athena is real, and the map to earth is real. Baltar is working with the cylons.
admiral_william_adama Even if thats true, you have no proof.
president_laura_roslin No, I dont.
admiral_william_adama Do we steal the results of a democratic election or not? Thats the decision. Because if we do this, were criminals. Unindicted, maybe, but criminals just the same.
president_laura_roslin Yes, we are.
admiral_william_adama You wont do it. Weve gone this far, but thats it.
president_laura_roslin Scuse me?
admiral_william_adama You try to steal this election, youll die inside likely move your cancer right to your heart. The people made their choice. Were gonna have to live with it.
president_laura_roslin Its the wrong choice.
admiral_william_adama Yes, it is.
president_laura_roslin All right. All right. All right. So thats it. We just give it up, just like that.
admiral_william_adama The battle, perhaps. But not the war.
admiral_william_adama Well, the important thing is the error was discovered and corrected. Youve been elected President. Congratulations.
dr_gaius_baltar Thank you very much, Admiral. Now about this error. Exactly what kind of a tabulating error could have occurred on your ship that couldve swung several thousand votes away from me in favor of your preferred candidate, Admiral? As soon as I have the time, there will be an investigation.
admiral_william_adama I suggest that you take your victory and you leave it at that, Doctor.
dr_gaius_baltar I think youll find I can be magnanimous in victory, Admiral. And I believe the correct honorific at this time is Mr. President elect. Set course for New Caprica.
lt_felix_gaeta Jump completed. We are in orbit around New Caprica.
officer_anastasia_dualla We have all ships present and accounted for, sir.
admiral_william_adama Send word to the Pegasus to launch their initial ground team onto the surface. Lets get a good look at our new home. Gods help us all.
dr_gaius_baltar Well... well, I think my ability to see you will no doubt be constrained by the responsibilities and the requirements of my new position. Listen to me. My--my new position. Um... but obviously, we, um, we will have the chance to connect, to, uh, to get together again on New Caprica once--
Gina#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode20 Im not going to New Caprica.
dr_gaius_baltar What? What are you talking about?
Gina#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode20 Im not going to New Caprica.
dr_gaius_baltar Were all going to New Caprica. All of us. Every last, single one of us! Its our chance to be together. To be together again.
Gina#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode20 No.
dr_gaius_baltar I cant do this anymore.
Gina#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode20 Stay.
priest If youll raise your right hand and repeat after me. I, Gaius Baltar, do now avow and affirm.
dr_gaius_baltar I, Gaius Baltar, do now avow and affirm.
priest That I take the office of the President of the Twelve Colonies of Kobol without any moral reservation or mental evasion.
dr_gaius_baltar That I take the office of President of the Twelve Colonies of Kobol without any moral reservation or mental evasion.
priest That I will protect and defend the articles of colonization.
dr_gaius_baltar That I will protect and defend the articles of colonization.
priest With every fiber of my being.
dr_gaius_baltar With every fiber of my being.
priest Congratulations, Mr. President.
dr_gaius_baltar Thank you. I accept the role offered to me by the Colonies with humility and gratitude. Thank you. Wait, wait. No, no, wait.And now... because it was the first will of the people, Im going to sign my first executive order requiring the fleet to immediately establish settlements on the planet we have come to know as New Caprica. Admiral Adama. You have your orders.
admiral_william_adama We suspect the warhead was stolen from your lab. Then smuggled aboard cloud 9 by a cylon agent.
dr_gaius_baltar I dont suppose I could interest you in a cup of tea, Admiral?
admiral_william_adama Mr. President. This may be the first step in a coordinated cylon attack. I suggest our first priority would be to focus in on internal security.
dr_gaius_baltar No. No, I dont think so. Our first priority is to the people. See that they are safely established on New Caprica. once thats accomplished... We can put this tragedy behind us.
admiral_william_adama Youre not listening.
dr_gaius_baltar I dont have to listen. Im the President. The settlement begins and it begins now.
lt_felix_gaeta Mr. President. President Baltar. Good morning, sir. Good morning, sir. Mr. President, the Union needs their answer.
dr_gaius_baltar The union. If its not the union, its the Quorum. If its not the Quorum, its the peoples council. We survived a nuclear holocaust, Mr. Gaeta. And the people complain about the weather.
lt_felix_gaeta Sir, its hardly the weather--
dr_gaius_baltar Well, whatever it is. How many cylon attacks have there been since I took office? How many?
lt_felix_gaeta None, sir.
dr_gaius_baltar None. Precisely. So why do the people complain? Tell the union to get off their fat asses and do some frakking work for a change or Ill start rounding up their leaders and holding them in detention. I doubt theyll like that very much.
lt_felix_gaeta Ill tell them, Mr. President.
dr_gaius_baltar Thank you. Morning. Wheres my, wheres my pills?
admiral_william_adama Im telling you to go, okay?
colonel_saul_tigh No, its not okay. I feel like Im abandoning my post.
admiral_william_adama Its time to pack it in, Saul. You know it. More than half the crew is down there on the ground already. We can barely put a squadron in the air to train, much less fly a decent cap. Were not really doing too much up here anymore.
colonel_saul_tigh Youre staying.
admiral_william_adama Yeah, well, someone has to take care of the lighthouse. Then Ill stay and take care of it with you. I appreciate that. But you know theres only one person per lighthouse.
colonel_saul_tigh We both know the cylons could still show up.
admiral_william_adama Anythings possible. Weve been orbiting New Caprica longer than we ran after the attack. I dont think theyre coming back anymore. Colonel... good luck. If she gives you too much trouble, find yourself a younger one.

samuel_anders Its okay.
captain_kara_thrace Ill be right back, okay? Hey, doc, wait. So?
dr_cottle Theres fluid in the lungs. Its probably pneumonia.
captain_kara_thrace So give him something.
dr_cottle Id love to. Ive been out of antibiotics for months.
captain_kara_thrace So what, thats it?
dr_cottle I have a lot of patients to see. But hes young and hes strong. So make him rest. Keep him warm. And with a little luck, hell make it.
captain_kara_thrace Son of a bitch.
chief_galen_tyrol Everybody, please. Just calm down.
chief_galen_tyrol Please just calm down. Everybody listen just for a second.
chief_galen_tyrol Please. Please. Be quiet!
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Hey, shut the frak up!
chief_galen_tyrol When you elected me union President, I promised I would keep us working, keep benefits flowing. But most of all, keep this city alive.
captain_kara_thrace Colonel.
chief_galen_tyrol I promised we would stay on the job. And well hey. And building a better tomorrow.
colonel_saul_tigh Wow, look at you.

captain_kara_thrace Oh, Im so glad you guys are here.
ellen_tigh Me too. Its pretty-- pretty exciting.
captain_kara_thrace Yeah, that wears off.
colonel_saul_tigh So whats going on here?
captain_kara_thrace President Baltar. Sir, Anders is really sick. But Doc Cottles giving me the runaround and says theres no antibiotics. And thats a load of crap. Anything you can do to help me cut through the red tape.
colonel_saul_tigh You should give Apollo a call. Pegasus is sitting on the backup meds. Hed spring some for you.
captain_kara_thrace Yeah. I doubt that.
colonel_saul_tigh That was a long time ago. People change.
captain_kara_thrace Okay.
chief_galen_tyrol But there comes a time when you realize that the engine youve built with your blood and your sweat and your tears is being used for something so foul, so perverted that it makes you sick in your heart. And its then that you must throw your body on the gears and on the levers and on the machine itself and make it stop. And you have to show the people who run it, the people who control it, that unless were free, that machine will be prevented from working at all.
All#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season02.Episode20 Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike!
