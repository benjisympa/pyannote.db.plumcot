Cavil Do you know that every time they take you out of this cell, we come in here and we change those little hash marks on your little calendar there youre trying to hide.
Leoben_bringing_in_dinner Potatoes, gravy. Even some carrots.
Leoben Heavenly father, we thank you for the bounty of this table…
Ellen Yes. Yes. Come on! Dont stop. Come on! Come on! You son of a bitch! Son of a bitch!
Cavil Oh, boy.
Tyrol all right, were armed.
Anders Theyre inbound. Lets move!
Starbuck I need a knife.
Starbuck Thank you.
Leoben Youre welcome.
Cavil I must say I quite enjoyed that.
Ellen Im so glad. And, uh... When do I get what I want?
Cavil I believe thats happening right now.
Cavil_tapping_hands_on_his_chair We reviewed your case today. And I must say there was great disappointment on the review committee.
Cavil Come on. We gotta get you processed. Itll take an hour or so. Bureaucracy must be served. But if youre lucky, youll get home by dinner time. Colonel, come on. Im not gonna hold this door open forever.
Ellen Saul! Ohh! Oh, Gods. Gods. What did they do to you?
Tigh Its all right. Im out. Thats all that matters.
Ellen Ohh.
Tigh Lets get out of here.
Ellen Okay.
Anders Okay. Ready? Now.
Anders Oh, for fraks sakes. Come on, come on! Is that thing gonna work or what?
Chief Whoo! Worked that time.
Anders Go, go!
Leoben Frakkin insurgents.
Leoben You look... so lovely tonight.
Leoben Gah! Ahh! Uhh! Ill see you soon...Kara.
Starbuck Take your time.
Voiceover 134th day of the Cylon occupation of New Caprica. Today is Marsday. Somehow it seems appropriate to honor the God of war on a day when it feels like perpetual war is the only realistic prospect for us. Weve had no contact with Galactica since it left four months ago. But I refuse to believe that Adama has abandoned us. Our insurgency has been striking back against the Cylons whenever and wherever possible. Although at times these attacks seem like futile gestures, I believe that they are critical to morale, to maintaining some measure of hope. But in order for the insurgency to have a more meaningful impact we need to strike a high profile target. It is simply not enough to kill Cylons, because they dont die. They resurrect themselves, and they continue to walk among us. It is horrifying. The Cylon occupation authority continues to exert complete control over the city, and we remain at their mercy. The colonial government under president Gaius Baltar functions in name only.
Cavil_1 Lets review why were here, shall we? Were supposed to bring the word of God to the people, right?
Cavil_2 Save humanity from damnation by bringing the love of God to these poor, benighted people.
Caprica_Six Were here because a majority of the Cylon felt that the slaughter of mankind had been a mistake.
Boomer Were here to find a new way to live in peace. As God wants us to live.
Cavil_2 And its been a fun ride so far. But I want to clarify our objectives. If were bringing the word of God, then it follows that we should employ any means necessary to do so, any means.
Cavil_1 Yes, fear is a key article of faith, as I understand it. So perhaps its time to instill a little more fear into the peoples hearts and minds. Lets, uh, lets execute Baltar.
Baltar Wha … What?
Caprica_Six Thats not gonna happen.
Cavil_1 Just because hes your favorite toy shouldnt be allowed to interfere with the larger issues here.
Baltar I think that I have cooperated --
Caprica_Six Gaius is with me. Anyone who wants to challenge that will have to deal with me.
Doral_1 Well, it doesnt matter. If wed killed him at the beginning, it might have worked.
Doral_2 But now, most humans think of him as a traitor, and would actually cheer his death.
Cavil_1 Fine, fine. We dont kill Baltar. We round up the leaders of the insurgency, and we execute them -- publicly. We round up at random groups off the street, and we execute them -- publicly. Send a message that the gloves are coming off.
Cavil_2 The insurgency stops now, or else we start reducing the human population to a more manageable size. I dont know, say, uh, less than 1,000.
Boomer We need to stop being butchers.
Caprica_Six The entire point of coming here was to start a new way of life. To push past the conflict thats separated us from humans for so long.
Cavil_2 And what has it gotten us? Its not like they welcomed us with … with -- frak it. Never mind. Youre all living in a fantasy world. Consider the irony in that. Delusional machines. Whats the universe gonna come up with next?
Three_taking_Caprica_Six_aside Is it really worth it, Caprica? Is the love of that man really worth possibly losing all of this?
Caprica_Six If you ever experienced love, you wouldnt have to ask.
VO In recent months, the Cylons have been recruiting and training humans in an attempt to establish a human police force. It is hard to think of anything more despicable than humans doing the dirty work of the Cylons, led to believe they were merely taking the civilian security out of the hands of the Cylons. And members of the human police have since become an extension of the Cylons corporeal authority. And while their names are kept deeply confidential, there is no question some of them are people we might least expect. Hundreds of us have been rounded up by the Cylons, held in detention, questioned, tortured. Others have simply vanished. In recent weeks, weve been gaining access to some very important documents from a source within Baltars administration. No one knows who this mysterious benefactor is. But he communicates with the insurgents by means of a secret signal. We pray every day for the men and women who risk their lives to fight the Cylons. They have everything to lose. And such little hope of something to gain. I pray they will not falter in the days ahead.
Chief Hey, Jake. There we go.
Cally_with_the_baby Here we go. Shh. Looks like mommys gonna get some sleep tonight after all. Sometimes I hate everything about this place. Sometimes its... its magic.
Chief Hmm.
Chief I gotta go. Ill be back in a couple hours.
Cally one of these days, youre just not gonna come back, are you? Youll just vanish, and thatll be it. Ill never see you again. Nick will never know his father.
Chief Couple hours. I promise.
Chief Uh... good to see you, Colonel.
Tigh Its good to be seen.
Tigh Ahh. I know youre wondering, so Ill save you the trouble. The eye is gone. Ripped it right out onto the floor. Picked it up and showed it to me. Looked like a hard-boiled egg. Big boom today. Hope that was you two.
Anders Oh, yeah. Heavy raider too.
Tigh Good men. Whats our next target?
Chief Well, got these today. Theyre security plans for the graduation ceremony at the New Caprica Police academy.
Tigh These are right out of the ministry files. Where are you getting this stuff? Whos your source?
Chief I have no idea. Source wont tell me what their name is. Its probably safer for all of us. Weve been getting stuff like this for weeks.
Anders Humans working for the Cylons. Makes you wanna puke.
Chief Yeah, well, all the top occupation brass is gonna be at the graduation. Even...President Baltar.
Tigh Gaius Baltar?
Chief Yes, sir. I think we can get a shot at him too. The problem is, its gonna be tough avoiding human casualties.
Tigh Dont avoid em. Send a message. You work with the Cylons, youre a target. No boundaries for the Cylons, theres no boundaries for us. Anything we can do to nail that son of a bitch, Gaius Baltar, is worth doing.
Tigh Where are we on the wireless?
Chief Uh...nowhere. Every day, we try and contact the raptor, and every day the Cylons jam the transmission. Ive asked for the inside source to tell us which of the Cylon jamming frequencies are the weakest, but so far, I got nothing.
Anders you guys are dreaming. Theres no Raptor there, okay? There hasnt been one for the past four months, either. Galacticas not coming back. Theyre not. Accept it.
Tigh Watch your frakkin mouth. Theres a Raptor out there every day, listening for a wireless call. Its out there because that was the plan if anything happened. And its out there because the old man isnt just gonna leave us to the Cylons.
Anders The old man left me to the Cylons, Colonel. And if it wasnt for my wife being a royal pain in the ass, and refusing to let it go, I would be dead a year now.
Tigh Any word on Kara?
Anders Nothing. In four months.
Leoben_enters Hi, honey, Im home. You kill me, I download, I come back, we start over. Five times now.
Leoben Im trying to help you, Kara. I only want you to see the truth of your life. The reason why you suffered and you struggled for so long. Thats why God sent me to you. Thats why God wants us to be together. All right?
Starbuck_nodding Youre right. Youre right. And I hear you. I do. So thank you.
Starbuck Thank you for putting up with me. Im so sorry.
Leoben Put it down, Kara. Just put it down.
Leoben Im a patient man.
Starbuck Youre not a man.
Leoben Im willing to wait. You just need more time.
Starbuck I dont need more frakkin time. Its never gonna happen.
Leoben Of course its gonna happen. Youre gonna hold me in your arms, youre gonna embrace me, youre gonna tell me that you love me. Ive seen it.
Starbuck Youre insane.
Leoben To know the face of God is to know madness.
Leoben Im going to bed. Be nice if you joined me. Either way, youre spending the night with me. I do love you, Kara Thrace. Good night.
Starbuck Let me out! Let me out of here! I dont belong here! Let me out! Let me out!
Second_man Snowbird 3, get information.
Woman Okay, Snowbirds, lets nail this exercise.
Man How many times are we gonna run this thing?
Second_man What, youre not having fun yet?
Woman Come on, focus, Snowbirds!
Helo Snowbirds, Galactica. Regroup in deployment formation and proceed to position 1.
Racetrack Snowbird 1 to Snowbirds. Drop point in eight seconds.
Kat Okay, Snowbirds, lets get this deployment bang on. The Admirals watching every move.
Racetrack Roger, Kat. We go on your command. Bomb bay doors open.
Kat All Vipers break … now, now, now! Deploy drones on my mark. Three...two...one. Mark!
Racetrack Frak me! Gods damn it, Snowbird 4! What the hell happened?
Kat Can the chatter, Snowbirds! This is the CAG. Abort maneuver. I say again, decoy squadron, abort maneuver.
Man Roger that, Leader. Snowbirds, fall back. Abort drill. Await further instructions.
Man Roger, get off my wings.
Man Snowbird fly, clear 7:00.
Kat Galactica, Kat. It is a mess out here. We got decoy drones heading every which way. Request instructions.
Helo Roger that, Kat. Abort acknowledged. Youre approaching bingo fuel anyway. Bring your birds back home.
Adama Belay that.
Helo Strike my last. Stand by.
Adama Launch a tanker bird. Let them practice their in-flight refueling before they recover the drones. Have them run the exercise one more time.
Helo 16 times now, sir.
Adama The next one will be 17, wont it?
Helo Yes, sir. Launch the tanker.
Helo_on_PA All units, Galactica. Recover drones and prepare to run training mission again. Were launching the tanker bird.
Apollo Tanker?
Helo once youve tanked up, head back to position alpha and prepare for training run 17. Galactica out.
Apollo What the frak are they doing over there?
Apollo This is the Commander. Get the Admiral on the line.
Apollo Admiral, considering how long our pilots have been in the air, I suggest we recall the birds and scrub the training exercise.
Adama If we cant do this in a training scenario, how the hell are we supposed to pull this off with Cylon raiders on our asses?! Huh? Tell me!
Apollo What the frak do you want from me? I dont know how were supposed to do any of this crap at half-strength!
Kat_on_comms Collision! Weve had a collision.
Helo Give me your status, Kat.
Kat Bingo, Molar, speak to me!
Molar Im losing flight control! I got red lights all across the board!
Bingo Kat, Molar, Im in a lateral spin and losing hydraulics. My wings clipped.
Kat Galactica, Kat. Im declaring an emergency. Requesting priority landing for two bent birds.
Adama Pull em in!
Helo Yes, sir. Roger that, Kat. Bring your birds back home.
Apollo This whole thing is frakking insane. We got two ships at half-strength. We got crews that havent seen action in a year and a half. And youre acting like the only problem is theyre not working hard enough.
Adama Have you taken a look at yourself in the mirror lately? Youre weak, soft! Mentally and physically.
Apollo This isnt about me.
Adama Youve had four months to get your act together. And so far, all youve been able to frakkin do is to complain and whine about how hard it is. Well, guess what. Its gonna get a lot harder. Do you understand me? Now I want you to turn around and get your fat ass out of here. Get your men ready! Or Ill find someone who can. Dismissed!
Chief I dont like this one, Colonel. I think were the ones crossing the line here.
Tigh Its the only way its gonna work. Kids got access and clearance.
Anders You gotta be square on this. You cant back out once you start.
Duck Im not backing out.
Chief Its wrong, Colonel. You know that, dont you?
Tigh Hes a soldier, Chief. Not the first time weve sent a soldier on a one-way mission. You know that, dont you?
Chief This is different.
Tigh This is our best chance to take out Gaius Baltar. Maybe the only one. Were sure as frak gonna take it.
Duck Every since they killed Nora, I got nothing to live for.
Anders All right.
Anders You look me in the eye, and you tell that you are committed to this.
Duck Im committed.
Anders_embracing_him May the Gods be with you.
Chief Some things you just dont do, Colonel. Not even in war.
Tigh Well, maybe youll feel different when youre sitting in detention. Duck volunteered. Hes going.
Adama Its a hard thing to say, but it seems like I dont know who my son is anymore. Same goes for the crew of the ship. I feel pretty much alone. Except maybe for you.
Sharon_chuckling I wish I could go back a year and tell that Admiral Adama about this conversation.
Adama A years a long time.
Sharon Can I ask you something? Very personal. Do you feel guilty about leaving the people behind on New Caprica?
Adama I dont do guilt.
Sharon You know, a year ago -- when you put me in the cell -- I was at a crossroads. I sat in here for weeks, just consumed with rage at all the things that had happened to me. And at some point, I realized it was all just guilt. I was angry at myself for the choices I had made. Betraying my people. And losing the baby. So...I had a choice. I could either move forward or stay in the past. But the only way to move forward... was to forgive myself. You know, I dont think we can survive. I dont think... the fleet or Galactica or the people on New Caprica can survive... unless the man at the top finds a way to forgive himself.
Apollo Two of our pilots almost got killed because theyve been in the cockpit for 11 hours. And he wants to bust my balls. Youre soft. Can you believe that?
Apollo What? Oh, you agree. Is that it?
Dualla Forget it. Im not looking for a fight.
Apollo Oh, no, no, no, no. Dont do that. You got something to say, come out and say it.
Dualla Hes right. You are soft. Im not talking about the weight. Youve lost your edge. Your confidence. You lost your war, lee. And the truth is, youre a soldier who needs a war. And you dont wanna hear it, because youve got it in your head that your fathers the soldier. And you sure dont wanna be like him. But you are like him. Youre more like him than you know. Thats one of the reasons I married you.
Chief Okay, its working. I think.
Tigh Is it working or isnt it?
Chief They keep jamming us.
Anders So much for our source on the inside.
Pilot Ten minutes left. And lots of nothing on the wireless, as usual.
Racetrack Keep an eye out for Raiders. Last listening bird almost got popped by a pair yesterday.
Chief I almost got it.
Anders Ow, frak! Turn that thing down! Ahh.
Chief Its working. Its working.
Racetrack Times up. Spin up the FTL and get ready to go.
Pilot Hold on. Im picking something up. Its a Colonial transmission. Its a low power signal, but... the recognition codes match. Oh, yeah. We got a link to the ground.
Racetrack_giggling Okay, send the coded response. Spin up the drive, and lets get the hell back to Galactica.
Chief Ive got a signal. A Raptor just made contact with us.
Tigh whats it say?
Chief We will make contact with this frequency every twelve hours. Prepare sitrep for command authority. Have hope. Were coming for you.
Racetrack_on_comms We made contact. I say again, we made contact with the ground. Colonel Tigh has formed an insurgent group against the Cylons, and now theyre ready and waiting for instructions on how to coordinate the rescue effort.
Adama Its gonna be okay. Its really gonna be okay.
Tory These are all the surveillance pictures taken by the insurgents. I think we can match names to about 50 of these photos. But our best guess puts the total police force at around 200.
Roslin 200? I wouldnt have believed thered be 20 people who would turn against their own kind. I want those names, I want the rest of the names.
Tory Thats tough. The Cylons are afraid the population will go after any human who joins the New Caprica Police.
Roslin As well they should.
Duck_praying I... I know I havent lived a model life. I made a lot of mistakes. Im gonna need your protection today.
Gaeta_knocking Mr. President.
Caprica_Six Morning, Gaeta.
Gaeta_ignoring_her Its time. For the graduation ceremony.
Baltar Oh, yes. The ceremony. About the ceremony... theres a been a change of plan. I wont be going. Security concern. Dont look so worried. Therell be other graduations.
Gaeta Right. Okay. Ill just... let the staff know.
Chief I think we should call off the strike. Theres no reason to go forward with it if the Galacticas gonna come back.
Tigh What, and pass up a golden opportunity to kill Gaius Baltar?
Chief Other than that, Colonel, I fail to see the point.
Tigh Think with your head, Chief, not with your heart. The only way they stand a chance of getting us off this rock is if the Cylons are too distracted battling a full-blown uprising when they get here. All right, if your source on the inside says Baltars not gonna be there, abort. Otherwise, stick with the plan.
Jammer Hey Duck…
Three Good morning. And welcome to all graduates. You are the hope. You are the dream of a new tomorrow for humans and Cylon alike. And I salute you. For the risks that you have taken for just showing up today. Today, you begin a new career. And a new life as provisional police officers. And looking out across this room, I see that the significance of this new path is not lost on you.
Three Congratulations, Sergeant... Congratulations, Captain… Its great to have you with us.
Duck Ill see you soon, Nora.
