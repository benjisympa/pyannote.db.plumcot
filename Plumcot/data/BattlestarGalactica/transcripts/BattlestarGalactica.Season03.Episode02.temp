Baltar Everyone … is being looked at right now. Youre no exception. I can help you, Laura. In ways I cannot help myself. I can protect you. But you have to understand the situation has changed now. The insurgency has crossed the line. Suicide bombings. Its abhorrent. Its contrary to everything that we believe in. So you -- you and I, we will, uh -- we will publicly condemn these tactics. They cannot be legitimized in any shape or form.
Roslin Theres something that scares the Cylons after all.
Baltar I should think using men and women as human bombs should scare us all.
Roslin Desperate people take desperate measures.
Baltar All right, look me in the eye. Look me in the eye and tell me that you approve of sending young men and women into crowded places with explosives strapped to their chests.
Baltar Im waiting for you to look me in the eye and tell me that you approve! 33 people killed. And their o nly crime was putting o n the police uniform. Trying to bring some order to the chaos out there.
Roslin_raises_her_voice Order? By arresting innocent people in the dead of night. Detaining them indefinitely without charge. Torturing them for information!
Baltar Nobodys been tortured.
Roslin Tell that to colonel Tigh.
Baltar Nobody has been tortured. Were done here.
Baltar I hope you understand the severity of the situation. Id ask you to obey the dictates of your conscience... which is what Ive always done.
Roslin_sarcastically Of that I have no doubt.
Baltar_to_the_NCP_guard Please give this lovely lady her shoes back. Then get her out of here.
Human_Police Curfew is now in effect. Severe penalties will be imposed o n anyone found o n the streets. Curfew is now in effect. Severe penalties will be imposed o n anyone found o n the streets.
NCP_#1 I dont know about this.
NCP_#2 We need to make a point. The violence must end. We got a job to do.
NCP_#3 What are we doing? Is that him?
NCP_#4 Yeah, just do what he asks. Everything will be okay.
Cavil You understand your orders, Captain? Everything clear?
Jammer Yes, sir.
Cavil Good. Dont worry. We have your back.
Chief Did you hear? The Cylons cut food rations toady.
Anders We heard. How long before the next Raptor transmission?
Chief Two minutes. You know, theyre taking about shutting down the marketplace. Its a security risk.
Tigh Well shift targets.
Chief You were gonna hit the marketplace. The market? Full of civilians. This is crazy. You know, we need to figure out whose side were o n.
Tigh Which side are we o n? Were o n the side of the demons, Chief. Were evil men in the gardens of Paradise. Sent by the forces of death to spread devastation and destruction wherever we go. Im surprised you didnt know that.
Chief Contact. Theyre ready for the sitrep.
Tigh Send it twice, just to make sure.
Cavil_to_Jammer Here are the names of those to be arrested and sent to detention.
Jammer I, uh -- I know some of these people.
Cavil Im sure you do. Theyre all insurgents, jammer. We have to break the cycle of violence.
Jammer_to_group Okay, suit up.
Cavil_to_group You wont have to wear those much longer. Eventually your people will see you as heroes.
Jammer Not tonight. Take numbers five through ten. Okay, take the tents to the right. Follow down to the end. Rest of you guys gotta keep quiet, okay?
NCP_Officer This is New Caprica Police!
NCP_Officer Youre under arrest for colluding with the insurgency.
NCP_Officer Youre wanting for questioning in the graduation bomb.
NCP_Officer Cally Tyrol, this is an NCP raid.
Cally No! Let go of me!
NCP_Officer Get your hands up.
Cally My baby! No! No, my baby! No!
NCP_Officer Hey, hey, hey!
Cally No, no, no, no.
Chief_picks_up_Baby_Nick Shh, shh, shh, shh. I got you. I got you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, there you go. Mommys coming back. Its okay. Its okay. Its okay.
Helo Their numbers are a little thin. It says here Tigh commands 1,150 armed effectives. Thats a lot less than he should have if you count all former Fleet officers and enlisted available down there.
Dualla Could be taking heavy losses. They mentioned a Cylon crackdown.
Kat We should get a breakdown of available pilots in the insurgent group. Somebodys gotta fly those ships off the ground if were gonna pull this off.
Adama Those ships arent going anywhere yet. The Cylons have removed launch keys from grounded Colonial ships. Location unknown. Came from Tyrol.
Kat Can we manufacture new launch keys?
Apollo Forget it. The specs o n launch keys are incredibly sophisticated. It would take weeks just to do the R&D.
Adama Best option is for Saul and the people o n the ground to find the original launch keys.
Dualla Assuming they werent destroyed.
Kat No. No way. The Cylons would want to keep them safe just in case they needed to use o ne of those ships someday.
Helo Shes right. Keys gotta still be there somewhere.
Kat We can make a weapons drop to the insurgents. They know the lay of the land, theyve been hitting the Cylons in the teeth for months.  Given them the tools, they can kind the keys themselves.
Apollo No. No way. The o nly thing youve got going for you so far is that the Cylon reduced their defense perimeter to just five baseships. You put heavy weaponry down there, theyre gonna know for sure that were in contact with the population. Call in ten more baseships and then your whole plans frakked.
Kat_sarcastically Funny, thought this was OUR plan, sir.
Adama Moving o n. The military plans that you have in your hands are to be kept with you at all times.
Chief Whyd they pick her up? She hasnt done anything. Weve got a baby, for Godssakes.
Gaeta I dont know. Ill try to find out.
Chief How long are they gonna hold her?
Gaeta …Detention is run by a separate ministry. They dont give us any reasons why they --
Chief Godsdammit, Felix. She hasnt done anything. Weve got a baby.
Gaeta I know, Galen. Im sorry.
Chief How do you do it? How do you help them day after day? How do you look yourself in the mirror? I gotta get my son. Camerons watching him, but shes got problems of her own.
Gaeta Chief! Ill see what I can do. Ill see if theres something I can find out.
Chief Yeah. Why dont you try and do something?
Cally_voiceover Please! No! No!
Chief Hey, you okay? Jammer, whats going o n?
Jammer Yeah. Yeah, Im okay, Chief.
Chief All right.
Jammer Hey, uh... I heard about last night.
Chief Shh. What?
Jammer About Cally being o n o ne of those lists.
Chief Yeah.
Jammer Im really sorry.
Chief Yeah. Frakkin human police, huh? Bunch of traitors if you ask me.
Jammer Some of those guys who joined up, I bet theyre in over their heads, you know? Especially now with these suicide bombings and … At first, I bet you they thought they were doing something good. You know, get the Cylons off the streets. Let us police our own.
Chief Theyre a bunch of frakkin idiots. What did they expect? You dont know any of those guys, do you? Any names?
Jammer Names? No. N-no idea.
Chief Damn.
Jammer Well, whats up with Cally? Why did they put her in detention?
Chief I dont know. She hasnt done a Godsdamn thing. I just talked to Gaeta. Says he doesnt know squat. Or so he says.
Jammer Gaetas a good guy. If he knows something …
Chief Hes a frakkin collaborator. You know what? o ne day when this is all over, guys like Gaeta are gonna get strung up. And guys like you and me, were gonna be there tying the knots. Making em tight.
Leoben Its been a couple of ugly days. I know you dont care about that, but life means something to us. So Ive decided to show you just how precious life can be. How even in the worst of times, it can restore your faith.
Leoben Remember that breeding farm o n Caprica?
Starbuck I remember I blew the frak out of the place.
Leoben It wasnt a total loss. We were able to salvage certain things. Certain medical samples. Like your ovary.
Starbuck Whats that?
Leoben This is Kacey. Kacey, this is Kara. Your mother.
Kacey Hi.
Leoben Good girl.
Dualla Unbelievable.
Apollo What?
Dualla Admirals decided to put some boots o n the ground. Wants to send an officer as a liaison between us and the resistance elements o n the planet to coordinate the rescue op.
Apollo Makes sense. Whats the problem?
Dualla Its who hes sending.
Apollo Hes frakking kidding with this, right?
Dualla I wish he were.
Apollo Mr. Hoshi, I want a Raptor prepped and ready in five minutes o n the hangar deck. Inform the flagship Im coming aboard, I want a private meeting with the Admiral.
Hoshi Aye, sir.
Dualla What are you gonna do?
Apollo What I shouldve done a long time ago.
Apollo You cant do this. Shes a Cylon.
Adama Well, I trust her.
Apollo Well, thats a mistake.
Adama Well, itll be my mistake, wont it?
Apollo You are gambling with the lives of everyone o n this ship. And everyone o n my ship.
Adama I dont need a lecture from you about the responsibilities of command. Were done here.
Apollo Im not finished. This entire plan is a reckless gamble. And, yes, you certainly have the right to risk the lives of the men and women under your command. But thats not the issue. The issue is that you are risking the lives of the entire human race.
Adama Im trying to save the human race.
Apollo No. No, youre not. Thats what youre not seeing. Right now, the human race? Well, thats the 2,000 people huddled in those civilian ships that managed to get away when the Cylons came back. Theyre the safe bet. Theyre the o nes whose survival we should guard. Just like we did after the attack o n the Colonies.
Adama Sharon can penetrate the Cylon defenses.
Apollo Its not about her.
Adama The Centurions cant distinguish her from the other humanoid models. Did you know that?
Apollo Admiral.
Adama They were deliberately programmed that way. The Cylons didnt want them becoming self-aware and suddenly resisting orders. They didnt want their own robotic rebellion o n their hands. You can appreciate the irony.
Apollo_jumping_in_front_of_him Dad.
Adama I know what youre saying. But we have a responsibility to the people that we left behind.
Apollo Remember what Roslin said: Our first responsibility is to the survival of humanity. We cant lose sight of that. Over the last year, weve lost sight of almost everything. We got ...soft. But if we go back to New Caprica now, and we lose, its over. Humanity just stops. And an Admirals stars dont give you the right to make that gamble.
Adama Youre right, son. You should make plans to resume the search for earth with the Pegasus and the civilian fleet.
Apollo With Pegasus? What about Galactica?
Adama I know why we left those people behind. And I know it was their choice in the first place to be down there. And I realize that the survival of the human race outweighs anything else. But this time... I cant live with it. Cant face it. Maybe Im a coward. But Im going back.
Apollo Dad, you wont have a chance.
Adama Im going back, son.
Leoben_laughing_o_n_the_floor_with_Kacey o nce I fertilized your egg, we transferred it to a human woman who carried it to term. She was pretty, funny. Great smile. You wouldve liked her. Although her birth mother died during childbirth, Kaceys heart never faltered. I guess she gets that will to live from you. Ive seen her path. Its difficult, but rewarding. Shell know the mind of God in this lifetime. Shell see patterns that others do not see. She probably got such spiritual clarity from me.
Leoben Shell be hungry soon. Theres food o n the table. You wouldnt let your own child starve, would you?
Starbuck Its not my child. I dont even know if its human.
Leoben Half-human. And you know that shes yours. You just wont admit it.
Starbuck Where the frak are you going? Take this with you. Hey! Dont leave me alone with this.
Starbuck Frak!
Starbuck I dont know who or what you are, but I do know this. Im not your mother.
Roslin I dont care that its effective. I dont care that the Cylons cant stop it. Its wrong. No more suicide bombings, Colonel. You understand?
Tigh What, are you working for the Cylons now?
Roslin Im sorry. Theres no excuse for that.
Tigh_laughing_grimly You see, little things like that, they dont matter anymore. In fact, not too frakking much really matters anymore. Ive got o ne job here, lady, and o ne job o nly. To disrupt the Cylons. Make them worry about the anthill theyve stirred up down here so theyre distracted and out of position when the old man shows up in orbit.  The bombings, they got the Cylons attention. They really got their attention, and I am not giving that up.
Roslin We are talking about people blowing themselves up.
Tigh You know, sometimes I think that youve got ice water in those veins, and other times I think youre just a naive little schoolteacher. Ive sent men o n suicide missions in two wars now, and let me tell you something. It dont make a Godsdamn bit of difference whether theyre riding in a Viper or walking out o nto a parade ground, in the end theyre just as dead. So take your piety and your moralizing and your high-minded principles and stick em someplace safe until youre off this rock and youre sitting in your nice cushy chair o n Colonial o ne again. Ive got a war to fight.
Boomer The detentions are just causing more resentment and more enemies. Were losing ground with the people.
Caprica_Six I know. We dont have another option. We have to send the message that suicide bombings wont be tolerated.
Jammer Excuse me, sir. Can I talk to you for a moment?
Boomer Yeah, sure, Jammer. Ill catch up with you.
Caprica_Six Okay.
Jammer Sir, I dont know exactly how to broach this. Nor do I know exactly what I expect you to do about it. But, um, I thought, you know, since we were -- anyway, since we were back o n the Galactica …
Boomer Yeah, Jammer, just spit it out.
Jammer We picked up chief Tyrols wife in the last raid. Cally. Shes in detention. I think shes o n a list.
Kacey Ashes, ashes … Full of posies … Ashes, ashes …
Starbuck Frak!
Starbuck Kacey?
Leoben Kara?
Boomer Hi, Cally. Its me, Boomer.
Cally I wish I had a gun.
Boomer_sighing Are you all right? Physically, I mean.
Cally What do you want from me?
Boomer Look, a lots happened. In everyones life. But I want you to know -- I want you and Galen to know -- that Im happy for you. Especially since you started a family. Something that him and I talked about o nce before.
Cally_jumps_up_in_her_face Can you get me out of here?
Boomer I dont know. I have nothing to do with internal security…
Cally Then frak you, Sharon, you stupid frakked-up toaster. How many times do I have to shoot you, anyway? If you cant help me, then just go away and leave us alone!
PA All human personnel prepare to present identification before passing through security scanner. Have your IDs out. Everyone have their work IDs ready. Work IDs out.
NCP You! Open your bag. Stop her!
Doral 23 Cylons critically wounded. 14 had to be euthanized.
Boomer They had casualties too. Four human dead.
Cavil_1 Who gives a frak about that? Pardon my language.
Cavil_2 You said it, brother.
Doral The power substation was crippled. Almost half the citys without power, and our best estimates put the repairs at two weeks.
Three_to_Six_and_Boomer Do you still think were being too hard o n the human population?
Cavil We have a very serious, very straightforward problem. Either we increase control or we lose control. Thats a fact. We think its time for stronger measures.
Three We agree.
Simon We agree.
Doral We agree as well. How about you?
Six_1 We agree also.
Six_2_indicating_Caprica_Six Most of us do, anyway.
Three Enough.
Baltar Whats this?
Three This orders the summary executions of all the detainees listed o n the next page. It requires your signature.
Baltar My signature?
Doral Youre the President.
Three Read it later. Sign now.
Caprica_Six Just because youve decided to do this doesnt mean you need to drag him into sin with you.
Three_1 Dont you lecture me about sin.
Three_2 Im not the o ne who committed the first act of Cylon-on-Cylon violence in our history.
Baltar Whats she talking about?
Three_2 She crushed my head in with a rock back o n Caprica. Interesting she didnt tell you.
Caprica_Six Its something I had to do. Im not proud of it.
Cavil This is all very interesting. Very edifying. Sign the order.
Baltar You dont need my signature.
Three_2 Well, actually, we do. Were here as allies and friends of the legitimate government of the colonies. You are the President, so everything we do requires your signature.
Cavil In other words, theyre worried about what God might think if they commit murder. Theyre covering their existential asses.
Baltar I wont do it. All right? I wont do it. Youre going to have to salve your consciences some other way.
Doral Then well find another president.
Caprica_Six Stop this. This is crazy!
Baltar Dear God.
Cavil_1 Shell be back.
Cavil_2 But if he pulls that trigger now, you wont.
Doral Sign it. Sign it! Sign your name! Sign it! Sign it!
Six Theres nothing you can do, Gaius. Itll be okay.
Baltar Its you. Help me.
Six You have to sign it. Theyll kill you if you dont.
Doral_in_the_real_world Sign it! Sign it! Sign it! Sign your name! Sign it!
Baltar I cant. I wont. You cant force --
Six Sometimes you have to do things you hate so you can survive to fight another day.
Adama Raise your right hand and repeat after me. I, Sharon Agathon …
Sharon I, Sharon Agathon …
Adama Do now pledge my faith and my loyalty...
Sharon Do now pledge my faith and my loyalty...
Adama To the protection of the Twelve Colonies of Kobol.
Sharon To the protection of the Twelve Colonies of Kobol.
Adama And will carry out the lawful orders of my superiors...
Sharon And will carry out the lawful orders of my superiors...
Adama As an officer...
Sharon As an officer...
Adama In the Colonial Fleet.
Sharon In the Colonial Fleet.
Adama Congratulations, Lieutenant.
Helo Never thought Id live to see the day.
Sharon Me neither.
Helo Looks good o n you. Belongs o n you.
Sharon You know what this means to me.
Helo o ne of the first things they taught us at the academy was that symbols matter. Uniforms, flags, banners, even mascots. Theyre like pieces of your heart you can look at. This uniform... it means a lot to me, Sharon.
Sharon I know it does, Helo. It means a lot to me, too. I wont betray it.
Sharon Can I ask you a question? How do you know? I mean, how do you really know that you can trust me?
Adama I dont. Thats what trust is. Good hunting, Lieutenant.
Cavil Whew. Heh! That was really something.
Ellen_laughing Thought you might like that.
Cavil You didnt do the twist this time. What do you call … Whats that deal you did right at the end? What do you call that?
Ellen You mean the swirl.
Cavil Oh, the swirl. Boy, thats really something.
Ellen Well, you said you wanted something memorable.
Cavil Hmm. How is Saul?
Ellen Fine.
Cavil Whens his next meeting with the insurgents? No point in denying it, Ellen. We know hes their leader. Why do you think we let him out of detention?
Ellen_smiling_sexily I thought it was because of the twist.
Cavil Well, yes, that too, for sure. But having the Colonel out and active with the resistance presents us with certain advantages.
Ellen I dont know anything about--
Cavil lets just consider your denials as read, shall we? I want a specific place, and I want a specific time, for a very high level meeting of the insurgency leadership. And if I dont get it, we pick up Saul again. And this time, hell lose more than an eye.
Chief Tomorrow, the Galactica is gonna send two Raptors, several Marines, and a ground liaison officer is gonna brief us o n the rescue mission and help coordinate our evac plans.
Tigh Ill be damned. Its really happening. Whos the liaison officer?
Chief Sharon.
Tigh I hope thats your idea of a joke.
Chief Admiral Adama has given her a uniform and a billet. She is a serving officer. Which is more than you can say about us, technically speaking.
Tigh The old mans lost his mind, all right. Wheres the rendezvous?
Chief Ah, they left that up to us.
Anders_showing_a_map Okay, heres my suggestion. If they jump into Breeders Canyon out here in the southern range …
Tigh Come.
Ellen Hi, guys.
Chief Hey, Ellen.
Anders Anyway, like I was saying, if they jump in here they wont get picked up o n Cylon dradis.
Tigh Thats a long way out there. A lot of ground to cover by foot.
Anders I realize that. Im gonna meet them halfway. Right about here. Now, theres good cover from the air. Its pretty isolated.
Tigh Gotta be sure. May be the most important meeting were ever gonna have.
Anders Colonel, Im sure. This is the place. The Cylons will not find them here.
Tigh All right, give me the map. You got the message memorized? All the wireless freqs? …Give me the message, too.
Ellen Ill do that, Saul. Dont get up.
Tigh Thanks.
Anders Colonel, Ive assembled a team of about six to eight men and women about half a dozen times. We have provisions for a couple of days if we need em. We have access to running water. I know that place like the back of my hand. This is gonna work.
Gaeta_running_in Gaius! Gaius! Did you sign this? Tell me you didnt sign this, Gaius.
Baltar_sadly Not now, Mr. Gaeta. Im very tired.
Gaeta This is a death warrant. Have you seen the names o n this list? Do you have any idea what theyre about to do out there? Are you listening to me?
Baltar I didnt have any choice.
Gaeta What the hells the matter with you? There are over 200 names o n this list. Have you even looked at the names? Look at the names, Gaius!
Baltar Ive seen them! Ive seen them, all right? And there was nothing I could do.
NCP_1 Back to your frakking tents!
NCP_2 Everybody back to your tents!
Roslin And you do triple digits. You can do that. Let me see --
NCP Laura Roslin. Come with us, please.
Boomer Killing Tyrols wife will o nly embitter him against us. Hes the head of a labor union.
Three Come o n, Sharon, lets just be honest with o ne another. In your view, you dont think theres any reason to kill any of them, correct?
Boomer Right.
Three Well, we made a decision. All of us. Just like when we listened to you and Caprica Six when we came here to start this new and glorious chapter in Cylon-human relations.
Boomer This has nothing to do with whether or not we execute Cally.
Three No o ne enjoys the thought of mortal death, Boomer. But she tried to murder you. Maybe its Gods justice.
Roslin Need a lift, Mr. Vice President?
Zarek Guess so.
Roslin Havent seen much of you lately. Been busy these days?
Zarek Well, not much to do in detention.
Roslin How long have you been held?
Zarek Four months, I think. I told Baltar I wouldnt have any part of collaborating with the Cylons. And he got a little pissed.
Roslin_indicating_her_own_zip_cuffs I think hes a little pissed at me, too.
Zarek Heh!
Pilot Jump complete. Right o n target.
Sharon Okay, hang o n, guys. Im dropping down to the landing point and theres some heavy turbulence up ahead.
Anders Follow the river. Make sure you hug the bank.
Sharon Okay, o nce we reach the rendezvous point, stay back and provide cover.
Sharon_across_the_river Go, Panthers!
Anders C-Bucks rule!
Sharon Hey, Sam. Been a long time.
Anders Funny. I feel like I see you every day.
Starbuck Lords, please dont take her life. It was my mistake. Dont punish her for it.
Leoben It was an accident, Kara. Nothing more.
Starbuck Kacey? Kacey, oh, my Gods. Honey.
Cavil Let them stretch their legs for a minute.
Jammer Yes, sir.
Jammer Lets go. All right, everybody out. Five minute rest break. Come o n, move! Everybody out! Five minute rest break. Come o n, lets go! Come o n, five minutes. Everyone out. Lets go. Lets move. Come o n. Move, people!
Zarek Tell me something, Laura.
Roslin Hmm?
Zarek Last year?
Roslin Mmm?
Zarek You tried to steal the election, didnt you?
Roslin_smiling_ruefully Yes, I did, Tom.
Zarek_laughing Oh. I wish youd gone through with it.
Roslin Me too.
Anders Well wait until nightfall before we go back to the city. Theres a system of tunnels weve been using --
Sharon Shh! Did you hear that?
Anders Take cover! Take cover!
Sharon Go!
Jammer_in_his_balaclava You. Over here.
Jammer Run. Run. Dont look back. Go!
