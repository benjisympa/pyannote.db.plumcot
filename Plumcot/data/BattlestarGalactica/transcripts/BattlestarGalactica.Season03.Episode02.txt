dr_gaius_baltar Everyone … is being looked at right now. Youre no exception. I can help you, Laura. In ways I cannot help myself. I can protect you. But you have to understand the situation has changed now. The insurgency has crossed the line. Suicide bombings. Its abhorrent. Its contrary to everything that we believe in. So you -- you and I, we will, uh -- we will publicly condemn these tactics. They cannot be legitimized in any shape or form.
president_laura_roslin Theres something that scares the Cylons after all.
dr_gaius_baltar I should think using men and women as human bombs should scare us all.
president_laura_roslin Desperate people take desperate measures.
dr_gaius_baltar All right, look me in the eye. Look me in the eye and tell me that you approve of sending young men and women into crowded places with explosives strapped to their chests.
dr_gaius_baltar Im waiting for you to look me in the eye and tell me that you approve! 33 people killed. And their o nly crime was putting o n the police uniform. Trying to bring some order to the chaos out there.
president_laura_roslin Order? By arresting innocent people in the dead of night. Detaining them indefinitely without charge. Torturing them for information!
dr_gaius_baltar Nobodys been tortured.
president_laura_roslin Tell that to colonel Tigh.
dr_gaius_baltar Nobody has been tortured. Were done here.
dr_gaius_baltar I hope you understand the severity of the situation. Id ask you to obey the dictates of your conscience... which is what Ive always done.
president_laura_roslin Of that I have no doubt.
dr_gaius_baltar Please give this lovely lady her shoes back. Then get her out of here.
Human_Police#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode02 Curfew is now in effect. Severe penalties will be imposed o n anyone found o n the streets. Curfew is now in effect. Severe penalties will be imposed o n anyone found o n the streets.
NCP_#1#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode02 I dont know about this.
NCP_#2#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode02 We need to make a point. The violence must end. We got a job to do.
NCP_#3#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode02 What are we doing? Is that him?
NCP_#4#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode02 Yeah, just do what he asks. Everything will be okay.
john_cavil You understand your orders, Captain? Everything clear?
jammer Yes, sir.
john_cavil Good. Dont worry. We have your back.
chief_galen_tyrol Did you hear? The Cylons cut food rations toady.
samuel_anders We heard. How long before the next Raptor transmission?
chief_galen_tyrol Two minutes. You know, theyre taking about shutting down the marketplace. Its a security risk.
colonel_saul_tigh Well shift targets.
chief_galen_tyrol You were gonna hit the marketplace. The market? Full of civilians. This is crazy. You know, we need to figure out whose side were o n.
colonel_saul_tigh Which side are we o n? Were o n the side of the demons, Chief. Were evil men in the gardens of Paradise. Sent by the forces of death to spread devastation and destruction wherever we go. Im surprised you didnt know that.
chief_galen_tyrol Contact. Theyre ready for the sitrep.
colonel_saul_tigh Send it twice, just to make sure.
john_cavil Here are the names of those to be arrested and sent to detention.
jammer I, uh -- I know some of these people.
john_cavil Im sure you do. Theyre all insurgents, jammer. We have to break the cycle of violence.
jammer Okay, suit up.
john_cavil You wont have to wear those much longer. Eventually your people will see you as heroes.
jammer Not tonight. Take numbers five through ten. Okay, take the tents to the right. Follow down to the end. Rest of you guys gotta keep quiet, okay?
NCP_Officer#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode02 This is New Caprica Police!
NCP_Officer#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode02 Youre under arrest for colluding with the insurgency.
NCP_Officer#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode02 Youre wanting for questioning in the graduation bomb.
NCP_Officer#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode02 Cally Tyrol, this is an NCP raid.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson No! Let go of me!
NCP_Officer#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode02 Get your hands up.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson My baby! No! No, my baby! No!
NCP_Officer#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode02 Hey, hey, hey!
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson No, no, no, no.
Chief_picks_up_Baby_Nick#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode02 Shh, shh, shh, shh. I got you. I got you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, there you go. Mommys coming back. Its okay. Its okay. Its okay.
captain_karl_agathon Their numbers are a little thin. It says here Tigh commands 1,150 armed effectives. Thats a lot less than he should have if you count all former Fleet officers and enlisted available down there.
officer_anastasia_dualla Could be taking heavy losses. They mentioned a Cylon crackdown.
louanne_katraine We should get a breakdown of available pilots in the insurgent group. Somebodys gotta fly those ships off the ground if were gonna pull this off.
admiral_william_adama Those ships arent going anywhere yet. The Cylons have removed launch keys from grounded Colonial ships. Location unknown. Came from Tyrol.
louanne_katraine Can we manufacture new launch keys?
cpt_lee_adama Forget it. The specs o n launch keys are incredibly sophisticated. It would take weeks just to do the R&D.
admiral_william_adama Best option is for Saul and the people o n the ground to find the original launch keys.
officer_anastasia_dualla Assuming they werent destroyed.
louanne_katraine No. No way. The Cylons would want to keep them safe just in case they needed to use o ne of those ships someday.
captain_karl_agathon Shes right. Keys gotta still be there somewhere.
louanne_katraine We can make a weapons drop to the insurgents. They know the lay of the land, theyve been hitting the Cylons in the teeth for months. Given them the tools, they can kind the keys themselves.
cpt_lee_adama No. No way. The o nly thing youve got going for you so far is that the Cylon reduced their defense perimeter to just five baseships. You put heavy weaponry down there, theyre gonna know for sure that were in contact with the population. Call in ten more baseships and then your whole plans frakked.
louanne_katraine Funny, thought this was OUR plan, sir.
admiral_william_adama Moving o n. The military plans that you have in your hands are to be kept with you at all times.
chief_galen_tyrol Whyd they pick her up? She hasnt done anything. Weve got a baby, for Godssakes.
lt_felix_gaeta I dont know. Ill try to find out.
chief_galen_tyrol How long are they gonna hold her?
lt_felix_gaeta …Detention is run by a separate ministry. They dont give us any reasons why they --
chief_galen_tyrol Godsdammit, Felix. She hasnt done anything. Weve got a baby.
lt_felix_gaeta I know, Galen. Im sorry.
chief_galen_tyrol How do you do it? How do you help them day after day? How do you look yourself in the mirror? I gotta get my son. Camerons watching him, but shes got problems of her own.
lt_felix_gaeta Chief! Ill see what I can do. Ill see if theres something I can find out.
chief_galen_tyrol Yeah. Why dont you try and do something?
Cally_voiceover#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode02 Please! No! No!
chief_galen_tyrol Hey, you okay? Jammer, whats going o n?
jammer Yeah. Yeah, Im okay, Chief.
chief_galen_tyrol All right.
jammer Hey, uh... I heard about last night.
chief_galen_tyrol Shh. What?
jammer About Cally being o n o ne of those lists.
chief_galen_tyrol Yeah.
jammer Im really sorry.
chief_galen_tyrol Yeah. Frakkin human police, huh? Bunch of traitors if you ask me.
jammer Some of those guys who joined up, I bet theyre in over their heads, you know? Especially now with these suicide bombings and … At first, I bet you they thought they were doing something good. You know, get the Cylons off the streets. Let us police our own.
chief_galen_tyrol Theyre a bunch of frakkin idiots. What did they expect? You dont know any of those guys, do you? Any names?
jammer Names? No. N-no idea.
chief_galen_tyrol Damn.
jammer Well, whats up with Cally? Why did they put her in detention?
chief_galen_tyrol I dont know. She hasnt done a Godsdamn thing. I just talked to Gaeta. Says he doesnt know squat. Or so he says.
jammer Gaetas a good guy. If he knows something …
chief_galen_tyrol Hes a frakkin collaborator. You know what? o ne day when this is all over, guys like Gaeta are gonna get strung up. And guys like you and me, were gonna be there tying the knots. Making em tight.
leoben_conoy Its been a couple of ugly days. I know you dont care about that, but life means something to us. So Ive decided to show you just how precious life can be. How even in the worst of times, it can restore your faith.
leoben_conoy Remember that breeding farm o n Caprica?
captain_kara_thrace I remember I blew the frak out of the place.
leoben_conoy It wasnt a total loss. We were able to salvage certain things. Certain medical samples. Like your ovary.
captain_kara_thrace Whats that?
leoben_conoy This is Kacey. Kacey, this is Kara. Your mother.
kacey Hi.
leoben_conoy Good girl.
officer_anastasia_dualla Unbelievable.
cpt_lee_adama What?
officer_anastasia_dualla Admirals decided to put some boots o n the ground. Wants to send an officer as a liaison between us and the resistance elements o n the planet to coordinate the rescue op.
cpt_lee_adama Makes sense. Whats the problem?
officer_anastasia_dualla Its who hes sending.
cpt_lee_adama Hes frakking kidding with this, right?
officer_anastasia_dualla I wish he were.
cpt_lee_adama Mr. Hoshi, I want a Raptor prepped and ready in five minutes o n the hangar deck. Inform the flagship Im coming aboard, I want a private meeting with the Admiral.
lt_louis_hoshi Aye, sir.
officer_anastasia_dualla What are you gonna do?
cpt_lee_adama What I shouldve done a long time ago.
cpt_lee_adama You cant do this. Shes a Cylon.
admiral_william_adama Well, I trust her.
cpt_lee_adama Well, thats a mistake.
admiral_william_adama Well, itll be my mistake, wont it?
cpt_lee_adama You are gambling with the lives of everyone o n this ship. And everyone o n my ship.
admiral_william_adama I dont need a lecture from you about the responsibilities of command. Were done here.
cpt_lee_adama Im not finished. This entire plan is a reckless gamble. And, yes, you certainly have the right to risk the lives of the men and women under your command. But thats not the issue. The issue is that you are risking the lives of the entire human race.
admiral_william_adama Im trying to save the human race.
cpt_lee_adama No. No, youre not. Thats what youre not seeing. Right now, the human race? Well, thats the 2,000 people huddled in those civilian ships that managed to get away when the Cylons came back. Theyre the safe bet. Theyre the o nes whose survival we should guard. Just like we did after the attack o n the Colonies.
admiral_william_adama Sharon can penetrate the Cylon defenses.
cpt_lee_adama Its not about her.
admiral_william_adama The Centurions cant distinguish her from the other humanoid models. Did you know that?
cpt_lee_adama Admiral.
admiral_william_adama They were deliberately programmed that way. The Cylons didnt want them becoming self-aware and suddenly resisting orders. They didnt want their own robotic rebellion o n their hands. You can appreciate the irony.
cpt_lee_adama Dad.
admiral_william_adama I know what youre saying. But we have a responsibility to the people that we left behind.
cpt_lee_adama Remember what Roslin said: Our first responsibility is to the survival of humanity. We cant lose sight of that. Over the last year, weve lost sight of almost everything. We got ...soft. But if we go back to New Caprica now, and we lose, its over. Humanity just stops. And an Admirals stars dont give you the right to make that gamble.
admiral_william_adama Youre right, son. You should make plans to resume the search for earth with the Pegasus and the civilian fleet.
cpt_lee_adama With Pegasus? What about Galactica?
admiral_william_adama I know why we left those people behind. And I know it was their choice in the first place to be down there. And I realize that the survival of the human race outweighs anything else. But this time... I cant live with it. Cant face it. Maybe Im a coward. But Im going back.
cpt_lee_adama Dad, you wont have a chance.
admiral_william_adama Im going back, son.
leoben_conoy o nce I fertilized your egg, we transferred it to a human woman who carried it to term. She was pretty, funny. Great smile. You wouldve liked her. Although her birth mother died during childbirth, Kaceys heart never faltered. I guess she gets that will to live from you. Ive seen her path. Its difficult, but rewarding. Shell know the mind of God in this lifetime. Shell see patterns that others do not see. She probably got such spiritual clarity from me.
leoben_conoy Shell be hungry soon. Theres food o n the table. You wouldnt let your own child starve, would you?
captain_kara_thrace Its not my child. I dont even know if its human.
leoben_conoy Half-human. And you know that shes yours. You just wont admit it.
captain_kara_thrace Where the frak are you going? Take this with you. Hey! Dont leave me alone with this.
captain_kara_thrace Frak!
captain_kara_thrace I dont know who or what you are, but I do know this. Im not your mother.
president_laura_roslin I dont care that its effective. I dont care that the Cylons cant stop it. Its wrong. No more suicide bombings, Colonel. You understand?
colonel_saul_tigh What, are you working for the Cylons now?
president_laura_roslin Im sorry. Theres no excuse for that.
colonel_saul_tigh You see, little things like that, they dont matter anymore. In fact, not too frakking much really matters anymore. Ive got o ne job here, lady, and o ne job o nly. To disrupt the Cylons. Make them worry about the anthill theyve stirred up down here so theyre distracted and out of position when the old man shows up in orbit. The bombings, they got the Cylons attention. They really got their attention, and I am not giving that up.
president_laura_roslin We are talking about people blowing themselves up.
colonel_saul_tigh You know, sometimes I think that youve got ice water in those veins, and other times I think youre just a naive little schoolteacher. Ive sent men o n suicide missions in two wars now, and let me tell you something. It dont make a Godsdamn bit of difference whether theyre riding in a Viper or walking out o nto a parade ground, in the end theyre just as dead. So take your piety and your moralizing and your high-minded principles and stick em someplace safe until youre off this rock and youre sitting in your nice cushy chair o n Colonial o ne again. Ive got a war to fight.
lt_sharon_valerii The detentions are just causing more resentment and more enemies. Were losing ground with the people.
number_six I know. We dont have another option. We have to send the message that suicide bombings wont be tolerated.
jammer Excuse me, sir. Can I talk to you for a moment?
lt_sharon_valerii Yeah, sure, Jammer. Ill catch up with you.
number_six Okay.
jammer Sir, I dont know exactly how to broach this. Nor do I know exactly what I expect you to do about it. But, um, I thought, you know, since we were -- anyway, since we were back o n the Galactica …
lt_sharon_valerii Yeah, Jammer, just spit it out.
jammer We picked up chief Tyrols wife in the last raid. Cally. Shes in detention. I think shes o n a list.
kacey Ashes, ashes … Full of posies … Ashes, ashes …
captain_kara_thrace Frak!
captain_kara_thrace Kacey?
leoben_conoy Kara?
lt_sharon_valerii Hi, Cally. Its me, Boomer.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson I wish I had a gun.
lt_sharon_valerii Are you all right? Physically, I mean.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson What do you want from me?
lt_sharon_valerii Look, a lots happened. In everyones life. But I want you to know -- I want you and Galen to know -- that Im happy for you. Especially since you started a family. Something that him and I talked about o nce before.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Can you get me out of here?
lt_sharon_valerii I dont know. I have nothing to do with internal security…
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Then frak you, Sharon, you stupid frakked-up toaster. How many times do I have to shoot you, anyway? If you cant help me, then just go away and leave us alone!
PA#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode02 All human personnel prepare to present identification before passing through security scanner. Have your IDs out. Everyone have their work IDs ready. Work IDs out.
NCP#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode02 You! Open your bag. Stop her!
aaron_doral 23 Cylons critically wounded. 14 had to be euthanized.
lt_sharon_valerii They had casualties too. Four human dead.
john_cavil Who gives a frak about that? Pardon my language.
john_cavil You said it, brother.
aaron_doral The power substation was crippled. Almost half the citys without power, and our best estimates put the repairs at two weeks.
danna_biers Do you still think were being too hard o n the human population?
john_cavil We have a very serious, very straightforward problem. Either we increase control or we lose control. Thats a fact. We think its time for stronger measures.
danna_biers We agree.
simon We agree.
aaron_doral We agree as well. How about you?
number_six We agree also.
number_six Most of us do, anyway.
danna_biers Enough.
dr_gaius_baltar Whats this?
danna_biers This orders the summary executions of all the detainees listed o n the next page. It requires your signature.
dr_gaius_baltar My signature?
aaron_doral Youre the President.
danna_biers Read it later. Sign now.
number_six Just because youve decided to do this doesnt mean you need to drag him into sin with you.
danna_biers Dont you lecture me about sin.
danna_biers Im not the o ne who committed the first act of Cylon-on-Cylon violence in our history.
dr_gaius_baltar Whats she talking about?
danna_biers She crushed my head in with a rock back o n Caprica. Interesting she didnt tell you.
number_six Its something I had to do. Im not proud of it.
john_cavil This is all very interesting. Very edifying. Sign the order.
dr_gaius_baltar You dont need my signature.
danna_biers Well, actually, we do. Were here as allies and friends of the legitimate government of the colonies. You are the President, so everything we do requires your signature.
john_cavil In other words, theyre worried about what God might think if they commit murder. Theyre covering their existential asses.
dr_gaius_baltar I wont do it. All right? I wont do it. Youre going to have to salve your consciences some other way.
aaron_doral Then well find another president.
number_six Stop this. This is crazy!
dr_gaius_baltar Dear God.
john_cavil Shell be back.
john_cavil But if he pulls that trigger now, you wont.
aaron_doral Sign it. Sign it! Sign your name! Sign it! Sign it!
number_six Theres nothing you can do, Gaius. Itll be okay.
dr_gaius_baltar Its you. Help me.
number_six You have to sign it. Theyll kill you if you dont.
aaron_doral Sign it! Sign it! Sign it! Sign your name! Sign it!
dr_gaius_baltar I cant. I wont. You cant force --
number_six Sometimes you have to do things you hate so you can survive to fight another day.
admiral_william_adama Raise your right hand and repeat after me. I, Sharon Agathon …
lt_sharon_valerii I, Sharon Agathon …
admiral_william_adama Do now pledge my faith and my loyalty...
lt_sharon_valerii Do now pledge my faith and my loyalty...
admiral_william_adama To the protection of the Twelve Colonies of Kobol.
lt_sharon_valerii To the protection of the Twelve Colonies of Kobol.
admiral_william_adama And will carry out the lawful orders of my superiors...
lt_sharon_valerii And will carry out the lawful orders of my superiors...
admiral_william_adama As an officer...
lt_sharon_valerii As an officer...
admiral_william_adama In the Colonial Fleet.
lt_sharon_valerii In the Colonial Fleet.
admiral_william_adama Congratulations, Lieutenant.
captain_karl_agathon Never thought Id live to see the day.
lt_sharon_valerii Me neither.
captain_karl_agathon Looks good o n you. Belongs o n you.
lt_sharon_valerii You know what this means to me.
captain_karl_agathon o ne of the first things they taught us at the academy was that symbols matter. Uniforms, flags, banners, even mascots. Theyre like pieces of your heart you can look at. This uniform... it means a lot to me, Sharon.
lt_sharon_valerii I know it does, Helo. It means a lot to me, too. I wont betray it.
lt_sharon_valerii Can I ask you a question? How do you know? I mean, how do you really know that you can trust me?
admiral_william_adama I dont. Thats what trust is. Good hunting, Lieutenant.
john_cavil Whew. Heh! That was really something.
ellen_tigh Thought you might like that.
john_cavil You didnt do the twist this time. What do you call … Whats that deal you did right at the end? What do you call that?
ellen_tigh You mean the swirl.
john_cavil Oh, the swirl. Boy, thats really something.
ellen_tigh Well, you said you wanted something memorable.
john_cavil Hmm. How is Saul?
ellen_tigh Fine.
john_cavil Whens his next meeting with the insurgents? No point in denying it, Ellen. We know hes their leader. Why do you think we let him out of detention?
ellen_tigh I thought it was because of the twist.
john_cavil Well, yes, that too, for sure. But having the Colonel out and active with the resistance presents us with certain advantages.
ellen_tigh I dont know anything about--
john_cavil lets just consider your denials as read, shall we? I want a specific place, and I want a specific time, for a very high level meeting of the insurgency leadership. And if I dont get it, we pick up Saul again. And this time, hell lose more than an eye.
chief_galen_tyrol Tomorrow, the Galactica is gonna send two Raptors, several Marines, and a ground liaison officer is gonna brief us o n the rescue mission and help coordinate our evac plans.
colonel_saul_tigh Ill be damned. Its really happening. Whos the liaison officer?
chief_galen_tyrol Sharon.
colonel_saul_tigh I hope thats your idea of a joke.
chief_galen_tyrol Admiral Adama has given her a uniform and a billet. She is a serving officer. Which is more than you can say about us, technically speaking.
colonel_saul_tigh The old mans lost his mind, all right. Wheres the rendezvous?
chief_galen_tyrol Ah, they left that up to us.
samuel_anders Okay, heres my suggestion. If they jump into Breeders Canyon out here in the southern range …
colonel_saul_tigh Come.
ellen_tigh Hi, guys.
chief_galen_tyrol Hey, Ellen.
samuel_anders Anyway, like I was saying, if they jump in here they wont get picked up o n Cylon dradis.
colonel_saul_tigh Thats a long way out there. A lot of ground to cover by foot.
samuel_anders I realize that. Im gonna meet them halfway. Right about here. Now, theres good cover from the air. Its pretty isolated.
colonel_saul_tigh Gotta be sure. May be the most important meeting were ever gonna have.
samuel_anders Colonel, Im sure. This is the place. The Cylons will not find them here.
colonel_saul_tigh All right, give me the map. You got the message memorized? All the wireless freqs? …Give me the message, too.
ellen_tigh Ill do that, Saul. Dont get up.
colonel_saul_tigh Thanks.
samuel_anders Colonel, Ive assembled a team of about six to eight men and women about half a dozen times. We have provisions for a couple of days if we need em. We have access to running water. I know that place like the back of my hand. This is gonna work.
lt_felix_gaeta Gaius! Gaius! Did you sign this? Tell me you didnt sign this, Gaius.
dr_gaius_baltar Not now, Mr. Gaeta. Im very tired.
lt_felix_gaeta This is a death warrant. Have you seen the names o n this list? Do you have any idea what theyre about to do out there? Are you listening to me?
dr_gaius_baltar I didnt have any choice.
lt_felix_gaeta What the hells the matter with you? There are over 200 names o n this list. Have you even looked at the names? Look at the names, Gaius!
dr_gaius_baltar Ive seen them! Ive seen them, all right? And there was nothing I could do.
NCP_1#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode02 Back to your frakking tents!

NCP#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode02 Laura Roslin. Come with us, please.
lt_sharon_valerii Killing Tyrols wife will o nly embitter him against us. Hes the head of a labor union.
danna_biers Come o n, Sharon, lets just be honest with o ne another. In your view, you dont think theres any reason to kill any of them, correct?
lt_sharon_valerii Right.
danna_biers Well, we made a decision. All of us. Just like when we listened to you and Caprica Six when we came here to start this new and glorious chapter in Cylon-human relations.
lt_sharon_valerii This has nothing to do with whether or not we execute Cally.
danna_biers No o ne enjoys the thought of mortal death, Boomer. But she tried to murder you. Maybe its Gods justice.
president_laura_roslin Need a lift, Mr. Vice President?
tom_zarek Guess so.
president_laura_roslin Havent seen much of you lately. Been busy these days?
tom_zarek Well, not much to do in detention.
president_laura_roslin How long have you been held?
tom_zarek Four months, I think. I told Baltar I wouldnt have any part of collaborating with the Cylons. And he got a little pissed.
president_laura_roslin I think hes a little pissed at me, too.
tom_zarek Heh!
