Ellen Can I help you? Here we go.
Tigh Thanks.
Ellen Sorry.
Tigh Thats all right. It doesnt hurt. I appreciate you doing this. I cant seem to get it right in the mirror.
Ellen Saul. Um, I want you to know that I would do anything for you…
Chief The list. Callys on the list. Theyre gonna kill her.
Tigh What list?
Chief Theyre gonna kill her.
Tigh What are you talking about?
Chief I got this. I got this from the dead drop, from the source in the administration. Its a death list and Callys name is on it.
Chief Theyre rounding up people in the city. Callys already in the detention, they could take her out at any minute, and then just--
Tigh They got this organized by transport vehicles. Callys in the group heading for map coordinate x-ray seven.
Chief I know, but where the frak is that? I mean, how are we gonna --
Tigh Calm down, dammit. You gotta start thinking clearly here, Chief, or shes dead. Now weve already figured out their map coordinate system. Its referred to in the list of Cylon freqs you got from the last dead drop.
Chief Holy frak! Youre right. I can extrapolate the coordinate system --
Tigh Callys group has to pick up a bunch of people in town first. Thatll take time. Take four men and get out there ahead of the trucks.
Tigh Chief! Pull it together. You wont do her any good if you get caught too. Besides, the last thing your son wants is me and Ellen for parents. Find that list, Chief.
Chief Where the frak is it? Dammit! Dammit! Wheres that frackin list? Its gotta be here. Its gotta be here. Frak! Come on! Here it is. Okay. X-ray seven. 1, 4, 3...
Seelix Hey, Chief. Good day for a walk, huh?
Chief Get your men together. Were going to Pergamus Flats.
Sharon Talk to me, Gunny.
Marine Dont like it, LT. Too much cover along this trail. We could catch enfilade fire from there...there... and along there.
Sharon Lets move out. Im going to the rendezvous point. Place your men on the ridge for cover.
Sharon Go Panthers!
Anders C-Bucks rule!
Sharon Hey, Sam. Its been a while.
Anders Funny, I feel like I see you every day. Come on.
Chief_to_his_men Trucks. Move down to the ridge. Move down to the ridge. Crispin, you here. Chief: This is it. Lock and load.
Chief All right. What do we see? Oh, frak me.
Seelix What?
Chief They got Laura Roslin and Tom Zarek with them.
Seelix Is there any sign of Cally?
Chief Not yet.
Sharon So Galacticas got a rescue plan in place and ready to go. My jobs to get the launch keys for the civilian ships still on the ground, then coordinate the rescue mission with your evacuation plan. When can we meet with Colonel Tigh?
Anders Were gonna wait until nightfall before we head back into the city.
Chief There she is. There she is. Oh, my Gods. There she is. What the fraks she doing? Shes making a run for it.
Seelix The bulletheads are lining up.
Chief Its a firing squad. Sight in on the Centurions... right now!
Seelix Callys right in our line of fire. If we shoot, were gonna hit her.
Chief Count to five. Open fire.
Man Two skinjobs. Should we take em down?
Seelix Where there are skinjobs, there are bulletheads. Bring up the RPG.
Anders Theres a system of tunnels we been using that run parallel and under --
Sharon Shh! Do you hear that?
Seelix Thousand one... thousand two... thousand three... thousand four... thousand five.
Anders Frak this. We gotta get out of here.
Sharon Stay put. Trust me. …Now!
Anders Thanks.
Chief Shh, shh, shh. I got you. I got you.
Marine They were waiting for us, LT. Right where we thought.
Insurgent_with_Anderss_map Sir, you better take a look at this. I found it on a dead skinjob. Its your handwriting, isnt it?
Anders Yeah. Damn right it is. We were sold out. Ellen.
Roslin You all right, Tom?
Zarek Yeah. Been a while since I had a woman throw me to the ground. Not quite as much fun as I remember.
Seelix_to_injured_Cavil Hurts, huh? Good. Then I hope it hurts a long, long time till you go to download city.
Chief You all right down there?
Roslin Oh, my Gods. Its good to see you, Chief.
Chief Good to see you too, maam.
Cally What happens now? Where do we go from here?
Chief Were going home. Were going home. Admiral Adamas on his way. Were getting off this rock. Were going back to Galactica.
Caprica_Six Dont worry about it, Gaius. Its all right. It doesnt matter to me really…
Baltar You can stop that right now, okay? My egos not so fragile as all that. These things happen. Or they dont happen. So what should we talk about? Should we talk about your day? How was your day, darling? How was your day at the office? My office. Any news? No? Well, let me tell you about my day, because it was a hoot. I had the most fascinating chat with one of the Dorals. Hes got this theory about sanitation being the key to regaining human trust and confidence. Something about toilet paper. No, lack of toilet paper, thats it. If people could only wipe their bums properly, thered be a measurable uptick in the polls.
Caprica_Six Four months of this, Gaius. Four months of watching you slip further and further down into this well of self-hatred and -loathing. Do you know what Ive given up for you? Do you?
Baltar Do you know, what with the occupation and everything, I cant really say Ive given it that much thought recently.
Baltar Dont go. Please.
Starbuck That doesnt look so bad. Theres something that I wanted to say to you. Im sorry that I left you alone. I didnt mean for you to get hurt. I was upset with myself. And not you, okay? Uh... grown-ups do stupid things sometimes. We get … caught up in our own little world until its almost too late. You have no idea what Im saying to you, do you? Okay. Time to take a nap.
Dodona_Selloi Dont be afraid. I know who you are. What you are. Poor thing. You must be terrified. Do you have any candy?
Three Candy? No.
Selloi Chamallas so bitter. Zeus sees all. Sees you, number Three. Sees your pain. Your destiny. All the Gods weep for you.
Three There is no Zeus. No other God but God.
Selloi Well, you dont believe that anymore. You dont know what you believe and that is why youre here.
Three Its not true. I dont even know why Im here. This is the stupidest thing I ever did.
Selloi It is your dream that brings you to me.
Three How do you know about that?
Selloi I have a message for you from the one you worship. He speaks through me to you just as he speaks in your dreams. The message is... the fruit born of two peoples is alive. A child named after the wife and sister of the all-knowing Zeus. Hera lives.
Three_sadly Thats not true. The child is dead.
Selloi You will hold her in your arms, and youll know for the first time what it is to feel true love. But youll lose everything youve done here. Wish I had some chocolate caramels.
Helo_to_crew Lets move! We got some people waiting for their ride down there. Will you quit looking at me like that?
Dualla Like what?
Helo You know like what. Like were never gonna see each other again. We will. Its a good plan, D.
Dualla Take care of the Admiral?
Helo Take care of his son.
Helo All right, people, you know how this works: Pegasus crew on the port side of the line, Galactica on the right.
Officer_reading_from_the_Scrolls Their enemies will divide them. Their colonies broken in the fiery chasm of space. Their shining days renounced by a multitude of dark sacrifices. Yet still they will remain always together.
All always together.
Adama thats the third time youve taken a look at your watch. Got dinner plans?
Apollo_laughing No, I was just thinking. Sharons probably on the ground by now.
Adama I know. These are your orders. Youll find the rendezvous point there. Take the civilian fleet. And wait for me for 18 hours. If Im not back in 18 hours, then find Earth.
Apollo Yeah, right.
Adama_quieter Ill see you at the rendezvous point.
Apollo 18 hours. Try not to be late.
Adama Im getting old. Im a little slow. But Ill be there.
Apollo Gods, I wish I could talk you out of this.
Adama You cant. You tried.
Apollo You know Dad, um --
Adama Dont. Dont make me cry in my own hangar deck.
Apollo Okay.
Adama Ill see you there.
Apollo Permission to leave your ship, Admiral.
Adama Permission granted, Commander.
Apollo_from_a_Raptors_wing Attention! Commander Pegasus departing. 18 hours.
Three Hey. Hey! Hey, Jake. Hey, Jake. Yeah, you dont care who I am, do ya? All Gods creatures in your eyes.  Here ya go.
Cottle Cant sleep?
Three Bad dreams.
Cottle Didnt know you people had dreams.
Three Oh, sure. Everybody dreams, Doc. That human or Cylon blood?
Cottle Cylon. one of the Fives got pretty shot up today by the insurgents. But hes gonna make it.
Three You couldve let him suffer.
Cottle Thats not what I do.
Three_smiling What about the baby? Sharons baby Hera. When that child died on Galactica, whyd you cremate the body? Its the first Cylon-human hybrid, and you threw it in the incinerator?
Cottle It wasnt my decision. That was the Presidents call. I was just following orders.
Three Thats a very funny thing. Cause this stuff all looks the same.
Cavil She said, I hope it hurts you for a long, long time before you go to download city. Then they just left me there. They left me in the hot sun with a bullet in my guts.
Doral_to_Baltar what a noble race you are.
Boomer How long were you there before you died?
Cavil Hours. Eventually, I managed to drag myself over to some spent shell casings. I used one of those to scratch open my carotid artery. Skin is a lot tougher than you think. Now thats...three for me. Three downloads. The first one, I just got a headache. But I could handle it. Now its worse and worse. This time it was like a frakkin white hot poker through my skull. Not worth it. None of this is worth it.
Baltar Hes right, you know. Its not worth it. Which is what I believe Ive been telling you all along.
Doral Caprica, can you please control him?
Baltar Why dont you just shoot me... if thatll remedy the situation?
Doral We need to crack down harder.
Caprica_Six How? Our resources are stretched to the max already.
Cavil I dont need to listen to this anymore.
Three Consensus used to be so easy. Now look what theyve done to us.
Doral Dont lose hope. Worst comes to worst, we can always nuke the city and be done with it.
Anders Better leave those dog tags here. They spot em, theyll know who you are.
Sharon No, you have no idea how hard I worked for these.
Anders So our best guess puts the launch keys somewhere in the detention center. Just keep to the main streets. Everybodyll think youre just a regular skinjob and theyll avoid you. But theres a lot of people out there looking to gut an unwary Cylon going for a stroll, so dont let anybody get close enough to stick a knife in you.
Sharon All right. Thanks for the concern. It makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.
Anders How are you gonna find those launch keys?
Sharon When I get inside and hook into the data stream, itll feed me the location. Now, once I get the keys, you need to distribute them to the pilots who can fly those ships out of here.
Anders Were already on it. We got pilots standing by.
Insurgents Commanders!
Anders Yeah, come in.
Ellen My Gods! Whats she doing here?
Anders Get her down below and keep her there until after the next briefing.
Ellen Wait a minute! No, no. Wait, listen to me. Please. I can explain.
Anders I suggest you keep your mouth shut.
Ellen Where is my husband? I want to speak to my husband.
Anders Lets go, get her down.
Sharon Okay, Im outta here.
Anders Wait. Sharon.
Sharon Yeah.
Anders Do me a favor. Just keep an eye out for Starbuck. I dont know if shes alive or if shes dead. But its been four months.
Sharon Ill do what I can.
Anders Yeah.
Laura You must keep the child hidden at all costs.
Anders We keep her on the move along with other high-value targets. Shell never stay in any one location longer than two or three days.
Laura Sam, I need you to really hear me on this. Really. There is no one -- no one -- of higher value than Maya and her child. We cannot let them fall into Cylon hands.
Anders I get it. How far do you want me to go? I mean, if it looks like the Cylons are gonna capture them --
Laura No. Dont let it get to that point. Thats all.
Anders I dont suppose youre gonna tell me what this is all about. I mean, whats so important about this kid?
Laura She may very well be the shape of things to come. Thats either a blessing or a curse.
Chief Weve stored arms and munitions in key areas throughout the city.
Mathias I can supplement that with mortars, RPGs, even a few shoulder-mounted anti-aircraft missiles aboard the Raptor.
Chief Great. When we give the signal, our people are gonna attack the airbase, the detention center, the power station, other critical facilities. The plan is to sow as much chaos and confusion as possible the moment Galactica and Pegasus arrive. That should help cover the evacuation.
Mathias No Pegasus. Just Galactica.
Roslin Why? Why no Pegasus? What happened?
Mathias Dont know, sir. Way beyond my pay grade. What about your evac plans?
Tory Weve designated and assigned 500 block captains to cover each sector of the city. Each block captain is responsible for rallying and guiding the people in his or her sector along their escape route to their designated ship.
Zarek Dont suppose youve been able to rehearse any of this.
Roslin Indeed. Weve had three full-dress rehearsals under the guise of fire and natural disaster drills.
Mathias Be different when the balloon goes up. Explosions, shooting, chaos. Theres gonna be some panic out there.
Roslin theyll do fine. These people know that at some point, theyre gonna be responsible for saving themselves. All we need to do is be ready and hope for the best. What about Maya and Isis?
Anders Im on it. Ive got my two best shooters here. Theyre gonna be their escorts and make sure they get back to the ship.
Roslin Gentlemen, I cant tell you why, but it is imperative that this woman and her child get off this planet. I trust you because I trust him.
Ellen_runs_up Saul!
Anders We need to talk.
Woman Toaster!
Anders She sold us out.
Tigh What are you talking about?
Anders We were ambushed at the rendezvous. The Cylons knew exactly where we were gonna be.
Tigh That doesnt mean Ellen had anything--
Anders This is the map, Colonel! The map that I drew for you. I gave this to you in your tent. You were gonna burn it, but then your wife offered to do it for you. I got it off a dead skinjob at the ambush. Do the math!
Ellen I want to explain, Saul.
Insurgent Godsdamn traitor!
Tigh Shut your frakkin mouth!
Ellen He said -- he said hed kill you.
Tigh Who said it?
Ellen one of the Brother Cavils. I did it for you...Saul. It was all for you, I had to. I didnt have any choice. Dont you see that?
Sharon Drawer 3-7-8.
Three What are you doing? Oh, my God, its you. Youre betraying your own people. For what?
Sharon Im a Colonial officer now.
Three Youre not one of them.
Sharon I gave them my word.
Three Thats not what counts. Its who you give it to.
Sharon Im gonna have to shoot you now.
Three Hera lives.
Sharon What?
Three Your daughter Hera is alive. Your new friends tell you that?
Three They faked her death, and they hid her from you.
Sharon You could say anything…
Three Oh, I had dreams. I had strange dreams. I was having strange dreams that made me question my faith. Made me question God. And in the dreams, there was a human oracle, so I went to see Dodona Selloi.
Sharon Im not gonna kill you, but Im gonna wound you so you cant warn the others.
Three The oracle said that the fruit borne of two peoples is still alive. That Hera lives and I would hold her in my arms and I will know true love.  Put down the gun, and when I find her you can hold her too.
Sharon_leaving Adama wouldnt lie to me.
Three_screaming_after_her Youre wrong. Youre wrong!
Sharon Launch keys dont seem to have been damaged. From all the data points, it looks like the ships all still have enough tylium to make at least one jump. Congratulations, by the way. I heard its a boy.
Chief Oh.
Sharon Whats his name?
Chief Uh... Nicolas, after Callys grandfather.
Sharon Hey, Chief? You remember when you helped Helo spread Heras ashes?
Chief Mm-hmm.
Sharon You actually saw the ashes?
Chief Yeah, of course. Why?
Sharon Nothing. Just make sure Cally never lets her kid out of her sight.
Helo Sir? Listening Raptor just jumped back. Sharons got the launch keys.
Racetrack Rec room, Racetrack. …Very well, sir.
Adama_over_PA This is the Admiral. Youve heard the news. You know the mission. You should also know theres only one way that this mission ends. And thats with the successful rescue of our people on New Caprica. Look around you. Take a good look at the men and women that stand next to you. Remember their faces. For one day you will tell your children and your grandchildren that you served with such men and women as the universe has never seen. And together you accomplished a feat that will be told and retold down through the ages, and find immortality as only the Gods once knew. Im proud to serve with you. Good hunting.
Adama Begin jump prep.
Helo Action stations. Set condition one throughout the ship. Standby for a combat jump.
