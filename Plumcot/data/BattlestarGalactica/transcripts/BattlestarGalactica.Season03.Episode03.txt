ellen_tigh Can I help you? Here we go.
colonel_saul_tigh Thanks.
ellen_tigh Sorry.
colonel_saul_tigh Thats all right. It doesnt hurt. I appreciate you doing this. I cant seem to get it right in the mirror.
ellen_tigh Saul. Um, I want you to know that I would do anything for you…
chief_galen_tyrol The list. Callys on the list. Theyre gonna kill her.
colonel_saul_tigh What list?
chief_galen_tyrol Theyre gonna kill her.
colonel_saul_tigh What are you talking about?
chief_galen_tyrol I got this. I got this from the dead drop, from the source in the administration. Its a death list and Callys name is on it.
chief_galen_tyrol Theyre rounding up people in the city. Callys already in the detention, they could take her out at any minute, and then just--
colonel_saul_tigh They got this organized by transport vehicles. Callys in the group heading for map coordinate x-ray seven.
chief_galen_tyrol I know, but where the frak is that? I mean, how are we gonna --
colonel_saul_tigh Calm down, dammit. You gotta start thinking clearly here, Chief, or shes dead. Now weve already figured out their map coordinate system. Its referred to in the list of Cylon freqs you got from the last dead drop.
chief_galen_tyrol Holy frak! Youre right. I can extrapolate the coordinate system --
colonel_saul_tigh Callys group has to pick up a bunch of people in town first. Thatll take time. Take four men and get out there ahead of the trucks.
colonel_saul_tigh Chief! Pull it together. You wont do her any good if you get caught too. Besides, the last thing your son wants is me and Ellen for parents. Find that list, Chief.
chief_galen_tyrol Where the frak is it? Dammit! Dammit! Wheres that frackin list? Its gotta be here. Its gotta be here. Frak! Come on! Here it is. Okay. X-ray seven. 1, 4, 3...
ensign_diana_seelix Hey, Chief. Good day for a walk, huh?
chief_galen_tyrol Get your men together. Were going to Pergamus Flats.
lt_sharon_valerii Talk to me, Gunny.
Marine#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode03 Dont like it, LT. Too much cover along this trail. We could catch enfilade fire from there...there... and along there.
lt_sharon_valerii Lets move out. Im going to the rendezvous point. Place your men on the ridge for cover.
lt_sharon_valerii Go Panthers!
samuel_anders C-Bucks rule!
lt_sharon_valerii Hey, Sam. Its been a while.
samuel_anders Funny, I feel like I see you every day. Come on.
chief_galen_tyrol Trucks. Move down to the ridge. Move down to the ridge. Crispin, you here. Chief: This is it. Lock and load.
chief_galen_tyrol All right. What do we see? Oh, frak me.
ensign_diana_seelix What?
chief_galen_tyrol They got Laura Roslin and Tom Zarek with them.
ensign_diana_seelix Is there any sign of Cally?
chief_galen_tyrol Not yet.
lt_sharon_valerii So Galacticas got a rescue plan in place and ready to go. My jobs to get the launch keys for the civilian ships still on the ground, then coordinate the rescue mission with your evacuation plan. When can we meet with Colonel Tigh?
samuel_anders Were gonna wait until nightfall before we head back into the city.
chief_galen_tyrol There she is. There she is. Oh, my Gods. There she is. What the fraks she doing? Shes making a run for it.
ensign_diana_seelix The bulletheads are lining up.
chief_galen_tyrol Its a firing squad. Sight in on the Centurions... right now!
ensign_diana_seelix Callys right in our line of fire. If we shoot, were gonna hit her.
chief_galen_tyrol Count to five. Open fire.
Man#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode03 Two skinjobs. Should we take em down?
ensign_diana_seelix Where there are skinjobs, there are bulletheads. Bring up the RPG.
samuel_anders Theres a system of tunnels we been using that run parallel and under --
lt_sharon_valerii Shh! Do you hear that?
ensign_diana_seelix Thousand one... thousand two... thousand three... thousand four... thousand five.
samuel_anders Frak this. We gotta get out of here.
lt_sharon_valerii Stay put. Trust me. …Now!
samuel_anders Thanks.
chief_galen_tyrol Shh, shh, shh. I got you. I got you.
Marine#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode03 They were waiting for us, LT. Right where we thought.
Insurgent_with_Anderss_map#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode03 Sir, you better take a look at this. I found it on a dead skinjob. Its your handwriting, isnt it?
samuel_anders Yeah. Damn right it is. We were sold out. Ellen.
president_laura_roslin You all right, Tom?
tom_zarek Yeah. Been a while since I had a woman throw me to the ground. Not quite as much fun as I remember.
ensign_diana_seelix Hurts, huh? Good. Then I hope it hurts a long, long time till you go to download city.
chief_galen_tyrol You all right down there?
president_laura_roslin Oh, my Gods. Its good to see you, Chief.
chief_galen_tyrol Good to see you too, maam.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson What happens now? Where do we go from here?
chief_galen_tyrol Were going home. Were going home. Admiral Adamas on his way. Were getting off this rock. Were going back to Galactica.
number_six Dont worry about it, Gaius. Its all right. It doesnt matter to me really…
dr_gaius_baltar You can stop that right now, okay? My egos not so fragile as all that. These things happen. Or they dont happen. So what should we talk about? Should we talk about your day? How was your day, darling? How was your day at the office? My office. Any news? No? Well, let me tell you about my day, because it was a hoot. I had the most fascinating chat with one of the Dorals. Hes got this theory about sanitation being the key to regaining human trust and confidence. Something about toilet paper. No, lack of toilet paper, thats it. If people could only wipe their bums properly, thered be a measurable uptick in the polls.
number_six Four months of this, Gaius. Four months of watching you slip further and further down into this well of self-hatred and -loathing. Do you know what Ive given up for you? Do you?
dr_gaius_baltar Do you know, what with the occupation and everything, I cant really say Ive given it that much thought recently.
dr_gaius_baltar Dont go. Please.
captain_kara_thrace That doesnt look so bad. Theres something that I wanted to say to you. Im sorry that I left you alone. I didnt mean for you to get hurt. I was upset with myself. And not you, okay? Uh... grown-ups do stupid things sometimes. We get … caught up in our own little world until its almost too late. You have no idea what Im saying to you, do you? Okay. Time to take a nap.
oracle_selloi Dont be afraid. I know who you are. What you are. Poor thing. You must be terrified. Do you have any candy?
danna_biers Candy? No.
oracle_selloi Chamallas so bitter. Zeus sees all. Sees you, number Three. Sees your pain. Your destiny. All the Gods weep for you.
danna_biers There is no Zeus. No other God but God.
oracle_selloi Well, you dont believe that anymore. You dont know what you believe and that is why youre here.
danna_biers Its not true. I dont even know why Im here. This is the stupidest thing I ever did.
oracle_selloi It is your dream that brings you to me.
danna_biers How do you know about that?
oracle_selloi I have a message for you from the one you worship. He speaks through me to you just as he speaks in your dreams. The message is... the fruit born of two peoples is alive. A child named after the wife and sister of the all-knowing Zeus. Hera lives.
danna_biers Thats not true. The child is dead.
oracle_selloi You will hold her in your arms, and youll know for the first time what it is to feel true love. But youll lose everything youve done here. Wish I had some chocolate caramels.
captain_karl_agathon Lets move! We got some people waiting for their ride down there. Will you quit looking at me like that?
officer_anastasia_dualla Like what?
captain_karl_agathon You know like what. Like were never gonna see each other again. We will. Its a good plan, D.
officer_anastasia_dualla Take care of the Admiral?
captain_karl_agathon Take care of his son.
captain_karl_agathon All right, people, you know how this works: Pegasus crew on the port side of the line, Galactica on the right.
Officer_reading_from_the_Scrolls#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode03 Their enemies will divide them. Their colonies broken in the fiery chasm of space. Their shining days renounced by a multitude of dark sacrifices. Yet still they will remain always together.
All#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode03 always together.
admiral_william_adama thats the third time youve taken a look at your watch. Got dinner plans?
cpt_lee_adama No, I was just thinking. Sharons probably on the ground by now.
admiral_william_adama I know. These are your orders. Youll find the rendezvous point there. Take the civilian fleet. And wait for me for 18 hours. If Im not back in 18 hours, then find Earth.
cpt_lee_adama Yeah, right.
admiral_william_adama Ill see you at the rendezvous point.
cpt_lee_adama 18 hours. Try not to be late.
admiral_william_adama Im getting old. Im a little slow. But Ill be there.
cpt_lee_adama Gods, I wish I could talk you out of this.
admiral_william_adama You cant. You tried.
cpt_lee_adama You know Dad, um --
admiral_william_adama Dont. Dont make me cry in my own hangar deck.
cpt_lee_adama Okay.
admiral_william_adama Ill see you there.
cpt_lee_adama Permission to leave your ship, Admiral.
admiral_william_adama Permission granted, Commander.
cpt_lee_adama Attention! Commander Pegasus departing. 18 hours.
danna_biers Hey. Hey! Hey, Jake. Hey, Jake. Yeah, you dont care who I am, do ya? All Gods creatures in your eyes. Here ya go.
dr_cottle Cant sleep?
danna_biers Bad dreams.
dr_cottle Didnt know you people had dreams.
danna_biers Oh, sure. Everybody dreams, Doc. That human or Cylon blood?
dr_cottle Cylon. one of the Fives got pretty shot up today by the insurgents. But hes gonna make it.
danna_biers You couldve let him suffer.
dr_cottle Thats not what I do.
danna_biers What about the baby? Sharons baby Hera. When that child died on Galactica, whyd you cremate the body? Its the first Cylon-human hybrid, and you threw it in the incinerator?
dr_cottle It wasnt my decision. That was the Presidents call. I was just following orders.
danna_biers Thats a very funny thing. Cause this stuff all looks the same.
john_cavil She said, I hope it hurts you for a long, long time before you go to download city. Then they just left me there. They left me in the hot sun with a bullet in my guts.
aaron_doral what a noble race you are.
Boomer#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode03 How long were you there before you died?
john_cavil Hours. Eventually, I managed to drag myself over to some spent shell casings. I used one of those to scratch open my carotid artery. Skin is a lot tougher than you think. Now thats...three for me. Three downloads. The first one, I just got a headache. But I could handle it. Now its worse and worse. This time it was like a frakkin white hot poker through my skull. Not worth it. None of this is worth it.
dr_gaius_baltar Hes right, you know. Its not worth it. Which is what I believe Ive been telling you all along.
aaron_doral Caprica, can you please control him?
dr_gaius_baltar Why dont you just shoot me... if thatll remedy the situation?
aaron_doral We need to crack down harder.
number_six How? Our resources are stretched to the max already.
john_cavil I dont need to listen to this anymore.
danna_biers Consensus used to be so easy. Now look what theyve done to us.
aaron_doral Dont lose hope. Worst comes to worst, we can always nuke the city and be done with it.
samuel_anders Better leave those dog tags here. They spot em, theyll know who you are.
lt_sharon_valerii No, you have no idea how hard I worked for these.
samuel_anders So our best guess puts the launch keys somewhere in the detention center. Just keep to the main streets. Everybodyll think youre just a regular skinjob and theyll avoid you. But theres a lot of people out there looking to gut an unwary Cylon going for a stroll, so dont let anybody get close enough to stick a knife in you.
lt_sharon_valerii All right. Thanks for the concern. It makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.
samuel_anders How are you gonna find those launch keys?
lt_sharon_valerii When I get inside and hook into the data stream, itll feed me the location. Now, once I get the keys, you need to distribute them to the pilots who can fly those ships out of here.
samuel_anders Were already on it. We got pilots standing by.
Insurgents#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode03 Commanders!
samuel_anders Yeah, come in.
ellen_tigh My Gods! Whats she doing here?
samuel_anders Get her down below and keep her there until after the next briefing.
ellen_tigh Wait a minute! No, no. Wait, listen to me. Please. I can explain.
samuel_anders I suggest you keep your mouth shut.
ellen_tigh Where is my husband? I want to speak to my husband.
samuel_anders Lets go, get her down.
lt_sharon_valerii Okay, Im outta here.
samuel_anders Wait. Sharon.
lt_sharon_valerii Yeah.
samuel_anders Do me a favor. Just keep an eye out for Starbuck. I dont know if shes alive or if shes dead. But its been four months.
lt_sharon_valerii Ill do what I can.
samuel_anders Yeah.
Laura#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode03 You must keep the child hidden at all costs.
samuel_anders We keep her on the move along with other high-value targets. Shell never stay in any one location longer than two or three days.
Laura#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode03 Sam, I need you to really hear me on this. Really. There is no one -- no one -- of higher value than Maya and her child. We cannot let them fall into Cylon hands.
samuel_anders I get it. How far do you want me to go? I mean, if it looks like the Cylons are gonna capture them --
Laura#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode03 No. Dont let it get to that point. Thats all.
samuel_anders I dont suppose youre gonna tell me what this is all about. I mean, whats so important about this kid?
Laura#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode03 She may very well be the shape of things to come. Thats either a blessing or a curse.
chief_galen_tyrol Weve stored arms and munitions in key areas throughout the city.
sgt_erin_mathias I can supplement that with mortars, RPGs, even a few shoulder-mounted anti-aircraft missiles aboard the Raptor.
chief_galen_tyrol Great. When we give the signal, our people are gonna attack the airbase, the detention center, the power station, other critical facilities. The plan is to sow as much chaos and confusion as possible the moment Galactica and Pegasus arrive. That should help cover the evacuation.
sgt_erin_mathias No Pegasus. Just Galactica.
president_laura_roslin Why? Why no Pegasus? What happened?
sgt_erin_mathias Dont know, sir. Way beyond my pay grade. What about your evac plans?
tory_foster Weve designated and assigned 500 block captains to cover each sector of the city. Each block captain is responsible for rallying and guiding the people in his or her sector along their escape route to their designated ship.
tom_zarek Dont suppose youve been able to rehearse any of this.
president_laura_roslin Indeed. Weve had three full-dress rehearsals under the guise of fire and natural disaster drills.
sgt_erin_mathias Be different when the balloon goes up. Explosions, shooting, chaos. Theres gonna be some panic out there.
president_laura_roslin theyll do fine. These people know that at some point, theyre gonna be responsible for saving themselves. All we need to do is be ready and hope for the best. What about Maya and Isis?
samuel_anders Im on it. Ive got my two best shooters here. Theyre gonna be their escorts and make sure they get back to the ship.
president_laura_roslin Gentlemen, I cant tell you why, but it is imperative that this woman and her child get off this planet. I trust you because I trust him.
ellen_tigh Saul!
samuel_anders We need to talk.
Woman#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode03 Toaster!
samuel_anders She sold us out.
colonel_saul_tigh What are you talking about?
samuel_anders We were ambushed at the rendezvous. The Cylons knew exactly where we were gonna be.
colonel_saul_tigh That doesnt mean Ellen had anything--
samuel_anders This is the map, Colonel! The map that I drew for you. I gave this to you in your tent. You were gonna burn it, but then your wife offered to do it for you. I got it off a dead skinjob at the ambush. Do the math!
ellen_tigh I want to explain, Saul.
Insurgent#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode03 Godsdamn traitor!
colonel_saul_tigh Shut your frakkin mouth!
ellen_tigh He said -- he said hed kill you.
colonel_saul_tigh Who said it?
ellen_tigh one of the Brother Cavils. I did it for you...Saul. It was all for you, I had to. I didnt have any choice. Dont you see that?
lt_sharon_valerii Drawer 3-7-8.
danna_biers What are you doing? Oh, my God, its you. Youre betraying your own people. For what?
lt_sharon_valerii Im a Colonial officer now.
danna_biers Youre not one of them.
lt_sharon_valerii I gave them my word.
danna_biers Thats not what counts. Its who you give it to.
lt_sharon_valerii Im gonna have to shoot you now.
danna_biers Hera lives.
lt_sharon_valerii What?
danna_biers Your daughter Hera is alive. Your new friends tell you that?
danna_biers They faked her death, and they hid her from you.
lt_sharon_valerii You could say anything…
danna_biers Oh, I had dreams. I had strange dreams. I was having strange dreams that made me question my faith. Made me question God. And in the dreams, there was a human oracle, so I went to see Dodona Selloi.
lt_sharon_valerii Im not gonna kill you, but Im gonna wound you so you cant warn the others.
danna_biers The oracle said that the fruit borne of two peoples is still alive. That Hera lives and I would hold her in my arms and I will know true love. Put down the gun, and when I find her you can hold her too.
lt_sharon_valerii Adama wouldnt lie to me.
danna_biers Youre wrong. Youre wrong!
lt_sharon_valerii Launch keys dont seem to have been damaged. From all the data points, it looks like the ships all still have enough tylium to make at least one jump. Congratulations, by the way. I heard its a boy.
chief_galen_tyrol Oh.
lt_sharon_valerii Whats his name?
chief_galen_tyrol Uh... Nicolas, after Callys grandfather.
lt_sharon_valerii Hey, Chief? You remember when you helped Helo spread Heras ashes?
chief_galen_tyrol Mm-hmm.
lt_sharon_valerii You actually saw the ashes?
chief_galen_tyrol Yeah, of course. Why?
lt_sharon_valerii Nothing. Just make sure Cally never lets her kid out of her sight.
captain_karl_agathon Sir? Listening Raptor just jumped back. Sharons got the launch keys.
racetrack Rec room, Racetrack. …Very well, sir.
admiral_william_adama This is the Admiral. Youve heard the news. You know the mission. You should also know theres only one way that this mission ends. And thats with the successful rescue of our people on New Caprica. Look around you. Take a good look at the men and women that stand next to you. Remember their faces. For one day you will tell your children and your grandchildren that you served with such men and women as the universe has never seen. And together you accomplished a feat that will be told and retold down through the ages, and find immortality as only the Gods once knew. Im proud to serve with you. Good hunting.
admiral_william_adama Begin jump prep.
captain_karl_agathon Action stations. Set condition one throughout the ship. Standby for a combat jump.
