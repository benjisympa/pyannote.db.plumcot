Adama Previously on Battlestar Galactica ...
Selloi I have a message for you. The fruit born of two peoples is alive. A child named after the wife and sister of the all-knowing Zeus. Hera lives.
Three Its not true.
Anders I dont suppose youre gonna tell me what this is all about. I mean, whats so important about this kid.
Roslin She may very well be the shape of things to come.
Anders The Cylons knew exactly where we were gonna be.
Tigh That doesnt mean Ellen...
Ellen I didnt do anything!
Anders This is the map, Colonel. The map that I drew for you. I gave this to you in your tent. You were gonna burn it, but then your wife offered to do it for you. But she didnt, did she?
Ellen I -- I want to explain. He said hed kill you.
Tigh Who said?
Ellen One of the Brother Cavils.
Leoben This is Kacey. Kacey, this is Kara.... your mother.
Chief Our people are gonna attack the air base, detention center, power station other critical facilities. The plan is sow as much chaos and confusion as possible the moment Galactica and Pegasus arrives.
Marine No Pegasus. Just Galactica.
Adama These are your orders. Take the civilian Fleet and wait for me for 18 hours. If Im not back in 18 hours, then find Earth.
Adama You know the mission. You should also know theres only one way and thats with the successful rescue of our people off of New Caprica. Good hunting.
Dualla Hoshis working on updating our map coordinates for the search for Earth. Civilian captains want to meet with you. They have questions, problems... Talk to me, Lee.
Apollo Im having trouble... accepting this.
Dualla I know. But we have to push forward. Keep the Fleet together. Find Earth.
Apollo Right. Thats our duty.
Dualla Theres still a chance theyll come back. Your father has pulled off more than a few miracles in his day.
Apollo I know that. And I havent given up hope.
Dualla Yes, you have. I saw the look on your face when you came back from the Galactica. Like you were never gonna see him again.
Apollo Am I that easy to read?
Dualla Just to me.
Apollo Hes taking on too much for one half-strength Battlestar to handle. And thats not opinion. Thats military fact. Hes not coming back from this. None of them are.
Dualla All we can do is make plans for the future. We have to survive. We have to find Earth. If we dont, theyll be no one to remember a man named William Adama. Or a Battlestar named Galactica. That is our charge to keep.
Apollo To keep humanity going. No matter what the cost. No matter -- No matter who we leave behind.
Dualla You can do this. You can get us there. You are Commander of this Fleet, and you will guide us to safety. And you will do it no matter the cost. Because youre an Adama.
Apollo Did I ever tell you how proud I am to serve with you?
Dualla Not in so many words, no.
Apollo Well, I am proud to serve with you, Lieutenant. And to call you my wife. Now lets talk about... map coordinates, meeting with ships captains.
Anders I lost three men today. And if that Marine Sergeant wasnt on her game, theyd have killed us all.
Tigh I know, Godsdamn it. I know. You dont have to keep running your mouth about it. I get it, all right?
Anders You get this. If Sharon had been killed, not only would we not get the launch keys, but the Cylons would know that we were in direct contact with Galactica. Now this whole plan, the fate of this whole city, would have fallen apart. Do you understand that, Colonel?
Tigh I get it.
Anders Good. Hey... you know what has to be done here. If you dont want to do it, I understand. But believe me, Colonel, someone is gonna do this. Now, it would be better for her sake if it was you.
Ellen_seated_with_Tigh I had to do it, Saul. I had to. It was all for you. And I want you to know that I wouldve done anything to save you.
Tigh I know, I know. Its all right. Everythings gonna be all right.
Ellen No, you dont understand. I got you out of detention, Saul. It was me. I got you out. I went to see them, the Cylons. Finally got to the one in charge. And I got him to notice me ... the way men notice me. I slept with him. And I felt like puking every time he put his filthy hands on me. But I smiled and I faked it to save you, Saul. But you listen to me. Id do it again. Frak anybody. Do anything. Even gave em the map. I didnt want anybody... to be killed.
Ellen I could use the drink. Youve always been there for me when I needed you. Oh, Im exhausted. I feel like I could just curl up here. Shouldve listened to you Saul. Shouldve stayed on Galactica.
Tigh Oh, dont worry about any of that now. You just... you just go to sleep.
Ellen Im sleepy.
Tigh_sobbing I love you, Ellen. Do you hear me?
Baltar I mean, I told you and I told you. But to what end? Too secure in your smug superiority to listen. Too comfortable in your predictions of success to even consider the possibility of defeat. And where are we now? And more to the point, wheres Laura Roslin? Wheres Tom Zarek? At large. Whereabouts unknown. Free at any rate. Probably with Colonel Tigh. Solidifying the insurgencys hold over the publics imagination.
Three What would you have us do, Gaius?
Baltar Leave. Pack up your Centurions and go. Please, go.
Three And then what? What would you do if we really just left you here? Youd live out your lives in peace and never trouble yourselves with thoughts of us again? Or would you raise your children with stories of the Cylon? The mechanical slaves who once did your bidding only to turn against you. Killers who committed genocide against your race. And occupiers of this city until we just ran away. Would you tell them to tell the story to their children? And to their childrens children? And nurse a dream of vengeance down through the years so that one day they could just go out into the stars and hunt the Cylon once more.
Baltar Blood for blood. It has to stop one day.
Gaeta_sees_the_bombs_and_fires_all_over_New_Caprica Oh, my Gods.
Tory_to_the_block_captains Nice job, Anders. Come on. Come on. Come on, come on. Okay, thats our cue. You know what to do. Rally your people get them to the evac points. Okay, remember the drills, and youll do fine. Go with the Gods. Go, go, go!
Maya Tory, would you tell Laura I cant thank her enough --
Tory tell her yourself when this is all over. Wish we were all as calm as she is. Get them to their ship. Go, go! Lets move, lets move, lets move!
Anders All right, this is it. We hit the detention center, and we do not stop until everybody is out of there free. Everybody knows their entry points. Lets load up and we move right now. Lets move, Connor. Come on, lets go. Lets go, lets go.
Kelly Decoy squadron approaching launch point.
Kat Okay, this is it, guys. Stand by. All vipers break...now, now, now!
Raptor_Pilot Deploy drones on my mark.
Kelly Drone signatures match. Cylons should pick up the drones on dradis and read them as two Battlestars any minute.
Gaeta_on_phone What? No, no, no. Immediate evac from sector v as in-- v as in victor.
Caprica Hey.
Baltar For nothing. All for nothing.
Caprica Well start over, Gaius. A new city to rise out of the ashes.
Baltar Itll be buried. Buried like the cities of old. Consumed by the wrath of God.
Boomer_entering Two Battlestars just jumped into orbit. Adamas back.
Racetrack Kat, Racetrack. Two baseships on dradis bearing 002 carom 015. Theyre launching Raiders.
Kat Red Squadron, Kat. Weve done our part. Kick in the turbos. Lets get the hell out of here.
Starbuck whats going on?
Leoben Insurgents. Ill be back.
Starbuck You cannot leave us trapped in here.
Leoben Its safest for you here.
Starbuck_jumping_on_his_back No!
Man Lets go, lets go. Move, move!
Woman Run!
Roslin Tom, you go that way. Head to the shipyard.
Zarek Youre coming, right?
Roslin_pointing_at_Colonial_One My ships up there.
Zarek You do have a sense of the dramatic.
Zarek Hey, wait, Laura. Wait, wait. Hey, you. You were on Galactica, right?
Jammer Yeah, I didnt do anything.
Zarek No, its okay. Keep an eye on her, all right? Dont let her out of your sight, go!
Roslin See you up there.
Zarek See you up there.
Kelly Jump preparation complete. My board is green. Ready to jump, sir.
Helo Stand by to launch blue squadron.
Adama this is the Admiral. All hands, brace for turbulence.
Three Baseships just closed on the Battlestar targets. Theres no Galactica, no Pegasus. Drones. Decoys. The whole things a trick.
Simon Wheres Galactica?
Man Theyve got us pinned down. Were trapped.
Kelly Altitude 99,000, falling like a rock.
Helo Launch! Launch them all!
Adama Stand by FTL.
Hotdog Well, this ought to be different.
Kelly Theyre clear.
Helo Stand by.
Adama Jump!
Chief Vipers! Everybody hold, hold!
Redwing Hotdog, Redwing. I see friendlies pinned down outside the shipyard gate.
Hotdog Roger. Redwing, target the guard tower. Ive got the gate. Rolling in hot.
Chief Incoming! Incoming! Fast mover coming! Everybody down, down, down! Thats it! Lets get to the ships! Lets go! Lets go! Lets go! Lets go! Godsdamn it. Come on, move! Move, move! Lets go! Move, people, come on! Lets go, lets go, lets go!
Insurgents Fire in the hole! Fire in the hole! All right, everybody, lets move! Head north to the shipyard. Move, move! Hustle!
Anders Kara? Oh, Gods, no. No. Oh! Im gonna get you out of here. Im gonna get you out of here.
Helo All divisions make damage report to combat. Main batteries report weapons status.
Adama Dradis.
Kelly Back online. Cylon baseships coming out of the nebula.
Helo Just as we expected. Cylon raiders are still scattered to hell and gone. Theyre coming after us without fighter cover. If we can draw the two basestars away from the planet, the colonists might be able to escape.
Kelly Hang on. Two more baseships just jumped into orbit. Weve got four baseships out there, Admiral.
Adama No. We cant hold off four.
Adama Pass up the cord. Pass it up. Connect up the other side right away.
Helo Weve lost maneuvering thrusters. We cant take any more hits to port or were looking at explosive decompressions in sections 36 through 48.
Adama Jump drives?
Adama Unh! Damn. Then thats it. Its been an honor.
Apollo Galactica, Pegasus. Let us take some of this work off your hands. Get your FTL up and ready, and well take care of the rest. All right, fire up that main battery!
Adama Damn you, Lee. Keep working on those FTLs. Get em online.
Helo yes, sir.
Adama The Cylons will re-deploy as soon as they recover. Thank you, Lee.
Dualla theyre coming about. Maneuvering to bracket us.
Apollo Steady as she goes. Take us right into the center.
Dualla Wont last long in there.
Apollo No.
Anders Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Shh, shh, shh! Kara, kara, shh!
Starbuck Is it really you?
Anders Baby, its really me. But listen, we dont have time. Were going to the ships, and were gonna get the hell off this frakkin planet.
Starbuck Okay. Wheres Kacey?
Anders Whos Kacey?
Starbuck Kacey, shes my daughter.
Anders Kara, whos Kacey?
Starbuck Shes my daughter!
Anders Kara! Kara, no! Godsdamn it, Kara, no! Out of the way! Godsdamn it, Kara, no!
Simon Weve lost control of the situation on the surface. Theres a Heavy Raider standing by ready to evacuate us.
Three Were agreed. Evacuate the entire facility. Ill stay behind and set off the nuke. You should go as well, Caprica. And you. I dont think youll want to be here after weve gone. Theres a place for you, too.
Baltar For me?
Three Well, you were right and we were wrong. Should be some reward for that.
Caprica Gaius, we should go.
Baltar I just wanna sit here and die.
Gaeta Youre gonna get your wish, Gaius.
Kelly civvie ships are getting off the ground. Jumping away. Only a few left. FTLs back online. Pegasus is taking a hell of a pounding, sir. I dont think she has a single plane in the air.
Adama Lee left all of his planes to guard the civilian ships. He knew that was a one-way trip. Hell evac before the end.
Helo You sure?
Adama Land our birds! Lets get the hell out of here.
Helo All wings, Galactica. Come on home. Combat landings authorized. Repeat, come on home.
Adama All hands, all hands, get ready to jump.
Gaeta I believed in you.
Caprica Whoa, whoa. Gaeta.
Gaeta I believed in the dream of New Caprica.
Caprica Gaeta, we all did.
Gaeta No! No. Not him. He believed in the dream of Gaius Baltar. The good life. Booze, pills, hot and cold running interns. He lead us to the apocalypse, and-- and I--I turned out to be--
Baltar An idealist. Theres no sin in that. Everything you say about me is true. Every word. But you have to listen to me. The Cylons have a nuke in this complex. Nobody... and I mean nobody is getting off this planet alive unless I stop Danna.
Caprica Gaius, shell kill you.
Baltar Then shell kill me. Or itll be down to Mr. Gaeta. Either way, the human race dies with me.
Six Gaius, he --
Baltar Go ahead, shoot. What are you waiting for? Do it. Please. Please. Im begging you to please --
Gaeta You have one chance to put things right. Do you understand me? Get the frak out of here! Stop that nuke! Go!
Caprica_dragging_him_out Gaius, lets go.
Apollo Set main batteries to autofire cycle-B. Lock engines ahead flank. This is the Commander. Abandon ship, abandon ship. All hands, abandon ship. Report to evac raptors and jump to rendezvous point. Good work, and Ill see you on the other side.
Dualla Okay, all right, people, lets move! Out! Lets go! You too, Commander.
Apollo Yes, sir. Thank you.
Starbuck Kacey! Kacey! Kacey, honey, where are you? Kacey --
Leoben_appearing_with_Kacey I knew youd be back. I saw it.
Starbuck Give me Kacey.
Leoben Say the words.
Starbuck Let me take her.
Leoben Say them.
Starbuck What words?
Leoben You know what I want. I want to hear you say them. And I want the rest of it. Just like I told you.
Starbuck Fine. I love you.
Leoben_leaning_in Say it again.
Starbuck I love you.
Leoben Now the rest.
Starbuck Was it everything you thought it would be?
Leoben That and more. Ill never forget this moment.
Starbuck_kissing_him_again Neither will I.
Starbuck Ill explain later. Lets move.
Baltar are you sure shes in there?
Caprica Positive. I saw her go in.
Three_searching_for_Hera Frakking liar.
Chip_Six_seeing_Hera_in_Mayas_arms Its her, Gaius. The first of Gods new generation.
Baltar Hera. Shh.
Caprica Its a miracle. God spared her.
Three_approaches Hera. Can I hold her?
Caprica No. Shes not going to set off the nuke, not anymore. Come on, Gaius. We have to go.
Roslin_sweetly All right. Im ready to go.
Chief All right, people, lets go. This way. Stay on the starboard hangar deck till we can get you to new ships. Come on, people, all the way down. All the way down, people, all the way down. Lets go.
Chief_seeing_Starbuck_with_Kacey Oh, my Gods. Captain! I thought you were dead.
Starbuck Yeah, so did I.
Chief Hey. Whos this?
Anders Yeah, I was gonna ask that myself.
Starbuck This is --
Woman Kacey? Kacey! Oh, my little girl! Oh, Mommy missed you so much! Thank you. Thank you! Thank you. When the Cylons took her I -- I thought -- but you saved her. Gods bless you.
Adama Hey. Welcome aboard. Welcome aboard.
Adama_to_Apollo I guess you didnt understand my orders, huh?
Apollo Never could read your handwriting.
Tigh permission to come aboard, sir.
Adama Hey.
Tigh_getting_down_off_the_Raptor_wing Ahh.
Adama Permission granted. You did it. You brought em home, Saul.
Tigh Not all of them.
Adama Im sorry.
Tory Were still double-checking the Fleets manifests, but, uh ... it doesnt look like Maya made it off of New Caprica.
Roslin What about the baby?
Tory_voice_breaking I was there when the two guards left to take them to their ship. I dont know what happened. Im so sorry. I let you down. And I know that.
Roslin No, you didnt. Its not your fault. This is bigger than us. This is life.
