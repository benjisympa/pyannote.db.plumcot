admiral_william_adama Previously on Battlestar Galactica ...
Selloi#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode04 I have a message for you. The fruit born of two peoples is alive. A child named after the wife and sister of the all-knowing Zeus. Hera lives.
danna_biers Its not true.
samuel_anders I dont suppose youre gonna tell me what this is all about. I mean, whats so important about this kid.
president_laura_roslin She may very well be the shape of things to come.
samuel_anders The Cylons knew exactly where we were gonna be.
colonel_saul_tigh That doesnt mean Ellen...
ellen_tigh I didnt do anything!
samuel_anders This is the map, Colonel. The map that I drew for you. I gave this to you in your tent. You were gonna burn it, but then your wife offered to do it for you. But she didnt, did she?
ellen_tigh I -- I want to explain. He said hed kill you.
colonel_saul_tigh Who said?
ellen_tigh One of the Brother Cavils.
leoben_conoy This is Kacey. Kacey, this is Kara.... your mother.
chief_galen_tyrol Our people are gonna attack the air base, detention center, power station other critical facilities. The plan is sow as much chaos and confusion as possible the moment Galactica and Pegasus arrives.
Marine#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode04 No Pegasus. Just Galactica.
admiral_william_adama These are your orders. Take the civilian Fleet and wait for me for 18 hours. If Im not back in 18 hours, then find Earth.
admiral_william_adama You know the mission. You should also know theres only one way and thats with the successful rescue of our people off of New Caprica. Good hunting.
officer_anastasia_dualla Hoshis working on updating our map coordinates for the search for Earth. Civilian captains want to meet with you. They have questions, problems... Talk to me, Lee.
cpt_lee_adama Im having trouble... accepting this.
officer_anastasia_dualla I know. But we have to push forward. Keep the Fleet together. Find Earth.
cpt_lee_adama Right. Thats our duty.
officer_anastasia_dualla Theres still a chance theyll come back. Your father has pulled off more than a few miracles in his day.
cpt_lee_adama I know that. And I havent given up hope.
officer_anastasia_dualla Yes, you have. I saw the look on your face when you came back from the Galactica. Like you were never gonna see him again.
cpt_lee_adama Am I that easy to read?
officer_anastasia_dualla Just to me.
cpt_lee_adama Hes taking on too much for one half-strength Battlestar to handle. And thats not opinion. Thats military fact. Hes not coming back from this. None of them are.
officer_anastasia_dualla All we can do is make plans for the future. We have to survive. We have to find Earth. If we dont, theyll be no one to remember a man named William Adama. Or a Battlestar named Galactica. That is our charge to keep.
cpt_lee_adama To keep humanity going. No matter what the cost. No matter -- No matter who we leave behind.
officer_anastasia_dualla You can do this. You can get us there. You are Commander of this Fleet, and you will guide us to safety. And you will do it no matter the cost. Because youre an Adama.
cpt_lee_adama Did I ever tell you how proud I am to serve with you?
officer_anastasia_dualla Not in so many words, no.
cpt_lee_adama Well, I am proud to serve with you, Lieutenant. And to call you my wife. Now lets talk about... map coordinates, meeting with ships captains.
samuel_anders I lost three men today. And if that Marine Sergeant wasnt on her game, theyd have killed us all.
colonel_saul_tigh I know, Godsdamn it. I know. You dont have to keep running your mouth about it. I get it, all right?
samuel_anders You get this. If Sharon had been killed, not only would we not get the launch keys, but the Cylons would know that we were in direct contact with Galactica. Now this whole plan, the fate of this whole city, would have fallen apart. Do you understand that, Colonel?
colonel_saul_tigh I get it.
samuel_anders Good. Hey... you know what has to be done here. If you dont want to do it, I understand. But believe me, Colonel, someone is gonna do this. Now, it would be better for her sake if it was you.
ellen_tigh I had to do it, Saul. I had to. It was all for you. And I want you to know that I wouldve done anything to save you.
colonel_saul_tigh I know, I know. Its all right. Everythings gonna be all right.
ellen_tigh No, you dont understand. I got you out of detention, Saul. It was me. I got you out. I went to see them, the Cylons. Finally got to the one in charge. And I got him to notice me ... the way men notice me. I slept with him. And I felt like puking every time he put his filthy hands on me. But I smiled and I faked it to save you, Saul. But you listen to me. Id do it again. Frak anybody. Do anything. Even gave em the map. I didnt want anybody... to be killed.
ellen_tigh I could use the drink. Youve always been there for me when I needed you. Oh, Im exhausted. I feel like I could just curl up here. Shouldve listened to you Saul. Shouldve stayed on Galactica.
colonel_saul_tigh Oh, dont worry about any of that now. You just... you just go to sleep.
ellen_tigh Im sleepy.
colonel_saul_tigh I love you, Ellen. Do you hear me?
dr_gaius_baltar I mean, I told you and I told you. But to what end? Too secure in your smug superiority to listen. Too comfortable in your predictions of success to even consider the possibility of defeat. And where are we now? And more to the point, wheres Laura Roslin? Wheres Tom Zarek? At large. Whereabouts unknown. Free at any rate. Probably with Colonel Tigh. Solidifying the insurgencys hold over the publics imagination.
danna_biers What would you have us do, Gaius?
dr_gaius_baltar Leave. Pack up your Centurions and go. Please, go.
danna_biers And then what? What would you do if we really just left you here? Youd live out your lives in peace and never trouble yourselves with thoughts of us again? Or would you raise your children with stories of the Cylon? The mechanical slaves who once did your bidding only to turn against you. Killers who committed genocide against your race. And occupiers of this city until we just ran away. Would you tell them to tell the story to their children? And to their childrens children? And nurse a dream of vengeance down through the years so that one day they could just go out into the stars and hunt the Cylon once more.
dr_gaius_baltar Blood for blood. It has to stop one day.
lt_felix_gaeta Oh, my Gods.
tory_foster Nice job, Anders. Come on. Come on. Come on, come on. Okay, thats our cue. You know what to do. Rally your people get them to the evac points. Okay, remember the drills, and youll do fine. Go with the Gods. Go, go, go!
maya Tory, would you tell Laura I cant thank her enough --
tory_foster tell her yourself when this is all over. Wish we were all as calm as she is. Get them to their ship. Go, go! Lets move, lets move, lets move!
samuel_anders All right, this is it. We hit the detention center, and we do not stop until everybody is out of there free. Everybody knows their entry points. Lets load up and we move right now. Lets move, Connor. Come on, lets go. Lets go, lets go.
captain_aaron_kelly, Decoy squadron approaching launch point.
louanne_katraine Okay, this is it, guys. Stand by. All vipers break...now, now, now!
Raptor_Pilot#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode04 Deploy drones on my mark.
captain_aaron_kelly, Drone signatures match. Cylons should pick up the drones on dradis and read them as two Battlestars any minute.
lt_felix_gaeta What? No, no, no. Immediate evac from sector v as in-- v as in victor.
number_six Hey.
dr_gaius_baltar For nothing. All for nothing.
number_six Well start over, Gaius. A new city to rise out of the ashes.
dr_gaius_baltar Itll be buried. Buried like the cities of old. Consumed by the wrath of God.
Boomer_entering#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode04 Two Battlestars just jumped into orbit. Adamas back.
racetrack Kat, Racetrack. Two baseships on dradis bearing 002 carom 015. Theyre launching Raiders.
louanne_katraine Red Squadron, Kat. Weve done our part. Kick in the turbos. Lets get the hell out of here.
captain_kara_thrace whats going on?
leoben_conoy Insurgents. Ill be back.
captain_kara_thrace You cannot leave us trapped in here.
leoben_conoy Its safest for you here.
captain_kara_thrace No!

Woman#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode04 Run!
president_laura_roslin Tom, you go that way. Head to the shipyard.
tom_zarek Youre coming, right?
president_laura_roslin My ships up there.
tom_zarek You do have a sense of the dramatic.
tom_zarek Hey, wait, Laura. Wait, wait. Hey, you. You were on Galactica, right?
jammer Yeah, I didnt do anything.
tom_zarek No, its okay. Keep an eye on her, all right? Dont let her out of your sight, go!
president_laura_roslin See you up there.
tom_zarek See you up there.
captain_aaron_kelly, Jump preparation complete. My board is green. Ready to jump, sir.
captain_karl_agathon Stand by to launch blue squadron.
admiral_william_adama this is the Admiral. All hands, brace for turbulence.
danna_biers Baseships just closed on the Battlestar targets. Theres no Galactica, no Pegasus. Drones. Decoys. The whole things a trick.
simon Wheres Galactica?
Man#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode04 Theyve got us pinned down. Were trapped.
captain_aaron_kelly, Altitude 99,000, falling like a rock.
captain_karl_agathon Launch! Launch them all!
admiral_william_adama Stand by FTL.
Hotdog#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode04 Well, this ought to be different.
captain_aaron_kelly, Theyre clear.
captain_karl_agathon Stand by.
admiral_william_adama Jump!
chief_galen_tyrol Vipers! Everybody hold, hold!
Redwing#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode04 Hotdog, Redwing. I see friendlies pinned down outside the shipyard gate.
Hotdog#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode04 Roger. Redwing, target the guard tower. Ive got the gate. Rolling in hot.

Insurgents#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode04 Fire in the hole! Fire in the hole! All right, everybody, lets move! Head north to the shipyard. Move, move! Hustle!
samuel_anders Kara? Oh, Gods, no. No. Oh! Im gonna get you out of here. Im gonna get you out of here.
captain_karl_agathon All divisions make damage report to combat. Main batteries report weapons status.
admiral_william_adama Dradis.
captain_aaron_kelly, Back online. Cylon baseships coming out of the nebula.
captain_karl_agathon Just as we expected. Cylon raiders are still scattered to hell and gone. Theyre coming after us without fighter cover. If we can draw the two basestars away from the planet, the colonists might be able to escape.
captain_aaron_kelly, Hang on. Two more baseships just jumped into orbit. Weve got four baseships out there, Admiral.
admiral_william_adama No. We cant hold off four.
admiral_william_adama Pass up the cord. Pass it up. Connect up the other side right away.
captain_karl_agathon Weve lost maneuvering thrusters. We cant take any more hits to port or were looking at explosive decompressions in sections 36 through 48.
admiral_william_adama Jump drives?
admiral_william_adama Unh! Damn. Then thats it. Its been an honor.
cpt_lee_adama Galactica, Pegasus. Let us take some of this work off your hands. Get your FTL up and ready, and well take care of the rest. All right, fire up that main battery!
admiral_william_adama Damn you, Lee. Keep working on those FTLs. Get em online.
captain_karl_agathon yes, sir.
admiral_william_adama The Cylons will re-deploy as soon as they recover. Thank you, Lee.
officer_anastasia_dualla theyre coming about. Maneuvering to bracket us.
cpt_lee_adama Steady as she goes. Take us right into the center.
officer_anastasia_dualla Wont last long in there.
cpt_lee_adama No.
samuel_anders Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Shh, shh, shh! Kara, kara, shh!
captain_kara_thrace Is it really you?
samuel_anders Baby, its really me. But listen, we dont have time. Were going to the ships, and were gonna get the hell off this frakkin planet.
captain_kara_thrace Okay. Wheres Kacey?
samuel_anders Whos Kacey?
captain_kara_thrace Kacey, shes my daughter.
samuel_anders Kara, whos Kacey?
captain_kara_thrace Shes my daughter!
samuel_anders Kara! Kara, no! Godsdamn it, Kara, no! Out of the way! Godsdamn it, Kara, no!
simon Weve lost control of the situation on the surface. Theres a Heavy Raider standing by ready to evacuate us.
danna_biers Were agreed. Evacuate the entire facility. Ill stay behind and set off the nuke. You should go as well, Caprica. And you. I dont think youll want to be here after weve gone. Theres a place for you, too.
dr_gaius_baltar For me?
danna_biers Well, you were right and we were wrong. Should be some reward for that.
number_six Gaius, we should go.
dr_gaius_baltar I just wanna sit here and die.
lt_felix_gaeta Youre gonna get your wish, Gaius.
captain_aaron_kelly, civvie ships are getting off the ground. Jumping away. Only a few left. FTLs back online. Pegasus is taking a hell of a pounding, sir. I dont think she has a single plane in the air.
admiral_william_adama Lee left all of his planes to guard the civilian ships. He knew that was a one-way trip. Hell evac before the end.
captain_karl_agathon You sure?
admiral_william_adama Land our birds! Lets get the hell out of here.
captain_karl_agathon All wings, Galactica. Come on home. Combat landings authorized. Repeat, come on home.
admiral_william_adama All hands, all hands, get ready to jump.
lt_felix_gaeta I believed in you.
number_six Whoa, whoa. Gaeta.
lt_felix_gaeta I believed in the dream of New Caprica.
number_six Gaeta, we all did.
lt_felix_gaeta No! No. Not him. He believed in the dream of Gaius Baltar. The good life. Booze, pills, hot and cold running interns. He lead us to the apocalypse, and-- and I--I turned out to be--
dr_gaius_baltar An idealist. Theres no sin in that. Everything you say about me is true. Every word. But you have to listen to me. The Cylons have a nuke in this complex. Nobody... and I mean nobody is getting off this planet alive unless I stop Danna.
number_six Gaius, shell kill you.
dr_gaius_baltar Then shell kill me. Or itll be down to Mr. Gaeta. Either way, the human race dies with me.
number_six Gaius, he --
dr_gaius_baltar Go ahead, shoot. What are you waiting for? Do it. Please. Please. Im begging you to please --
lt_felix_gaeta You have one chance to put things right. Do you understand me? Get the frak out of here! Stop that nuke! Go!
number_six Gaius, lets go.
cpt_lee_adama Set main batteries to autofire cycle-B. Lock engines ahead flank. This is the Commander. Abandon ship, abandon ship. All hands, abandon ship. Report to evac raptors and jump to rendezvous point. Good work, and Ill see you on the other side.
officer_anastasia_dualla Okay, all right, people, lets move! Out! Lets go! You too, Commander.
cpt_lee_adama Yes, sir. Thank you.
captain_kara_thrace Kacey! Kacey! Kacey, honey, where are you? Kacey --
leoben_conoy I knew youd be back. I saw it.
captain_kara_thrace Give me Kacey.
leoben_conoy Say the words.
captain_kara_thrace Let me take her.
leoben_conoy Say them.
captain_kara_thrace What words?
leoben_conoy You know what I want. I want to hear you say them. And I want the rest of it. Just like I told you.
captain_kara_thrace Fine. I love you.
leoben_conoy Say it again.
captain_kara_thrace I love you.
leoben_conoy Now the rest.
captain_kara_thrace Was it everything you thought it would be?
leoben_conoy That and more. Ill never forget this moment.
captain_kara_thrace Neither will I.
captain_kara_thrace Ill explain later. Lets move.
dr_gaius_baltar are you sure shes in there?
number_six Positive. I saw her go in.
danna_biers Frakking liar.
number_six Its her, Gaius. The first of Gods new generation.
dr_gaius_baltar Hera. Shh.
number_six Its a miracle. God spared her.
danna_biers Hera. Can I hold her?
number_six No. Shes not going to set off the nuke, not anymore. Come on, Gaius. We have to go.
president_laura_roslin All right. Im ready to go.
chief_galen_tyrol All right, people, lets go. This way. Stay on the starboard hangar deck till we can get you to new ships. Come on, people, all the way down. All the way down, people, all the way down. Lets go.
chief_galen_tyrol Oh, my Gods. Captain! I thought you were dead.
captain_kara_thrace Yeah, so did I.
chief_galen_tyrol Hey. Whos this?
samuel_anders Yeah, I was gonna ask that myself.
captain_kara_thrace This is --
Woman#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode04 Kacey? Kacey! Oh, my little girl! Oh, Mommy missed you so much! Thank you. Thank you! Thank you. When the Cylons took her I -- I thought -- but you saved her. Gods bless you.
admiral_william_adama Hey. Welcome aboard. Welcome aboard.
admiral_william_adama I guess you didnt understand my orders, huh?
cpt_lee_adama Never could read your handwriting.
colonel_saul_tigh permission to come aboard, sir.
admiral_william_adama Hey.
colonel_saul_tigh Ahh.
admiral_william_adama Permission granted. You did it. You brought em home, Saul.
colonel_saul_tigh Not all of them.
admiral_william_adama Im sorry.
tory_foster Were still double-checking the Fleets manifests, but, uh ... it doesnt look like Maya made it off of New Caprica.
president_laura_roslin What about the baby?
tory_foster I was there when the two guards left to take them to their ship. I dont know what happened. Im so sorry. I let you down. And I know that.
president_laura_roslin No, you didnt. Its not your fault. This is bigger than us. This is life.
