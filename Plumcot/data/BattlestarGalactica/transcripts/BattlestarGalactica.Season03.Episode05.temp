Leoben Youre gonna hold me in your arms. Youre gonna tell me that you love me.
Starbuck Youre insane.
Leoben You kill me, I download, I come back, we start over.
Starbuck I dont belong here! Let me out!
Jammer Some of those guys who joined up -- the Cylon police -- bet theyre in over their heads, you know?
Chief one day when this is all over, guys like that are gonna get strung up. Guys like you and me, were gonna be there, tying the knots, making them tight.
Tigh Where are you getting this stuff? Whos your source?
Chief I have no idea. The source wont tell me what their name is. Its probably safer for all of us.
Gaeta Mr. President?
Caprica Good morning, Gaeta.
Gaeta This is a death warrant. Have you seen the names on this list? Do you have any idea what theyre about to do out there?
Chief I got this from the dead-drop from the source of the administration. Its a death list and Callys names on it.
Jammer Run! Dont look back. Go!
Anders We were ambushed at the rendezvous. The Cylons knew exactly where we were gonna be.
Tigh That doesnt mean Ellen had anything to do --
Ellen I didnt do anything!
Anders This is the map that I drew for you! You were gonna burn it, but then your wife offered to do it for you.
Anders_VO You know what has to be done here. Now it would be better for her sake if it was you.
Chief_shouting_at_evacuees Come on! Move! Move, move!
Three Evacuate the entire facility. ...You should go as well, Gaius. Theres a place for you too.
Seelix Evidence for the following charges have been presented to the Circle: that you carried arms for the enemy as you carried out multiple raids against the human population, and that during one raid, 23 people were killed by you and your men during the assault on the temple of Artemis.
Jammer Its not true!
Connor These are the names of the people killed by you and those under your command. You look at those names!
Seelix Connor. The Circle has examined the evidence and found you guilty of treason and crimes against humanity. Do you have anything to say before sentence is passed?
Jammer I was just trying to help people.
Tigh You didnt do a very good job, then, did you?
Anders Lets just get this over with.
Jammer I helped people. I helped lots of people. Chief -- Chief! Chief, I helped Cally. I saved Cally. I saved Cally.
Chief What do you mean you helped Cally?
Jammer Im the one who did. Im the one who let her go when they were gonna shoot her. I took her out of line. I said, Go! Run right now. Run like hell. Get out of here. And she did. She ran and she got away. Because of me, Chief. I helped Cally. I saved Cally.
Chief Cally did get away...somehow.
Connor They killed 23 people during the temple raids. Twelve men, eight women, and three children. Children! My son is on this list. His name is right there. And that frakkin son-of-a-bitch put him there. So saving Cally, if that happened -- does that make up for killing my son?
Tigh Answer the question, Chief. Does saving Cally let him off the hook for killing 23 others?
Chief_crouching Did you do this, Jammer? Did you kill these people? Answer me.
Jammer It was crazy down there, Chief. You know that. You make these decisions so fast. Youre making an arrest, and people come out with their hands up. But sometimes its just a trick. They tell you theyre surrendering and then they open fire. We thought they were insurgents. It wasnt till after we saw the bodies. What was I supposed to do? It wasnt till after we saw the bodies. What was I supposed to do?
Chief_stands_and_returns_to_the_Circle No, it doesnt.
Seelix Under the articles, the punishment for treason is death. Sentence confirmed and carried out on this, the third day of the second Exodus.
Anders Thats too much frakkin talk.
Jammer Wait!
Jammer Im sorry!
Connor My son. Kevin. He was only seven years old.
Barolay Lets go. Come on. Connor, lets go.
Anders_to_Chief This isnt what I signed up for.
Chief Hi. Hey, sweetie.
Cally Am I on watch?
Chief No, no, youre fine. Here. Give him to me. Come here. You come here. Come to daddy. Hey, buddy. There you go. I know, Mommys much more comfortable than me. Huh? Cally?
Cally Mm-hmm.
Chief When you were down on their planet, you ran away from the trucks. Did anybody help you? one of the NCP goons or ... anybody?
Cally What? No. Wait, yeah. Somebody told me to run. It probably was one of those goons. I havent thought about it since. Hey, how did you know about that? I mean, why do you ask?
Chief No reason. Go back to sleep.
Cally Okay.
Adama In my opinion it wasnt his fault.
Tigh_with_both_eyes_intact I hate to admit it, but the Admirals right. He was in an impossible situation. Id have probably done the same in his position.
Roslin Well, if thats the way it has to be then thats the way it has to be. No hard feelings?
Baltar None. Mistakes were made, no doubt. Theres no question. But the past is the past. I think we can all agree that wed like to move on.
Chip_Six_enters You fools. Youre being too lenient, he betrayed you. Actively sought your deaths. Doesnt that matter to you? Dont you have any self-respect?
Baltar Wouldnt bother, they cant hear you...
Six Dont make me angry, Gaius.
Adama You wouldnt like her when shes angry.
Roslin_taking_off_Baltars_glasses Ive always wanted you.
Baltar Oh, no.
Roslin What?
Baltar Im dreaming, arent I?
Roslin Yes, you are.
Anders Hey. Did you get any sleep?
Starbuck Sleep when youre dead.
Anders Nice. What is all that?
Starbuck I got my gear out of storage. Never thought Id see any of this stuff again.
Anders Hey.
Starbuck What?
Anders Come here.
Starbuck Just dont, okay?
Roslin So, Mr. President, how long before the new Quorum of Twelve can be sworn in?
Zarek Three days. I will personally place your name in nomination as my Vice President. once they confirm you, I submit my resignation and you get sworn in. The whole thing should take less than an hour.
Roslin Youre stepping down without a fight? Means Tom Zarek wants something. So why dont you put your cards on the table and lets see if its a price that Im willing to pay.
Zarek Well, Im a realist. I never had any illusions about remaining in office for very long. And the Admirals made it quite clear that hed like nothing better than to put me in a cell if I try to hang on to power.
Roslin Hes trying to do you a favor. You and I both know how impossible it would be to govern this fleet without the backing of the military.
Zarek I agree. Thats why were here. Even so, I want to be included in the new government. I dont wanna be on the outside looking in anymore.
Roslin Okay. Okay. You stood up to Baltar on New Caprica. You nearly lost your life for your trouble. This Fleet needs that kind of courage. The vice presidency is yours if you want it, Tom.
Zarek_laughing Well, thank you.
Roslin_shaking_his_hand Youre welcome.
Tigh You gotta be kidding. Who gave this man permission to enter the CIC?
Helo Admirals orders, sir. Communications took some serious hits during the rescue, and Mr. Gaetas offered to help with the repairs.
Tigh Well, isnt that nice. Man can turn his coat, collaborate with the enemy, contribute to the deaths of thousands. But the old man needs his phones fixed, and suddenly, all is forgiven.
Helo Cylons find us, were gonna need every hand weve got.
Tigh The Cylons found us, Mr. Agathon. Your friend Gaeta was on the welcoming committee.
Tigh Hey! Look at me. Long as youre here, maybe you can help me out. Im missing something. I lost it in detention. Since youre so buddy-buddy with the Cylons, maybe you know where it is? How bout it? Do you know where my eye is?
Adama_entering Saul!
Tigh Admiral.
Adama_to_crew Back to work. Walk with me.
Tigh Yeah.
Adama They have a lot of work in the next couple of weeks. I need you to get some sleep. Get rested and get ready, all right?
Tigh Oh, Im ready right now. I may be a little rough around the edges, but I can still hold my own. And you can tell that toaster-lover over there that I am still the XO of this ship!
Adama Lets go.
Tigh Get your hands off me.
Adama Youre embarrassing yourself, Saul.
Tigh Youre the one that should be embarrassed. Letting one of Baltars henchman walk around like nothings happened.
Adama Go sleep this off. Thats an order.
Tigh Oh, yeah. Just go to sleep. Forget about it all, just forget about everything. Well, Im not forgetting. Im not gonna forget.
Seelix The charges are carrying arms for the enemy in a time of war, shooting three civilians, and collaboration with the enemy. I call the vote.
Anders Guilty.
Barolay Guilty.
Tigh Guilty.
Connor Guilty.
Chief Yeah. Guilty.
Seelix Guilty. The vote being unanimous, the sentence is death.
Barolay Chadwicks aboard
Anders Anybody got a cigarette?
Chief How many more of these we got?
Barolay 57. Three days. I cant believe thats all the time weve got.
Tigh Then stop wasting it bitching and moaning. We all knew there was a clock when we signed on.
Connor Most of these fraks are so guilty they stink. I could get through 50 of these things in an hour.
Tigh_slams_Connors_head_into_the_table You think were a bunch of thugs handing out punishment on a whim? Jammer didnt get airlocked because you thought he was guilty. There was evidence. He was tried and convicted by this circle. This is about justice. You got that? Justice!
Connor Yeah, okay. Okay.
Tigh Hey. Now dont get me wrong here. I like you, Connor. Youre a good guy. Next case.
Seelix Felix Gaeta. Charges are collaborating with the enemy, and crimes against humanity.
Tigh I dont wanna do this. Do you think I like it? I stood beside Gaeta in the CIC for almost four years. He was like family. But the fact remains he was chief of staff to Gaius Baltar. And that alone is enough to convict him
Anders And Im saying that on this particular guy, we do not have any hard evidence. We got no witnesses -- nothing. All we do know is that he worked for Baltar. Thats it.
Chief Yeah, I gotta go with Sam on this one. We need something specific.
Tigh You want specific? You think Baltar ran things? That guy? He was the public face, but Gaeta -- he was the brains. Everyone knew that. He ran the operation. He did the paperwork. He approved the death lists.
Chief How do you know that? Were you there? Did you see him approve one single death list?
Tigh He knew Cally was on a death list.
Chief What are you talking about? How do you know that?
Tigh Look there. Thats a distribution list and theres Callys name. And theres Gaetas name. He saw her execution ordered.
Anders Its still all circumstantial. We dont know what Gaeta did or didnt do when he saw that list.
Barolay I gotta go with them on this one.
Anders Jean!
Barolay No, Sam, you see a death list like that, you know innocent people are gonna die, and you do nothing about it? Hes guilty.
Connor I call the question.
Seelix The question of the innocence or guilt of Felix Gaeta has been called. The Circle will vote. I vote guilty.
Connor Guilty.
Tigh Guilty.
Anders No, dont bother. Im done.
Seelix Were still voting.
Anders Im not. Im done. Im done with this whole thing. Wars over for me. Im sorry.
Connor Okay. Thats fine. Still four to none, Chief. Whats your vote?
Barolay No, wait a minute. We need six votes.
Connor No, screw that.
Chief No, screw you! Were a jury. Thats how it was set up. We need six votes. We dont have six votes, Im out too.
Tigh Hes right. We need a sixth.
Three How are you, Gaius?
Baltar Im alive. I suppose thats something.
Baltar Thank you.
Baltar Youll have to excuse me, Im slightly confused. How long have I been here exactly?
Three Three days.
Baltar Three days? So its taken you three days to remember where I was?
Three No ones forgotten you, Gaius.
Three Its just theres been some controversy about whether or not you shouldve let on board or not.
Baltar I cant believe theres still question of my value.
Three_regards_him_from_the_couch Therell always be a question. You are a human.
Baltar Now look. I helped you. I gave you Sharons child.
Three Yes, thats right. You did. And the childs rescue did weigh in your favor. However, the votes deadlocked. Three in favor of your being allowed to stay, and three against. With one model still undecided. The fact is, the decision rests with the Sixes.
Apollo Were starting to see a rash of missing persons reports.
Adama Well, we left thousands of people on that planet.
Apollo No, this is different. These are people known to have survived, but whove gone missing since the Exodus. Jammer for instance.
Adama Deck hand. I saw him yesterday afternoon.
Apollo Yeah, but he didnt report at muster this morning, bedcheck negative, sickbay negative. Its like he just vanished.
Adama How many people are missing?
Apollo 13 as of today. Two on Galactica, 11 elsewhere. Every one of them confirmed as a survivor by multiple witnesses and then poof! Gone.
Adama Keep me posted on any more missing persons. I wanna know about it.
Apollo Yes, sir. Now if youll excuse me. I have a date with a jump rope.
Apollo Hey, Ive dropped half a stone.
Adama Keep jumping.
Starbuck Hey. How ya doing?
Gaeta You know, Im ... making do. How are you?
Starbuck Im good. Why do you ask?
Gaeta Well, I heard about your situation. You were
Starbuck ...Right. I just try not to think about it anymore. You know?
Starbuck Kinda like you... sitting in your plushy little office on
Gaeta I didnt know about your situation. If I had, I wouldve tried to get you out.
Starbuck Mm.
Gaeta Like I just said about 50 times now, I was serving the legal President of the Colonies. We all elected him, remember?
Starbuck So thats supposed to excuse it?
Gaeta What do you want me to say? Maybe I couldve done more. But I thought that when the Cylons landed, it was important for me to keep my job. To help from the inside.
Starbuck By propping Baltar up and letting the Cylons walk all over us.
Gaeta No! No! I fed information to the Resistance. I set up dead-drops. There was a dog bowl. I passed along Cylon positions, internal memoranda --
Starbuck Hooray, Felix. Youre a frakkin hero.
Six Whatever feelings I had for you have to stop. I allowed my feelings to cloud my judgment. I protected you. I gave your species a second chance. I even turned against a sister Cylon and for WHAT? Im Cylon, Gaius. Somehow I lost sight of that.
Baltar_stands You are much, much more than a machine. Youre a person. A real person. A woman. And youre in love with me. And it hurts. I know it hurts. But believe me, I am the only one that can make it better. Dont you see? I am the only one.
Six No, this has to end.
Baltar You need me. You need me! Admit it! Admit that you need me.
Baltar And I need you too! Did you hear me? I need you too. Maybe I shouldve started with that.
Tigh Its a jury. I wanna make that clear. Its not about settling scores or personal grudges. Its a jury.
Chief Were just dealing with the worst of the worst. People that did more than put on an NCP uniform or make a deal with the Cylons.
Barolay Theyre the killers. The real traitors.
Starbuck Yeah, but none of this is legal, right?
Chief No, no. Its legal.
Starbuck You gotta be kidding me.
Tigh Thats why we need to know right now. Are you in or out?
Tigh Good. Weve already been through the evidence. So just take your time.
Starbuck You telling me that Gaeta saw this list and didnt do a damn thing about it?
Chief We have no idea of knowing what Gaeta did or did not do when he saw the list.
Starbuck My Gods, the whole things like a bad dream only we woke up and the traitors are all still here. ...Guilty.
Seelix Thats five to none in favor of guilty. Its gotta be unanimous. Chief. Youre the last to vote.
Tigh Get outta here, Sam.
Anders Id like to talk to my wife. Id like to do it now.
Starbuck We already have your vote. Take a break.
Anders Hey, I quit because Im not looking for ways to keep killing people.
Starbuck I need this, Sam.
Anders So what? Throwing a few people out an airlock is gonna make you feel better about yourself? Cause believe me, those arent the people that kept you locked in that room.
Starbuck Theyll do. And not just for me but for every person we left back on that planet because someone has gotta pay. So you can either get with it, or you can get lost.
Anders Is that what you want, Kara? You want me to leave?
Tigh He doesnt wanna say hes guilty because Gaeta is such a good guy. Right, Chief? Everyone likes Gaeta, so lets let him off the hook. Lets just look the other way on this one. Well, a lot of good people had to pay the price for what they did. Choices they made on New Caprica. Like my wife.
Tigh Thats right. Ellen collaborated. Gave the Cylons information on the Resistance, and she died for it. Because thats the price of collaborating with the enemy. And I liked her a lot more than I like Gaeta.
Starbuck Look, Sam... Im in a different place now. I -- I dont know how else to explain it to you. But I got out of that cell, and its like someone painted the world in different colors. And I look at you... and I want to tear your eyes out just for looking at me.
Starbuck I just wanna hurt someone and it might as well be you. So you should probably go before that happens.
Seelix Baltar signed death warrants, organized murder squads. He collaborated with the enemy from day one.
Chief Baltar, not Gaeta.
Tigh Its the same Godsdamned thing.
Seelix Hes right. A lot of people died because of them, Chief.
Chief Fine. Guilty.
Anders_hands_Starbuck_her_dogtags Remember this? I dont want this anymore.
Starbuck Sam...
Barolay Take him.
Connor Turn around! on your knees. on your knees!
Seelix Felix Gaeta, youve been tried and found guilty of crimes against humanity by a circle of your peers, as duly authorized by the President of the Colonies.
Seelix If you have any words to offer in your own defense, now is the time.
Chief Come on, Felix. Talk. Well listen.
Connor Yeah, thats right. Well listen to you tell us how hiding behind Baltars skirt was actually your way of helping the insurgency.
Barolay Say something.
Gaeta_teeth_clenched Whats the point? I already tried to explain it. Im not gonna beg.
Tigh Too bad you didnt grow that spine four months ago.
Starbuck Beg. Beg! Beg!
Tigh Thrace.
Starbuck No! Beg. Come on, Felix. Tell em how you were actually working for the Resistance the entire time. Come on! Tell em all about the important information that you were giving up. Tell em about all the messages and the dog bowl, and everything else. Just tell me about ...
Chief What? Whatd she say? What did she just say? Back up, lady. What did she just say? What did you say to her? Tell me. What did you say to her?
Gaeta There was a yellow dog bowl. It was a signal. It meant there was a message in the garbage dump. I turned it over. It was a signal. And then there was a message in the garbage dump.
Chief That was you. Oh, my God --
Tigh What are you doing?
Starbuck_sick Chief.
Chief There was a yellow dog bowl. I used it. You were wondering who the source was, Colonel. Theres no other way he couldve known. Hes the only other one that would know about it. Hes the reason we know about the death lists. Hes the reason I saved Cally. Hes the reason were on this ship. Hes the one who gave us the inside information. Theres our source, Colonel.
Gaeta I did what I could. I dont know what else I couldve done.
Adama What the hell is this?
Zarek Its all perfectly legal. Youll find a signed executive order on file authorizing a secret jury of six men and women to try, sentence, and execute people guilty of extraordinary crimes while collaborating with the enemy in a time of war. Theres also a death warrant with my signature for every conviction.
Adama Your presidency is a farce. It stops right now.
Roslin If theyre guilty, theyll be tried by a jury of their peers.
Zarek They have a jury. But they dont get lawyers. They dont get to showboat for weeks and months on end. They dont get to blame the system and they dont get lasting fame as martyrs or innocent people just in the wrong place at the wrong time. They just disappear. Now, in the gray twilight between the long night of the Occupation and the dawn of a new era, you come into office clean, without their blood on your hands.
Zarek You think by making the trials public that youll find justice?
Roslin Yes, I do.
Zarek Come on, Laura. Youre not that naive. Let me tell you whats gonna happen if these cases go to trial. Itll consume this fleet for months, maybe years. People will be lining up to testify against their neighbors. Itll be a circus -- an entertainment for the mob. And youll be signing death warrants almost every day. Is that how you wanna spend your next term, Laura? As executioner-in-chief?
Roslin ...With every fiber of my being.
Roslin Thank you. Thank you all, for once again entrusting me with this high office of civil service. Todays a new beginning for all of us. We share a unique destiny ...
Roslin ... That our future is ours to shape, and our past cannot be forgotten. A new day requires new thinking. And while I had intended on using this occasion as an opportunity to announce a formation of a special prosecutors office charged with investigating acts of collaboration with the enemy ...
Roslin ... I have decided instead that a different gesture is called for on this, the first day of my next term as your president. We all feel the need for justice, and we all feel the need for vengeance.
Roslin ... And telling the difference between the two can be difficult at times. We are all victims of the Cylons
Roslin ... And none of us can be impartial. I certainly cant. So today I am forming a commission on truth and reconciliation to hear our stories, and record them for posterity. There will be no prosecutions.
Roslin ... I am issuing a general pardon for every human being in this fleet. This will not be a popular move today. But I truly believe that this is the only way for us to move forward in strength in a spirit of healing and reconciliation.
Roslin ... I thank you for your continued patience and courage. Good day.
