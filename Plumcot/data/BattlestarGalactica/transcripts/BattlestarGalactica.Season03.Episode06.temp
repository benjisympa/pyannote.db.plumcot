Baltar Previously, on
Sharon I, Sharon Agathon, will carry out the lawful orders of my superiors as an officer in the Colonial Fleet.
Adama Congratulations, Lieutenant.
Roslin Were talking about people blowing themselves up.
Tigh Ive got one job here, lady, and one job only -- to disrupt the Cylons. Make them worry about the anthill theyve stirred up down here, so theyre distracted and out of position when the old man shows up in orbit.
Adama_on_PA You know the mission. You should also know theres only one way that this mission ends, and thats with the successful rescue of our people off of New Caprica.
Three Evacuate the entire facility. You should go as well, Gaius. Theres a place for you too.
Chief Captain? Hi. Whos this?
Starbuck This is ...
Julia Kacey! Oh, my little girl. When the Cylons took her, I thought... But you saved her. Gods bless you!
Tigh A lot of good people had to pay the price for what they did. Choices they made on New Caprica. Like my wife. Thats right, Ellen collaborated. Gave the Cylons information on the Resistance, and she died for it.
Baltar I cant believe theres still a question of my value.
Three There will always be a question. Youre human.
Baltar Good to see you. I far prefer these picturesque settings for little our interludes, dont you? I thought you had abandoned me to your Cylon comrades.
Six_archly Would I do that?
Baltar Youve always been more unpredictable than your flesh and blood counterparts.
Six A man that loves women as much as you should have learned that a long time ago.
Baltar Im a slow learner.
Six Then take this period as a time to learn all you can about the Cylons. Youll need it in the days ahead.
Baltar Something special on the horizon?
Six Cylon psychology is based on projection.
Baltar Projection?
Six Its how they choose to see the world around them. The only difference is, you choose to see me.
Baltar What are you... really? Youre either connected to the woman I knew in Caprica ... or youre just a damaged part of my subconscious struggling for self-expression, so which one is it?
Six Im an angel of God sent here to help you. Just as I always have been.
Three Were all part of one big ecosystem.
Baltar Yes, I can feel it. Breathing.
Three Get used to it.
Six So, whatd he say?
Three I havent asked him yet.
Baltar Asked me about what?
Six Earth.
Baltar Uh... What, uh...
Three Earth. Its the 13th colony.
Six Do you know how to find it?
Baltar Not really, no.
Three Well, thats unfortunate. There was a hope -- my hope -- that if you knew the way to Earth, it would justify keeping you alive a little longer. Come on, Six.
Baltar Wait. Wait, wait! Now when I say that I do not know exactly where Earth is, that is not to say that I do not know a very great deal about its probable location. Honestly, I spent hours, days, weeks, months and months on a map that Adama and Roslin found on Kobol. And I correlated that with astrometric observations. I doubt anyone here can make the same claim.
Six Well get back to you.
Baltar What do you care about finding Earth?
Six Because were looking for it.
Baltar You are.
Three Yes, weve decided that Earths going to be our new home.
Helo_on_comms ship-to-ship training exercise is authorized. You may commence when ready.
Apollo This is Apollo. Red team set.
Kat Blue team set.
Apollo Red team, Apollo. As soon as we clear the moon, were gonna be on their dradis, so keep your eyes up. Theyre gonna hit us with everything they got. Stay in formation, Starbuck. Nacho, youre my wingman.
Kat Blue team, Kat. Lets show these lazy fraks how its done.
Starbuck Red team, Starbuck. I got Hotdog.
Hotdog Im hit!
Apollo_on_comms Red team, Apollo. Im going after Kat.
Apollo Got you.
Kat_evading_his_shot Whoo! Youre gonna have to do better than that, Apollo. Come on!
Starbuck Ill take care of Kat.
Apollo Starbuck, you stay in formation. Nacho has Kat.
Starbuck Inbound.
Kat Starbuck, youre too close.
Apollo Frak!
Chief Compressor blew. Looks like it threw a blade, severed the fuel line. Cally, check the tank. Gods, this is ugly.
Cally The tanks bone dry. Theres not even fumes in here.
Chief Captain, howd you land this thing?
Starbuck Pointed it toward the deck, and stopped when I got here.
Hotdog_quietly_to_Kat Bone dry, she says. Landed the bird without a drop of fuel.
Apollo If you want to die, I will open up an airlock for you, but you are not taking one of my Vipers with you!
Starbuck The birds on the deck. Im on the deck. I dont know what youre bitching about.
Apollo I dont give a frak what you do, Starbuck, youre done flying.
Ellen I cant believe you did that to me.
Tigh What?
Ellen Dont look at me like that!
Tigh Oh, my Gods. Ellen? Ellen?
Tigh Excuse me. Excuse me. Hey, make a hole. Ellen?
Woman If Ive told you once, Ive told you a thousand times...
Tigh Ellen, Im right here.
Woman What is this? Let go of me.
Kacey Kara, Kara!
Starbuck Kacey?
Kacey Kara, Kara!
Julia Captain Thrace? Im sorry, dont you remember me? Im Julia. Im Kaceys mom?
Starbuck Yeah. Yeah, I remember.
Kacey Give me a hug.
Julia Weve been staying over in the ... Well, everyones calling it Camp Oilslick, part of the hangar deck? And theyve put up cots for, you know, refugees...
Starbuck Yeah, I heard.
Julia Well, Kaceys been asking to see you for days. I sent messages. I thought, you know, maybe youd come for a visit...
Starbuck You seem like a really nice person, so Im gonna be honest with you. The last thing I need is a two-year-old friend. And Kacey sure as hell does not need me in her life, so do us both a favor and do not bring her around here again, okay?
Starbuck Go to your mom, Kase.
Julia_hurt Sure. Sorry, dont let us keep you up.
Julia Sorry, honey, we gotta go.
Apollo_balancing_the_scales There it goes.
Helo Thats it. See? See, I told you you could do it! You did great.
Apollo Remind me never to let that happen again.
Helo You got it, Slim.
Apollo Ever.
Gaeta Ive been trying to reassemble President Balt --
Roslin Im curious, Mr. Gaeta. What is it that you trust about Dr. Baltars research? How do you know its not another one of his lies?
Gaeta If there was one thing I learned about Baltar, it was his extraordinary capacity for self-preservation. I think he wanted to find Earth because he wanted to get there.
Roslin How far did he get with his research?
Gaeta Well, as you can see, Im still hacking through his notes. But it appears that he was trying to correlate our own astrometric readings with the map of constellations that we found back on Kobol, and apply his findings to certain select passages within the Scroll of Pythia.
Adama Why the Scroll of Pythia?
Roslin Pythia is supposed to have chronicled the original journey of the 13th Tribe on its way to Earth.
Gaeta If I can draw your attention to this passage: And the caravan of the heavens was watched over by a great lion with a mighty blinking eye...
Adama_reading ...Red and blue.
Gaeta Exactly.
Adama Exactly what? Youre looking for a lions head?
Roslin_smiling With a mighty blinking eye.
Adama Blinking.
Roslin Well, theyre Scrolls. They speak in metaphors.
Gaeta Initially, I thought the doctor might be off his meds as well, sir. But then I found this note here, where he had written blinking equals pulsar.
Roslin That means a star, right?
Gaeta Uh, plural, actually. Theyre the rotating cores of dead stars? They emit a blast of radio waves. From a distance, they appear to --
Roslin Blink.
Gaeta Right. The doctor found two in very close mutual orbit within this sector. Uh, the spectrographic readings that I found show one will appear to be red, and one will appear to be blue. Now... these pulsars appear to be in this nebula. We have never had a direct look at this area. But it is possible, with a couple of eyeballs out there, they might look at the nebula and see --
Adama A giant lions head.
Roslin_brightly Well, it looks like this is the best thing weve got going, so ... Unless you object, Admiral, I suggest we go lion hunting.
Caprica The navigational markers you gave us may prove useful. They sent a baseship out to investigate the pulsars, and look for this lions head of yours.
Baltar Look, this isnt easy for me. I dont think you fully appreciate just how difficult this is! I have very conflicted, very ambiguous feelings about helping you find Earth.
Caprica_laughing Funny how all that ambivalence and conflict seemed to vanish once you thought your life hung in the balance.
Caprica You should know theres still a lot of skepticism about whether youre being entirely truthful.
Eight Im very sorry. We didnt mean to intrude.
Caprica Come on, Gaius.
Baltar are we going round in circles?
Caprica Im sure it all looks the same to you, doesnt it? Be hard for any human to navigate around here. Especially without projecting.
Baltar Yes, youve used that word before and Im not quite sure what youre talking about. It helps you to what, exactly?
Caprica Have you ever daydreamed... and imagined that you were somewhere else?
Baltar I do have an active imagination.
Caprica Well, we dont have to imagine. We project. We choose to see our environment in any form we wish, whenever we wish. For instance, right now you see us as standing in a hallway, but I see it as a forest.
Caprica Filled with trees, birds, sunlight...
Baltar Like the walks that you and I used to take. on Caprica.
Caprica The aesthetic is what gives me pleasure. Not the specific memories.
Caprica Instead of staring at blank walls, I choose to surround myself with a vision of Gods creation.
Baltar Right, now I think I understand projection, but its a bit of a coincidence, isnt it? That I could see such a vivid reality that Ive created, and the Cylon projection experience seems to be so similar?
Six Is it a coincidence?
Baltar Well, what are you saying? Theres a connection? What, because of my experiences with you --
Caprica_grossed_out ...
Baltar Oh, nothing. Just talking out loud. ...Silly me.
Racetrack So you sure you want to go in the second seat again? I mean, I hear youre a pretty fair pilot now.
Racetrack Well, too many Pilots, not enough birds. Anything to keep me flying, at this point. You want me Im yours, Boomer.
Sharon Uh, no, Boomer was... She was someone else.
Helo Listen up. We need a new call sign for Lieutenant Agathon.
Pilots Chrome Dome! Titania! Lightbulb! Wind-up Toy! Raptor Adapter! Microchip! Digital Dame! Mayflower! Carburetor! Tincan! Toaster Babe! Transistor! Robopilot!
Hotdog How about Athena?
Helo Wait, wait, wait, wait. What was that?
Hotdog You know, the Goddess of Wisdom and War. Usually accompanied by the Goddess of Victory?
A_Pilot_quietly She likes it.
Helo Athena it is!
Racetrack Hey, Colonel! Colonel, come have a seat. Over here.
Tigh_approaching_Starbucks_table_instead Enough of that to go around?
Starbuck Always.
Kat Oh, yeah.
Tigh Dead Mans Chest? Cutthroat game. Not usually your style.
Starbuck It is now. And Im in it to win. You dont like it, find another game.
Starbuck Frakkin civilians think they run the ship now.
A_Pilot Beats what we had before. The ship was like a tomb.
Tigh You want to know what alone feels like, try spending a few weeks in a Cylon holding cell.
Kat_grinning Yeah, it was a bitch on both sides. And it wasnt exactly easy coming up with a plan to save your sorry butts.
Starbuck You guys had it rough, huh? Hot showers, three squares a day. Viper jocks didnt even take a shot till you jumped into orbit.
Helo Hey... we all made sacrifices.
Tigh Is that so?
Helo Yes, thats right.
Tigh While you were pinning wings on your Cylon girlfriend, and our people were strapping homemade bombs to their chests. Doing whatever they could to take the bastards out. So forgive me if I dont get all misty over your sacrifices.
Caprica You seem distracted, Gaius.
Baltar Do I?
Caprica_quietly You can rest easy, at least for now. The data on Earths location and your valiant rescue of the baby has gone a long way toward impressing the others.
Caprica_smiling I used to think you and I would have a baby one day.
Baltar There are only twelve Cylon models. But in the entire occupation on New Caprica, I only saw seven. Now here again, the same seven. Who are the final five?
Caprica I cant talk about that.
Baltar Cant or wont?
Caprica I cant. Its complicated, but we dont talk about them. Ever.
Baltar But youd know one of them, wouldnt you, if you saw them? one of the final five. If they were to walk past here right --
Three_urgently_approaching_with_several_other_models Six, we have a problem.
Doral A baseship. The one we sent to investigate the pulsars in the lion nebula. Weve lost contact.
Three The trouble is we know almost nothing about the missing baseships status.
Doral We received a garbled distress call, then silence. Not surprisingly, their Hybrid sent us a confusing set of data. Our Hybrid is analyzing it.
Baltar What are these Hybrids hes talking about?
Six Be quiet, Gaius.
Eight Our Hybrids deciphered part of the data set that we received from our scout ship.
Doral this cant happen to us. Its impossible.
Simon It is not only possible, it may have been inevitable, once we took human form.
Doral were not human. Were not like them.
Simon God has chosen this time, this place, to test us. Whether we fail or pass the test is up to us.
Baltar Whats going on?
Caprica The missing baseship, its been infected by some kind of disease.
Baltar Disease?
Eight Yes, its killing them. All of them.
Simon If an infected Cylon dies, and carries this disease with them into a resurrection ship, it could rapidly spread, potentially infecting our entire race.
Three All right, we make sure that the resurrection ship is out of range, then we jump to their location. Send in a group of Centurions to make sure...
Eight No. The data set indicates that as soon as the Hybrid was infected, the Centurions started shutting down. We dont know how ours are gonna be affected.
Three I assume our Raiders and baseships are also susceptible.
Simon Of course. We are all created from the same genetic pool.
Doral Then no Cylon can board that ship without risking infection.
Six_evenly Say youll go aboard the infected baseship, and investigate what happened. You sent them to that nebula. Remember?
Baltar Are you mad?
Six_chuckling You have to prove to them you can be counted on in an emergency. Show them youre worth keeping alive.
Baltar And what if I catch the disease?
Six_laughing_again What are the chances that a human could catch something that infects a Centurion or a Raider? That is, if youre human. And if youre really a Cylon -- one of the final five you havent seen yet -- then wouldnt you rather just get it over with and die?
Baltar_loudly Ill go.
Three What?
Baltar Yes, Ill go. Look, I am a trained scientist. I can go to the baseship. I can make observations about the Cylons, their physical condition. Bring back information about this disease, which now threatens all of you.
Simon We land, the disease thats killing the human Cylons could infect one of our Raiders as well.
Baltar Then dont send a raider. Surely the wars furbished you with some Colonial vessels.
Eight Hes right. We could program one of our Raptors to approach on autopilot.
Three All right, then prepare to jump the ship. Make sure the resurrection ship knows to stay behind, out of range.
Baltar A truly ... selfless act.
Tigh I could use a refill here.
Hotdog Here. Heres to knowing ... that somebody will always have your back.
Pilots Yeah!
Tigh The sentiments good, but in my book, trust is an overrated commodity.
Starbuck Mmm, that one Ill drink to.
Kat Frak you guys.
Starbuck What is your problem, Katraine?
Kat My problem is you, Captain. And all this us against them crap.
Starbuck_laughing Truth hurts, doesnt it. Gimme another one.
Kat you know what, Starbuck? Whatever happened to you down there, why dont you take it out on the Cylons,cause we busted our ass to get you off that rock.
Tigh Do you think that means anything? Every colonist that landed on New Caprica was loyal, to a point. It was amazing watching those people that you thought you knew go over to the Cylons.
Starbuck At least in the end, we knew where we stood, huh?
Tigh Is that so? Then how come you are off flight duty, and some Cylon lover is holding down my post? Dont kid yourselves, youre on your own in this life. Each and every one of us.
Kat Why dont you tell that to the pilots that died getting you off that rock?
Helo And Gaetas briefing Sharon and Racetrack on the scouting mission to the pulsars.
Adama You mean Athena and Racetrack.
Helo_proud Word travels fast.
Adama Yes, it does. I understand that morales taken a hit on the flight deck.
Helo Nothing we cant handle, sir.
Adama Im also told that Colonel Tigh is spending a lot of time down in the pilots rec room.
Helo Both him and Starbuck, sir. Theyve been holding court. Second-guessing the rescue, bad-mouthing the crew that stayed up with Galactica. Suddenly, if you werent in the ground war, its like you cant be trusted.
Adama People are listening.
Helo Your word carries a lot of weight. Youre right, theyre destroying morale and unit cohesion.
Adama They both know better.
Helo I dont think they care, sir.

Baltar do you have any idea what its talking about?
Caprica No. Most Cylons think the conscious mind of the Hybrid has simply gone mad, and the vocalizations we hear are meaningless.
Baltar But not everyone thinks that.
Hybrid Thank you genesis turns ...
Caprica The ones you know as Leoben believe that every word out of her mouth means something. That God literally speaks to us through her.
Baltar She sort of controls the baseship, does she?
Caprica Well, she is the baseship, in a very real sense.
Baltar Mind gone mad.
Caprica She experiences life very differently than we do, Gaius. She swims in the heavens... laughs at stars, breathes in cosmic dust. Maybe Leobens right. Maybe she does see God...
Hybrid ...they cry for succor in the dark of the light.
Caprica Were wasting time.
Hybrid_louder ...Jump!
Baltar_on_comms There are bodies everywhere. Others dying.
Baltar What the hell is that? Definitely man-made.
Baltar Youre severely dehydrated. You must drink some water.
Six Kill me.
Baltar You dont understand. There is no resurrection ship nearby. You will not be downloaded into a new body. You will just be gone.
Six_weeping I saw how they died. Please -- please, I cant bear that.
Baltar_panicking Im here to bring help. All right? Im just gonna take some blood samples for analysis on the baseship. And then we will be able to make a treatment for the disease.
Baltar You must breathe. Please. Please take some water.
Six Youre -- youre from Galactica.
Baltar No. Im from a baseship. Tell me... do you know what this is?
Six We found it floating at these coordinates. Must be some kind of...beacon... or marker.
Baltar It looks too old. It looks very old.
Six Mustve been left by the 13th tribe. Infected, poisoned. Left by some humans like you to destroy us.
Baltar What?
Six A human device filled with a pestilence. You sent us to this place.
Baltar It wasnt me.
Six You know wed bring it aboard.
Baltar You dont know what youre saying. This is the disease speaking through you. Calm down. I am going to bring help.
Six You knew it was here.
Baltar Now, shush. Shush. I would never do anything to hurt you.
Six You and the other baseships knew it was here.
Baltar I am going to bring help. Be quiet. Be quiet. Im going to bring help.
Six You want to destroy us all. Its your fault! You lie to them.
Baltar Shut up!
Six You lie to them.
Baltar Shut up!
Six Youll bring them here.
Baltar Be quiet! Be quiet! Shut up!
Six Youre gonna infect all of us!
Baltar Be quiet. Shut up! Aaaaaaah! Shut up!
Doral_on_comms Gaius, do you hear us? Gaius, do you read? Is anyone alive? Speak to us. Do you read? What do you see? Are any of them alive?
Baltar This is Gaius Baltar. Im returning to the baseship.
Doral What do you see?
Baltar_staring_at_the_beacon I see nothing. Nothing of consequence. Theres nothing left to do here.
Three Nobody likes it, but we have to make a terrible choice. Do we attempt a rescue, and risk the lives of our Fleet -- even our species -- or do we leave them?
Simon The answer wont be found in science, because theres no cure in science.
Eight Well, there has to be.
Six Look at them, do we just leave them?
Leoben Then theyre condemned to death.
Six Even the humans dont leave their own.
Leoben They must be sacrificed for the greater good.
Simon There is a greater question.
Three Yes, there is. How did this happen?
Simon Baltar.
Doral Its Baltar, of course. Its his fault. He led us there deliberately. Hes been working with Galactica the whole time.
Baltar It wasnt me. Whatever you think I did, I didnt do it, honestly!
Three Baltar, we followed your coordinates, and found a disease with no treatment or cure.
Caprica ...Theyre doomed. Never to return.
Doral Perhaps God would smile upon us for our mercy.
Eight Oh, listen to you. You can barely even speak His name.
Three We have to agree. We are not abandoning our brothers and sisters ...
Baltar Listen to me! Im totally and utterly innocent!
Three Stop! We have to leave them. We have to jump, and leave them to their fate. There is no other way.
Doral The Hybrid objects.
Three She doesnt get a vote. Jump the ship.
Hybrid Jump.
Three This disease... it mustve come from someplace. So what did you notice on the infected ship?
Baltar Nothing. Nothing. I am just as baffled as you are.
Three You noticed nothing suspicious on the infected ship?
Baltar Nothing whatsoever.
Pilot Admiral on deck!
Tigh Admiral.
Adama Give me the room.
Adama Stay in your seat.
Tigh Have a drink?
Adama Give me your sidearm.
Starbuck ...What?
Adama Your sidearm.
Tigh Hey, theres a live round in that.
Adama Now one of you, and I dont care who, pick that weapon up and shoot me.
Starbuck Admiral, I dont know --
Adama I didnt say to talk. Youve done enough of that already. I said to pick up that weapon, and shoot. Whats the matter? No guts? You dont got a pair? Youre both frakking cowards.
Tigh Watch your mouth...
Adama Or what? You going to turn the rest of my pilots against each other? Poison the crew? Youve already done that, Saul. Both of you.
Starbuck Yeah, well, if youre looking for an apology, it isnt gonna happen....
Adama You were like a daughter to me once. No more. Youre malcontented, and a cancer. And I wont have you on my ship. So you have a choice. You figure out how to become a human being again, and an officer, or you can find another place to live. Off of this ship. Youre dismissed.
Tigh Are you gonna kick me out of my chair too?
Adama Listen, I know youve been through a lot.
Tigh Dont patronize me. Say what you came here to say.
Adama Youre full of bile, hatred. And I know that it has something to do with Ellen. And Im sorry for that. And if you need time, Saul, well, you take all the time you want. But I gotta run a ship. The last thing I need is a one-eyed drunk sitting down here sowing discontent and disobedience. So Ill tell you once again, Saul. You can pick up that weapon and kill me...or you can get your ass back into your quarters, and not leave until youre ready to act like the man that Ive known for the past thirty years.
Tigh That man doesnt exist anymore, Bill. And you wont be seeing me again.
Racetrack Oh, my Gods, its right there. The lions head nebula, and the blinking eye. Holy crap, its the road to Earth!
Racetrack Oh, my Gods. Lets get the frak out of here. Ill start the jump.
Athena_panicked When Gods anger awakens, even the mighty shall fall...
Racetrack Frak, Athena, we need to get out of here!
