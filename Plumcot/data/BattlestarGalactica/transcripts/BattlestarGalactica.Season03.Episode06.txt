dr_gaius_baltar Previously, on
lt_sharon_valerii I, Sharon Agathon, will carry out the lawful orders of my superiors as an officer in the Colonial Fleet.
admiral_william_adama Congratulations, Lieutenant.
president_laura_roslin Were talking about people blowing themselves up.
colonel_saul_tigh Ive got one job here, lady, and one job only -- to disrupt the Cylons. Make them worry about the anthill theyve stirred up down here, so theyre distracted and out of position when the old man shows up in orbit.
admiral_william_adama You know the mission. You should also know theres only one way that this mission ends, and thats with the successful rescue of our people off of New Caprica.
danna_biers Evacuate the entire facility. You should go as well, Gaius. Theres a place for you too.
chief_galen_tyrol Captain? Hi. Whos this?
captain_kara_thrace This is ...
julia Kacey! Oh, my little girl. When the Cylons took her, I thought... But you saved her. Gods bless you!
colonel_saul_tigh A lot of good people had to pay the price for what they did. Choices they made on New Caprica. Like my wife. Thats right, Ellen collaborated. Gave the Cylons information on the Resistance, and she died for it.
dr_gaius_baltar I cant believe theres still a question of my value.
danna_biers There will always be a question. Youre human.
dr_gaius_baltar Good to see you. I far prefer these picturesque settings for little our interludes, dont you? I thought you had abandoned me to your Cylon comrades.
number_six Would I do that?
dr_gaius_baltar Youve always been more unpredictable than your flesh and blood counterparts.
number_six A man that loves women as much as you should have learned that a long time ago.
dr_gaius_baltar Im a slow learner.
number_six Then take this period as a time to learn all you can about the Cylons. Youll need it in the days ahead.
dr_gaius_baltar Something special on the horizon?
number_six Cylon psychology is based on projection.
dr_gaius_baltar Projection?
number_six Its how they choose to see the world around them. The only difference is, you choose to see me.
dr_gaius_baltar What are you... really? Youre either connected to the woman I knew in Caprica ... or youre just a damaged part of my subconscious struggling for self-expression, so which one is it?
number_six Im an angel of God sent here to help you. Just as I always have been.
danna_biers Were all part of one big ecosystem.
dr_gaius_baltar Yes, I can feel it. Breathing.
danna_biers Get used to it.
number_six So, whatd he say?
danna_biers I havent asked him yet.
dr_gaius_baltar Asked me about what?
number_six Earth.
dr_gaius_baltar Uh... What, uh...
danna_biers Earth. Its the 13th colony.
number_six Do you know how to find it?
dr_gaius_baltar Not really, no.
danna_biers Well, thats unfortunate. There was a hope -- my hope -- that if you knew the way to Earth, it would justify keeping you alive a little longer. Come on, Six.
dr_gaius_baltar Wait. Wait, wait! Now when I say that I do not know exactly where Earth is, that is not to say that I do not know a very great deal about its probable location. Honestly, I spent hours, days, weeks, months and months on a map that Adama and Roslin found on Kobol. And I correlated that with astrometric observations. I doubt anyone here can make the same claim.
number_six Well get back to you.
dr_gaius_baltar What do you care about finding Earth?
number_six Because were looking for it.
dr_gaius_baltar You are.
danna_biers Yes, weve decided that Earths going to be our new home.
captain_karl_agathon ship-to-ship training exercise is authorized. You may commence when ready.
cpt_lee_adama This is Apollo. Red team set.
louanne_katraine Blue team set.
cpt_lee_adama Red team, Apollo. As soon as we clear the moon, were gonna be on their dradis, so keep your eyes up. Theyre gonna hit us with everything they got. Stay in formation, Starbuck. Nacho, youre my wingman.
louanne_katraine Blue team, Kat. Lets show these lazy fraks how its done.
captain_kara_thrace Red team, Starbuck. I got Hotdog.
Hotdog#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode06 Im hit!
cpt_lee_adama Red team, Apollo. Im going after Kat.
cpt_lee_adama Got you.
louanne_katraine Whoo! Youre gonna have to do better than that, Apollo. Come on!
captain_kara_thrace Ill take care of Kat.
cpt_lee_adama Starbuck, you stay in formation. Nacho has Kat.
captain_kara_thrace Inbound.
louanne_katraine Starbuck, youre too close.
cpt_lee_adama Frak!
chief_galen_tyrol Compressor blew. Looks like it threw a blade, severed the fuel line. Cally, check the tank. Gods, this is ugly.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson The tanks bone dry. Theres not even fumes in here.
chief_galen_tyrol Captain, howd you land this thing?
captain_kara_thrace Pointed it toward the deck, and stopped when I got here.
Hotdog_quietly_to_Kat#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode06 Bone dry, she says. Landed the bird without a drop of fuel.
cpt_lee_adama If you want to die, I will open up an airlock for you, but you are not taking one of my Vipers with you!
captain_kara_thrace The birds on the deck. Im on the deck. I dont know what youre bitching about.
cpt_lee_adama I dont give a frak what you do, Starbuck, youre done flying.
Ellen#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode06 I cant believe you did that to me.
colonel_saul_tigh What?
Ellen#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode06 Dont look at me like that!
colonel_saul_tigh Oh, my Gods. Ellen? Ellen?
colonel_saul_tigh Excuse me. Excuse me. Hey, make a hole. Ellen?
Woman#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode06 If Ive told you once, Ive told you a thousand times...
colonel_saul_tigh Ellen, Im right here.
Woman#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode06 What is this? Let go of me.
kacey Kara, Kara!
captain_kara_thrace Kacey?
kacey Kara, Kara!
julia Captain Thrace? Im sorry, dont you remember me? Im Julia. Im Kaceys mom?
captain_kara_thrace Yeah. Yeah, I remember.
kacey Give me a hug.
julia Weve been staying over in the ... Well, everyones calling it Camp Oilslick, part of the hangar deck? And theyve put up cots for, you know, refugees...
captain_kara_thrace Yeah, I heard.
julia Well, Kaceys been asking to see you for days. I sent messages. I thought, you know, maybe youd come for a visit...
captain_kara_thrace You seem like a really nice person, so Im gonna be honest with you. The last thing I need is a two-year-old friend. And Kacey sure as hell does not need me in her life, so do us both a favor and do not bring her around here again, okay?
captain_kara_thrace Go to your mom, Kase.
julia Sure. Sorry, dont let us keep you up.
julia Sorry, honey, we gotta go.
cpt_lee_adama There it goes.
captain_karl_agathon Thats it. See? See, I told you you could do it! You did great.
cpt_lee_adama Remind me never to let that happen again.
captain_karl_agathon You got it, Slim.
cpt_lee_adama Ever.
lt_felix_gaeta Ive been trying to reassemble President Balt --
president_laura_roslin Im curious, Mr. Gaeta. What is it that you trust about Dr. Baltars research? How do you know its not another one of his lies?
lt_felix_gaeta If there was one thing I learned about Baltar, it was his extraordinary capacity for self-preservation. I think he wanted to find Earth because he wanted to get there.
president_laura_roslin How far did he get with his research?
lt_felix_gaeta Well, as you can see, Im still hacking through his notes. But it appears that he was trying to correlate our own astrometric readings with the map of constellations that we found back on Kobol, and apply his findings to certain select passages within the Scroll of Pythia.
admiral_william_adama Why the Scroll of Pythia?
president_laura_roslin Pythia is supposed to have chronicled the original journey of the 13th Tribe on its way to Earth.
lt_felix_gaeta If I can draw your attention to this passage: And the caravan of the heavens was watched over by a great lion with a mighty blinking eye...
admiral_william_adama ...Red and blue.
lt_felix_gaeta Exactly.
admiral_william_adama Exactly what? Youre looking for a lions head?
president_laura_roslin With a mighty blinking eye.
admiral_william_adama Blinking.
president_laura_roslin Well, theyre Scrolls. They speak in metaphors.
lt_felix_gaeta Initially, I thought the doctor might be off his meds as well, sir. But then I found this note here, where he had written blinking equals pulsar.
president_laura_roslin That means a star, right?
lt_felix_gaeta Uh, plural, actually. Theyre the rotating cores of dead stars? They emit a blast of radio waves. From a distance, they appear to --
president_laura_roslin Blink.
lt_felix_gaeta Right. The doctor found two in very close mutual orbit within this sector. Uh, the spectrographic readings that I found show one will appear to be red, and one will appear to be blue. Now... these pulsars appear to be in this nebula. We have never had a direct look at this area. But it is possible, with a couple of eyeballs out there, they might look at the nebula and see --
admiral_william_adama A giant lions head.
president_laura_roslin Well, it looks like this is the best thing weve got going, so ... Unless you object, Admiral, I suggest we go lion hunting.
number_six The navigational markers you gave us may prove useful. They sent a baseship out to investigate the pulsars, and look for this lions head of yours.
dr_gaius_baltar Look, this isnt easy for me. I dont think you fully appreciate just how difficult this is! I have very conflicted, very ambiguous feelings about helping you find Earth.
number_six Funny how all that ambivalence and conflict seemed to vanish once you thought your life hung in the balance.
number_six You should know theres still a lot of skepticism about whether youre being entirely truthful.
Eight#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode06 Im very sorry. We didnt mean to intrude.
number_six Come on, Gaius.
dr_gaius_baltar are we going round in circles?
number_six Im sure it all looks the same to you, doesnt it? Be hard for any human to navigate around here. Especially without projecting.
dr_gaius_baltar Yes, youve used that word before and Im not quite sure what youre talking about. It helps you to what, exactly?
number_six Have you ever daydreamed... and imagined that you were somewhere else?
dr_gaius_baltar I do have an active imagination.
number_six Well, we dont have to imagine. We project. We choose to see our environment in any form we wish, whenever we wish. For instance, right now you see us as standing in a hallway, but I see it as a forest.
number_six Filled with trees, birds, sunlight...
dr_gaius_baltar Like the walks that you and I used to take. on Caprica.
number_six The aesthetic is what gives me pleasure. Not the specific memories.
number_six Instead of staring at blank walls, I choose to surround myself with a vision of Gods creation.
dr_gaius_baltar Right, now I think I understand projection, but its a bit of a coincidence, isnt it? That I could see such a vivid reality that Ive created, and the Cylon projection experience seems to be so similar?
number_six Is it a coincidence?
dr_gaius_baltar Well, what are you saying? Theres a connection? What, because of my experiences with you --
number_six ...
dr_gaius_baltar Oh, nothing. Just talking out loud. ...Silly me.
racetrack So you sure you want to go in the second seat again? I mean, I hear youre a pretty fair pilot now.
racetrack Well, too many Pilots, not enough birds. Anything to keep me flying, at this point. You want me Im yours, Boomer.
lt_sharon_valerii Uh, no, Boomer was... She was someone else.
captain_karl_agathon Listen up. We need a new call sign for Lieutenant Agathon.
Pilots#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode06 Chrome Dome! Titania! Lightbulb! Wind-up Toy! Raptor Adapter! Microchip! Digital Dame! Mayflower! Carburetor! Tincan! Toaster Babe! Transistor! Robopilot!
Hotdog#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode06 How about Athena?
captain_karl_agathon Wait, wait, wait, wait. What was that?
Hotdog#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode06 You know, the Goddess of Wisdom and War. Usually accompanied by the Goddess of Victory?
A_Pilot_quietly#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode06 She likes it.
captain_karl_agathon Athena it is!
racetrack Hey, Colonel! Colonel, come have a seat. Over here.
colonel_saul_tigh Enough of that to go around?
captain_kara_thrace Always.
louanne_katraine Oh, yeah.
colonel_saul_tigh Dead Mans Chest? Cutthroat game. Not usually your style.
captain_kara_thrace It is now. And Im in it to win. You dont like it, find another game.
captain_kara_thrace Frakkin civilians think they run the ship now.
A_Pilot#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode06 Beats what we had before. The ship was like a tomb.
colonel_saul_tigh You want to know what alone feels like, try spending a few weeks in a Cylon holding cell.
louanne_katraine Yeah, it was a bitch on both sides. And it wasnt exactly easy coming up with a plan to save your sorry butts.
captain_kara_thrace You guys had it rough, huh? Hot showers, three squares a day. Viper jocks didnt even take a shot till you jumped into orbit.
captain_karl_agathon Hey... we all made sacrifices.
colonel_saul_tigh Is that so?
captain_karl_agathon Yes, thats right.
colonel_saul_tigh While you were pinning wings on your Cylon girlfriend, and our people were strapping homemade bombs to their chests. Doing whatever they could to take the bastards out. So forgive me if I dont get all misty over your sacrifices.
number_six You seem distracted, Gaius.
dr_gaius_baltar Do I?
number_six You can rest easy, at least for now. The data on Earths location and your valiant rescue of the baby has gone a long way toward impressing the others.
number_six I used to think you and I would have a baby one day.
dr_gaius_baltar There are only twelve Cylon models. But in the entire occupation on New Caprica, I only saw seven. Now here again, the same seven. Who are the final five?
number_six I cant talk about that.
dr_gaius_baltar Cant or wont?
number_six I cant. Its complicated, but we dont talk about them. Ever.
dr_gaius_baltar But youd know one of them, wouldnt you, if you saw them? one of the final five. If they were to walk past here right --
danna_biers Six, we have a problem.
aaron_doral A baseship. The one we sent to investigate the pulsars in the lion nebula. Weve lost contact.
danna_biers The trouble is we know almost nothing about the missing baseships status.
aaron_doral We received a garbled distress call, then silence. Not surprisingly, their Hybrid sent us a confusing set of data. Our Hybrid is analyzing it.
dr_gaius_baltar What are these Hybrids hes talking about?
number_six Be quiet, Gaius.
Eight#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode06 Our Hybrids deciphered part of the data set that we received from our scout ship.
aaron_doral this cant happen to us. Its impossible.
simon It is not only possible, it may have been inevitable, once we took human form.
aaron_doral were not human. Were not like them.
simon God has chosen this time, this place, to test us. Whether we fail or pass the test is up to us.
dr_gaius_baltar Whats going on?
number_six The missing baseship, its been infected by some kind of disease.
dr_gaius_baltar Disease?
Eight#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode06 Yes, its killing them. All of them.
simon If an infected Cylon dies, and carries this disease with them into a resurrection ship, it could rapidly spread, potentially infecting our entire race.
danna_biers All right, we make sure that the resurrection ship is out of range, then we jump to their location. Send in a group of Centurions to make sure...
Eight#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode06 No. The data set indicates that as soon as the Hybrid was infected, the Centurions started shutting down. We dont know how ours are gonna be affected.
danna_biers I assume our Raiders and baseships are also susceptible.
simon Of course. We are all created from the same genetic pool.
aaron_doral Then no Cylon can board that ship without risking infection.
number_six Say youll go aboard the infected baseship, and investigate what happened. You sent them to that nebula. Remember?
dr_gaius_baltar Are you mad?
number_six You have to prove to them you can be counted on in an emergency. Show them youre worth keeping alive.
dr_gaius_baltar And what if I catch the disease?
number_six What are the chances that a human could catch something that infects a Centurion or a Raider? That is, if youre human. And if youre really a Cylon -- one of the final five you havent seen yet -- then wouldnt you rather just get it over with and die?
dr_gaius_baltar Ill go.
danna_biers What?
dr_gaius_baltar Yes, Ill go. Look, I am a trained scientist. I can go to the baseship. I can make observations about the Cylons, their physical condition. Bring back information about this disease, which now threatens all of you.
simon We land, the disease thats killing the human Cylons could infect one of our Raiders as well.
dr_gaius_baltar Then dont send a raider. Surely the wars furbished you with some Colonial vessels.
Eight#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode06 Hes right. We could program one of our Raptors to approach on autopilot.
danna_biers All right, then prepare to jump the ship. Make sure the resurrection ship knows to stay behind, out of range.
dr_gaius_baltar A truly ... selfless act.
colonel_saul_tigh I could use a refill here.
Hotdog#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode06 Here. Heres to knowing ... that somebody will always have your back.
Pilots#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode06 Yeah!
colonel_saul_tigh The sentiments good, but in my book, trust is an overrated commodity.
captain_kara_thrace Mmm, that one Ill drink to.
louanne_katraine Frak you guys.
captain_kara_thrace What is your problem, Katraine?
louanne_katraine My problem is you, Captain. And all this us against them crap.
captain_kara_thrace Truth hurts, doesnt it. Gimme another one.
louanne_katraine you know what, Starbuck? Whatever happened to you down there, why dont you take it out on the Cylons,cause we busted our ass to get you off that rock.
colonel_saul_tigh Do you think that means anything? Every colonist that landed on New Caprica was loyal, to a point. It was amazing watching those people that you thought you knew go over to the Cylons.
captain_kara_thrace At least in the end, we knew where we stood, huh?
colonel_saul_tigh Is that so? Then how come you are off flight duty, and some Cylon lover is holding down my post? Dont kid yourselves, youre on your own in this life. Each and every one of us.
louanne_katraine Why dont you tell that to the pilots that died getting you off that rock?
captain_karl_agathon And Gaetas briefing Sharon and Racetrack on the scouting mission to the pulsars.
admiral_william_adama You mean Athena and Racetrack.
captain_karl_agathon Word travels fast.
admiral_william_adama Yes, it does. I understand that morales taken a hit on the flight deck.
captain_karl_agathon Nothing we cant handle, sir.
admiral_william_adama Im also told that Colonel Tigh is spending a lot of time down in the pilots rec room.
captain_karl_agathon Both him and Starbuck, sir. Theyve been holding court. Second-guessing the rescue, bad-mouthing the crew that stayed up with Galactica. Suddenly, if you werent in the ground war, its like you cant be trusted.
admiral_william_adama People are listening.
captain_karl_agathon Your word carries a lot of weight. Youre right, theyre destroying morale and unit cohesion.
admiral_william_adama They both know better.
captain_karl_agathon I dont think they care, sir.

dr_gaius_baltar do you have any idea what its talking about?
number_six No. Most Cylons think the conscious mind of the Hybrid has simply gone mad, and the vocalizations we hear are meaningless.
dr_gaius_baltar But not everyone thinks that.
the_hybrid Thank you genesis turns ...
number_six The ones you know as Leoben believe that every word out of her mouth means something. That God literally speaks to us through her.
dr_gaius_baltar She sort of controls the baseship, does she?
number_six Well, she is the baseship, in a very real sense.
dr_gaius_baltar Mind gone mad.
number_six She experiences life very differently than we do, Gaius. She swims in the heavens... laughs at stars, breathes in cosmic dust. Maybe Leobens right. Maybe she does see God...
the_hybrid ...they cry for succor in the dark of the light.
number_six Were wasting time.
the_hybrid ...Jump!
dr_gaius_baltar There are bodies everywhere. Others dying.
dr_gaius_baltar What the hell is that? Definitely man-made.
dr_gaius_baltar Youre severely dehydrated. You must drink some water.
number_six Kill me.
dr_gaius_baltar You dont understand. There is no resurrection ship nearby. You will not be downloaded into a new body. You will just be gone.
number_six I saw how they died. Please -- please, I cant bear that.
dr_gaius_baltar Im here to bring help. All right? Im just gonna take some blood samples for analysis on the baseship. And then we will be able to make a treatment for the disease.
dr_gaius_baltar You must breathe. Please. Please take some water.
number_six Youre -- youre from Galactica.
dr_gaius_baltar No. Im from a baseship. Tell me... do you know what this is?
number_six We found it floating at these coordinates. Must be some kind of...beacon... or marker.
dr_gaius_baltar It looks too old. It looks very old.
number_six Mustve been left by the 13th tribe. Infected, poisoned. Left by some humans like you to destroy us.
dr_gaius_baltar What?
number_six A human device filled with a pestilence. You sent us to this place.
dr_gaius_baltar It wasnt me.
number_six You know wed bring it aboard.
dr_gaius_baltar You dont know what youre saying. This is the disease speaking through you. Calm down. I am going to bring help.
number_six You knew it was here.
dr_gaius_baltar Now, shush. Shush. I would never do anything to hurt you.
number_six You and the other baseships knew it was here.
dr_gaius_baltar I am going to bring help. Be quiet. Be quiet. Im going to bring help.
number_six You want to destroy us all. Its your fault! You lie to them.
dr_gaius_baltar Shut up!
number_six You lie to them.
dr_gaius_baltar Shut up!
number_six Youll bring them here.
dr_gaius_baltar Be quiet! Be quiet! Shut up!
number_six Youre gonna infect all of us!
dr_gaius_baltar Be quiet. Shut up! Aaaaaaah! Shut up!
aaron_doral Gaius, do you hear us? Gaius, do you read? Is anyone alive? Speak to us. Do you read? What do you see? Are any of them alive?
dr_gaius_baltar This is Gaius Baltar. Im returning to the baseship.
aaron_doral What do you see?
dr_gaius_baltar I see nothing. Nothing of consequence. Theres nothing left to do here.
danna_biers Nobody likes it, but we have to make a terrible choice. Do we attempt a rescue, and risk the lives of our Fleet -- even our species -- or do we leave them?
simon The answer wont be found in science, because theres no cure in science.
Eight#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode06 Well, there has to be.
number_six Look at them, do we just leave them?
leoben_conoy Then theyre condemned to death.
number_six Even the humans dont leave their own.
leoben_conoy They must be sacrificed for the greater good.
simon There is a greater question.
danna_biers Yes, there is. How did this happen?
simon Baltar.
aaron_doral Its Baltar, of course. Its his fault. He led us there deliberately. Hes been working with Galactica the whole time.
dr_gaius_baltar It wasnt me. Whatever you think I did, I didnt do it, honestly!
danna_biers Baltar, we followed your coordinates, and found a disease with no treatment or cure.
number_six ...Theyre doomed. Never to return.
aaron_doral Perhaps God would smile upon us for our mercy.
Eight#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode06 Oh, listen to you. You can barely even speak His name.
danna_biers We have to agree. We are not abandoning our brothers and sisters ...
dr_gaius_baltar Listen to me! Im totally and utterly innocent!
danna_biers Stop! We have to leave them. We have to jump, and leave them to their fate. There is no other way.
aaron_doral The Hybrid objects.
danna_biers She doesnt get a vote. Jump the ship.
the_hybrid Jump.
danna_biers This disease... it mustve come from someplace. So what did you notice on the infected ship?
dr_gaius_baltar Nothing. Nothing. I am just as baffled as you are.
danna_biers You noticed nothing suspicious on the infected ship?
dr_gaius_baltar Nothing whatsoever.
Pilot#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode06 Admiral on deck!
colonel_saul_tigh Admiral.
admiral_william_adama Give me the room.
admiral_william_adama Stay in your seat.
colonel_saul_tigh Have a drink?
admiral_william_adama Give me your sidearm.
captain_kara_thrace ...What?
admiral_william_adama Your sidearm.
colonel_saul_tigh Hey, theres a live round in that.
admiral_william_adama Now one of you, and I dont care who, pick that weapon up and shoot me.
captain_kara_thrace Admiral, I dont know --
admiral_william_adama I didnt say to talk. Youve done enough of that already. I said to pick up that weapon, and shoot. Whats the matter? No guts? You dont got a pair? Youre both frakking cowards.
colonel_saul_tigh Watch your mouth...
admiral_william_adama Or what? You going to turn the rest of my pilots against each other? Poison the crew? Youve already done that, Saul. Both of you.
captain_kara_thrace Yeah, well, if youre looking for an apology, it isnt gonna happen....
admiral_william_adama You were like a daughter to me once. No more. Youre malcontented, and a cancer. And I wont have you on my ship. So you have a choice. You figure out how to become a human being again, and an officer, or you can find another place to live. Off of this ship. Youre dismissed.
colonel_saul_tigh Are you gonna kick me out of my chair too?
admiral_william_adama Listen, I know youve been through a lot.
colonel_saul_tigh Dont patronize me. Say what you came here to say.
admiral_william_adama Youre full of bile, hatred. And I know that it has something to do with Ellen. And Im sorry for that. And if you need time, Saul, well, you take all the time you want. But I gotta run a ship. The last thing I need is a one-eyed drunk sitting down here sowing discontent and disobedience. So Ill tell you once again, Saul. You can pick up that weapon and kill me...or you can get your ass back into your quarters, and not leave until youre ready to act like the man that Ive known for the past thirty years.
colonel_saul_tigh That man doesnt exist anymore, Bill. And you wont be seeing me again.
racetrack Oh, my Gods, its right there. The lions head nebula, and the blinking eye. Holy crap, its the road to Earth!
racetrack Oh, my Gods. Lets get the frak out of here. Ill start the jump.
lt_sharon_valerii When Gods anger awakens, even the mighty shall fall...
racetrack Frak, Athena, we need to get out of here!
