Helo Previously, on
Baltar Some people in the Fleet believe that the legend of Earth held perhaps the greatest promise for our survival.
Caprica Do you know how to find it?
Baltar Not really, no.
Three There was a hope -- my hope -- that if you knew the way to Earth it would justify keeping you alive a little longer.
Baltar Now when I say that I do not know exactly where Earth is, that is not to say that I do not know a very great deal about its probable location.
Leoben A baseship, the one we sent to investigate the pulsars in the Lion Nebula, weve lost contact.
Six The missing baseship, its been infected by some kind of disease.
Simon If an infected cylon dies and carries this disease with them into a resurrection ship, it could rapidly spread, potentially infecting our entire race. If one of us is resurrected, the disease will follow.
Doral Then no cylon can board that ship without risking infection.
Baltar Ill go. Yes, Ill go. I can go to the baseship. I can make observations about the Cylons, their physical condition, bring back information about this disease which now threatens all of you.
Baltar Do you know what this is?
Six Must be some kind of beacon left by the Thirteenth Tribe. The beacon carried the disease, left by some humans like you to destroy us.
Three You noticed nothing suspicious on the infected ship?
Baltar Nothing whatsoever. I am just as baffled as you are.
Racetrack Just like the scriptures say. There it is. The Lions Head nebula and the blinking eye... Holy crap! Its the road to Earth!
Apollo This is combat. Prepped and ready, Plan A. Were approaching the baseship.
Athena This is just so wrong.
Apollo What the hell happened here?
Athena Whatever this is, its something new.
Adama Go.
Helo Apollo,
Apollo Roger that,
Athena Hang on, guys.
Helo_on_comms Use extreme caution, Apollo.
Six What the hell?
Racetrack Gods, what happened here?
Gunny_Mathias I dont know, but their frakking resurrection ship is gonna overheat.
Apollo Sharon. Athena! See what you can pick up with the computers.
Mathias Three fireteams, each doorway. Go.
Athena_putting_her_hands_in_the_basestars_data_port_gel Okay, Im gonna try to call up the database. If I get a connection, put the SSR leads in the water over there. Reduce the error correction level for higher throughput.
Racetrack You sure you want to do that?
Athena_accessing_the_database Its how it works.
Athena Oh!
Hotdog You okay?
Athena_shaken Uh, yeah, the datapoints are almost completely corroded. I dont know if Im gonna get much out of here, but lets try.
Apollo What is going on? Frak me! This ones alive! Weve got a live one over there!
Mathias Danelli, Peters, cover the Major!
Apollo Theyre alive!
Helo Are you taking fire?
Apollo_on_comms Negative, negative. They seem in pretty bad shape.
Helo Dont take chances. They make any threatening moves --
Apollo Oh, you can trust me on that one.
Leoben Heavenly Father...
Mathias Major, what do we do? Should we take em out?
Apollo Hold your fire, hold your fire!
Six Heavenly Father...
Mathias keep away from the trackers!
Apollo I said hold your fire!
Cylons_moaning Grant us the strength ... the wisdom...
Apollo what are they doing?
Cylons ...And above all...a measure of acceptance.
Apollo Hey, Athena, what are you doing? Athena! Athena!
Cylons The strength... the wisdom...
Eight_to_Athena Traitor. Save yourself.
Athena From what?
Six Get away from us.
Athena What happened here?
Six A beacon. We brought it aboard. Carried disease. Were infected.
Athena Infected?
Mathias Oh, son of a bitch!
Apollo Okay, okay, okay! Settle down! Keep back! Watch the doorways. Get the doorways!
Doc_Cottle Theyll have to come aboard under quarantine procedures. Clear a path from the hangar deck to sickbay and sterilize it. And the Raptors after theyre in.
Gaeta_leaving Ill handle that.
Dualla How long will they have to stay in quarantine?
Cottle I wont know that until I do the blood work. Could be days, weeks. Theres no way to tell. You said they picked up this disease from a beacon?
Adama According to the Cylons.
Cottle Always good to have the source of the pathogen. Can you bring it aboard
Adama No, too dangerous. I want to limit our exposure.
Cottle What about the prisoners?
Helo Prisoners?
Cottle The disease is more advanced in their systems, so itll give at least an idea of what to expect as it progresses. And when they die, itll tell me how long our people have to live.
Adama How many prisoners?
Cottle How many you got?
Helo_on_comms Apollo,
Apollo Holy frak, what was that?
Gaeta Massive energy discharge from the baseship. It exploded, sir.
Helo Apollo,
Apollo Uh, yeah, affirmative. Were still here. What the hell happened?
Helo Baseship exploded. Must have self-destructed. You guys are lucky you got out when you did.
Apollo Roger that.
Baltar Nothing the matter, I trust?
Caprica We have some questions.
Three How long have you planned to betray us, Gaius?
Baltar_laughing Funny.
Baltar Youre joking, of course.
Caprica Youre only making this harder on yourself.
Baltar Wait a minute. I have been more than very accommodating since I arrived here. I helped you find Sharons baby. Ive helped you with a map towards Earth.
Three We know about the beacon, Gaius.
Caprica You knew it was out there. You knew it contained a deadly virus.
Baltar No, I didnt. I didnt. Thats not --
Caprica Was the virus created by
Three have you been in contact with them since youve been onboard? Or did you plan this before the evacuation of New Caprica?
Baltar_calmly This is a most profound misunderstanding. Uh, I had nothing to do with the virus or the beacon. Yes. Yes, I did discover it on the baseship. And I should have told you about it sooner, and I didnt. Um, because I thought, you know, you-- youd try and link me, you know, to the virus....
Caprica Im sorry, Gaius.
Three Things would have been so much simpler had you only told the truth. We think you know more about this virus, and we intend to find out.
Six Relax. Have a drink.
Baltar I cant.
Six Its all in your head, Gaius. Pain, pleasure. Theyre just neural impulses sent to the brain. You decide how to interpret them. They can be pleasant. Or unpleasant.
Baltar_screaming No! No, please! Please!
Three I want it to stop, Gaius. I dont want you to feel this pain. And neither does Caprica, do you?
Caprica_crying No.
Baltar_exhausted I love you.
Hotdog you feel anything yet?
Racetrack Yeah, I feel sick. Sick of you buggin me.
Hotdog You didnt touch any infected skinjobs.
Racetrack Not my fault youre clumsy.
Hotdog You can kiss my infected ass.
Cottle_entering Well, you can kiss it, but its not infected. I got your blood work back. Humans are immune to the virus. Youre all healthy.
Apollo All right, people. Nice job. Lets get outta here.
Athena No. You stay put for a while.
Helo No, no, no, no, no, no. Please tell me shes okay.
Cottle I havent done her bloodwork yet.
Helo What? Oh, I see. She can wait because of who she isnt.
Helo_to_Cottle You come for me, Godsdamn it. You come for me the second you know.
Doral Take him. Hes the furthest gone.
Doral No, no, no, no.
Roslin You can keep the Cylons alive.
Cottle I cant cure them. But yes.
Adama How long?
Cottle Indefinitely. I identified the virus. We know it as lymphocytic encephalitis. The disease is carried by rodents. Rats, mostly. But a couple of hundred years ago, humans developed an immunity. Now I can create a simple vaccine that will dramatically reverse the effect of the virus on the Cylons. But, uh, they have an antibody in their blood which breaks down the RNA of the vaccine. So they will need regular, close-interval injections of the vaccine. Or they will die.
Apollo Can I ask the ugly question here? Is there a reason to keep them alive?
Helo We could interrogate them for intelligence.
Adama I agree. We have a lot of unanswered questions.
Apollo Yeah, okay. But theyre not gonna talk.
Roslin well, they might if we dangled the vaccine. They dont need to know its a stop-gap, not a cure.
Apollo They prayed on the infected ship. Karls wife said it was something called the prayer to the cloud of unknowing, whatever the hell that is. Anyway, the point is, she said they only use it when theyre facing an imminent death that is final. No possibility of downloading. Theyre ready to die.
Roslin They may be ready to die, but it doesnt mean that one of them wont jump at a second chance.
Simon_in_a_collar It infected everything. Baseship. Centurions. Raiders. Until we were finally abandoned by the other Cylon ships.
Apollo Why? Why not just put you under quarantine until they found a cure?
Simon_breathing_hard Fear of spreading the disease. They told us that there was a bioelectric feedback component to the pathogen. It corrupts how our brains manage our immune systems. If one of us dies and is resurrected, the disease will follow, infecting the resurrection ship, and the Fleet.
Adama Why were you in this area in the first place?
Simon We were sent. We were sent here to look for the Lion Nebula. Baltar said it would point the way to Earth.
Helo What did you just say?
Gaeta Baltar -- Baltars alive?
Simon Baltar is on our baseship. Hes helping us find Earth.
Adama Hes using our navigation charts. Along with our map from Kobol. Hes leading them to Earth.
Simon We want a new beginning. Much like you. I gave you information. She said that there was a cure.
Adama Doc Cottle will be giving you the medicine.
Cottle Take him back to the infirmary.
Adama What the hells so funny?
Apollo I think I just thought of a way to solve all of our problems. To get rid of the Cylon threat for once and for all. We can wipe em out. We can destroy the entire Cylon race.
Apollo We jump to an area we know the Cylons use as a supply line. NCD2539. We stay there, exposed; we look as if were spoiling for a fight. Theyll send their Fleet. And where theres a Fleet, theres a resurrection ship. And once the resurrection ship is within our reach, we execute our infected prisoners. We bug out. The executed prisoners download into the resurrection ship, and with them, the virus.
Roslin Youre sure the virus will download to a new body?
Apollo The Cylons are sure of it. They left their wounded out here to die alone with no hope of being rescued. Tells me all I need to know. And once the virus is in the resurrection ship, therell be no stopping it.
Adama Rescuers become carriers of the plague. Cylons themselves dont believe that theyll develop a cure.
Roslin Oh, my Gods. This could be the end of the Cylons entirely.
Apollo Forever.
Helo Genocide? So thats what were about now?
Apollo Theyre not human. They were built. Not born. No fathers, no mothers, no sons, no daughters --
Helo I had a daughter. I held her in my arms.
Apollo And she was half human. These are things. Dangerous things. This is our one chance to be rid of them.
Helo You can rationalize it any way you want. We do this... we wipe out their race... then were no different than they are.
Roslin Captain, I respectfully disagree. The Cylons struck first in this war and, not being content with the annihilation of billions of human beings, they pursued us relentlessly through the galaxies, determined to wipe us out.
Helo They tried to live with us on New Caprica.
Roslin ...What did you say?
Helo They tried to live with us on New Caprica.
Roslin You werent on New Caprica. To my recollection, you didnt set foot there. So out of respect for the hundreds of men and women on your crew who suffered through that snake pit, Im gonna pretend I didnt hear that. You would serve your Fleet well if youd remember occasionally that the Cylons are a mortal threat to the survival of the human race.
Helo Im talking about right and wrong. Im talking about losing a piece of our souls. No one wants to hear that, right? Lets keep it on me. Yeah, Im married to a Cylon. Who walked through hell for all of us how many times? And shes not half anything, okay. How do we know there arent others like her? She made a choice. Shes a person. Theyre a race of people. Wiping them out with a biological weapon is a crime against -- is a crime against humanity.
Apollo But theyre not human. Theyre programmed.
Roslin We will take your input under advisement. Thank you both.
Adama Dismissed.
Six_fugue I can help you. I can guide you through the torment and beyond, but youll have to do the work.
Baltar_gasping Ill do anything.
Three Then tell us what we want to know. How was the virus invented? Did they make a cure?
Baltar_in_the_interrogation I cant ... the pain --
Six_in_the_projection The pains only in your body. So keep your body here with me. Dont worry. Ill take care of it.
Three_turning_down_the_machine You see, Gaius, this is what the absence of pain feels like. Its easy to forget.
Baltar I had nothing to do with the virus. It was a coincidence.
Three Theres no such thing as coincidence. God wills the universe according to his design.
Six_begins_to_undress Now. Focus on her. As a Cylon, not a woman. Be a scientist. Examine her faith. Whats your analysis, doctor?
Baltar Im a scientist. And as a scientist, I believe that if God exists our knowledge of him is imperfect. Why?
Three Its called faith.
Baltar Absolute belief in Gods will means theres a reason for everything. Everything! And yet you cant help ask yourself how God can allow death and destruction and then despise yourself for asking. But the truth is, if we knew Gods will, wed all be Gods, wouldnt we? I can see it in your eyes, DAnna. Youre frustrated. Youre conflicted. Let me help you. Let me help you change. Find a way to reconcile your faith with fact. Find a way towards a rational universe.
Three I dont know what your game is, but its not going to work.
Six_in_the_projection_as_they_make_love Give your body to me. only your mind is there. Feel me. Feel this where she wants you to feel pain. Look at me. Look at me, Gaius. Do you want me to believe youre worth saving? Do you? Do you? Say it.
Baltar_in_the_interrogation I want you to believe in me. Dont stop! Dont stop! Please, please dont stop. You have to believe in me. Youre all I have left.
Six Now tell me you believe in me. Tell me you believe in my strength. Oh, God, say it!
Baltar_in_the_interrogation I believe in you! I believe in you.
Baltar_in_the_projection I love you. I love you with all my heart.
Baltar_in_the_interrogation I love you with all my heart.
Helo How?
Athena Cottle said it had something to do with carrying a half-human child. How the fetal blood cells enter the maternal circulatory system, causing the mother to create antibodies ... whatever. Im immune!
Helo Oh, my Gods.
Athena Our baby... saved my life. Shes gone forever, and she saved my life. Hera kept us together.
Helo Share this.
Athena_going_for_his_trousers This. You mean us? Together? You mean us?
Helo Them, them. I mean them.
Athena Whos them?
Helo Theyre gonna execute the infected prisoners. But not until we jump into a Cylon region with a resurrection ship present.
Helo The infections gonna spread everywhere.
Adama Theres a point Id like to make.
Roslin Mm-hmm?
Adama The law forbids me to use biological weapons without a direct presidential order.
Roslin Which means youre passing the buck.
Adama on this one, yes. Helos right on one thing. We start destroying entire races, even mechanical races, were liable to tear off a piece of mans soul.
Roslin The Cylons are coming to Earth. If they find us, they are coming for us. Those are the stakes. They always have been, bill.
Helo Were talking about the genocide of your entire race.
Athena_whimpering Yeah. You think I dont know that? I made a choice to wear a uniform. To be a person.
Helo You were a person before you put on that uniform. Okay? You were a person before I fell in love with you. You dont have to prove that.
Athena_angrily I have to prove it every day.
Adama Posterity really doesnt look too kindly on genocide.
Roslin Youre making an assumption that posterity will define this as genocide. If they do, at least therell be someone alive to hate us for it. The Cylons are our mistake, we created them. All right, Admiral Adama. As President, I have determined the Cylons be made extinct. The use of biological weapons is authorized.
Adama So say we all.
Roslin_laughing_softly ...So say we all.
Dualla Jump complete. Dradis is clear. No Cylons, sir.
Adama Theyll be here soon enough. Get our birds in the air.
Gaeta_over_PA Commence Viper and nav Raptor launch.
Athena Lets do this, Racetrack.
Pilots Lets go. Take up this bird. Move that.
Chief Get it out of the way. Go.
Pilots_and_Deck_Crew Lets go, lets go! Come on!
Racetrack CAP is away, nav bird has them on dradis.
Dualla Dradis contact. A pair of Cylon Raiders. Keeping their distance for now.
Adama Didnt take em that long. Theyre just scouts. Theyll jump away and report back to their Fleet. See if they take our bait.
Dualla Got em. Theres a resurrection ship with them.
Adama Then its time to execute our cylon prisoners. Call it in.
Gaeta_on_phone Terminate the prisoners.
Apollo Head shots, okay?
Mathias Yes, sir.
Apollo Lets do it.
Starbuck All right, lets see if we cant frak up some toasters on this joy ride, people.
Hotdog Bogies holding hands, Im notching like hell up here!
Starbuck Hotdog, Starbuck. Quit your bitchin and continue to cover as fragged.
Apollo Frak! Theyre already dead. Theyre already dead.
Gaeta Sir, you should hear this.
Apollo_on_comms They were dead before the resurrection ship was in range. They didnt download the disease. We missed our window.
Adama Call our birds in. Spool up. Lets get the hell outta here.
Gaeta Commence FTL. Sir, we lost time waiting to hear from quarantine. Were gonna take significant fire while we spool up.
Adama Continue jump. Take us back to our Fleet.
Gaeta Yes, sir.
Helo Theyll be coming for me. You or me.
Helo Seems like theyre always coming for one of us... Im not a traitor. I love my people. I love this ship. Besides you, the first thing I wanna see on any morning are the lights in that CIC. I did what I thought was right. If it was a mistake, fine. I can live with that. Its you I cant live without.
Roslin Hmm, no thanks.
Adama The prisoners died of asphyxiation. The air purification system was reversed. Sucked the oxygen out. When this happens, the deadbolts are automatically activated on the door. Someone did this manually.
Roslin Someone? Seems to me theres only one or two likely suspects. Who will head the investigation?
Adama No one. Im closing the book on this.
Roslin How convenient.
Roslin Somebody sneezed, maybe.
Adama Yeah, an entire race almost wiped out because someone forgot to wipe their nose.
Adama I think were on the right trail, Laura.
Roslin Yes, we are on the right trail, Bill. So are the Cylons.
