captain_karl_agathon Previously, on
dr_gaius_baltar Some people in the Fleet believe that the legend of Earth held perhaps the greatest promise for our survival.
number_six Do you know how to find it?
dr_gaius_baltar Not really, no.
danna_biers There was a hope -- my hope -- that if you knew the way to Earth it would justify keeping you alive a little longer.
dr_gaius_baltar Now when I say that I do not know exactly where Earth is, that is not to say that I do not know a very great deal about its probable location.
leoben_conoy A baseship, the one we sent to investigate the pulsars in the Lion Nebula, weve lost contact.
number_six The missing baseship, its been infected by some kind of disease.
simon If an infected cylon dies and carries this disease with them into a resurrection ship, it could rapidly spread, potentially infecting our entire race. If one of us is resurrected, the disease will follow.
aaron_doral Then no cylon can board that ship without risking infection.
dr_gaius_baltar Ill go. Yes, Ill go. I can go to the baseship. I can make observations about the Cylons, their physical condition, bring back information about this disease which now threatens all of you.
dr_gaius_baltar Do you know what this is?
number_six Must be some kind of beacon left by the Thirteenth Tribe. The beacon carried the disease, left by some humans like you to destroy us.
danna_biers You noticed nothing suspicious on the infected ship?
dr_gaius_baltar Nothing whatsoever. I am just as baffled as you are.
racetrack Just like the scriptures say. There it is. The Lions Head nebula and the blinking eye... Holy crap! Its the road to Earth!
cpt_lee_adama This is combat. Prepped and ready, Plan A. Were approaching the baseship.
lt_sharon_valerii This is just so wrong.
cpt_lee_adama What the hell happened here?
lt_sharon_valerii Whatever this is, its something new.
admiral_william_adama Go.
captain_karl_agathon Apollo,
cpt_lee_adama Roger that,
lt_sharon_valerii Hang on, guys.
captain_karl_agathon Use extreme caution, Apollo.
number_six What the hell?
racetrack Gods, what happened here?
sgt_erin_mathias I dont know, but their frakking resurrection ship is gonna overheat.
cpt_lee_adama Sharon. Athena! See what you can pick up with the computers.
sgt_erin_mathias Three fireteams, each doorway. Go.
lt_sharon_valerii Okay, Im gonna try to call up the database. If I get a connection, put the SSR leads in the water over there. Reduce the error correction level for higher throughput.
racetrack You sure you want to do that?
lt_sharon_valerii Its how it works.
lt_sharon_valerii Oh!
Hotdog#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode07 You okay?
lt_sharon_valerii Uh, yeah, the datapoints are almost completely corroded. I dont know if Im gonna get much out of here, but lets try.
cpt_lee_adama What is going on? Frak me! This ones alive! Weve got a live one over there!
sgt_erin_mathias Danelli, Peters, cover the Major!
cpt_lee_adama Theyre alive!
captain_karl_agathon Are you taking fire?
cpt_lee_adama Negative, negative. They seem in pretty bad shape.
captain_karl_agathon Dont take chances. They make any threatening moves --
cpt_lee_adama Oh, you can trust me on that one.
leoben_conoy Heavenly Father...
sgt_erin_mathias Major, what do we do? Should we take em out?
cpt_lee_adama Hold your fire, hold your fire!
number_six Heavenly Father...
sgt_erin_mathias keep away from the trackers!
cpt_lee_adama I said hold your fire!
Cylons_moaning#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode07 Grant us the strength ... the wisdom...
cpt_lee_adama what are they doing?
Cylons#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode07 ...And above all...a measure of acceptance.
cpt_lee_adama Hey, Athena, what are you doing? Athena! Athena!
Cylons#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode07 The strength... the wisdom...
Eight_to_Athena#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode07 Traitor. Save yourself.
lt_sharon_valerii From what?
number_six Get away from us.
lt_sharon_valerii What happened here?
number_six A beacon. We brought it aboard. Carried disease. Were infected.
lt_sharon_valerii Infected?
sgt_erin_mathias Oh, son of a bitch!
cpt_lee_adama Okay, okay, okay! Settle down! Keep back! Watch the doorways. Get the doorways!
dr_cottle Theyll have to come aboard under quarantine procedures. Clear a path from the hangar deck to sickbay and sterilize it. And the Raptors after theyre in.
lt_felix_gaeta Ill handle that.
officer_anastasia_dualla How long will they have to stay in quarantine?
dr_cottle I wont know that until I do the blood work. Could be days, weeks. Theres no way to tell. You said they picked up this disease from a beacon?
admiral_william_adama According to the Cylons.
dr_cottle Always good to have the source of the pathogen. Can you bring it aboard
admiral_william_adama No, too dangerous. I want to limit our exposure.
dr_cottle What about the prisoners?
captain_karl_agathon Prisoners?
dr_cottle The disease is more advanced in their systems, so itll give at least an idea of what to expect as it progresses. And when they die, itll tell me how long our people have to live.
admiral_william_adama How many prisoners?
dr_cottle How many you got?
captain_karl_agathon Apollo,
cpt_lee_adama Holy frak, what was that?
lt_felix_gaeta Massive energy discharge from the baseship. It exploded, sir.
captain_karl_agathon Apollo,
cpt_lee_adama Uh, yeah, affirmative. Were still here. What the hell happened?
captain_karl_agathon Baseship exploded. Must have self-destructed. You guys are lucky you got out when you did.
cpt_lee_adama Roger that.
dr_gaius_baltar Nothing the matter, I trust?
number_six We have some questions.
danna_biers How long have you planned to betray us, Gaius?
dr_gaius_baltar Funny.
dr_gaius_baltar Youre joking, of course.
number_six Youre only making this harder on yourself.
dr_gaius_baltar Wait a minute. I have been more than very accommodating since I arrived here. I helped you find Sharons baby. Ive helped you with a map towards Earth.
danna_biers We know about the beacon, Gaius.
number_six You knew it was out there. You knew it contained a deadly virus.
dr_gaius_baltar No, I didnt. I didnt. Thats not --
number_six Was the virus created by
danna_biers have you been in contact with them since youve been onboard? Or did you plan this before the evacuation of New Caprica?
dr_gaius_baltar This is a most profound misunderstanding. Uh, I had nothing to do with the virus or the beacon. Yes. Yes, I did discover it on the baseship. And I should have told you about it sooner, and I didnt. Um, because I thought, you know, you-- youd try and link me, you know, to the virus....
number_six Im sorry, Gaius.
danna_biers Things would have been so much simpler had you only told the truth. We think you know more about this virus, and we intend to find out.
number_six Relax. Have a drink.
dr_gaius_baltar I cant.
number_six Its all in your head, Gaius. Pain, pleasure. Theyre just neural impulses sent to the brain. You decide how to interpret them. They can be pleasant. Or unpleasant.
dr_gaius_baltar No! No, please! Please!
danna_biers I want it to stop, Gaius. I dont want you to feel this pain. And neither does Caprica, do you?
number_six No.
dr_gaius_baltar I love you.
Hotdog#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode07 you feel anything yet?
racetrack Yeah, I feel sick. Sick of you buggin me.
Hotdog#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode07 You didnt touch any infected skinjobs.
racetrack Not my fault youre clumsy.
Hotdog#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode07 You can kiss my infected ass.
dr_cottle Well, you can kiss it, but its not infected. I got your blood work back. Humans are immune to the virus. Youre all healthy.
cpt_lee_adama All right, people. Nice job. Lets get outta here.
lt_sharon_valerii No. You stay put for a while.
captain_karl_agathon No, no, no, no, no, no. Please tell me shes okay.
dr_cottle I havent done her bloodwork yet.
captain_karl_agathon What? Oh, I see. She can wait because of who she isnt.
captain_karl_agathon You come for me, Godsdamn it. You come for me the second you know.
aaron_doral Take him. Hes the furthest gone.
aaron_doral No, no, no, no.
president_laura_roslin You can keep the Cylons alive.
dr_cottle I cant cure them. But yes.
admiral_william_adama How long?
dr_cottle Indefinitely. I identified the virus. We know it as lymphocytic encephalitis. The disease is carried by rodents. Rats, mostly. But a couple of hundred years ago, humans developed an immunity. Now I can create a simple vaccine that will dramatically reverse the effect of the virus on the Cylons. But, uh, they have an antibody in their blood which breaks down the RNA of the vaccine. So they will need regular, close-interval injections of the vaccine. Or they will die.
cpt_lee_adama Can I ask the ugly question here? Is there a reason to keep them alive?
captain_karl_agathon We could interrogate them for intelligence.
admiral_william_adama I agree. We have a lot of unanswered questions.
cpt_lee_adama Yeah, okay. But theyre not gonna talk.
president_laura_roslin well, they might if we dangled the vaccine. They dont need to know its a stop-gap, not a cure.
cpt_lee_adama They prayed on the infected ship. Karls wife said it was something called the prayer to the cloud of unknowing, whatever the hell that is. Anyway, the point is, she said they only use it when theyre facing an imminent death that is final. No possibility of downloading. Theyre ready to die.
president_laura_roslin They may be ready to die, but it doesnt mean that one of them wont jump at a second chance.
simon It infected everything. Baseship. Centurions. Raiders. Until we were finally abandoned by the other Cylon ships.
cpt_lee_adama Why? Why not just put you under quarantine until they found a cure?
simon Fear of spreading the disease. They told us that there was a bioelectric feedback component to the pathogen. It corrupts how our brains manage our immune systems. If one of us dies and is resurrected, the disease will follow, infecting the resurrection ship, and the Fleet.
admiral_william_adama Why were you in this area in the first place?
simon We were sent. We were sent here to look for the Lion Nebula. Baltar said it would point the way to Earth.
captain_karl_agathon What did you just say?
lt_felix_gaeta Baltar -- Baltars alive?
simon Baltar is on our baseship. Hes helping us find Earth.
admiral_william_adama Hes using our navigation charts. Along with our map from Kobol. Hes leading them to Earth.
simon We want a new beginning. Much like you. I gave you information. She said that there was a cure.
admiral_william_adama Doc Cottle will be giving you the medicine.
dr_cottle Take him back to the infirmary.
admiral_william_adama What the hells so funny?
cpt_lee_adama I think I just thought of a way to solve all of our problems. To get rid of the Cylon threat for once and for all. We can wipe em out. We can destroy the entire Cylon race.
cpt_lee_adama We jump to an area we know the Cylons use as a supply line. NCD2539. We stay there, exposed; we look as if were spoiling for a fight. Theyll send their Fleet. And where theres a Fleet, theres a resurrection ship. And once the resurrection ship is within our reach, we execute our infected prisoners. We bug out. The executed prisoners download into the resurrection ship, and with them, the virus.
president_laura_roslin Youre sure the virus will download to a new body?
cpt_lee_adama The Cylons are sure of it. They left their wounded out here to die alone with no hope of being rescued. Tells me all I need to know. And once the virus is in the resurrection ship, therell be no stopping it.
admiral_william_adama Rescuers become carriers of the plague. Cylons themselves dont believe that theyll develop a cure.
president_laura_roslin Oh, my Gods. This could be the end of the Cylons entirely.
cpt_lee_adama Forever.
captain_karl_agathon Genocide? So thats what were about now?
cpt_lee_adama Theyre not human. They were built. Not born. No fathers, no mothers, no sons, no daughters --
captain_karl_agathon I had a daughter. I held her in my arms.
cpt_lee_adama And she was half human. These are things. Dangerous things. This is our one chance to be rid of them.
captain_karl_agathon You can rationalize it any way you want. We do this... we wipe out their race... then were no different than they are.
president_laura_roslin Captain, I respectfully disagree. The Cylons struck first in this war and, not being content with the annihilation of billions of human beings, they pursued us relentlessly through the galaxies, determined to wipe us out.
captain_karl_agathon They tried to live with us on New Caprica.
president_laura_roslin ...What did you say?
captain_karl_agathon They tried to live with us on New Caprica.
president_laura_roslin You werent on New Caprica. To my recollection, you didnt set foot there. So out of respect for the hundreds of men and women on your crew who suffered through that snake pit, Im gonna pretend I didnt hear that. You would serve your Fleet well if youd remember occasionally that the Cylons are a mortal threat to the survival of the human race.
captain_karl_agathon Im talking about right and wrong. Im talking about losing a piece of our souls. No one wants to hear that, right? Lets keep it on me. Yeah, Im married to a Cylon. Who walked through hell for all of us how many times? And shes not half anything, okay. How do we know there arent others like her? She made a choice. Shes a person. Theyre a race of people. Wiping them out with a biological weapon is a crime against -- is a crime against humanity.
cpt_lee_adama But theyre not human. Theyre programmed.
president_laura_roslin We will take your input under advisement. Thank you both.
admiral_william_adama Dismissed.
number_six I can help you. I can guide you through the torment and beyond, but youll have to do the work.
dr_gaius_baltar Ill do anything.
danna_biers Then tell us what we want to know. How was the virus invented? Did they make a cure?
dr_gaius_baltar I cant ... the pain --
number_six The pains only in your body. So keep your body here with me. Dont worry. Ill take care of it.
Three_turning_down_the_machine#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode07 You see, Gaius, this is what the absence of pain feels like. Its easy to forget.
dr_gaius_baltar I had nothing to do with the virus. It was a coincidence.
danna_biers Theres no such thing as coincidence. God wills the universe according to his design.
number_six Now. Focus on her. As a Cylon, not a woman. Be a scientist. Examine her faith. Whats your analysis, doctor?
dr_gaius_baltar Im a scientist. And as a scientist, I believe that if God exists our knowledge of him is imperfect. Why?
danna_biers Its called faith.
dr_gaius_baltar Absolute belief in Gods will means theres a reason for everything. Everything! And yet you cant help ask yourself how God can allow death and destruction and then despise yourself for asking. But the truth is, if we knew Gods will, wed all be Gods, wouldnt we? I can see it in your eyes, DAnna. Youre frustrated. Youre conflicted. Let me help you. Let me help you change. Find a way to reconcile your faith with fact. Find a way towards a rational universe.
danna_biers I dont know what your game is, but its not going to work.
number_six Give your body to me. only your mind is there. Feel me. Feel this where she wants you to feel pain. Look at me. Look at me, Gaius. Do you want me to believe youre worth saving? Do you? Do you? Say it.
dr_gaius_baltar I want you to believe in me. Dont stop! Dont stop! Please, please dont stop. You have to believe in me. Youre all I have left.
number_six Now tell me you believe in me. Tell me you believe in my strength. Oh, God, say it!
dr_gaius_baltar I believe in you! I believe in you.
dr_gaius_baltar I love you. I love you with all my heart.
dr_gaius_baltar I love you with all my heart.
captain_karl_agathon How?
lt_sharon_valerii Cottle said it had something to do with carrying a half-human child. How the fetal blood cells enter the maternal circulatory system, causing the mother to create antibodies ... whatever. Im immune!
captain_karl_agathon Oh, my Gods.
lt_sharon_valerii Our baby... saved my life. Shes gone forever, and she saved my life. Hera kept us together.
captain_karl_agathon Share this.
lt_sharon_valerii This. You mean us? Together? You mean us?
captain_karl_agathon Them, them. I mean them.
lt_sharon_valerii Whos them?
captain_karl_agathon Theyre gonna execute the infected prisoners. But not until we jump into a Cylon region with a resurrection ship present.
captain_karl_agathon The infections gonna spread everywhere.
admiral_william_adama Theres a point Id like to make.
president_laura_roslin Mm-hmm?
admiral_william_adama The law forbids me to use biological weapons without a direct presidential order.
president_laura_roslin Which means youre passing the buck.
admiral_william_adama on this one, yes. Helos right on one thing. We start destroying entire races, even mechanical races, were liable to tear off a piece of mans soul.
president_laura_roslin The Cylons are coming to Earth. If they find us, they are coming for us. Those are the stakes. They always have been, bill.
captain_karl_agathon Were talking about the genocide of your entire race.
lt_sharon_valerii Yeah. You think I dont know that? I made a choice to wear a uniform. To be a person.
captain_karl_agathon You were a person before you put on that uniform. Okay? You were a person before I fell in love with you. You dont have to prove that.
lt_sharon_valerii I have to prove it every day.
admiral_william_adama Posterity really doesnt look too kindly on genocide.
president_laura_roslin Youre making an assumption that posterity will define this as genocide. If they do, at least therell be someone alive to hate us for it. The Cylons are our mistake, we created them. All right, Admiral Adama. As President, I have determined the Cylons be made extinct. The use of biological weapons is authorized.
admiral_william_adama So say we all.
president_laura_roslin ...So say we all.
officer_anastasia_dualla Jump complete. Dradis is clear. No Cylons, sir.
admiral_william_adama Theyll be here soon enough. Get our birds in the air.
lt_felix_gaeta Commence Viper and nav Raptor launch.
lt_sharon_valerii Lets do this, Racetrack.
Pilots#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode07 Lets go. Take up this bird. Move that.
chief_galen_tyrol Get it out of the way. Go.
Pilots_and_Deck_Crew#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode07 Lets go, lets go! Come on!
racetrack CAP is away, nav bird has them on dradis.
officer_anastasia_dualla Dradis contact. A pair of Cylon Raiders. Keeping their distance for now.
admiral_william_adama Didnt take em that long. Theyre just scouts. Theyll jump away and report back to their Fleet. See if they take our bait.
officer_anastasia_dualla Got em. Theres a resurrection ship with them.
admiral_william_adama Then its time to execute our cylon prisoners. Call it in.
lt_felix_gaeta Terminate the prisoners.
cpt_lee_adama Head shots, okay?
sgt_erin_mathias Yes, sir.
cpt_lee_adama Lets do it.
captain_kara_thrace All right, lets see if we cant frak up some toasters on this joy ride, people.
Hotdog#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode07 Bogies holding hands, Im notching like hell up here!
captain_kara_thrace Hotdog, Starbuck. Quit your bitchin and continue to cover as fragged.
cpt_lee_adama Frak! Theyre already dead. Theyre already dead.
lt_felix_gaeta Sir, you should hear this.
cpt_lee_adama They were dead before the resurrection ship was in range. They didnt download the disease. We missed our window.
admiral_william_adama Call our birds in. Spool up. Lets get the hell outta here.
lt_felix_gaeta Commence FTL. Sir, we lost time waiting to hear from quarantine. Were gonna take significant fire while we spool up.
admiral_william_adama Continue jump. Take us back to our Fleet.
lt_felix_gaeta Yes, sir.
captain_karl_agathon Theyll be coming for me. You or me.
captain_karl_agathon Seems like theyre always coming for one of us... Im not a traitor. I love my people. I love this ship. Besides you, the first thing I wanna see on any morning are the lights in that CIC. I did what I thought was right. If it was a mistake, fine. I can live with that. Its you I cant live without.
president_laura_roslin Hmm, no thanks.
admiral_william_adama The prisoners died of asphyxiation. The air purification system was reversed. Sucked the oxygen out. When this happens, the deadbolts are automatically activated on the door. Someone did this manually.
president_laura_roslin Someone? Seems to me theres only one or two likely suspects. Who will head the investigation?
admiral_william_adama No one. Im closing the book on this.
president_laura_roslin How convenient.
president_laura_roslin Somebody sneezed, maybe.
admiral_william_adama Yeah, an entire race almost wiped out because someone forgot to wipe their nose.
admiral_william_adama I think were on the right trail, Laura.
president_laura_roslin Yes, we are on the right trail, Bill. So are the Cylons.
