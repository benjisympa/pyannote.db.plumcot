Adama You cannot play God then wash your hands of the things that youve created.
Adama Sooner or later, the day comes when you cant hide from the things that youve done anymore.
Gaeta Attention all Colonial units. Cylon attack underway.
Gaeta This is no drill.
Adama Ill be right there.
Adama How? Why? Doesnt really matter now. What does matter is that as of this moment, we are at war.
Adama Youre full of bile, hatred, poison. And Im sorry for what happened to you down there, but I gotta run a ship. The last thing I need is a one-eyed drunk sowing discontent and disobedience. So you can get your ass back into your quarters and not leave until youre ready to act like the man that Ive known for the past thirty years.
Tigh That man doesnt exist anymore, Bill. And you wont be seeing me again.
Tory_holding_Gaiuss_portrait Is there really any place left in the universe deserving of such a rare and distinguished item?
Roslin I was thinking put it in the bathroom right over the toilet.
Tory Excellent choice.
Roslin_gasping Oh, my Gods. Oh Tory, come look at this. This is the dossier that Billy prepared for me my first day aboard Galactica. I cant believe I was about to throw this out in the trash.
Tory_looking_at_a_picture_of_the_Valkyrie_command_officers The Valkyrie. This was Adamas command before Galactica?
Roslin Mm-hmm.
Tory Look at that. This year marks Admiral Adamas 45th anniversary in the Colonial Fleet. In fact, his commissioning dates only a few days from now.
Roslin_handing_her_the_dossier Here. I think I want to have a ceremony. Lets give the Admiral a medal for 45 years of devoted service.
Tory_continuing_to_look_at_it Couldnt have come at a better time.
Roslin Give the people something to feel good about for a change.
Helo This is the XO. Set Condition one throughout the ship. I repeat, set Condition one throughout the ship. This is not a drill.
Adama Whats the problem?
Dualla Three Raiders, CBDR, bearing 145, carom 33.
Helo But this isnt their standard wedge formation.
Adama Wheres the CAP?
Dualla Starbuck and Kat will intercept in 98 seconds, sir. It looks like a pursuit, and theres been weapons exchange between them.
Adama A pursuit?
Helo_grins Yes, sir. Weve got two Raiders chasing a third.
Adama Have they fired on any of ours yet?
Helo No, sir.
Adama What the hell are they doing?
Starbuck All right, lets see if we can climb up their asses without drawing any fire. These two seem pretty preoccupied with the other one...
Kat Got any idea why Cylons would be chasing Cylons?
Starbuck Dont know, dont care. But waitll we close the gap, I dont wanna have to chase these frakkin things any longer than I have to.
Kat Yeah, roger that.
Kat Two down! one to go!
Starbuck Kat, check six. ...Damn, Kat, flank right. This guys headed right for Galactica.
Kat Im on it, sir!
Bulldog Krypter krypter krypter! This is Bulldog. Get me the hell out of here. Im wounded!
Starbuck What the frak is that?
Kat Target in range, closing in.
Bulldog Krypter krypter krypter, this is Bulldog...
Kelly Audio lock-on enabled.
Adama Where is that coming from?
Gaeta Its the Raider, sir.
Starbuck Take the frakkin shot, Kat.
Kat Gimme a sec. I almost got him lined up.
Bulldog Krypter krypter krypter, this is Bulldog.
Starbuck Kat, take the frakkin shot.
Adama Order the Vipers to hold their fire, immediately.
Adama Have them escort the Raider in. Prisoner drill. I want the alert guard in the hangar deck in five minutes.
Helo Yes, sir.
Chief All right, park that bird! Lets grab this Raider! Lets go, people! Move with a purpose!
Chief Make some room for the marines.
Bulldog Is it really you, sir?
Adama Yeah... its me. Welcome home, Bulldog.
Corman We may never have this opportunity again. Im assuming you appreciate the consequences if youre discovered. And you understand, Commander, that this conversation did not happen. Are you prepared for this?
Adama Of course, sir. on one condition: I need my men. Especially for the Stealthship. Theres only one pilot I trust.
Corman Who?
Cottle Well ... the conspiracy theorists are gonna be disappointed. Weve checked your DNA signature against your military records, and its conclusive. Youre not a Cylon. Smoke?
Adama_quietly_on_the_phone Thats right. Hes one of mine. Disappeared about three years ago. We think that he was captured.
Roslin Id like to meet him.
Adama Of course. Ill arrange it.
Cottle Well ... he checks out fine. Whatever they did to him out there, they kept him fed and relatively healthy. Physically, anyway.
Adama I know youve been through a lot. I realize that. But youve gotta talk to me, Danny. How the hell did you escape off a Cylon baseship?
Bulldog_swallows Well, sir, its like this. The enemy had me locked in a cell for three years. The accommodations were lousy, the service was slow, and after awhile I felt the institution no longer had anything to offer me. So I left.
Adama You had me worried there for a moment. Thought maybe the Cylons had beaten the bullshit attitude out of you.
Adama_taking_a_stiff_drink ...Howd you get out?
Bulldog_shaking I thought I was gonna die in there, Bill. But a while ago, they all started getting sick. I mean really sick.
Adama You mean a virus.
Bulldog Yeah.
Adama Weve seen that too.
Bulldog I heard them say it was spreading, getting worse. But eventually I realize... Im not catching it. Im immune.
Adama So what did you do?
Bulldog I was smart. Patient. I waited.
Three Ah, well...youre lookin good. Strong. Chuckles. Me, Ive felt better. I dont know why you guys do all that exercise. What, are you trying to stave off getting old? Doesnt seem such a tragedy to me. Given the alternatives.
Three You know what Im saying? Do I look that bad? Chuckles: You know what I think? I think youre afraid.
Roslin Let me try and understand exactly what happened to you. Im just gonna go back a little, all right? About a year prior to the Cylon attack on the Colonies, you were on a mission with Admiral Adama. Is that correct?
Bulldog It was a black ops mission.
Bulldog You remember the Tauron Colonists were such outlaws, always pushing their luck with the Admiralty every chance they got?
Roslin Right.
Adama The Taurons were drilling for tylium ore on a moon that was too close to the Cylon Armistice line. We knew that they had to get out of there or risk provoking the Cylons.
Tory Im sorry, but how did this result in his ship being shot down?
Bulldog He was my recon pilot. He was there to gather evidence. Taurons mustve seen us coming, because they ambushed him.
Adama Lieutenant Novacek was shot down by the Taurons in cold blood.
Bulldog Krypter krypter krypter, Ive got damage to the port engine. Bird is down. Repeat: bird is down. Request rescue.Krypter krypter krypter! This is Bulldog... bird is down. Repeat: bird is down. Request rescue.
Roslin So what did you do?
Adama I made a bad call. His ship was gone. No ejection on dradis. No distress call. He was dead. So I left.
Tory But the Lieutenant did eject, obviously, and somehow survived in his ejection seat long enough for the Cylons to find him. Wow.
Roslin Could you both give us a moment, please? Thank you, Tory, and thank you very much, Lieutenant. I appreciate it.
Bulldog Madam President.
Tory Why dont we check the Fleet registry, see if any of your family might have survived?
Roslin So are you gonna tell me what really happened?
Adama Youre gonna have to trust me on this one, okay? Its my mess. Ill fix it.
Three Fire.
Tigh_bringing_a_cigarette_in_and_out_of_the_line_of_sight_of_his_good_eye I see it. I see it. I see it. I see it.
Adama_enters_in_full_dress_without_knocking Daniel Novacek just escaped from a POW cell on a Cylon baseship, stole a Raider, flew it here. I just finished debriefing him.
Tigh_not_looking_at_Adama Bulldogs alive?
Adama Yeah.
Tigh_finally_standing My Gods. How could he be alive? That tough son of a bitch, he actually made it, didnt he?
Adama Yeah, I guess he did.
Tigh So... are you here to talk to your friend? Or to your XO? Last time I checked, I was neither.
Tigh Ohhh. I get it. Oh, yeah. Oh, this is gonna be a little complicated for you, isnt it, Admiral? You gonna tell him what you did?
Adama I did what I had to do.
Tigh So tell him.
Adama Its not gonna make any difference, the past is the past.
Tigh Youre equivocating.
Adama I dont know why the frak I came here.
Tigh Tell him! Hes gonna find out sooner or later.
Tigh I see it.
Tigh Go away.
Tigh Godsdamn son of a bitch.
Bulldog_after_Tigh_opens_the_door I cant believe it. Its really you.
Tigh Danny Novacek. They told me you made it. Good for you, Bulldog.
Bulldog Saul.
Tigh A drink?
Bulldog You have no idea.
Tigh Yes, I do.
Apollo_enters Dad? Hey, I just, uh, I just got your message.
Adama Thank you for coming. Sit down. Its time for us to talk.
Bulldog Let me ask you something. How often you get out of here?
Tigh Why, all the time. Ive been a little under the weather. Thats all.
Bulldog And howd you wind up on this old bucket anyway? What happened to the Valkyrie?
Tigh Well, uh, lets just say that last mission wasnt exactly a boon to the old mans career. Galactica was his graceful retirement.
Bulldog Heard you and the old man havent spoken in a while. Whats wrong? He wont cover your ass day and night like he used to?
Tigh Oh, no, he still does his share of ass-covering. Problem is, its his main function now. Of course, considering how you wound up getting captured in the first place, I guess you found that out the hard way yourself, didnt you?
Bulldog Whats that supposed to mean?
Tigh My Gods. He didnt tell you, did he? Did he?
Bulldog Tell me what?
Tigh_disappointed That son of a bitch.
Adama I shot him down.
Apollo Well, if you shot him down you had your reasons, you were following orders. Preventing something worse. Right?
Adama No. I shot him down to avoid... detection. Protect the mission. So it wouldnt be discovered by the Cylons. It was a black ops mission whose sole purpose was to ascertain the likelihood of a Cylon strike.
Apollo Cylon strike? So youre saying that -- that we knew they were out there? That they could launch an attack on the Colonies?
Adama We didnt know anything for sure. There were theories in some circles that the reason that the Cylons had stayed dormant for so long was because they were building a war machine. Preparing a strike.
Apollo But I thought... I thought that no one had seen or heard from the Cylons in over 40 years.
Adama Thats true. Partially. The Admiralty had grown restless with the Adar administration. They thought we were resting on our laurels, unprepared to protect against an attack.
Adama_over_a_flashback_to_the_Admirals_office My mission was to escort a stealth recon ship just beyond the Armistice line, stick our nose over, gather evidence, see if there was any suspicious activities.
Apollo And if the Cylons discovered you across the line breaching the Armistice, then, uh... they would see that as...
Adama An act of war.
Valkyrie_XO Stealthstar, Valkyrie. We register you on dradis, just past the Armistice line. Youre on full alert. Proceed with caution.
Bulldog Valkyrie, Bulldog. Im exactly two clicks past the line. Repeat: two clicks, and Ive got negative dradis contacts. Theres nothing here, sir. Which is fine by me. Company wants to pay me for a joy ride, they came to the right driver. Helluva moon.
Valkyrie_XO Dradis contact. Unknown vessel just jumped in.
Bulldog Frak!
Bulldog_on_wireless Krypter krypter krypter, Ive got damage to the port engine. Bird is down. Repeat: bird is down. Request rescue. Krypter krypter krypter. This is Bulldog.
Valkyrie_XO Vessel just jumped out, sir.
Bulldog Bird is down! Repeat: bird is down! Request rescue. Krypter krypter krypter, this is Bulldog. Bird is down. Repeat: bird is down.
Valkyrie_XO Two more dradis contacts. Sir, please instruct. What are your orders, sir? Sir, what are your orders?
Tigh Dont do this. Think about it, Bill. You dont want to do this.
Adama Do you want his ship discovered? Do you know where we are? Do you have any idea what this could mean?
Valkyrie_XO Bogies on intercept course. Will merge with Stealthstar in 20 seconds. Sir?
Adama_on_the_phone Weapons: launch ship-to-ship missile. Now.
Bulldog No! There is no way...
Tigh Oh, its true. And you know its true. Youve known it every second of every day since it happened. And the sooner you admit it, the sooner you might get that haunted look out of your eyes.
Tigh Listen to me. Sometimes surviving can be its own death sentence. I know that.
Apollo So the attack on Novaceks ship -- the one that winged him and the two dradis contacts that were following him... They werent Taurons. Those were the Cylons.
Adama For all those years, I told myself that I didnt know what they were. But I was just lying to myself. Pretending that it couldnt be true. It is true.
Adama I started it. Initiated it.
Apollo Wait a minute, started what? Started what?
Adama The attacks on the Colonies. By crossing the line, I showed them that we were the warmongers they figured us to be. [
Apollo No. No. Because it wasnt just you. They put you there. They put you there, across the line. You had no choice. That was the Admiralty. That was the ... that was the military. You were one mission. You were one man. one man.
Adama_quietly_wiping_his_eyes It only takes one.
Caprica You all right?
Three Yeah, of course.
Caprica More nightmares?
Three Dreams. Something different this time, though. I think Gods trying to tell me something.
Caprica Its about Gaius, isnt it?
Three No. Its not. Its about something much bigger than that.
DAnna After you execute this command, youll delete the order from your logs, then overwrite the corresponding memory locations.
DAnna_scared Execute.
Eight Its okay. Its okay. Relax, try to breathe through it... breathe.
DAnna_up_at_the_attending_Three Oh, theres something beautiful... Miraculous, between life and death.
Starbuck Hmm. Thats weird. Why the hell do they keep missing?
Starbuck_standing_quickly Frak.
Adama_answering_the_phone Adama.
Ernestine Admiral, you have a call from a Lieutenant Novacek.
Adama Put him through.
Bulldog Bill?
Adama Yes?
Bulldog This is Danny. We need to talk.
Adama Hold on.
Bulldog I need to see you right now.
Adama Hold on. Ill be right there.
Starbuck_showing_Tigh_shots_from_the_video The Cylons are saddled up on him. Theyve got a perfect, point-blank, no-deflection shot. They had him dead to rights.
Tigh Id say so.
Starbuck Look, Novacek was hit and smoking, flying straight and level. Any nugget could make that kill. The Cylons couldve wasted him any number of times, and they didnt. They didnt. They let him escape.
Tigh_taking_a_drink The Cylons dont do anything by accident.
Starbuck Yeah, thats what I was thinking too. Did Novacek say how he was able to overcome the Cylons that were holding him prisoner? They were sick? Had a virus? I mean, how many viruses do the Cylons have, sir?
Tigh Who knows? Maybe it was the same virus those Cylons we found were suffering from...
Starbuck -- Yeah, or maybe they just told us a story that wed buy. Something that was credible, familiar.
Starbuck Novacek was held on a baseship for three years, escapes, and then conveniently finds our Fleet with no agenda and no reason to be here.
Adama_arrives_at_the_open_door Hey, Dan.
Bulldog Its funny how all the training comes back, huh?
Bulldog Why did you lie to me, Bill?
Bulldog All those years... You know what I kept telling myself? What stupid, frakked-up dream I held onto? I kept thinking, Just hang in there, Bulldog. Bill Adamas coming. He wont leave you to rot in here, not him. He wont leave a man behind. Just hold on.
Bulldog But you werent coming. You didnt think I was alive. You werent even hoping I was alive!
Bulldog And if I hadnt figured a way to escape, if I didnt make my move when I saw they left that door wide open for me, Id be as good as dead right now!
Adama Is that what they did? Did they leave the door standing open? Did they let you escape?
Bulldog Thats not what I meant. I know the truth.
Bulldog I beat them. Do you understand? I beat them at their own game. I frakkin killed her, and I escaped. You trying to take that away from me?
Tigh_cocking_a_gun_behind_him Bulldog!
Tigh Stay down! Are you all right, Bill?
Adama_wiped_out Yeah, Im okay.
Tigh You dont wanna believe it, do you? I know. The truth hurts, Bulldog, but its better to know the truth than to live a lie. Were all soldiers, Danny. Were all expendable. And we did what we had to do to protect the mission. Its ugly, but there it is. The Cylons let you go. The question is why? Ask yourself that, Danny. Because up until a minute ago, you were doing exactly what they wanted you to do. Come here and learn the truth and seek revenge. And thats exactly what you did. You almost gave them what they wanted.
Tigh Tell you a dirty little secret: The toughest part of getting played is losing your dignity. Feeling like you are not worth the oxygen you are sucking down. You get used to it. You start to believe it. You start to love it. Its like a bottle that never runs dry. You can keep reaching for it over and over and over again.
Adama So how do you put that bottle away, Saul?
Tigh I dont know. one day you just decide to ... get up and walk out of your room.
Roslin What is this?
Roslin_disgusted Your resignation. You have gotta be kidding me.
Adama I said before. We cant hide from the things weve done. I see no other way around this situation. Maybe its time, Laura.
Roslin Siddown, Bill.
Roslin I think youre being naïve.
Adama Naïve?
Roslin Did it ever occur to you that the Admiralty may have set you up to provoke a war they wanted? Its naïve to think that horrible things that we cant understand have simple explanations. Because simple explanations make us feel like we have control when we dont. We know why the Cylons attacked us and it wasnt any one thing. Oh my Gods. We did a thousand things, good and bad, every day for 40 years, to pave the way for those attacks.
Adama Something has to be done.
Roslin_taking_out_a_small_invitation_to_the_pinning You know what that is?
Adama_dropping_the_invite Medal of distinction.
Roslin This was before I heard about this resignation of yours. So hmm... Id like to propose this. You seem hellbent on paying some kind of penance for whatever it is you think youve done. So instead of resigning, why dont you get up and walk out of here. Meet me on the port hangar deck tomorrow evening for this ceremony, and let me pin a frakkin medal to your chest.
Adama I cant.
Roslin Its not for you. Its for them. Stand up there, acknowledge your Fleet, and give them what they need: a hero. Thatll be your penance. Even if it kills you.
Roslin on behalf of everyone in this room, it is my pleasure to present you, Admiral Adama, with the medal of distinction for your 40 years of courageous service to the Colonial Fleet. Congratulations.
Cottle Have Dr. Stoffa call me as soon as you arrive. And, Bulldog, youre gonna be fine. Just remember itll take some time.
Bulldog All right.
Adama Lieutenant... you forgot something.
Bulldog I cant. Bill, I --
Adama Take it. Youre not gettin off that easy.
Adama once a pilot, always a pilot, Bulldog.
Bulldog Yes, sir.
Adama Come in.
Tigh I heard you won a medal.
Adama Yeah. They give em out for anything these days. Good behavior, attendance, playing well with others.
Adama I need you back in the CIC. It just aint the same without you in there intimidating the inmates.
Tigh No. No no no. Thats not what I came here to talk to you about.
Adama Okay. So why are you here?
Tigh I dont know. Nothing.
Adama You wanna tell me what happened to Ellen?
Tigh_sighs I could use a drink.
Adama Me too.
