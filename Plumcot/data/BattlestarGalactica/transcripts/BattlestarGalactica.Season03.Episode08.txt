admiral_william_adama You cannot play God then wash your hands of the things that youve created.
admiral_william_adama Sooner or later, the day comes when you cant hide from the things that youve done anymore.
lt_felix_gaeta Attention all Colonial units. Cylon attack underway.
lt_felix_gaeta This is no drill.
admiral_william_adama Ill be right there.
admiral_william_adama How? Why? Doesnt really matter now. What does matter is that as of this moment, we are at war.
admiral_william_adama Youre full of bile, hatred, poison. And Im sorry for what happened to you down there, but I gotta run a ship. The last thing I need is a one-eyed drunk sowing discontent and disobedience. So you can get your ass back into your quarters and not leave until youre ready to act like the man that Ive known for the past thirty years.
colonel_saul_tigh That man doesnt exist anymore, Bill. And you wont be seeing me again.
tory_foster Is there really any place left in the universe deserving of such a rare and distinguished item?
president_laura_roslin I was thinking put it in the bathroom right over the toilet.
tory_foster Excellent choice.
president_laura_roslin Oh, my Gods. Oh Tory, come look at this. This is the dossier that Billy prepared for me my first day aboard Galactica. I cant believe I was about to throw this out in the trash.
tory_foster The Valkyrie. This was Adamas command before Galactica?
president_laura_roslin Mm-hmm.
tory_foster Look at that. This year marks Admiral Adamas 45th anniversary in the Colonial Fleet. In fact, his commissioning dates only a few days from now.
president_laura_roslin Here. I think I want to have a ceremony. Lets give the Admiral a medal for 45 years of devoted service.
tory_foster Couldnt have come at a better time.
president_laura_roslin Give the people something to feel good about for a change.
captain_karl_agathon This is the XO. Set Condition one throughout the ship. I repeat, set Condition one throughout the ship. This is not a drill.
admiral_william_adama Whats the problem?
officer_anastasia_dualla Three Raiders, CBDR, bearing 145, carom 33.
captain_karl_agathon But this isnt their standard wedge formation.
admiral_william_adama Wheres the CAP?
officer_anastasia_dualla Starbuck and Kat will intercept in 98 seconds, sir. It looks like a pursuit, and theres been weapons exchange between them.
admiral_william_adama A pursuit?
captain_karl_agathon Yes, sir. Weve got two Raiders chasing a third.
admiral_william_adama Have they fired on any of ours yet?
captain_karl_agathon No, sir.
admiral_william_adama What the hell are they doing?
captain_kara_thrace All right, lets see if we can climb up their asses without drawing any fire. These two seem pretty preoccupied with the other one...
louanne_katraine Got any idea why Cylons would be chasing Cylons?
captain_kara_thrace Dont know, dont care. But waitll we close the gap, I dont wanna have to chase these frakkin things any longer than I have to.
louanne_katraine Yeah, roger that.
louanne_katraine Two down! one to go!
captain_kara_thrace Kat, check six. ...Damn, Kat, flank right. This guys headed right for Galactica.
louanne_katraine Im on it, sir!
lt_danny_novacek Krypter krypter krypter! This is Bulldog. Get me the hell out of here. Im wounded!
captain_kara_thrace What the frak is that?
louanne_katraine Target in range, closing in.
lt_danny_novacek Krypter krypter krypter, this is Bulldog...
Kelly#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode08 Audio lock-on enabled.
admiral_william_adama Where is that coming from?
lt_felix_gaeta Its the Raider, sir.
captain_kara_thrace Take the frakkin shot, Kat.
louanne_katraine Gimme a sec. I almost got him lined up.
lt_danny_novacek Krypter krypter krypter, this is Bulldog.
captain_kara_thrace Kat, take the frakkin shot.
admiral_william_adama Order the Vipers to hold their fire, immediately.
admiral_william_adama Have them escort the Raider in. Prisoner drill. I want the alert guard in the hangar deck in five minutes.
captain_karl_agathon Yes, sir.
chief_galen_tyrol All right, park that bird! Lets grab this Raider! Lets go, people! Move with a purpose!
chief_galen_tyrol Make some room for the marines.
lt_danny_novacek Is it really you, sir?
admiral_william_adama Yeah... its me. Welcome home, Bulldog.
admiral_corman We may never have this opportunity again. Im assuming you appreciate the consequences if youre discovered. And you understand, Commander, that this conversation did not happen. Are you prepared for this?
admiral_william_adama Of course, sir. on one condition: I need my men. Especially for the Stealthship. Theres only one pilot I trust.
admiral_corman Who?
dr_cottle Well ... the conspiracy theorists are gonna be disappointed. Weve checked your DNA signature against your military records, and its conclusive. Youre not a Cylon. Smoke?
admiral_william_adama Thats right. Hes one of mine. Disappeared about three years ago. We think that he was captured.
president_laura_roslin Id like to meet him.
admiral_william_adama Of course. Ill arrange it.
dr_cottle Well ... he checks out fine. Whatever they did to him out there, they kept him fed and relatively healthy. Physically, anyway.
admiral_william_adama I know youve been through a lot. I realize that. But youve gotta talk to me, Danny. How the hell did you escape off a Cylon baseship?
lt_danny_novacek Well, sir, its like this. The enemy had me locked in a cell for three years. The accommodations were lousy, the service was slow, and after awhile I felt the institution no longer had anything to offer me. So I left.
admiral_william_adama You had me worried there for a moment. Thought maybe the Cylons had beaten the bullshit attitude out of you.
admiral_william_adama ...Howd you get out?
lt_danny_novacek I thought I was gonna die in there, Bill. But a while ago, they all started getting sick. I mean really sick.
admiral_william_adama You mean a virus.
lt_danny_novacek Yeah.
admiral_william_adama Weve seen that too.
lt_danny_novacek I heard them say it was spreading, getting worse. But eventually I realize... Im not catching it. Im immune.
admiral_william_adama So what did you do?
lt_danny_novacek I was smart. Patient. I waited.
danna_biers Ah, well...youre lookin good. Strong. Chuckles. Me, Ive felt better. I dont know why you guys do all that exercise. What, are you trying to stave off getting old? Doesnt seem such a tragedy to me. Given the alternatives.
danna_biers You know what Im saying? Do I look that bad? Chuckles: You know what I think? I think youre afraid.
president_laura_roslin Let me try and understand exactly what happened to you. Im just gonna go back a little, all right? About a year prior to the Cylon attack on the Colonies, you were on a mission with Admiral Adama. Is that correct?
lt_danny_novacek It was a black ops mission.
lt_danny_novacek You remember the Tauron Colonists were such outlaws, always pushing their luck with the Admiralty every chance they got?
president_laura_roslin Right.
admiral_william_adama The Taurons were drilling for tylium ore on a moon that was too close to the Cylon Armistice line. We knew that they had to get out of there or risk provoking the Cylons.
tory_foster Im sorry, but how did this result in his ship being shot down?
lt_danny_novacek He was my recon pilot. He was there to gather evidence. Taurons mustve seen us coming, because they ambushed him.
admiral_william_adama Lieutenant Novacek was shot down by the Taurons in cold blood.
lt_danny_novacek Krypter krypter krypter, Ive got damage to the port engine. Bird is down. Repeat: bird is down. Request rescue.Krypter krypter krypter! This is Bulldog... bird is down. Repeat: bird is down. Request rescue.
president_laura_roslin So what did you do?
admiral_william_adama I made a bad call. His ship was gone. No ejection on dradis. No distress call. He was dead. So I left.
tory_foster But the Lieutenant did eject, obviously, and somehow survived in his ejection seat long enough for the Cylons to find him. Wow.
president_laura_roslin Could you both give us a moment, please? Thank you, Tory, and thank you very much, Lieutenant. I appreciate it.
lt_danny_novacek Madam President.
tory_foster Why dont we check the Fleet registry, see if any of your family might have survived?
president_laura_roslin So are you gonna tell me what really happened?
admiral_william_adama Youre gonna have to trust me on this one, okay? Its my mess. Ill fix it.
danna_biers Fire.
colonel_saul_tigh I see it. I see it. I see it. I see it.
admiral_william_adama Daniel Novacek just escaped from a POW cell on a Cylon baseship, stole a Raider, flew it here. I just finished debriefing him.
colonel_saul_tigh Bulldogs alive?
admiral_william_adama Yeah.
colonel_saul_tigh My Gods. How could he be alive? That tough son of a bitch, he actually made it, didnt he?
admiral_william_adama Yeah, I guess he did.
colonel_saul_tigh So... are you here to talk to your friend? Or to your XO? Last time I checked, I was neither.
colonel_saul_tigh Ohhh. I get it. Oh, yeah. Oh, this is gonna be a little complicated for you, isnt it, Admiral? You gonna tell him what you did?
admiral_william_adama I did what I had to do.
colonel_saul_tigh So tell him.
admiral_william_adama Its not gonna make any difference, the past is the past.
colonel_saul_tigh Youre equivocating.
admiral_william_adama I dont know why the frak I came here.
colonel_saul_tigh Tell him! Hes gonna find out sooner or later.
colonel_saul_tigh I see it.
colonel_saul_tigh Go away.
colonel_saul_tigh Godsdamn son of a bitch.
lt_danny_novacek I cant believe it. Its really you.
colonel_saul_tigh Danny Novacek. They told me you made it. Good for you, Bulldog.
lt_danny_novacek Saul.
colonel_saul_tigh A drink?
lt_danny_novacek You have no idea.
colonel_saul_tigh Yes, I do.
cpt_lee_adama Dad? Hey, I just, uh, I just got your message.
admiral_william_adama Thank you for coming. Sit down. Its time for us to talk.
lt_danny_novacek Let me ask you something. How often you get out of here?
colonel_saul_tigh Why, all the time. Ive been a little under the weather. Thats all.
lt_danny_novacek And howd you wind up on this old bucket anyway? What happened to the Valkyrie?
colonel_saul_tigh Well, uh, lets just say that last mission wasnt exactly a boon to the old mans career. Galactica was his graceful retirement.
lt_danny_novacek Heard you and the old man havent spoken in a while. Whats wrong? He wont cover your ass day and night like he used to?
colonel_saul_tigh Oh, no, he still does his share of ass-covering. Problem is, its his main function now. Of course, considering how you wound up getting captured in the first place, I guess you found that out the hard way yourself, didnt you?
lt_danny_novacek Whats that supposed to mean?
colonel_saul_tigh My Gods. He didnt tell you, did he? Did he?
lt_danny_novacek Tell me what?
colonel_saul_tigh That son of a bitch.
admiral_william_adama I shot him down.
cpt_lee_adama Well, if you shot him down you had your reasons, you were following orders. Preventing something worse. Right?
admiral_william_adama No. I shot him down to avoid... detection. Protect the mission. So it wouldnt be discovered by the Cylons. It was a black ops mission whose sole purpose was to ascertain the likelihood of a Cylon strike.
cpt_lee_adama Cylon strike? So youre saying that -- that we knew they were out there? That they could launch an attack on the Colonies?
admiral_william_adama We didnt know anything for sure. There were theories in some circles that the reason that the Cylons had stayed dormant for so long was because they were building a war machine. Preparing a strike.
cpt_lee_adama But I thought... I thought that no one had seen or heard from the Cylons in over 40 years.
admiral_william_adama Thats true. Partially. The Admiralty had grown restless with the Adar administration. They thought we were resting on our laurels, unprepared to protect against an attack.
admiral_william_adama My mission was to escort a stealth recon ship just beyond the Armistice line, stick our nose over, gather evidence, see if there was any suspicious activities.
cpt_lee_adama And if the Cylons discovered you across the line breaching the Armistice, then, uh... they would see that as...
admiral_william_adama An act of war.
Valkyrie_XO#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode08 Stealthstar, Valkyrie. We register you on dradis, just past the Armistice line. Youre on full alert. Proceed with caution.
lt_danny_novacek Valkyrie, Bulldog. Im exactly two clicks past the line. Repeat: two clicks, and Ive got negative dradis contacts. Theres nothing here, sir. Which is fine by me. Company wants to pay me for a joy ride, they came to the right driver. Helluva moon.
Valkyrie_XO#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode08 Dradis contact. Unknown vessel just jumped in.
lt_danny_novacek Frak!
lt_danny_novacek Krypter krypter krypter, Ive got damage to the port engine. Bird is down. Repeat: bird is down. Request rescue. Krypter krypter krypter. This is Bulldog.
Valkyrie_XO#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode08 Vessel just jumped out, sir.
lt_danny_novacek Bird is down! Repeat: bird is down! Request rescue. Krypter krypter krypter, this is Bulldog. Bird is down. Repeat: bird is down.
Valkyrie_XO#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode08 Two more dradis contacts. Sir, please instruct. What are your orders, sir? Sir, what are your orders?
colonel_saul_tigh Dont do this. Think about it, Bill. You dont want to do this.
admiral_william_adama Do you want his ship discovered? Do you know where we are? Do you have any idea what this could mean?
Valkyrie_XO#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode08 Bogies on intercept course. Will merge with Stealthstar in 20 seconds. Sir?
admiral_william_adama Weapons: launch ship-to-ship missile. Now.
lt_danny_novacek No! There is no way...
colonel_saul_tigh Oh, its true. And you know its true. Youve known it every second of every day since it happened. And the sooner you admit it, the sooner you might get that haunted look out of your eyes.
colonel_saul_tigh Listen to me. Sometimes surviving can be its own death sentence. I know that.
cpt_lee_adama So the attack on Novaceks ship -- the one that winged him and the two dradis contacts that were following him... They werent Taurons. Those were the Cylons.
admiral_william_adama For all those years, I told myself that I didnt know what they were. But I was just lying to myself. Pretending that it couldnt be true. It is true.
admiral_william_adama I started it. Initiated it.
cpt_lee_adama Wait a minute, started what? Started what?
admiral_william_adama The attacks on the Colonies. By crossing the line, I showed them that we were the warmongers they figured us to be. [
cpt_lee_adama No. No. Because it wasnt just you. They put you there. They put you there, across the line. You had no choice. That was the Admiralty. That was the ... that was the military. You were one mission. You were one man. one man.
admiral_william_adama It only takes one.
number_six You all right?
danna_biers Yeah, of course.
number_six More nightmares?
danna_biers Dreams. Something different this time, though. I think Gods trying to tell me something.
number_six Its about Gaius, isnt it?
danna_biers No. Its not. Its about something much bigger than that.
danna_biers After you execute this command, youll delete the order from your logs, then overwrite the corresponding memory locations.
danna_biers Execute.
Eight#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode08 Its okay. Its okay. Relax, try to breathe through it... breathe.
danna_biers Oh, theres something beautiful... Miraculous, between life and death.
captain_kara_thrace Hmm. Thats weird. Why the hell do they keep missing?
captain_kara_thrace Frak.
admiral_william_adama Adama.
Ernestine#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode08 Admiral, you have a call from a Lieutenant Novacek.
admiral_william_adama Put him through.
lt_danny_novacek Bill?
admiral_william_adama Yes?
lt_danny_novacek This is Danny. We need to talk.
admiral_william_adama Hold on.
lt_danny_novacek I need to see you right now.
admiral_william_adama Hold on. Ill be right there.
captain_kara_thrace The Cylons are saddled up on him. Theyve got a perfect, point-blank, no-deflection shot. They had him dead to rights.
colonel_saul_tigh Id say so.
captain_kara_thrace Look, Novacek was hit and smoking, flying straight and level. Any nugget could make that kill. The Cylons couldve wasted him any number of times, and they didnt. They didnt. They let him escape.
colonel_saul_tigh The Cylons dont do anything by accident.
captain_kara_thrace Yeah, thats what I was thinking too. Did Novacek say how he was able to overcome the Cylons that were holding him prisoner? They were sick? Had a virus? I mean, how many viruses do the Cylons have, sir?
colonel_saul_tigh Who knows? Maybe it was the same virus those Cylons we found were suffering from...
captain_kara_thrace -- Yeah, or maybe they just told us a story that wed buy. Something that was credible, familiar.
captain_kara_thrace Novacek was held on a baseship for three years, escapes, and then conveniently finds our Fleet with no agenda and no reason to be here.
admiral_william_adama Hey, Dan.
lt_danny_novacek Its funny how all the training comes back, huh?
lt_danny_novacek Why did you lie to me, Bill?
lt_danny_novacek All those years... You know what I kept telling myself? What stupid, frakked-up dream I held onto? I kept thinking, Just hang in there, Bulldog. Bill Adamas coming. He wont leave you to rot in here, not him. He wont leave a man behind. Just hold on.
lt_danny_novacek But you werent coming. You didnt think I was alive. You werent even hoping I was alive!
lt_danny_novacek And if I hadnt figured a way to escape, if I didnt make my move when I saw they left that door wide open for me, Id be as good as dead right now!
admiral_william_adama Is that what they did? Did they leave the door standing open? Did they let you escape?
lt_danny_novacek Thats not what I meant. I know the truth.
lt_danny_novacek I beat them. Do you understand? I beat them at their own game. I frakkin killed her, and I escaped. You trying to take that away from me?
colonel_saul_tigh Bulldog!
colonel_saul_tigh Stay down! Are you all right, Bill?
admiral_william_adama Yeah, Im okay.
colonel_saul_tigh You dont wanna believe it, do you? I know. The truth hurts, Bulldog, but its better to know the truth than to live a lie. Were all soldiers, Danny. Were all expendable. And we did what we had to do to protect the mission. Its ugly, but there it is. The Cylons let you go. The question is why? Ask yourself that, Danny. Because up until a minute ago, you were doing exactly what they wanted you to do. Come here and learn the truth and seek revenge. And thats exactly what you did. You almost gave them what they wanted.
colonel_saul_tigh Tell you a dirty little secret: The toughest part of getting played is losing your dignity. Feeling like you are not worth the oxygen you are sucking down. You get used to it. You start to believe it. You start to love it. Its like a bottle that never runs dry. You can keep reaching for it over and over and over again.
admiral_william_adama So how do you put that bottle away, Saul?
colonel_saul_tigh I dont know. one day you just decide to ... get up and walk out of your room.
president_laura_roslin What is this?
president_laura_roslin Your resignation. You have gotta be kidding me.
admiral_william_adama I said before. We cant hide from the things weve done. I see no other way around this situation. Maybe its time, Laura.
president_laura_roslin Siddown, Bill.
president_laura_roslin I think youre being naïve.
admiral_william_adama Naïve?
president_laura_roslin Did it ever occur to you that the Admiralty may have set you up to provoke a war they wanted? Its naïve to think that horrible things that we cant understand have simple explanations. Because simple explanations make us feel like we have control when we dont. We know why the Cylons attacked us and it wasnt any one thing. Oh my Gods. We did a thousand things, good and bad, every day for 40 years, to pave the way for those attacks.
admiral_william_adama Something has to be done.
president_laura_roslin You know what that is?
admiral_william_adama Medal of distinction.
president_laura_roslin This was before I heard about this resignation of yours. So hmm... Id like to propose this. You seem hellbent on paying some kind of penance for whatever it is you think youve done. So instead of resigning, why dont you get up and walk out of here. Meet me on the port hangar deck tomorrow evening for this ceremony, and let me pin a frakkin medal to your chest.
admiral_william_adama I cant.
president_laura_roslin Its not for you. Its for them. Stand up there, acknowledge your Fleet, and give them what they need: a hero. Thatll be your penance. Even if it kills you.
president_laura_roslin on behalf of everyone in this room, it is my pleasure to present you, Admiral Adama, with the medal of distinction for your 40 years of courageous service to the Colonial Fleet. Congratulations.
dr_cottle Have Dr. Stoffa call me as soon as you arrive. And, Bulldog, youre gonna be fine. Just remember itll take some time.
lt_danny_novacek All right.
admiral_william_adama Lieutenant... you forgot something.
lt_danny_novacek I cant. Bill, I --
admiral_william_adama Take it. Youre not gettin off that easy.
admiral_william_adama once a pilot, always a pilot, Bulldog.
lt_danny_novacek Yes, sir.
admiral_william_adama Come in.
colonel_saul_tigh I heard you won a medal.
admiral_william_adama Yeah. They give em out for anything these days. Good behavior, attendance, playing well with others.
admiral_william_adama I need you back in the CIC. It just aint the same without you in there intimidating the inmates.
colonel_saul_tigh No. No no no. Thats not what I came here to talk to you about.
admiral_william_adama Okay. So why are you here?
colonel_saul_tigh I dont know. Nothing.
admiral_william_adama You wanna tell me what happened to Ellen?
colonel_saul_tigh I could use a drink.
admiral_william_adama Me too.
