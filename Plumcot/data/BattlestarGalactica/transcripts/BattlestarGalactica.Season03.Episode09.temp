Apollo Previously on
Tigh I feel like Im abandoning my post.
Adama Time to pack it in, Saul. You know it. More than half the crews down on New Caprica already. Were not really doing too much up here anymore. Good luck.
Dualla Oh, my Gods. Its a Cylon fleet. They found us.
Adama Theres only way that this mission ends, and thats with the successful rescue of our people off of New Caprica.
Adama You brought em home, Saul.
Tigh Not all of them.
Apollo What about us?
Starbuck There is no us. All right? There is nothing here. Do you get that? Nothing!
Starbuck Lee, when are you gonna get yourself a girl?
Apollo Im doing fine, thank you.
Starbuck Youre not still frakkin Dualla, are you?
Apollo I am proud to serve with you, Lieutenant. And to call you my wife.
Starbuck Im in a different place now. I just want to hurt someone, and it might as well be you.
Starbuck That was exactly what I needed.
Anders Glad to be of service.
Starbuck Damn it.
Anders_with_her_shirt Looking for this?
Starbuck Ahem. Yeah.
Anders_holding_the_shirt_back Kara, I want you back. I want our marriage back. I want a real marriage.
Starbuck And what if Im just not ready for that?
Anders_giving_up_the_shirt I dont know. Then I guess youll never be. Maybe because Im not what you really want after all.
Starbuck_pauses_then_grabs_her_dog_tags Im late for the dance. [
Kat Get that right up, Lee!
Starbuck If it isnt the fighting Agathons, huh?
Helo Starbuck, late to the party as usual.
Starbuck At least I got here in time to watch you kick the CAGs ass.
Kat Lee, you got him. You just got to keep your right up.
Helo Hes a tough little frakker, Ill give him that. Hes springing like hes got it in for me.
Sharon Stay off the ropes.
Helo All right.
Kat_with_Lee Stick and move. Just stay off the ropes. All right, you got him.
Starbuck Well, look at that. A couple months ago you wouldve had to roll him into this ring.
Sharon Well, not anymore. You know, with a cooler head, he might have half a chance.
Starbuck_urging_him_back_up Come on.
Tigh Fisher! Fisher, youre up!
Starbuck Good fight. Bit off a little more than you can chew, huh? Oh, come on, Lee. Dont be that way. Stick around. The nights young.
Apollo Well, I guess then youll just have to enjoy it without me.
Starbuck Pulling your tags out so soon?
Apollo Im done, Kara.
Starbuck Im not.
Apollo Now whos biting off more than they can chew, Captain?
Starbuck Not me from where Im standing, Major.
Apollo Excuse me.
Dualla I cant believe the progress theyve made. You shouldve seen it a month ago.
Apollo Well, Id still rather sleep in a warm bunk every night then muck around in this muck.
Dualla Bunks gonna be plenty warm tonight. He said yes.
Apollo He approved the transfer?
Starbuck_approaches_with_Anders You two just dont know how to keep a secret, do you? So what, are you guys here to see Baltar put a shovel in the ground?
Anders Join the celebration as we break ground for a better tomorrow.
Starbuck Aw, its such a load of crap.
Dualla Theres an open bar.
Starbuck Really? See, now why didnt you say so? Lee, you gotta let your better half do the talking for you, she gets right to the point. [
Roslin Didnt expect to find you playing in the sand.
Adama Its not sand. Its alluvial deposits. This used to be the river mouth.
Roslin And you just had to take off your shoes and play in the alluvial deposits. How romantic.
Adama Thats a nice color on you.
Roslin Thank you.
Adama Its good to see you, Laura.
Roslin_patting_his_shoulder You too, Bill.
Roslin There you are.
Adama Hey. How are you?
Roslin My father was an avid fight fan. I adored my father, so I love a good fight. I heard about your so-called dance. Accidentally, I might add.
Adama Dont take it personal. This is sort of a private tradition.
Roslin Tradition?
Adama Theres a lot of frustration aboard warships. Arguments become grudges, then end up being feuds. This allows them to let off some steam out in the open so everybody can participate. Rank doesnt matter. As long as you throw your tags in the box, everyones fair game.
Tigh Next up is Hotdog! Hotdog, get your butt up here and pick a partner.
Roslin Did you throw your tags in there?
Adama_laughing No. No. I wish. All the frustrations that I have...
Tigh whos your partner, Hotdog?
Hotdog Starbuck.
Starbuck You gotta be kidding me.
Baltar Thank you. Let this day be remembered as the day we broke ground for our new tomorrow.
Anders But no, it gets better.
Tigh Okay?
Anders Cause then they come back to the locker room with a set of handcuffs and two straws!
Tigh Did I ever tell you how glad I am I married you?
Ellen Not once.
Tigh Oh. Well, then Ill save it for a special occasion.
Ellen Come here.
Anders Hey, honey.
Starbuck Hey, baby. Hi.
Gaeta well have the infrastructure to deal with any unforeseen -- excuse me for just one moment. The finance minister just came by, and I should really...
Adama go ahead.
Roslin Oh, my Gods. I didnt think hed ever leave.
Adama_pulling_out_their_joint Hes a good kid.
Roslin Hmm. Indeed.
Adama You say this stuff grows around here?
Roslin Mm-hmm. In the mountains north of here theres this little stream that comes down into this lake the water is so clear its like looking through glass. Im thinking of building a cabin.
Roslin Mmm, it is good.
Roslin Thats a beautiful combination!
Grisky_a_deck_hand what I miss?
Chief Grisky, you done that bird already?
Grisky No, the gyros giving me trouble. Come on, Chief, Im the only one over there.
Chief Frak it, get yourself a drink.
Adama Ship down, Chief.
Chief Yeah, well get it tomorrow. Im figuring Ill give em a little R&R.
Adama_pouring_Chief_a_drink Congratulations. I may be jumping the gun, but... Heh! The first boy born on Galactica.
Chief Thats the thing I want to talk to you about, sir. Um, Cally doesnt want him born here. And neither do I. Not if he has a chance to grow up breathing fresh air.
Adama What are you saying?
Chief_taking_the_drink Thank you. Well, we both would like to request to be relieved of duty and settle on New Caprica.
Adama No, no way. Youre both here for the duration.
Roslin What?
Adama Can you hold these? Thank you.
Adama Chief. Get your fat, lazy ass up here.
Adama Make em tight.
Helo Yes, sir.
Chief_reassures_Cally Hes an old man, its fine. Hes not serious, anyways.
Tigh_to_Adama Sure about this? Its your funeral.
Adama Get up, Chief. Were just getting started.
Chief You know, I was thinking its probably better to have the baby on Galactica anyways. You know, theres, uh, sickbay, doctors, medicine.
Cally Yeah. No, itll be better. Well be happier.
Chief_kissing_her Yeah.
Starbuck Come on, Admiral!
Starbuck Hey, honey.
Anders Hey, baby. Hi.
Roslin Is this really it, Bill? Is this how were gonna spend all the rest of our days? Hmm?
Roslin Maybe we should just enjoy this.
Adama I am.
Roslin No, no, I mean enjoy being here on this planet as long as it lasts. I mean, maybe the Cylons come back, maybe they dont, but for now, right now... Weve got a break.
Adama Ive got people that want to get off the ship, move down here.
Roslin Cant say as I blame them. I mean, what are you gonna do?
Adama_to_Chief_on_the_floor This how you fight your enemies, Chief? This how you fight for your life? No excuses. Show me youre a soldier. Get up!
Chief Is that what you want? Is that what you want, Admiral?
Starbuck Nice, Admiral! The old mans got chops. He knows when to make his moves, when to hold back. I wish I could say the same for his son.
Starbuck Come on!
Apollo_with_liquor I bring offerings.
Starbuck Just in time. I was runnin on bingo fuel.
Apollo Wow, look at that. You literally drank Anders under the table.
Starbuck Wheres Dee?
Apollo Oh, she, uh, packed it in. To go pack.
Starbuck_chuckling Guess its just you and me then.
Apollo Yep. Its just you and me.
Apollo Come on, dad!
Cottle Thats bad. Thats enough already. You should quit.
Adama Just stop the blood.
Roslin Coagulant for the swelling and bleeding -- come on. You insist on doing this. You want to do this. Youre crazy, right? You want to do this?
Adama Yeah.
Roslin All right. Keep your guard up. Hes coming in wild. Get him with a left hook. You wanna win?
Adama Im not gonna win.
Kelly_working_on_Chief Watch his jab. His jabs killin you, all right...
Adama_approaching_with_Roslin Chief, good morning. Morning, Cally.
Chief Admiral.
Adama Ive been thinking about, uh, what you said. A Battlestars no place to raise a family. So Im gonna miss you, Chief. I wanna wish you good luck.
Chief Thank you, sir.
Adama My best to both of you.
Cally You mean it? Really? Thank you.
Adama I want you guys to have at least a dozen.
Cally_laughing Well see about that.
Adama_breathing_hard When you stand on this deck, you be ready to fight, or you dishonor the reason why were here. Now remember this: When you fight a man, hes not your friend. Same goes when you lead men. I forgot that once. I let you get too close. All of you. I dropped my guard. I gave some of you breaks, let some of you go, before the fight was really over. I let this crew and this family disband. And we paid the price in lives. That cant happen again.
Chief Grogosky. Youre with me. Lets get that bird back on the line.
Adama Madam President.
Roslin_taking_his_arm_and_walking_out_with_him Admiral.
Tigh All right, this dance is over. Get your booze and your dog tags and lets get out of here.
Starbuck So what, youre just gonna call it?
Tigh Not enough excitement for one night for you, Captain?
Apollo Its over, Kara.
Starbuck So what? You have the guts to try and frak another mans woman but not to fight one? [
Starbuck Truth stings, dont it?
Apollo You want a fight, Captain. You got it.
Starbuck Come on. You afraid to hit me? Or maybe you cant.
Starbuck_pointing_at_a_clearing Check it out. Its a great place for a house.
Apollo So youre really gonna give up flying.
Starbuck Ah, flyings gonna suck now anyway. Lots of training, endless CAPs. The wars over. [
Apollo Gimme a tour of the future life of Kara Anders.
Starbuck Im not getting married.
Apollo Well, then -- then whats the point, Kara? I mean, you love him, right?
Starbuck Where are we going with this, Lee?
Apollo Well, now, thats the question, isnt it-- where are we going? I mean, what if this-- this is it? The rest of your life, Kara. Is this how you want to spend it? Is this who you want to spend it with?
Anders_entering Whats going on?
Dualla Whats it look like?
Anders Looks like theyre trying to kill each other.
Dualla Thats one perspective.
Starbuck_laughing Well, that makes things more complicated.
Apollo Yeah.
Starbuck What are we gonna do?
Apollo What are we gonna do? We accept it. Tomorrow, I tell Dualla, you tell Sam.
Starbuck Just like that?
Apollo Just like that.
Starbuck Whispering: I dont know.
Apollo Yeah, we tell them how we feel. We shout it to the skies.
Starbuck_laughing Yeah, right. Mm-hmm.
Apollo Well, you... You dont think I will?
Starbuck Mm-mm.
Apollo_laughing Wait. My name is Lee Adama, and I love Kara Thrace!
Starbuck Calm down!
Apollo Well, its not like anybodyll hear. Were in your cabin in the forest, right?
Starbuck_giggling Ah.
Apollo I love Kara Thrace! And I dont care who frakking knows!
Starbuck_as_they_both_laugh Oh, youre crazy. Get down.
Apollo Well, come on. Im not gonna stop until you get up and do it too.
Starbuck I cant.
Apollo_giggling Im gonna-- Okay, here we go again. Lee Adama...
Starbuck Okay, shh! Okay. Ka -- Kara Thrace loves Lee Adama!
Helo Get up! Starbuck get up, you can do this.
Apollo Morning, Admiral.
Adama You look like you had a good time.
Apollo Yeah, it was some party.
Adama Yeah, well, its been a hell of a morning too. You missed all the excitement.
Apollo Theres problems upstairs?
Adama No. No, good things. Kara got married. Believe that?
Apollo What?
Adama Yep, bout an hour ago. Found herself a priest, went down by the river and got married.
Adama You okay?
Adama Can you believe that? [
Anders Hey, man. Did you hear the news? were hitched. We got married. Can you believe it?
Apollo No. No, I cant believe it.
Anders Yeah. No, it was crazy. She comes down, and she wakes me up. She pops the question, she drags me down to the priest, and, bang, like that, were married.
Apollo So it was your idea.
Starbuck_apologetically Yeah. It was my idea.
Anders Do you guys... Do you guys want a minute to, uh, you know, talk?
Apollo_shaking_his_hand Congratulations, Sam.
Anders Yeah.
Apollo And good luck. [
Kat Watch that pretty face!
Starbuck I missed you.
Apollo_thickly I missed you too. I missed you too.
