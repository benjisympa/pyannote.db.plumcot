colonel_saul_tigh I feel like Im abandoning my post.
admiral_william_adama Time to pack it in, Saul. You know it. More than half the crews down on New Caprica already. Were not really doing too much up here anymore. Good luck.
officer_anastasia_dualla Oh, my Gods. Its a Cylon fleet. They found us.
admiral_william_adama Theres only way that this mission ends, and thats with the successful rescue of our people off of New Caprica.
admiral_william_adama You brought em home, Saul.
colonel_saul_tigh Not all of them.
cpt_lee_adama What about us?
captain_kara_thrace There is no us. All right? There is nothing here. Do you get that? Nothing!
captain_kara_thrace Lee, when are you gonna get yourself a girl?
cpt_lee_adama Im doing fine, thank you.
captain_kara_thrace Youre not still frakkin Dualla, are you?
cpt_lee_adama I am proud to serve with you, Lieutenant. And to call you my wife.
captain_kara_thrace Im in a different place now. I just want to hurt someone, and it might as well be you.
captain_kara_thrace That was exactly what I needed.
samuel_anders Glad to be of service.
captain_kara_thrace Damn it.
samuel_anders Looking for this?
captain_kara_thrace Ahem. Yeah.
samuel_anders Kara, I want you back. I want our marriage back. I want a real marriage.
captain_kara_thrace And what if Im just not ready for that?
samuel_anders I dont know. Then I guess youll never be. Maybe because Im not what you really want after all.
captain_kara_thrace Im late for the dance. [
louanne_katraine Get that right up, Lee!
captain_kara_thrace If it isnt the fighting Agathons, huh?
captain_karl_agathon Starbuck, late to the party as usual.
captain_kara_thrace At least I got here in time to watch you kick the CAGs ass.
louanne_katraine Lee, you got him. You just got to keep your right up.
captain_karl_agathon Hes a tough little frakker, Ill give him that. Hes springing like hes got it in for me.
lt_sharon_valerii Stay off the ropes.
captain_karl_agathon All right.
Kat_with_Lee#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode09 Stick and move. Just stay off the ropes. All right, you got him.
captain_kara_thrace Well, look at that. A couple months ago you wouldve had to roll him into this ring.
lt_sharon_valerii Well, not anymore. You know, with a cooler head, he might have half a chance.
captain_kara_thrace Come on.
colonel_saul_tigh Fisher! Fisher, youre up!
captain_kara_thrace Good fight. Bit off a little more than you can chew, huh? Oh, come on, Lee. Dont be that way. Stick around. The nights young.
cpt_lee_adama Well, I guess then youll just have to enjoy it without me.
captain_kara_thrace Pulling your tags out so soon?
cpt_lee_adama Im done, Kara.
captain_kara_thrace Im not.
cpt_lee_adama Now whos biting off more than they can chew, Captain?
captain_kara_thrace Not me from where Im standing, Major.
cpt_lee_adama Excuse me.
officer_anastasia_dualla I cant believe the progress theyve made. You shouldve seen it a month ago.
cpt_lee_adama Well, Id still rather sleep in a warm bunk every night then muck around in this muck.
officer_anastasia_dualla Bunks gonna be plenty warm tonight. He said yes.
cpt_lee_adama He approved the transfer?
captain_kara_thrace You two just dont know how to keep a secret, do you? So what, are you guys here to see Baltar put a shovel in the ground?
samuel_anders Join the celebration as we break ground for a better tomorrow.
captain_kara_thrace Aw, its such a load of crap.
officer_anastasia_dualla Theres an open bar.
captain_kara_thrace Really? See, now why didnt you say so? Lee, you gotta let your better half do the talking for you, she gets right to the point. [
president_laura_roslin Didnt expect to find you playing in the sand.
admiral_william_adama Its not sand. Its alluvial deposits. This used to be the river mouth.
president_laura_roslin And you just had to take off your shoes and play in the alluvial deposits. How romantic.
admiral_william_adama Thats a nice color on you.
president_laura_roslin Thank you.
admiral_william_adama Its good to see you, Laura.
president_laura_roslin You too, Bill.
president_laura_roslin There you are.
admiral_william_adama Hey. How are you?
president_laura_roslin My father was an avid fight fan. I adored my father, so I love a good fight. I heard about your so-called dance. Accidentally, I might add.
admiral_william_adama Dont take it personal. This is sort of a private tradition.
president_laura_roslin Tradition?
admiral_william_adama Theres a lot of frustration aboard warships. Arguments become grudges, then end up being feuds. This allows them to let off some steam out in the open so everybody can participate. Rank doesnt matter. As long as you throw your tags in the box, everyones fair game.
colonel_saul_tigh Next up is Hotdog! Hotdog, get your butt up here and pick a partner.
president_laura_roslin Did you throw your tags in there?
admiral_william_adama No. No. I wish. All the frustrations that I have...
colonel_saul_tigh whos your partner, Hotdog?
Hotdog#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode09 Starbuck.
captain_kara_thrace You gotta be kidding me.
dr_gaius_baltar Thank you. Let this day be remembered as the day we broke ground for our new tomorrow.
samuel_anders But no, it gets better.
colonel_saul_tigh Okay?
samuel_anders Cause then they come back to the locker room with a set of handcuffs and two straws!
colonel_saul_tigh Did I ever tell you how glad I am I married you?
ellen_tigh Not once.
colonel_saul_tigh Oh. Well, then Ill save it for a special occasion.
ellen_tigh Come here.
samuel_anders Hey, honey.
captain_kara_thrace Hey, baby. Hi.
lt_felix_gaeta well have the infrastructure to deal with any unforeseen -- excuse me for just one moment. The finance minister just came by, and I should really...
admiral_william_adama go ahead.
president_laura_roslin Oh, my Gods. I didnt think hed ever leave.
admiral_william_adama Hes a good kid.
president_laura_roslin Hmm. Indeed.
admiral_william_adama You say this stuff grows around here?
president_laura_roslin Mm-hmm. In the mountains north of here theres this little stream that comes down into this lake the water is so clear its like looking through glass. Im thinking of building a cabin.
president_laura_roslin Mmm, it is good.
president_laura_roslin Thats a beautiful combination!
Grisky_a_deck_hand#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode09 what I miss?
chief_galen_tyrol Grisky, you done that bird already?
Grisky#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode09 No, the gyros giving me trouble. Come on, Chief, Im the only one over there.
chief_galen_tyrol Frak it, get yourself a drink.
admiral_william_adama Ship down, Chief.
chief_galen_tyrol Yeah, well get it tomorrow. Im figuring Ill give em a little R&R.
admiral_william_adama Congratulations. I may be jumping the gun, but... Heh! The first boy born on Galactica.
chief_galen_tyrol Thats the thing I want to talk to you about, sir. Um, Cally doesnt want him born here. And neither do I. Not if he has a chance to grow up breathing fresh air.
admiral_william_adama What are you saying?
chief_galen_tyrol Thank you. Well, we both would like to request to be relieved of duty and settle on New Caprica.
admiral_william_adama No, no way. Youre both here for the duration.
president_laura_roslin What?
admiral_william_adama Can you hold these? Thank you.
admiral_william_adama Chief. Get your fat, lazy ass up here.
admiral_william_adama Make em tight.
captain_karl_agathon Yes, sir.
chief_galen_tyrol Hes an old man, its fine. Hes not serious, anyways.
colonel_saul_tigh Sure about this? Its your funeral.
admiral_william_adama Get up, Chief. Were just getting started.
chief_galen_tyrol You know, I was thinking its probably better to have the baby on Galactica anyways. You know, theres, uh, sickbay, doctors, medicine.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Yeah. No, itll be better. Well be happier.
chief_galen_tyrol Yeah.
captain_kara_thrace Come on, Admiral!
captain_kara_thrace Hey, honey.
samuel_anders Hey, baby. Hi.
president_laura_roslin Is this really it, Bill? Is this how were gonna spend all the rest of our days? Hmm?
president_laura_roslin Maybe we should just enjoy this.
admiral_william_adama I am.
president_laura_roslin No, no, I mean enjoy being here on this planet as long as it lasts. I mean, maybe the Cylons come back, maybe they dont, but for now, right now... Weve got a break.
admiral_william_adama Ive got people that want to get off the ship, move down here.
president_laura_roslin Cant say as I blame them. I mean, what are you gonna do?
admiral_william_adama This how you fight your enemies, Chief? This how you fight for your life? No excuses. Show me youre a soldier. Get up!
chief_galen_tyrol Is that what you want? Is that what you want, Admiral?
captain_kara_thrace Nice, Admiral! The old mans got chops. He knows when to make his moves, when to hold back. I wish I could say the same for his son.
captain_kara_thrace Come on!
cpt_lee_adama I bring offerings.
captain_kara_thrace Just in time. I was runnin on bingo fuel.
cpt_lee_adama Wow, look at that. You literally drank Anders under the table.
captain_kara_thrace Wheres Dee?
cpt_lee_adama Oh, she, uh, packed it in. To go pack.
captain_kara_thrace Guess its just you and me then.
cpt_lee_adama Yep. Its just you and me.
cpt_lee_adama Come on, dad!
dr_cottle Thats bad. Thats enough already. You should quit.
admiral_william_adama Just stop the blood.
president_laura_roslin Coagulant for the swelling and bleeding -- come on. You insist on doing this. You want to do this. Youre crazy, right? You want to do this?
admiral_william_adama Yeah.
president_laura_roslin All right. Keep your guard up. Hes coming in wild. Get him with a left hook. You wanna win?
admiral_william_adama Im not gonna win.
Kelly_working_on_Chief#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode09 Watch his jab. His jabs killin you, all right...
admiral_william_adama Chief, good morning. Morning, Cally.
chief_galen_tyrol Admiral.
admiral_william_adama Ive been thinking about, uh, what you said. A Battlestars no place to raise a family. So Im gonna miss you, Chief. I wanna wish you good luck.
chief_galen_tyrol Thank you, sir.
admiral_william_adama My best to both of you.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson You mean it? Really? Thank you.
admiral_william_adama I want you guys to have at least a dozen.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Well see about that.
admiral_william_adama When you stand on this deck, you be ready to fight, or you dishonor the reason why were here. Now remember this: When you fight a man, hes not your friend. Same goes when you lead men. I forgot that once. I let you get too close. All of you. I dropped my guard. I gave some of you breaks, let some of you go, before the fight was really over. I let this crew and this family disband. And we paid the price in lives. That cant happen again.
chief_galen_tyrol Grogosky. Youre with me. Lets get that bird back on the line.
admiral_william_adama Madam President.
president_laura_roslin Admiral.
colonel_saul_tigh All right, this dance is over. Get your booze and your dog tags and lets get out of here.
captain_kara_thrace So what, youre just gonna call it?
colonel_saul_tigh Not enough excitement for one night for you, Captain?
cpt_lee_adama Its over, Kara.
captain_kara_thrace So what? You have the guts to try and frak another mans woman but not to fight one? [
captain_kara_thrace Truth stings, dont it?
cpt_lee_adama You want a fight, Captain. You got it.
captain_kara_thrace Come on. You afraid to hit me? Or maybe you cant.
captain_kara_thrace Check it out. Its a great place for a house.
cpt_lee_adama So youre really gonna give up flying.
captain_kara_thrace Ah, flyings gonna suck now anyway. Lots of training, endless CAPs. The wars over. [
cpt_lee_adama Gimme a tour of the future life of Kara Anders.
captain_kara_thrace Im not getting married.
cpt_lee_adama Well, then -- then whats the point, Kara? I mean, you love him, right?
captain_kara_thrace Where are we going with this, Lee?
cpt_lee_adama Well, now, thats the question, isnt it-- where are we going? I mean, what if this-- this is it? The rest of your life, Kara. Is this how you want to spend it? Is this who you want to spend it with?
samuel_anders Whats going on?

samuel_anders Looks like theyre trying to kill each other.
officer_anastasia_dualla Thats one perspective.
captain_kara_thrace Well, that makes things more complicated.
cpt_lee_adama Yeah.
captain_kara_thrace What are we gonna do?
cpt_lee_adama What are we gonna do? We accept it. Tomorrow, I tell Dualla, you tell Sam.
