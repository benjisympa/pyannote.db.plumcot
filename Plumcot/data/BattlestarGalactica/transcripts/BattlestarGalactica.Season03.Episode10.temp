Kat Previously on
Kat I was burnt out. I started taking stims.
Starbuck Whats this? Stims. And by the look of her, shes been taking em by the handful.
Kat No! Let go!
Kat You know, coming in late for a briefing cause youre hung over, thats bad enough. But when you back out of a mission...
Starbuck See, unlike you, I dont take a bunch of pills and then climb in my cockpit so wired that I cant land the frakkin ship.
Kat Starbuck, youre an embarrassment.
Adama I need you back in the CIC. Just aint the same without you in there intimidating the inmates.
Tigh Oh, Im not...
Baltar There are only 12 Cylon models, but in the entire occupation on New Caprica I only saw seven. Who are the final five?
Caprica I cant talk about that.
Baltar do you have any idea what its talking about?
Caprica most Cylons think the conscious mind of the Hybrid has simply gone mad, and the vocalizations we hear are meaningless.
Baltar But not everyone thinks that.
Biers You will delete the order from your logs... Execute.
Three Its okay, its okay.
Biers Theres something beautiful -- miraculous -- between life and death.
Roslin you mean theres no food to be salvaged? What about the good food we had stored before we started inadvertently churning out the contaminated stuff?
Adama The newly processed bad food went into the depleted storage system. Everythings tainted.
Cottle but Sharons out finding all this algae for us to process. Its tough to choke down, but its almost pure protein.
Roslin What if Sharon comes back and reports theres no clear passage to this planet?
Adama Then the question is, Doc, how long can we survive?
Cottle With the rations weve been on, Id say seven to ten days.
Roslin When is she due back?
Helo She was due three hours ago. The, um...the radiation levels are high, but shes strong and -- shes, um -- shell be here any moment.
Kat_from_a_top_bunk Im sorry, guys. I dont have anything.
Starbuck To share.
Kat I told you, Starbuck, I dont have anything. Get off my back.
Starbuck Yeah, I saw a protein bar on your cot.
Kat I gave it to Cottle.
Starbuck Right. Right after I gave him head.
Kat Oh, so what now Im a liar?
Starbuck If the shoe fits ...
Apollo All right, all right, can it! Kat, get down here. [
Kat_to_Hotdog Here, baby, eat this.
Racetrack Oh, my Gods, thats good.
Baltar somewhere to be, DAnna?
Three Shh. Dont wake Caprica. Look, Id love to hang around with you two all day, but Ive got things to do.
Baltar Ill never understand what you all do all day, living on this thing like fleas on a cat. Where do you suppose she takes herself off to then?
Caprica_sleepily Youre not the only one asking that.
Baltar Im not? What do you mean?
Caprica Shes been doing things.
Baltar Doing things? What things?
Sharon Theres a way through the star cluster. And I found the planet on the other side. I skimmed it and I took photos. Theres huge swaths of algae, just like we thought.
Helo_of_the_rad_badge Its black.
Apollo Shes a Cylon. She can handle a radiation dose that big.
Helo We think. Someone call Cottle!
Sharon Im fine.
Adama For you, maybe. A human might not be able to make it.
Apollo So then how do we get tens of thousands of humans through there?
Sharon_indicating_table_models So we can make it through in two jumps with a stop right there.
Helo Theres not a solution with a single jump?
Sharon No, the clusters too big. And its too big to go around too.
Apollo But the civvie ships arent shielded enough to jump in the middle of all that radiation. I would say 80% of the people onboard would die.
Roslin Can we send Galactica for food?
Helo And put her where?
Roslin What do you mean?
Gaeta It would take dozens of return trips. Each time wed leave the fleet vulnerable to attack. We just cant bring the food to the people.
Roslin What if we bring the people to the food? Put the people on Galactica. Send the civilian ships with skeleton crew, give them radiation meds.
Apollo Except that the radiation would fry the civvie ships nav systems. They wouldnt be able to see squat on dradis. There wouldnt even be a way to calculate a jump out.
Sharon its worse than that. once you jump in, the light is so blinding you begin to drift. And before you can get your bearings ... [
Apollo no visual contact. Instruments blinded. Radiation. Theyd get lost. Theyd burn up.
Apollo Pilot ship.
Adama We pair a Raptor with each civilian ship.
Apollo Raptor navigation systems are hardened against nuclear strikes. They can handle the radiation.
Adama Each Raptor could lead a civilian ship through the cluster. Then they both jump out together. Question is... how many jumps will it take?
Apollo Five round trips.
Apollo You heard. Five round trips. on our outbound jumps well each be responsible for relaying jump coordinates to our own specific civilian ship, nailing them to their jump points, and insuring they dont drift off.
Racetrack Sir, are we gonna get fed when we get there?
Apollo Eventually, yes, but after we find the algae and get it processed.
Kat Whoa...
Apollo The truth is that nausea from the radiation exposure will take care of our appetites. [
Starbuck Remember, were all flying solo on this mission. So that means therell be nobody there to bitch slap you if you start to get tired or start seeing little toasters on your wing. Well be issuing stims, so use em.
Kat What? Are you crazy? We cant use stims.
Apollo Kat, do you have a problem?
Kat Stims amp up your metabolism. Weve got nothing to burn. You put stims in our systems, were gonna be flying into the sides of the ships.
Random_Pilot Is that true? Theyd mess us up?
Starbuck You used to like the stims, Kat.
Apollo All right, personal discretion on the stims. Were taking the first load of civilians on board as we speak. Thats it. Skids up in four hours.
Dualla There is no food here. There are no rations anywhere on this ship. If someone told you there was food, they were lying. If you leave this area, force will be used. [
Enzo_smiling Sasha!
Kat My name isnt Sasha. My names Captain Louanne Katraine. You understand me? Sasha -- and you -- were a lifetime ago.
Enzo Right. Right, because you have this [
Kat Stay away from me. Do you understand me?
Enzo_calling_after_her Do they even know who you really are?
Baltar Oh, fancy bumping into you here. Can you believe Im lost again? Ill never find my way around this place. Where have you been?
Three Ive been talking with Simon about our next move toward Earth. Theres some debate about it, apparently.
Baltar Of course, if I spoke to the relevant Simon hed actually ascertain you were at this meeting?
Baltar I hear that youve been going off by yourself. Doing things.
Three Really? Now who would tell you anything about my business?
Baltar So its true.
Three Caprica?
Baltar Did you know you have some dried goo in your hair? That can happen when you resurrect. You know, now Im beginning to understand just what youve been doing with yourself all these afternoons.
Three_pulling_him_into_a_niche Do you have any idea of what you are accusing me of?
Baltar Yes. Intentionally killing yourself over and over so you can download over and over. But deaths just a revolving door, isnt it?
Kat_pulling_Enzo_into_a_niche Come here!
Enzo Ooh!
Kat What do you want?
Enzo Take it down a notch, baby. Relax. Im not looking for a business partner.
Kat Look, I told you to stay the frak away from me.
Enzo Yeah, because if they find out who you really are theyll kick you out of the service. Or worse. Now, do you think that I want that? I dont want that, cause that happens, whos gonna feed me? [
Kat We dont. And I dont have anything stashed, Enzo --
Enzo_forehead_on_hers yeah, sure you dont. Oh, we go back, baby. Since when is it a crime to take care of your own? Huh? Inhales deeply: Remember, I know who you are. And I know how to make you happy. [
Kat_leaving Get your hands off of me.
Random_Marine Colonel.
Deck_Officers_with_scattered_applause Welcome back, sir. Welcome, sir. [
Tigh Enough! Dont you people have jobs to do?
Adama Welcome back, Colonel.
Tigh Admiral.
Hoshi Apollo, Galactica. Launch Raptors on your orders.
Apollo Shepherds, find your sheep. Stay close, and never let them go. These crews are counting on us to guide them through.
Starbuck Apollo, Starbuck. on station.
Kat Ive got visual on Chiron.
Hotdog Hotdog, Adriatic in sight.
Apollo okay. When you jump into the cluster, you will be disoriented. Take it one step at a time. Find your sheep, work the jump calculations, and get them out. Remember, we do not stay beyond our radiation dose limit.
Hoshi Apollo reports pilots in position, sir.
Adama Initiate jump on his command. Galactica will follow.
Gaeta aye, aye, sir.
Apollo Raptors, Apollo. We jump on my mark. 3, 2...
Gaeta Jumping.)
Apollo 1...mark.
Apollo Whoa! What is this? I cant see anything.
Kat Frak. Whoa! Oh, frak.
Kat Ah, gotcha!
Apollo Kat, you got yours?
Kat Affirmative, Apollo. only got eyes for the Chiron. Relaying coordinates.
Apollo Squadron, Apollo. I have Theta Sita. Relaying jump coordinates to her right now.
Starbuck Apollo, Starbuck. Ive got mine. Frak, Im just barely holding on here.
Hotdog I lost mine. Anyone seen Adriatic? She has lost her jump coordinates.
Apollo Whos that, Hotdog? Negative. Negative, Hotdog. Negative on Adriatic.
Helo Hotdog, Hotdog, just ease up on the control, man. Ease up on the stick. This is not a viper.
Hotdog Frak it, frak it!
Helo youll find her, man. Use visual.
Adama Apollo, this is Galactica actual. Youve reached your radiation dose limit. Weve got to jump. Count us down!
Apollo Roger that, Galactica.
Hotdog No, hold on! Apollo, please wait!
Apollo Hotdog, listen to me! We have to get out of here now.
Hotdog I can find them! Wait! I can find em!
Apollo you will jump on my mark. Starbuck, jump on my mark with or without your ship.
Apollo 1, 2, 3...
Hotdog No, please wait! We cant leave without em!
Hotdog Frak! Frak!
Gaeta Jump complete. Dradis is back online. Ship reports moderate hull damage.)
Apollo Galactica, Apollo. First trip complete. Raptors, land your birds, debrief your pilots, and prepare to jump back for the second group of civilians.
Gaeta We lost the Adriatic.
Tigh Its only our first jump.
Adama Yes, it is.
Kat Carina, Kat! Report your location.
Apollo Kat, Apollo. Do you have the Carina?
Kat Negative! Radiations pissing on my nav! Frak... Hold it, I found her! [
Apollo Kat. Kat, report!
Kat Godsdamn it!
Apollo All right. Kat, Apollo. Times up. We are jumping. on mark. 3, 2, 1, mark!
Kat Godsdamn it, Carina! I lost it. I lost it.
Apollo All right, we managed to get another eight ships through. But we still lost one. We gotta get better at tracking our sheep. Quicker reaction times out of the jumps. Racetrack, dont be calling out coordinates to the wrong ship.
Racetrack I got mixed up.
Apollo Keep checking your instruments and rechecking.
Kat The instruments are crap.
Apollo All right, that concludes outbound four. This is return four. one to go. All right, get some rest.
Tigh These are the reports from the doc. 100 marines too weak to work. 200 more ready to drop.
Adama Its gonna slow down the harvest.
Tigh The last batch of passengers kicked up some trouble. You get these people to the other side, they think theres a diner and a chef waiting to take their order.
Adama Ohh. When they gonna learn they gotta process the thing first, for fraks sake?
Tigh Try telling that to a bunch of empty stomachs.
Adama I hear theyre still eating paper. Is that true?
Tigh No. Paper shortage.
Adama Not a good sign!
Tigh No, sir.
Baltar So when you resurrect you see the faces of the final five Cylons? The ones that no ones seen.
Three Why do you want to know about them?
Baltar I could be a Cylon. I would stop being a traitor to one set of people, and be a hero to another. And have a place to belong. You would help me understand my destiny. Have you seen my face?
Three Your face?
Baltar Yes, my face.
Three Cant remember. [
Baltar Cylons, humans. Were all just trying to discover who we are. Arent we?
Starbuck Hey, Enzo.
Enzo ...Yeah.
Kat I took the name Louanne Katraine from a girl who died two days before the attack on Caprica. Got me through the background checks.
Starbuck Yeah, times were rough. Keep going.
Kat I was a drug runner. Enzo was my supplier. What do you want, we were truckers, okay? We just moved stuff.
Starbuck People. You see, some think that thats the way that the Cylons infiltrated Caprica. They seeded themselves throughout the Outer Colonies, and then they used criminals to get them into the capital. Anyone whos found guilty of helping the Cylons is considered a traitor.
Kat We didnt carry Cylons.
Starbuck How do you know?
Kat Because nobody knew that they looked like us.
Starbuck Then how do you know you didnt? [
Kat You think Im a traitor. You think Im a traitor?
Starbuck No. I dont think youre a traitor. Youre a smart young woman, thats what the old man said. [
Kat_begins_to_weep Starbuck, dont tell the admiral. Please. Please dont, or I --
Starbuck Or what?
Kat Starbuck, please just let me tell him myself. Please just let me. Can you do that?
Starbuck_disgusted Gods.
Hybrid one degree angle nominal seascape portrait of the womanchild cavern of the soul under pressure-heat ratio ides of evolutions have buried their fears...
Baltar So this is where you got the idea to start intentionally downloading.
Hybrid Gestalt therapy and escape clauses.
Baltar Right, lets see what we can find out.
Hybrid Throughout history the nexus between man and machine has spun some of the most dramatic compelling... and entertaining fiction.
Three Gaius. What do you think youre doing? [
Hybrid_grabbing_his_hand Intelligence. A mind that burns like a fire.
Baltar Yes, Im here.
Hybrid Find the hand that lies in the shadow of the light. In the eye of the husband of the eye of the cow.
Three You all right? It just speaks nonsense, doesnt it?
Baltar I dont think anything it says is nonsense. The husband of the eye of the eye of the -- Hera. Hera, sometimes referred to as cow-eyed Hera. And the husband of Hera ...
Three ...Is Jupiter. The eye of Jupiter. Well, thats written about in the ancient texts. My God. Could their be a connection between their Gods and ours? What does it mean?
Baltar Its a location. A planet hidden in the shadow of light -- probably a cluster of stars -- thatll lead us to the eye of Jupiter. And to the hand ... hidden in the shadow of light. Probably some type of artifact.
Three Hand.
Baltar As in five. Five faces. Now all we have to do is find the right planet. In a star cluster.
Starbuck_echoing Accept who you are. Accept who you are.
Enzo_touches_Kat Yeah. Remember me?
Kat Yeah. Yeah, I remember you. Thieving bastard. Youll ruin everything I got. Come here.
Kat Faru Sadin, report your location.
Apollo Kat, you got Faru Sadin? Kat, you got Faru Sadin? Kat? Kat, report!
Kat Negative.
Apollo Kat.
Kat Frak! I lost the Faru Sadin!
Dualla Sir, escalating damage reports shipwide. Engineers are reporting a cascade of pressure failures.
Tigh Jump spots become unstable. We gotta get out of here.
Adama Open line.
Hoshi Aye, sir. Channel open.
Adama Apollo, Galactica actual. Jump all. Repeat, jump all.
Apollo All right, Admirals calling it. Everyone, jump on my mark.
Kat Im not losing another one.
Apollo 3, 2, 1, mark!
Starbuck Apollo, Starbuck. I dont see Kat.
Adama Report.
Hoshi Were missing Faru Sadin. And one Raptor.
Gaeta its Kat. She mustve missed the order. Shes still out there.
Adama Damn.
Kat Faru Sadin, this is Kat. Report your location. [
Tigh come on, kid. Come on home.
Hoshi Its them! She brought em home.
Kat Galactica, Kat. Mission accomplished.
Starbuck They said you wanted to see me.
Kat Yeah. ...I dont think we should end the way we ended.
Starbuck Listen, um... everybodys... everybody is stuck with the things that theyre not proud of. That, uh...that thing about good people, I... Um, I didnt mean that.
Kat Yeah, I know.
Starbuck_taking_out_a_small_bottle Here. Take these. Sleeping pills. [
Kat Thank you.
Starbuck_breaking_into_tears I gotta go.
Kat Admiral, I -- I know, Im so sorry...
Adama Im not here to lecture. Im letting you know about a promotion. Im making you CAG again.
Kat_crying Sir, you know Im not getting out of here, right?
Adama You earned it. What you did was harder than facing a bullet. And you did it without putting one other soul in harms way. Dont know if I couldve done that. I wish there something more that I could give you.
Kat No. Its good. Id like to be CAG very much. Thank you. [
Adama I dont need to know anything other than what I already know. When you were CAG, you protected your people. Made them feel safe enough to be brave. What you were gonna say, does it change that?
Kat Are you...you staying?
Adama Oh, Im staying. I love this sickbay in a way. [
Kat Did you want a girl too?
Adama Yeah. Threes a good round number.
