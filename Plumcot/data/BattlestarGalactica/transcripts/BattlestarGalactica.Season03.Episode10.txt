louanne_katraine Previously on
louanne_katraine I was burnt out. I started taking stims.
captain_kara_thrace Whats this? Stims. And by the look of her, shes been taking em by the handful.
louanne_katraine No! Let go!
louanne_katraine You know, coming in late for a briefing cause youre hung over, thats bad enough. But when you back out of a mission...
captain_kara_thrace See, unlike you, I dont take a bunch of pills and then climb in my cockpit so wired that I cant land the frakkin ship.
louanne_katraine Starbuck, youre an embarrassment.
admiral_william_adama I need you back in the CIC. Just aint the same without you in there intimidating the inmates.
colonel_saul_tigh Oh, Im not...
dr_gaius_baltar There are only 12 Cylon models, but in the entire occupation on New Caprica I only saw seven. Who are the final five?
number_six I cant talk about that.
dr_gaius_baltar do you have any idea what its talking about?
number_six most Cylons think the conscious mind of the Hybrid has simply gone mad, and the vocalizations we hear are meaningless.
dr_gaius_baltar But not everyone thinks that.
danna_biers You will delete the order from your logs... Execute.
danna_biers Its okay, its okay.
danna_biers Theres something beautiful -- miraculous -- between life and death.
president_laura_roslin you mean theres no food to be salvaged? What about the good food we had stored before we started inadvertently churning out the contaminated stuff?
admiral_william_adama The newly processed bad food went into the depleted storage system. Everythings tainted.
dr_cottle but Sharons out finding all this algae for us to process. Its tough to choke down, but its almost pure protein.
president_laura_roslin What if Sharon comes back and reports theres no clear passage to this planet?
admiral_william_adama Then the question is, Doc, how long can we survive?
dr_cottle With the rations weve been on, Id say seven to ten days.
president_laura_roslin When is she due back?
captain_karl_agathon She was due three hours ago. The, um...the radiation levels are high, but shes strong and -- shes, um -- shell be here any moment.
louanne_katraine Im sorry, guys. I dont have anything.
captain_kara_thrace To share.
louanne_katraine I told you, Starbuck, I dont have anything. Get off my back.
captain_kara_thrace Yeah, I saw a protein bar on your cot.
louanne_katraine I gave it to Cottle.
captain_kara_thrace Right. Right after I gave him head.
louanne_katraine Oh, so what now Im a liar?
captain_kara_thrace If the shoe fits ...
cpt_lee_adama All right, all right, can it! Kat, get down here. [
louanne_katraine Here, baby, eat this.
racetrack Oh, my Gods, thats good.
dr_gaius_baltar somewhere to be, DAnna?
danna_biers Shh. Dont wake Caprica. Look, Id love to hang around with you two all day, but Ive got things to do.
dr_gaius_baltar Ill never understand what you all do all day, living on this thing like fleas on a cat. Where do you suppose she takes herself off to then?
number_six Youre not the only one asking that.
dr_gaius_baltar Im not? What do you mean?
number_six Shes been doing things.
dr_gaius_baltar Doing things? What things?
lt_sharon_valerii Theres a way through the star cluster. And I found the planet on the other side. I skimmed it and I took photos. Theres huge swaths of algae, just like we thought.
captain_karl_agathon Its black.
cpt_lee_adama Shes a Cylon. She can handle a radiation dose that big.
captain_karl_agathon We think. Someone call Cottle!
lt_sharon_valerii Im fine.
admiral_william_adama For you, maybe. A human might not be able to make it.
cpt_lee_adama So then how do we get tens of thousands of humans through there?
lt_sharon_valerii So we can make it through in two jumps with a stop right there.
captain_karl_agathon Theres not a solution with a single jump?
lt_sharon_valerii No, the clusters too big. And its too big to go around too.
cpt_lee_adama But the civvie ships arent shielded enough to jump in the middle of all that radiation. I would say 80% of the people onboard would die.
president_laura_roslin Can we send Galactica for food?
captain_karl_agathon And put her where?
president_laura_roslin What do you mean?
lt_felix_gaeta It would take dozens of return trips. Each time wed leave the fleet vulnerable to attack. We just cant bring the food to the people.
president_laura_roslin What if we bring the people to the food? Put the people on Galactica. Send the civilian ships with skeleton crew, give them radiation meds.
cpt_lee_adama Except that the radiation would fry the civvie ships nav systems. They wouldnt be able to see squat on dradis. There wouldnt even be a way to calculate a jump out.
lt_sharon_valerii its worse than that. once you jump in, the light is so blinding you begin to drift. And before you can get your bearings ... [
cpt_lee_adama no visual contact. Instruments blinded. Radiation. Theyd get lost. Theyd burn up.
cpt_lee_adama Pilot ship.
admiral_william_adama We pair a Raptor with each civilian ship.
cpt_lee_adama Raptor navigation systems are hardened against nuclear strikes. They can handle the radiation.
admiral_william_adama Each Raptor could lead a civilian ship through the cluster. Then they both jump out together. Question is... how many jumps will it take?
cpt_lee_adama Five round trips.
cpt_lee_adama You heard. Five round trips. on our outbound jumps well each be responsible for relaying jump coordinates to our own specific civilian ship, nailing them to their jump points, and insuring they dont drift off.
racetrack Sir, are we gonna get fed when we get there?
cpt_lee_adama Eventually, yes, but after we find the algae and get it processed.
louanne_katraine Whoa...
cpt_lee_adama The truth is that nausea from the radiation exposure will take care of our appetites. [
captain_kara_thrace Remember, were all flying solo on this mission. So that means therell be nobody there to bitch slap you if you start to get tired or start seeing little toasters on your wing. Well be issuing stims, so use em.
louanne_katraine What? Are you crazy? We cant use stims.
cpt_lee_adama Kat, do you have a problem?
louanne_katraine Stims amp up your metabolism. Weve got nothing to burn. You put stims in our systems, were gonna be flying into the sides of the ships.
Random_Pilot#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode10 Is that true? Theyd mess us up?
captain_kara_thrace You used to like the stims, Kat.
cpt_lee_adama All right, personal discretion on the stims. Were taking the first load of civilians on board as we speak. Thats it. Skids up in four hours.
officer_anastasia_dualla There is no food here. There are no rations anywhere on this ship. If someone told you there was food, they were lying. If you leave this area, force will be used. [
enzo Sasha!
louanne_katraine My name isnt Sasha. My names Captain Louanne Katraine. You understand me? Sasha -- and you -- were a lifetime ago.
enzo Right. Right, because you have this [
louanne_katraine Stay away from me. Do you understand me?
enzo Do they even know who you really are?
dr_gaius_baltar Oh, fancy bumping into you here. Can you believe Im lost again? Ill never find my way around this place. Where have you been?
danna_biers Ive been talking with Simon about our next move toward Earth. Theres some debate about it, apparently.
dr_gaius_baltar Of course, if I spoke to the relevant Simon hed actually ascertain you were at this meeting?
dr_gaius_baltar I hear that youve been going off by yourself. Doing things.
danna_biers Really? Now who would tell you anything about my business?
dr_gaius_baltar So its true.
danna_biers Caprica?
dr_gaius_baltar Did you know you have some dried goo in your hair? That can happen when you resurrect. You know, now Im beginning to understand just what youve been doing with yourself all these afternoons.
danna_biers Do you have any idea of what you are accusing me of?
dr_gaius_baltar Yes. Intentionally killing yourself over and over so you can download over and over. But deaths just a revolving door, isnt it?
louanne_katraine Come here!
enzo Ooh!
louanne_katraine What do you want?
enzo Take it down a notch, baby. Relax. Im not looking for a business partner.
louanne_katraine Look, I told you to stay the frak away from me.
enzo Yeah, because if they find out who you really are theyll kick you out of the service. Or worse. Now, do you think that I want that? I dont want that, cause that happens, whos gonna feed me? [
louanne_katraine We dont. And I dont have anything stashed, Enzo --
enzo yeah, sure you dont. Oh, we go back, baby. Since when is it a crime to take care of your own? Huh? Inhales deeply: Remember, I know who you are. And I know how to make you happy. [
louanne_katraine Get your hands off of me.
Random_Marine#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode10 Colonel.
Deck_Officers_with_scattered_applause#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode10 Welcome back, sir. Welcome, sir. [
colonel_saul_tigh Enough! Dont you people have jobs to do?
admiral_william_adama Welcome back, Colonel.
colonel_saul_tigh Admiral.
lt_louis_hoshi Apollo, Galactica. Launch Raptors on your orders.
cpt_lee_adama Shepherds, find your sheep. Stay close, and never let them go. These crews are counting on us to guide them through.
captain_kara_thrace Apollo, Starbuck. on station.
louanne_katraine Ive got visual on Chiron.
lt_brendan_constanza Hotdog, Adriatic in sight.
cpt_lee_adama okay. When you jump into the cluster, you will be disoriented. Take it one step at a time. Find your sheep, work the jump calculations, and get them out. Remember, we do not stay beyond our radiation dose limit.
lt_louis_hoshi Apollo reports pilots in position, sir.
admiral_william_adama Initiate jump on his command. Galactica will follow.
lt_felix_gaeta aye, aye, sir.
cpt_lee_adama Raptors, Apollo. We jump on my mark. 3, 2...
lt_felix_gaeta Jumping.)
cpt_lee_adama 1...mark.
cpt_lee_adama Whoa! What is this? I cant see anything.
louanne_katraine Frak. Whoa! Oh, frak.
louanne_katraine Ah, gotcha!
cpt_lee_adama Kat, you got yours?
louanne_katraine Affirmative, Apollo. only got eyes for the Chiron. Relaying coordinates.
cpt_lee_adama Squadron, Apollo. I have Theta Sita. Relaying jump coordinates to her right now.
captain_kara_thrace Apollo, Starbuck. Ive got mine. Frak, Im just barely holding on here.
lt_brendan_constanza I lost mine. Anyone seen Adriatic? She has lost her jump coordinates.
cpt_lee_adama Whos that, Hotdog? Negative. Negative, Hotdog. Negative on Adriatic.
captain_karl_agathon Hotdog, Hotdog, just ease up on the control, man. Ease up on the stick. This is not a viper.
lt_brendan_constanza Frak it, frak it!
captain_karl_agathon youll find her, man. Use visual.
admiral_william_adama Apollo, this is Galactica actual. Youve reached your radiation dose limit. Weve got to jump. Count us down!
cpt_lee_adama Roger that, Galactica.
lt_brendan_constanza No, hold on! Apollo, please wait!
cpt_lee_adama Hotdog, listen to me! We have to get out of here now.
lt_brendan_constanza I can find them! Wait! I can find em!
cpt_lee_adama you will jump on my mark. Starbuck, jump on my mark with or without your ship.
cpt_lee_adama 1, 2, 3...
lt_brendan_constanza No, please wait! We cant leave without em!
lt_brendan_constanza Frak! Frak!
lt_felix_gaeta Jump complete. Dradis is back online. Ship reports moderate hull damage.)
cpt_lee_adama Galactica, Apollo. First trip complete. Raptors, land your birds, debrief your pilots, and prepare to jump back for the second group of civilians.
lt_felix_gaeta We lost the Adriatic.
colonel_saul_tigh Its only our first jump.
admiral_william_adama Yes, it is.
louanne_katraine Carina, Kat! Report your location.
cpt_lee_adama Kat, Apollo. Do you have the Carina?
louanne_katraine Negative! Radiations pissing on my nav! Frak... Hold it, I found her! [
cpt_lee_adama Kat. Kat, report!
louanne_katraine Godsdamn it!
cpt_lee_adama All right. Kat, Apollo. Times up. We are jumping. on mark. 3, 2, 1, mark!
louanne_katraine Godsdamn it, Carina! I lost it. I lost it.
cpt_lee_adama All right, we managed to get another eight ships through. But we still lost one. We gotta get better at tracking our sheep. Quicker reaction times out of the jumps. Racetrack, dont be calling out coordinates to the wrong ship.
racetrack I got mixed up.
cpt_lee_adama Keep checking your instruments and rechecking.
louanne_katraine The instruments are crap.
cpt_lee_adama All right, that concludes outbound four. This is return four. one to go. All right, get some rest.
colonel_saul_tigh These are the reports from the doc. 100 marines too weak to work. 200 more ready to drop.
admiral_william_adama Its gonna slow down the harvest.
colonel_saul_tigh The last batch of passengers kicked up some trouble. You get these people to the other side, they think theres a diner and a chef waiting to take their order.
admiral_william_adama Ohh. When they gonna learn they gotta process the thing first, for fraks sake?
colonel_saul_tigh Try telling that to a bunch of empty stomachs.
admiral_william_adama I hear theyre still eating paper. Is that true?
colonel_saul_tigh No. Paper shortage.
admiral_william_adama Not a good sign!
colonel_saul_tigh No, sir.
dr_gaius_baltar So when you resurrect you see the faces of the final five Cylons? The ones that no ones seen.
danna_biers Why do you want to know about them?
dr_gaius_baltar I could be a Cylon. I would stop being a traitor to one set of people, and be a hero to another. And have a place to belong. You would help me understand my destiny. Have you seen my face?
danna_biers Your face?
dr_gaius_baltar Yes, my face.
danna_biers Cant remember. [
dr_gaius_baltar Cylons, humans. Were all just trying to discover who we are. Arent we?
captain_kara_thrace Hey, Enzo.
enzo ...Yeah.
louanne_katraine I took the name Louanne Katraine from a girl who died two days before the attack on Caprica. Got me through the background checks.
captain_kara_thrace Yeah, times were rough. Keep going.
louanne_katraine I was a drug runner. Enzo was my supplier. What do you want, we were truckers, okay? We just moved stuff.
captain_kara_thrace People. You see, some think that thats the way that the Cylons infiltrated Caprica. They seeded themselves throughout the Outer Colonies, and then they used criminals to get them into the capital. Anyone whos found guilty of helping the Cylons is considered a traitor.
louanne_katraine We didnt carry Cylons.
captain_kara_thrace How do you know?
louanne_katraine Because nobody knew that they looked like us.
captain_kara_thrace Then how do you know you didnt? [
louanne_katraine You think Im a traitor. You think Im a traitor?
captain_kara_thrace No. I dont think youre a traitor. Youre a smart young woman, thats what the old man said. [
louanne_katraine Starbuck, dont tell the admiral. Please. Please dont, or I --
captain_kara_thrace Or what?
louanne_katraine Starbuck, please just let me tell him myself. Please just let me. Can you do that?
captain_kara_thrace Gods.
the_hybrid one degree angle nominal seascape portrait of the womanchild cavern of the soul under pressure-heat ratio ides of evolutions have buried their fears...
dr_gaius_baltar So this is where you got the idea to start intentionally downloading.
the_hybrid Gestalt therapy and escape clauses.
dr_gaius_baltar Right, lets see what we can find out.
the_hybrid Throughout history the nexus between man and machine has spun some of the most dramatic compelling... and entertaining fiction.
danna_biers Gaius. What do you think youre doing? [
Hybrid_grabbing_his_hand#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode10 Intelligence. A mind that burns like a fire.
dr_gaius_baltar Yes, Im here.
the_hybrid Find the hand that lies in the shadow of the light. In the eye of the husband of the eye of the cow.
danna_biers You all right? It just speaks nonsense, doesnt it?
dr_gaius_baltar I dont think anything it says is nonsense. The husband of the eye of the eye of the -- Hera. Hera, sometimes referred to as cow-eyed Hera. And the husband of Hera ...
danna_biers ...Is Jupiter. The eye of Jupiter. Well, thats written about in the ancient texts. My God. Could their be a connection between their Gods and ours? What does it mean?
dr_gaius_baltar Its a location. A planet hidden in the shadow of light -- probably a cluster of stars -- thatll lead us to the eye of Jupiter. And to the hand ... hidden in the shadow of light. Probably some type of artifact.
danna_biers Hand.
dr_gaius_baltar As in five. Five faces. Now all we have to do is find the right planet. In a star cluster.
captain_kara_thrace Accept who you are. Accept who you are.
enzo Yeah. Remember me?
louanne_katraine Yeah. Yeah, I remember you. Thieving bastard. Youll ruin everything I got. Come here.
louanne_katraine Faru Sadin, report your location.
cpt_lee_adama Kat, you got Faru Sadin? Kat, you got Faru Sadin? Kat? Kat, report!
louanne_katraine Negative.
cpt_lee_adama Kat.
louanne_katraine Frak! I lost the Faru Sadin!
officer_anastasia_dualla Sir, escalating damage reports shipwide. Engineers are reporting a cascade of pressure failures.
colonel_saul_tigh Jump spots become unstable. We gotta get out of here.
admiral_william_adama Open line.
lt_louis_hoshi Aye, sir. Channel open.
admiral_william_adama Apollo, Galactica actual. Jump all. Repeat, jump all.
cpt_lee_adama All right, Admirals calling it. Everyone, jump on my mark.
louanne_katraine Im not losing another one.
cpt_lee_adama 3, 2, 1, mark!
captain_kara_thrace Apollo, Starbuck. I dont see Kat.
admiral_william_adama Report.
lt_louis_hoshi Were missing Faru Sadin. And one Raptor.
lt_felix_gaeta its Kat. She mustve missed the order. Shes still out there.
admiral_william_adama Damn.
louanne_katraine Faru Sadin, this is Kat. Report your location. [
colonel_saul_tigh come on, kid. Come on home.
lt_louis_hoshi Its them! She brought em home.
louanne_katraine Galactica, Kat. Mission accomplished.
captain_kara_thrace They said you wanted to see me.
louanne_katraine Yeah. ...I dont think we should end the way we ended.
captain_kara_thrace Listen, um... everybodys... everybody is stuck with the things that theyre not proud of. That, uh...that thing about good people, I... Um, I didnt mean that.
louanne_katraine Yeah, I know.
captain_kara_thrace Here. Take these. Sleeping pills. [
louanne_katraine Thank you.
captain_kara_thrace I gotta go.
louanne_katraine Admiral, I -- I know, Im so sorry...
admiral_william_adama Im not here to lecture. Im letting you know about a promotion. Im making you CAG again.
louanne_katraine Sir, you know Im not getting out of here, right?
admiral_william_adama You earned it. What you did was harder than facing a bullet. And you did it without putting one other soul in harms way. Dont know if I couldve done that. I wish there something more that I could give you.
louanne_katraine No. Its good. Id like to be CAG very much. Thank you. [
admiral_william_adama I dont need to know anything other than what I already know. When you were CAG, you protected your people. Made them feel safe enough to be brave. What you were gonna say, does it change that?
louanne_katraine Are you...you staying?
admiral_william_adama Oh, Im staying. I love this sickbay in a way. [
louanne_katraine Did you want a girl too?
admiral_william_adama Yeah. Threes a good round number.
