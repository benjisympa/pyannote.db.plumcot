Apollo My name is Lee Adama, and I love Kara Thrace!
Anders Did you hear the news? We got married, can you believe it?
Apollo No. No, I cant believe it.
Apollo Congratulations, Sam. And good luck. Youre gonna need it.
Starbuck I missed you.
Apollo I missed you too.
Doral The childs life must be protected at all costs.
Biers the first Cylon-human hybrid. It truly is a miracle from God.
Roslin This child will not be raised by the Cylon and I cannot risk Cylon agents getting ahold of her. Ive made my decision.
Cottle We lost her. We did the best we could, but shes dead. And thats all there is to it.
Roslin as far as the Cylons know, this child no longer exists. That is a good, good thing.
Chip_Six Its Hera. The first of Gods new generation.
Baltar Have you seen the faces of the other five Cylons? The ones that no one has seen?
Three Why do you want to know about them?
Baltar I could be a Cylon.
Racetrack I thought our food supply was inexhaustible.
Apollo The food manufacturing systems been contaminated. If we just hold on until Athena gets back, this algae can keep us alive indefinitely.
Sharon Theres a way through the star cluster. And I found the planet. Theres huge swathes of algae, just like we thought.
Anders Fourteen-inch intake.
Chief Yeah, thats great.
Man Two-meter extensions.
Marine just pack em and stack em -- yes, right there.
Woman Ive got your meter reading for the light...
Chief All right -- this can go on the first Raptor, all that can go on the second one.
Chief Need a hand?
Anders Oh, yeah.
Chief Couple more days, we can wrap this up. Get away from this stench. It stinks as bad up here as it does down there.
Anders At least it tastes as good as it smells.
Chief Well, its breakfast, lunch, and dinner until someone finds a hot fudge planet. [
Apollo Who the hell is that?
Dualla Starbuck, Im guessing. Third time this week. Its amazing how she keeps landing on the top of the pilot rotation.
Apollo Donut runs are assigned off a coin flip. Kara probably thinks shes running a stream of bad luck. I should probably get over there.
Dualla Im gonna skip the meet and greet this time, if you dont mind.
Apollo Sure.
Apollo You brought her in a little hot, dont you think?
Starbuck Yeah well had I know I was being graded I would have thrown in a couple barrel rolls. [
Apollo this is insane, you know?
Starbuck Mm, thats just the way I like it.
Cally Should we start emptying the tents?
Chief Uh, yeah. Get this cleared up first. And then get to the tents.
Cally Okay. Here. Ready?
Apollo I can barely look Dee in the eye. We gotta do something about that.
Starbuck Okay, like what?
Apollo I dont know. Like divorce.
Starbuck No. Hmm-mm.
Apollo Oh, come on, lets get real here. You said yourself things were bad. Your marriage was failing.
Starbuck Yeah, but marriage is a sacrament. Its not a pyramid game, you dont -- you dont get do-overs, Lee. I made a vow in the sight of the Gods, and Im not gonna break that.
Apollo Youre breaking it every time we do this. [
Starbuck_chuckling Divorce is different. This is just bending the rules.
Apollo_breaking_off No, Im sorry. I cant -- I cant... I cant live like this. Every time I look at my wife, I see my own guilt reflected in her eyes.
Starbuck Wow. Wow, Lee, that is really poetic of you. But you dont need to make that big of a deal out of this.
Apollo Well, it is a big deal, Kara. It is. It is.
Starbuck Great. So, I wont divorce, and you wont cheat. So where does that leave us?
Apollo Trapped.
Baltar Who were the Final Five? I could be a Cylon.
Boomer Shes not well.
Baltar Whats the matter, Hera? [
Chief Our initial radiocarbon dating suggests that the temples at least 4,000 years old, which lines up with the exodus of the Thirteenth Tribe.
Chief Yeah. I recognize it from the books in my fathers study, Madame President. He was a priest, and the Temple of Five was an important part of our faith. Well, his faith anyways.
Chief You got me, Madame President. All I know is the stuff I kinda remember from sneaking into my dads study when he wasnt looking.
Adama the Eye of Jupiter? What are we talking about?
Chief According to the Scriptures, its a marker that was left behind by the Thirteenth Tribe. Its supposed to point the way to Earth.
Adama Chief, were on alert. [
Gaeta Admiral. Lieutenant Gaeta, CIC. We have multiple dradis contacts. Four Cylon baseships just jumped into view.
Adama on our way.
Roslin Sitrep.
Tigh Four baseships inbound at high speed.
Adama Four?
Tigh The bastards practically jumped right on top of us.
Hoshi Fleets spooling up their FTL drives, sir. Preparing to jump to emergency stand-by coordinates on your command.
Adama Do it.
Hoshi Aye, sir.
Adama We gotta hold this position until everyones back on board.
Roslin How many are down there?
Adama Enough.
Roslin Admiral, if the Eye of Jupiter is somewhere in that temple, and it really is a marker on the way to Earth... We cant let the Cylons get their hands on it.
Adama Stand by to launch Vipers.
Tigh Somethings odd here. The Cylons arent launching Raiders. The baseships are standing off outside of weapons range.
Roslin That is odd.
Hoshi Admiral. Its the Cylon baseship, requesting to speak with you.
Adama Put it through the speaker. [
Baltar Admiral, I cant tell you what a genuine pleasure it is to hear your voice. [
Roslin I cant believe were allowing Cylons on this ship.
Adama They must want something pretty bad, or else they would have started shooting as soon as they jumped in.
Roslin Well, why would they send Baltar? Theyve gotta know we wont believe a word he says.
Adama He can say whatever he wants. The longer he talks, the more time we have to get Lee and his people off the planet.
Chip_Six Feels like old times, doesnt it?
Baltar I cant believe how much I actually miss this place.
Chip_Six You know you cant return. Theyd toss you out the nearest airlock and then throw a party.
Baltar Yes, I know. Still, I cant help feeling Im finally... Home.
Chip_Six If youre really a Cylon, a member of the Final Five, these feelings are just part of your programming. Part of your cover.
Baltar And if Im a human being after all, if Im not one of the Final Five, then this is the last chance I ever get to see my kind again.
Sharon Colonel, wait.
Cavil Well, look at this. Should we salute?
Tigh Thats Boomer.
Tigh The one who shot the old man. Well, you just lost your visiting privileges. Hold that thing here until we get back.
Marines_cocking_guns Yes sir.
Tigh_to_the_party You three keep on moving.
Baltar_in_tears Laura. [
Biers The weapons are hardly necessary.
Cavil Yes, exactly. We come in peace.
Roslin What do you want?
Three We want the Eye of Jupiter. So lets just skip all the denials and protestations, and go straight to what we know -- that you have people on the ground. And we know that youve found the original settlement of the Thirteenth Tribe.
Cavil It also doesnt take a lot of deduction to conclude that the only reason you havent cut your losses and jumped away by now, is that you probably found the artifact, but you havent been able to retrieve it yet. Is that about right, Madame President?
Roslin We have our people on the surface, were not leaving them behind.
Cavil Thats a touching, but not very convincing idea.
Baltar Look the chances that weve all converged on this small planet at the same time are infinitesimally small. so we all understand its not chance. You want the eye. The Cylons want the eye. I would like to discuss the practical issues that come to hand -- and there are some -- so that we can reach some accommodation.
Roslin_still_not_looking_at_him The less this man says, the better this will go.
Baltar Wait a minute. If it wasnt for me, the Cylons would have blown you out of the sky two seconds after wed arrived.
Roslin_leaving I think you can handle this alone -- if you can stomach it.
Baltar So Ive saved your life... again. How many times is that now? Because Im beginning to lose count. If it wasnt for me, youd all be dead!
Adama Whats your offer?
Three You give us the Eye of Jupiter... we let you go.
Cavil And...well throw in Baltar.
Baltar What are you talking about now?
Baltar Whats he saying?
Cavil Im improvising. Throw in something, sweeten the pot. In fact Im suspecting that the admiral and Madame President would enjoy some nice, quiet, private time with their former leader. Am I right?
Tigh worth thinking about.
Adama Definitely worth thinking about.
Boomer Despite that uniform, its not your home anymore.
Sharon Ive made my choice, and I know where my loyalties lie.
Boomer_coming_closer What if I told you that your daughter was still alive?
Sharon Id say you were lying.
Boomer Well, someones lying. But its not me. Heras alive. At least for now. Shes ill, and we dont know why.
Sharon Yeah, right.
Boomer Baltar found her on New Caprica during the evacuation. Shes on our baseship right now. From what we could gather, she was hidden at Laura Roslins school, which means that she probably planned the whole thing in the first place.
Sharon I dont need to listen to this. [
Boomer_as_Sharons_leaving They let you think that she was dead. You dont do that to a person, you do that to a thing. Thats what your friends think of you, Sharon. Youre not one of them. Youre a thing!
Adama Were not giving you the key to finding Earth.
Biers You try bringing it up from that planet and see what happens. We outnumber you four to one.
Adama_getting_right_in_her_face Im setting the terms now. Make any attempt to attack this ship or the people on the planets surface, Ill launch every nuke Ive got. Lay waste to the entire continent.
Biers Youre bluffing. You want to find Earth as much as we do.
Adama Guards, escort them back to their ship.
Marine yes sir.
Apollo It would help if I knew what I was looking for: does it look like an eye?
Roslin I dont know, Lee. Ive looked at the Scriptures, and they make reference to the Eye being left in some sort of temple. But theres no physical description.
Adama All we know for sure is it supposedly points the way to Earth.
Apollo And you believe that?
Adama The Cylons do. I cant take a chance that theyre right. If it looks like theyre going to get into the Temple, your order is to blow it.
Apollo Understood. Whats my timeframe...
Apollo whats going on?
Starbuck The Cylons are jamming the wireless. Every frequency.
Apollo Okay, we need to establish our communications ... work out a plan to defend this Temple while Tyrol searches.
Starbuck Defend it with what? A dozen Marines? Maybe five more military?
Apollo Were gonna have to draft the civilians.
Starbuck Can I make a suggestion that you wont like?
Apollo Do you make any other kind?
Starbuck Use Sam to command the civilians.
Apollo Youre not serious.
Anders Lee.
Apollo Hey, Sam.
Starbuck Hey.
Anders Heard you were coming down. Guess it takes an emergency to get us in the same room these days.
Starbuck Can we do this later please?
Apollo Sam, I need you to command the civilians, form them into fire teams. Ill give my deployment orders through Sergeant...
Anders Whoa, whoa, whoa. Deployment orders? Fire teams? Come on, some of these guys have never even held a rifle before.
Apollo Well, youve supposed to be the expert in turning civilians into soldiers.
Anders Oh, no, no. We were guerilla fighters. All right? Hit and run. Keep moving, keep the enemy off balance. Ive never had to defend a fixed position. Thats a whole different game.
Apollo Well, then, youre just gonna have to learn it fast, because thats what were doing. Were defending this fixed position. Until the Chief finds his Eye of Jupiter.
Anders Oh okay, so you want us to risk our lives for something that you havent even found yet?!
Apollo Listen, Sam, Im not even sure it exists. But I dont have to tell you every little Godsdamn detail...
Anders You know what you have to explain to me?
Starbuck Hey, hey, hey. Honey -- the Majors in charge on this one, okay? Okay?
Anders Uh-huh. Well, I certainly wouldnt want to step between you and your Major.
Apollo Well I thought that went really well.
Starbuck Hell do it.
Apollo Hed better.
Cally I miss Nicky. Do you think hes okay?
Chief Yes, hes fine. Hes on Galactica. Hes fine.
Cally I hope.
Chief I hated everything about the faith. The rules, the rituals. The endless discussions at the dinner table. I used to sneak into my moms prayer room. You know, Holiest of the Holies. I would dance around naked with porn magazines, just to defy the Gods and tell them to frak off. [
Cally You should see the look on your face when youre in here. Theres this... reverence. You even talk softer.
Chief I feel something in here. Something true. But here I am setting charges in this special place. Holiest of the holies. This is... The Temple of Five. If my parents could see this. And Im gonna blow it up.
Gaeta I noticed some anomalies in the solar radiation belt. I made an analysis of the stars vibrational modes. Sure enough, it appears to be highly unstable. If you can believe it, on the verge of going supernova.
Adama When?
Gaeta Could be tomorrow. Could be next year. Theres no way of knowing for sure, sir. When it does happen, the only warning that were likely to get is a fast helium flash, at which point well have to jump out of here before it obliterates the entire planetary system. Sir, I am not one to look for religious signs. But I cant get my head around these odds. That human and Cylon both converge on this planet at this exact moment just as the stars about to go supernova...
Adama Im not a religious person, Mr. Gaeta, as you both know. So if this is the work of a higher power then they have one hell of a sense of humor.
Cavil We have a standoff; very predictable. They have the Eye, and theyll nuke it if we try to take it. And well shoot them down if they try bringing it up to Galactica.
Leoben Are we sure they have it? How do we know theyre not bluffing?
Baltar You dont.
Biers We Threes feel that we cant afford to take the chance.
Cavil I think were missing the big picture here. We have the opportunity to rid the universe of the human pestilence once and for all.
Caprica We can discuss that after we get the Eye of Jupiter. After we find the path to Earth.
Cavil Let me point out that it doesnt matter if we find Earth in five days, or if we find Earth in 5,000 years. Were machines. Well still be around to savor the great miracle. So let them destroy the Eye. If, indeed, they have it. We have to take advantage of the situation and take down Galactica once and for all. [
Biers Were not doing nothing, Cavil. Plans are in motion.
Baltar Im sorry, what does that mean?
Caprica Danna?
Biers I put a heavy raider down on the planets surface as soon as we jumped in. I thought that would be our best chance of slipping by their dradis. It seems I was right.
Caprica Is there any particular reason the rest of us werent involved in this decision?
Biers It was a need to know mission. So now I am telling you, because you need to know. The point is, we have cut off their troops communications, and weve put our own troops on the ground. So as soon as our centurions retrieve the eye, you can take out Galactica.
Anders Okay, heres the deal. Were out of options. The Cylons have got us pinned on this rock, and our only way out of here is to hold this place until Galactica can send a rescue party. So Ive divided you into two teams, okay? Team one is gonna be distributing ammunition throughout the camp. Team two is gonna be making homemade tylium mines. I know thats not glamorous work, but were going to need the extra firepower in case the Cylons decide to take a shot at us. Look, I know some of you are scared. And thats okay, cause Im scared too. But if we keep our heads, and we do our jobs, we can do this. And we can all get out of here in one piece. Now, Barolay has a list of your names and your assignments. Make sure you get with her. See you outside.
Apollo That was good. Honest. Youd make a good officer.
Apollo Im not really sure what you think is going on here.
Anders Dont insult me, okay? Im not stupid. I know how she is. Weve been married for a year and a half. What, do you think youre the first? I chose to marry Kara. Thats my business. I dont know what the hell you think youre trying to do.
Apollo Im trying to fight a war. Im trying to get these people off this rock in one piece.
Anders Anything for the cause,
Hybrid ...I dont care if it rains or freezes, as long as... the five lights of the apocalypse rising scenes revealed only to those who enter the temple only to the chosen one the chosen one the chosen one the chosen one the chosen one the chosen one the chosen one the chosen one end of line. Until next time ... the eye the eye the eye look into the eye to know thyself.
Biers Gaius, I am on the verge of seeing the faces of the Final Five Cylons. Maybe the face of God himself. [
Caprica_entering What truth?
Biers Caprica.
Caprica Id like to think that we three have shared something. Transcended the barriers that separate people. And yet, somehow, the more time goes on, the more I find myself on the outside looking in.
Baltar Well, thats not the case at all. Is it? Because we three, were integral. Were part of...
Biers Were finished. Baltars and my destiny lie separate from yours, Caprica. [
Caprica What are you after? What is this secret that you keep pursuing? You have to tell me the truth. I love you both.
Biers We love you too. But this is something you cannot share with us.
Caprica Something I cant share with you? [
Baltar Now, look, you mustnt misunderstand. Its not personal. Its transcendent. Its like what you said: its transcendent.
Biers Pray for us, Caprica. Well be praying for you.
Dualla Okay, he wants us to set up forward observation posts that are hard-wired back to base for communications. The ops are gonna be staggered at strategic locations, giving us as much warning as possible, if there is a Cylon advance. Since we only have one Raptor, Captain Thrace will fly point.
Starbuck Oh, joy.
Dualla Wireless is dead, so if you do make contact, do not engage. Have them relay the information back to command. Be sure to note force strength, direction of march, and position.
Starbuck I have flown recon once or twice, Lieutenant.
Dualla Griggs, you and Varrick are gonna set up an observation post here. Annick and Ditko, You go here....
Starbuck And who gets lucky number three?
Dualla That will be Sergeant Finsher and me. Do you have a problem with that, Captain?
Starbuck ...No.
Dualla We go in an hour.
Dualla Green base, foxfire one. Green base, foxfire one. We are open for business. Over.
Starbuck Son of a bitch. [
Dualla Shes relaying a message... Its Centurions. [
Adama Laura.
Roslin What?
Adama The Cylon we know as Boomer arrived with the others. She told our Sharon that her child was alive, and that she was on board one of the Cylon baseships. And that she had been seen on New Caprica in your school.
Roslin_softly The child is alive. Yes. Yes, the child was at the school. Yes, I kept her there. [
Helo Do you have any idea what weve gone through? You, of all people, know ... what its like to lose a child.
Adama The difference is your childs still alive. And eventually, I hope you become grateful of that.
Sharon_shrugging_off_Helos_attempt_to_comfort_her I want to see her.
Anders What do you mean shes gone down. Gone down where?
Apollo Somewhere in the north valley. Get your men on the line. Theyre coming from the north.
Anders Whoa, whoa whoa. Were gonna set up a rescue party, right?
Apollo Ah, no. We dont have the manpower. We have to defend the position.
Anders Lee, she could be dying out there.
Apollo Yeah, I know that, Sam. I know. But we are thin on the ground here, and the Cylons are on the march. We cant help her. We have to hold our positions.
Anders Are you out of your frakkin mind?
Tigh Just picked up six heavy Raiders falling away from the Cylon Fleet, definitely heading down toward the planet.
Roslin I dont get it. Theyd have to know we see them.
Tigh Theyre testing us. Want to know if were bluffing about nuking the planet.
Roslin Well, unfortunately we are bluffing.
Adama_still_angry Are we. Mr. Hoshi.
Hoshi Aye, sir.
Adama Order nuclear ground-strike missiles in launch tubes 4 through 10.
Hoshi Aye, sir. [
Mathias The Majors right. We dont have any troops to spare if were gonna hold this position.
Anders Screw this position! Listen, we can take those hills, use guerilla tactics. Thats what Ive been talking about this whole time.
Apollo Well, that is not the mission. We have our orders. We are stronger--
Anders What are you, some Godsdamn wind-up tin soldier? This is my wife were talking about.
Apollo I know who she is! And I have known her and cared about her a hell of a lot longer than you!
Anders You can do whatever the frak you want! I am going after my wife!
Gaeta Missiles are loaded, Admiral.
Adama Open launch tube doors.
Gaeta Doors are open, Admiral.
Roslin What are you doing?
Adama Getting ready to nuke the planet.
Six Radiological detection. Theyve opened their missile doors.
Cavil Hes bluffing.
Apollo I cant let you do that, Sam.
Anders I am not asking you for permission.
Apollo Sergeant Mathias.
Adama Load target package 3-bravo. Set ground zero for the underground structure.
Roslin Are we prepared to sacrifice Lee?
Eight Theyre loading a targeting package.
Cavil Its a bluff. Dont let him rattle you.
Leoben The risk to us is unacceptable. Turn back the Raiders.
Three The ships cannot turn back. He wont launch it. And DAnna was explicit that she and Baltar make it to the planets surface.
Caprica So is that what all this is really about?
Chief And the heavens opened up, and they saw the Eye. But where is that frakking Eye?
Anders Are you kidding me? Are you gonna shoot me now?
Apollo I cant let you go. I need you on the line. I need you commanding those civilians. Im sorry, Sam, but you cannot go.
Anders Im sorry too, Major, but you cant stop me.
Adama Release of nuclear weapons is now authorized.
Tigh Sir.
