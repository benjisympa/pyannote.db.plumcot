cpt_lee_adama My name is Lee Adama, and I love Kara Thrace!
samuel_anders Did you hear the news? We got married, can you believe it?
cpt_lee_adama No. No, I cant believe it.
cpt_lee_adama Congratulations, Sam. And good luck. Youre gonna need it.
captain_kara_thrace I missed you.
cpt_lee_adama I missed you too.
Doral#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode11 The childs life must be protected at all costs.
danna_biers the first Cylon-human hybrid. It truly is a miracle from God.
president_laura_roslin This child will not be raised by the Cylon and I cannot risk Cylon agents getting ahold of her. Ive made my decision.
Cottle#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode11 We lost her. We did the best we could, but shes dead. And thats all there is to it.
president_laura_roslin as far as the Cylons know, this child no longer exists. That is a good, good thing.
Chip_Six#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode11 Its Hera. The first of Gods new generation.
dr_gaius_baltar Have you seen the faces of the other five Cylons? The ones that no one has seen?
Three#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode11 Why do you want to know about them?
dr_gaius_baltar I could be a Cylon.
Racetrack#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode11 I thought our food supply was inexhaustible.
cpt_lee_adama The food manufacturing systems been contaminated. If we just hold on until Athena gets back, this algae can keep us alive indefinitely.
lt_sharon_valerii Theres a way through the star cluster. And I found the planet. Theres huge swathes of algae, just like we thought.
samuel_anders Fourteen-inch intake.
chief_galen_tyrol Yeah, thats great.
Man#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode11 Two-meter extensions.
marine_sgt_fischer just pack em and stack em -- yes, right there.
Woman#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode11 Ive got your meter reading for the light...
chief_galen_tyrol All right -- this can go on the first Raptor, all that can go on the second one.
chief_galen_tyrol Need a hand?
samuel_anders Oh, yeah.
chief_galen_tyrol Couple more days, we can wrap this up. Get away from this stench. It stinks as bad up here as it does down there.
samuel_anders At least it tastes as good as it smells.
chief_galen_tyrol Well, its breakfast, lunch, and dinner until someone finds a hot fudge planet. [
cpt_lee_adama Who the hell is that?
officer_anastasia_dualla Starbuck, Im guessing. Third time this week. Its amazing how she keeps landing on the top of the pilot rotation.
cpt_lee_adama Donut runs are assigned off a coin flip. Kara probably thinks shes running a stream of bad luck. I should probably get over there.
officer_anastasia_dualla Im gonna skip the meet and greet this time, if you dont mind.
cpt_lee_adama Sure.
cpt_lee_adama You brought her in a little hot, dont you think?
captain_kara_thrace Yeah well had I know I was being graded I would have thrown in a couple barrel rolls. [
cpt_lee_adama this is insane, you know?
captain_kara_thrace Mm, thats just the way I like it.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Should we start emptying the tents?
chief_galen_tyrol Uh, yeah. Get this cleared up first. And then get to the tents.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Okay. Here. Ready?
cpt_lee_adama I can barely look Dee in the eye. We gotta do something about that.
captain_kara_thrace Okay, like what?
cpt_lee_adama I dont know. Like divorce.
captain_kara_thrace No. Hmm-mm.
cpt_lee_adama Oh, come on, lets get real here. You said yourself things were bad. Your marriage was failing.
captain_kara_thrace Yeah, but marriage is a sacrament. Its not a pyramid game, you dont -- you dont get do-overs, Lee. I made a vow in the sight of the Gods, and Im not gonna break that.
cpt_lee_adama Youre breaking it every time we do this. [
captain_kara_thrace Divorce is different. This is just bending the rules.
cpt_lee_adama No, Im sorry. I cant -- I cant... I cant live like this. Every time I look at my wife, I see my own guilt reflected in her eyes.
captain_kara_thrace Wow. Wow, Lee, that is really poetic of you. But you dont need to make that big of a deal out of this.
cpt_lee_adama Well, it is a big deal, Kara. It is. It is.
captain_kara_thrace Great. So, I wont divorce, and you wont cheat. So where does that leave us?
cpt_lee_adama Trapped.
dr_gaius_baltar Who were the Final Five? I could be a Cylon.
lt_sharon_valerii Shes not well.
dr_gaius_baltar Whats the matter, Hera? [
chief_galen_tyrol Our initial radiocarbon dating suggests that the temples at least 4,000 years old, which lines up with the exodus of the Thirteenth Tribe.
chief_galen_tyrol Yeah. I recognize it from the books in my fathers study, Madame President. He was a priest, and the Temple of Five was an important part of our faith. Well, his faith anyways.
chief_galen_tyrol You got me, Madame President. All I know is the stuff I kinda remember from sneaking into my dads study when he wasnt looking.
admiral_william_adama the Eye of Jupiter? What are we talking about?
chief_galen_tyrol According to the Scriptures, its a marker that was left behind by the Thirteenth Tribe. Its supposed to point the way to Earth.
admiral_william_adama Chief, were on alert. [
lt_felix_gaeta Admiral. Lieutenant Gaeta, CIC. We have multiple dradis contacts. Four Cylon baseships just jumped into view.
admiral_william_adama on our way.
president_laura_roslin Sitrep.
colonel_saul_tigh Four baseships inbound at high speed.
admiral_william_adama Four?
colonel_saul_tigh The bastards practically jumped right on top of us.
lt_louis_hoshi Fleets spooling up their FTL drives, sir. Preparing to jump to emergency stand-by coordinates on your command.
admiral_william_adama Do it.
lt_louis_hoshi Aye, sir.
admiral_william_adama We gotta hold this position until everyones back on board.
president_laura_roslin How many are down there?
admiral_william_adama Enough.
president_laura_roslin Admiral, if the Eye of Jupiter is somewhere in that temple, and it really is a marker on the way to Earth... We cant let the Cylons get their hands on it.
admiral_william_adama Stand by to launch Vipers.
colonel_saul_tigh Somethings odd here. The Cylons arent launching Raiders. The baseships are standing off outside of weapons range.
president_laura_roslin That is odd.
lt_louis_hoshi Admiral. Its the Cylon baseship, requesting to speak with you.
admiral_william_adama Put it through the speaker. [
dr_gaius_baltar Admiral, I cant tell you what a genuine pleasure it is to hear your voice. [
president_laura_roslin I cant believe were allowing Cylons on this ship.
admiral_william_adama They must want something pretty bad, or else they would have started shooting as soon as they jumped in.
president_laura_roslin Well, why would they send Baltar? Theyve gotta know we wont believe a word he says.
admiral_william_adama He can say whatever he wants. The longer he talks, the more time we have to get Lee and his people off the planet.
Chip_Six#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode11 Feels like old times, doesnt it?
dr_gaius_baltar I cant believe how much I actually miss this place.
Chip_Six#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode11 You know you cant return. Theyd toss you out the nearest airlock and then throw a party.
dr_gaius_baltar Yes, I know. Still, I cant help feeling Im finally... Home.
Chip_Six#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode11 If youre really a Cylon, a member of the Final Five, these feelings are just part of your programming. Part of your cover.
dr_gaius_baltar And if Im a human being after all, if Im not one of the Final Five, then this is the last chance I ever get to see my kind again.
lt_sharon_valerii Colonel, wait.
john_cavil Well, look at this. Should we salute?
colonel_saul_tigh Thats Boomer.
colonel_saul_tigh The one who shot the old man. Well, you just lost your visiting privileges. Hold that thing here until we get back.
marine_sgt_fischer Yes sir.
colonel_saul_tigh You three keep on moving.
dr_gaius_baltar Laura. [
danna_biers The weapons are hardly necessary.
john_cavil Yes, exactly. We come in peace.
president_laura_roslin What do you want?
Three#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode11 We want the Eye of Jupiter. So lets just skip all the denials and protestations, and go straight to what we know -- that you have people on the ground. And we know that youve found the original settlement of the Thirteenth Tribe.
john_cavil It also doesnt take a lot of deduction to conclude that the only reason you havent cut your losses and jumped away by now, is that you probably found the artifact, but you havent been able to retrieve it yet. Is that about right, Madame President?
president_laura_roslin We have our people on the surface, were not leaving them behind.
john_cavil Thats a touching, but not very convincing idea.
dr_gaius_baltar Look the chances that weve all converged on this small planet at the same time are infinitesimally small. so we all understand its not chance. You want the eye. The Cylons want the eye. I would like to discuss the practical issues that come to hand -- and there are some -- so that we can reach some accommodation.
president_laura_roslin The less this man says, the better this will go.
dr_gaius_baltar Wait a minute. If it wasnt for me, the Cylons would have blown you out of the sky two seconds after wed arrived.
president_laura_roslin I think you can handle this alone -- if you can stomach it.
dr_gaius_baltar So Ive saved your life... again. How many times is that now? Because Im beginning to lose count. If it wasnt for me, youd all be dead!
admiral_william_adama Whats your offer?
Three#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode11 You give us the Eye of Jupiter... we let you go.
john_cavil And...well throw in Baltar.
dr_gaius_baltar What are you talking about now?
dr_gaius_baltar Whats he saying?
john_cavil Im improvising. Throw in something, sweeten the pot. In fact Im suspecting that the admiral and Madame President would enjoy some nice, quiet, private time with their former leader. Am I right?
colonel_saul_tigh worth thinking about.
admiral_william_adama Definitely worth thinking about.
lt_sharon_valerii Despite that uniform, its not your home anymore.
lt_sharon_valerii Ive made my choice, and I know where my loyalties lie.
lt_sharon_valerii What if I told you that your daughter was still alive?
lt_sharon_valerii Id say you were lying.
lt_sharon_valerii Well, someones lying. But its not me. Heras alive. At least for now. Shes ill, and we dont know why.
lt_sharon_valerii Yeah, right.
lt_sharon_valerii Baltar found her on New Caprica during the evacuation. Shes on our baseship right now. From what we could gather, she was hidden at Laura Roslins school, which means that she probably planned the whole thing in the first place.
lt_sharon_valerii I dont need to listen to this. [
lt_sharon_valerii They let you think that she was dead. You dont do that to a person, you do that to a thing. Thats what your friends think of you, Sharon. Youre not one of them. Youre a thing!
admiral_william_adama Were not giving you the key to finding Earth.
danna_biers You try bringing it up from that planet and see what happens. We outnumber you four to one.
admiral_william_adama Im setting the terms now. Make any attempt to attack this ship or the people on the planets surface, Ill launch every nuke Ive got. Lay waste to the entire continent.
danna_biers Youre bluffing. You want to find Earth as much as we do.
admiral_william_adama Guards, escort them back to their ship.
marine_sgt_fischer yes sir.
cpt_lee_adama It would help if I knew what I was looking for: does it look like an eye?
president_laura_roslin I dont know, Lee. Ive looked at the Scriptures, and they make reference to the Eye being left in some sort of temple. But theres no physical description.
admiral_william_adama All we know for sure is it supposedly points the way to Earth.
cpt_lee_adama And you believe that?
admiral_william_adama The Cylons do. I cant take a chance that theyre right. If it looks like theyre going to get into the Temple, your order is to blow it.
cpt_lee_adama Understood. Whats my timeframe...
cpt_lee_adama whats going on?
captain_kara_thrace The Cylons are jamming the wireless. Every frequency.
cpt_lee_adama Okay, we need to establish our communications ... work out a plan to defend this Temple while Tyrol searches.
captain_kara_thrace Defend it with what? A dozen Marines? Maybe five more military?
cpt_lee_adama Were gonna have to draft the civilians.
captain_kara_thrace Can I make a suggestion that you wont like?
cpt_lee_adama Do you make any other kind?
captain_kara_thrace Use Sam to command the civilians.
cpt_lee_adama Youre not serious.
samuel_anders Lee.
cpt_lee_adama Hey, Sam.
captain_kara_thrace Hey.
samuel_anders Heard you were coming down. Guess it takes an emergency to get us in the same room these days.
captain_kara_thrace Can we do this later please?
cpt_lee_adama Sam, I need you to command the civilians, form them into fire teams. Ill give my deployment orders through Sergeant...
samuel_anders Whoa, whoa, whoa. Deployment orders? Fire teams? Come on, some of these guys have never even held a rifle before.
cpt_lee_adama Well, youve supposed to be the expert in turning civilians into soldiers.
samuel_anders Oh, no, no. We were guerilla fighters. All right? Hit and run. Keep moving, keep the enemy off balance. Ive never had to defend a fixed position. Thats a whole different game.
cpt_lee_adama Well, then, youre just gonna have to learn it fast, because thats what were doing. Were defending this fixed position. Until the Chief finds his Eye of Jupiter.
samuel_anders Oh okay, so you want us to risk our lives for something that you havent even found yet?!
cpt_lee_adama Listen, Sam, Im not even sure it exists. But I dont have to tell you every little Godsdamn detail...
samuel_anders You know what you have to explain to me?
captain_kara_thrace Hey, hey, hey. Honey -- the Majors in charge on this one, okay? Okay?
samuel_anders Uh-huh. Well, I certainly wouldnt want to step between you and your Major.
cpt_lee_adama Well I thought that went really well.
captain_kara_thrace Hell do it.
cpt_lee_adama Hed better.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson I miss Nicky. Do you think hes okay?
chief_galen_tyrol Yes, hes fine. Hes on Galactica. Hes fine.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson I hope.
chief_galen_tyrol I hated everything about the faith. The rules, the rituals. The endless discussions at the dinner table. I used to sneak into my moms prayer room. You know, Holiest of the Holies. I would dance around naked with porn magazines, just to defy the Gods and tell them to frak off. [
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson You should see the look on your face when youre in here. Theres this... reverence. You even talk softer.
chief_galen_tyrol I feel something in here. Something true. But here I am setting charges in this special place. Holiest of the holies. This is... The Temple of Five. If my parents could see this. And Im gonna blow it up.
lt_felix_gaeta I noticed some anomalies in the solar radiation belt. I made an analysis of the stars vibrational modes. Sure enough, it appears to be highly unstable. If you can believe it, on the verge of going supernova.
admiral_william_adama When?
lt_felix_gaeta Could be tomorrow. Could be next year. Theres no way of knowing for sure, sir. When it does happen, the only warning that were likely to get is a fast helium flash, at which point well have to jump out of here before it obliterates the entire planetary system. Sir, I am not one to look for religious signs. But I cant get my head around these odds. That human and Cylon both converge on this planet at this exact moment just as the stars about to go supernova...
admiral_william_adama Im not a religious person, Mr. Gaeta, as you both know. So if this is the work of a higher power then they have one hell of a sense of humor.
john_cavil We have a standoff; very predictable. They have the Eye, and theyll nuke it if we try to take it. And well shoot them down if they try bringing it up to Galactica.
leoben_conoy Are we sure they have it? How do we know theyre not bluffing?
dr_gaius_baltar You dont.
danna_biers We Threes feel that we cant afford to take the chance.
john_cavil I think were missing the big picture here. We have the opportunity to rid the universe of the human pestilence once and for all.
number_six We can discuss that after we get the Eye of Jupiter. After we find the path to Earth.
john_cavil Let me point out that it doesnt matter if we find Earth in five days, or if we find Earth in 5,000 years. Were machines. Well still be around to savor the great miracle. So let them destroy the Eye. If, indeed, they have it. We have to take advantage of the situation and take down Galactica once and for all. [
danna_biers Were not doing nothing, Cavil. Plans are in motion.
dr_gaius_baltar Im sorry, what does that mean?
number_six Danna?
danna_biers I put a heavy raider down on the planets surface as soon as we jumped in. I thought that would be our best chance of slipping by their dradis. It seems I was right.
number_six Is there any particular reason the rest of us werent involved in this decision?
danna_biers It was a need to know mission. So now I am telling you, because you need to know. The point is, we have cut off their troops communications, and weve put our own troops on the ground. So as soon as our centurions retrieve the eye, you can take out Galactica.
samuel_anders Okay, heres the deal. Were out of options. The Cylons have got us pinned on this rock, and our only way out of here is to hold this place until Galactica can send a rescue party. So Ive divided you into two teams, okay? Team one is gonna be distributing ammunition throughout the camp. Team two is gonna be making homemade tylium mines. I know thats not glamorous work, but were going to need the extra firepower in case the Cylons decide to take a shot at us. Look, I know some of you are scared. And thats okay, cause Im scared too. But if we keep our heads, and we do our jobs, we can do this. And we can all get out of here in one piece. Now, Barolay has a list of your names and your assignments. Make sure you get with her. See you outside.
cpt_lee_adama That was good. Honest. Youd make a good officer.
cpt_lee_adama Im not really sure what you think is going on here.
samuel_anders Dont insult me, okay? Im not stupid. I know how she is. Weve been married for a year and a half. What, do you think youre the first? I chose to marry Kara. Thats my business. I dont know what the hell you think youre trying to do.
cpt_lee_adama Im trying to fight a war. Im trying to get these people off this rock in one piece.
samuel_anders Anything for the cause,
the_hybrid ...I dont care if it rains or freezes, as long as... the five lights of the apocalypse rising scenes revealed only to those who enter the temple only to the chosen one the chosen one the chosen one the chosen one the chosen one the chosen one the chosen one the chosen one end of line. Until next time ... the eye the eye the eye look into the eye to know thyself.
danna_biers Gaius, I am on the verge of seeing the faces of the Final Five Cylons. Maybe the face of God himself. [
number_six What truth?
danna_biers Caprica.
number_six Id like to think that we three have shared something. Transcended the barriers that separate people. And yet, somehow, the more time goes on, the more I find myself on the outside looking in.
dr_gaius_baltar Well, thats not the case at all. Is it? Because we three, were integral. Were part of...
danna_biers Were finished. Baltars and my destiny lie separate from yours, Caprica. [
number_six What are you after? What is this secret that you keep pursuing? You have to tell me the truth. I love you both.
danna_biers We love you too. But this is something you cannot share with us.
number_six Something I cant share with you? [
dr_gaius_baltar Now, look, you mustnt misunderstand. Its not personal. Its transcendent. Its like what you said: its transcendent.
danna_biers Pray for us, Caprica. Well be praying for you.
officer_anastasia_dualla Okay, he wants us to set up forward observation posts that are hard-wired back to base for communications. The ops are gonna be staggered at strategic locations, giving us as much warning as possible, if there is a Cylon advance. Since we only have one Raptor, Captain Thrace will fly point.
captain_kara_thrace Oh, joy.
officer_anastasia_dualla Wireless is dead, so if you do make contact, do not engage. Have them relay the information back to command. Be sure to note force strength, direction of march, and position.
captain_kara_thrace I have flown recon once or twice, Lieutenant.
officer_anastasia_dualla Griggs, you and Varrick are gonna set up an observation post here. Annick and Ditko, You go here....
captain_kara_thrace And who gets lucky number three?
officer_anastasia_dualla That will be Sergeant Finsher and me. Do you have a problem with that, Captain?
captain_kara_thrace ...No.
officer_anastasia_dualla We go in an hour.
officer_anastasia_dualla Green base, foxfire one. Green base, foxfire one. We are open for business. Over.
captain_kara_thrace Son of a bitch. [
officer_anastasia_dualla Shes relaying a message... Its Centurions. [
admiral_william_adama Laura.
president_laura_roslin What?
admiral_william_adama The Cylon we know as Boomer arrived with the others. She told our Sharon that her child was alive, and that she was on board one of the Cylon baseships. And that she had been seen on New Caprica in your school.
president_laura_roslin The child is alive. Yes. Yes, the child was at the school. Yes, I kept her there. [
captain_karl_agathon Do you have any idea what weve gone through? You, of all people, know ... what its like to lose a child.
admiral_william_adama The difference is your childs still alive. And eventually, I hope you become grateful of that.
lt_sharon_valerii I want to see her.
samuel_anders What do you mean shes gone down. Gone down where?
cpt_lee_adama Somewhere in the north valley. Get your men on the line. Theyre coming from the north.
samuel_anders Whoa, whoa whoa. Were gonna set up a rescue party, right?
cpt_lee_adama Ah, no. We dont have the manpower. We have to defend the position.
samuel_anders Lee, she could be dying out there.
cpt_lee_adama Yeah, I know that, Sam. I know. But we are thin on the ground here, and the Cylons are on the march. We cant help her. We have to hold our positions.
samuel_anders Are you out of your frakkin mind?
colonel_saul_tigh Just picked up six heavy Raiders falling away from the Cylon Fleet, definitely heading down toward the planet.
president_laura_roslin I dont get it. Theyd have to know we see them.
colonel_saul_tigh Theyre testing us. Want to know if were bluffing about nuking the planet.
president_laura_roslin Well, unfortunately we are bluffing.
admiral_william_adama Are we. Mr. Hoshi.
lt_louis_hoshi Aye, sir.
admiral_william_adama Order nuclear ground-strike missiles in launch tubes 4 through 10.
lt_louis_hoshi Aye, sir. [
sgt_erin_mathias The Majors right. We dont have any troops to spare if were gonna hold this position.
samuel_anders Screw this position! Listen, we can take those hills, use guerilla tactics. Thats what Ive been talking about this whole time.
cpt_lee_adama Well, that is not the mission. We have our orders. We are stronger--
samuel_anders What are you, some Godsdamn wind-up tin soldier? This is my wife were talking about.
cpt_lee_adama I know who she is! And I have known her and cared about her a hell of a lot longer than you!
samuel_anders You can do whatever the frak you want! I am going after my wife!
lt_felix_gaeta Missiles are loaded, Admiral.
admiral_william_adama Open launch tube doors.
lt_felix_gaeta Doors are open, Admiral.
president_laura_roslin What are you doing?
admiral_william_adama Getting ready to nuke the planet.
number_six Radiological detection. Theyve opened their missile doors.
john_cavil Hes bluffing.
cpt_lee_adama I cant let you do that, Sam.
samuel_anders I am not asking you for permission.
cpt_lee_adama Sergeant Mathias.
admiral_william_adama Load target package 3-bravo. Set ground zero for the underground structure.
president_laura_roslin Are we prepared to sacrifice Lee?
Eight#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode11 Theyre loading a targeting package.
john_cavil Its a bluff. Dont let him rattle you.
leoben_conoy The risk to us is unacceptable. Turn back the Raiders.
Three#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode11 The ships cannot turn back. He wont launch it. And DAnna was explicit that she and Baltar make it to the planets surface.
number_six So is that what all this is really about?
chief_galen_tyrol And the heavens opened up, and they saw the Eye. But where is that frakking Eye?
samuel_anders Are you kidding me? Are you gonna shoot me now?
cpt_lee_adama I cant let you go. I need you on the line. I need you commanding those civilians. Im sorry, Sam, but you cannot go.
samuel_anders Im sorry too, Major, but you cant stop me.
admiral_william_adama Release of nuclear weapons is now authorized.
colonel_saul_tigh Sir.
