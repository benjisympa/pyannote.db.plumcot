Athena Previously on
Gaeta Theres enough algae on this planet to feed the entire fleet. But the star in the system is highly unstable. If you can believe it, on the verge of going supernova.
Tigh We just picked up four baseships inbound at high speed. Captain Adama, its just a matter of time until the Cylons find out what were up to on this planet.
Dualla Starbuck has gone down!
Anders I am going after my wife.
Apollo I cant let you do that, Sam.
Anders I am not asking you for permission.
Apollo Sergeant Mathias?
Boomer What if I told you that your daughter was still alive?
Athena Id say you were lying.
Boomer Shes on our baseship right now. Shes ill, and we dont know why.
Chief I mean, I dont even know how I found this place. I just got this urge to start walking, and then suddenly, here it is.
Chief The scriptures say this Temple is the final resting place of the Eye of Jupiter.
Adama What exactly are we talking about?
Roslin Its a marker that was left behind by the Thirteenth Tribe. Its supposed to point the way to Earth.
Three We want the Eye of Jupiter.
Adama Make any attempt to attack this ship or the people on the planets surface, Ill launch every nuke Ive got.
Adama Major, youve got to hold off the Cylons until Chief finds the Eye of Jupiter. If it looks like theyre gonna get into the Temple, your order is to blow it.
Three We have to go down to the planet. I am so close to seeing the faces of the last five Cylons.
Hybrid The Final Five revealed only to those who enter the Temple. only to the chosen one. The chosen one.
Tigh We just picked up six heavy Raiders heading down toward the planet.
Adama Order nuclear ground-strike missiles Im not gonna let the Cylons get their hands on the Eye.
Roslin Are we prepared to sacrifice Lee?
Gaeta Missiles are loaded, Admiral.
Adama Release of nuclear weapons is now authorized.
Adama Mr. Gaeta, disable launch and warhead safeties on tubes four through ten.
Gaeta Safeties disabled. Warheads ... are armed.
Adama XO, please input your firing code.
Tigh These nukes will obliterate anything or anyone within twenty klicks of the Temple.
Adama I know.
Leoben Hes gonna do it. Recall the Raiders immediately.
Eight We agree. Bring them back.
Cavil We agree. After all this time, we cant afford to lose everything.
Caprica We agree. Bring them back.
Anders If Kara dies out there... I swear to Gods, I will kill you myself.
Apollo If she dies out there, Ill let you.
Anders So what are we gonna do now, follow me around with a gun? Because that is the only way that I am not going after Kara.
Apollo Private Sykes.
Sykes Sir?
Apollo Get Lieutenant Dualla on the line.
Sykes Yes sir.
Dualla Im here.
Apollo Do you have eyeballs on Starbucks position?
Dualla Negative, we have no visual on her Raptor, but I can see smoke from the crash site. She went down behind a hill, its a couple klicks away.
Apollo Can you get to the Raptor?
Dualla I dont know. Its pretty far away. Theres minimal cover.
Apollo Is it doable?
Dualla I dont know.
Adama Key.
Tigh Standing by.
Gaeta Launch sequence set to auto.
Three They want the key to finding Earth as much as we do. He wont just destroy it.
Leoben We spoke, and the decisions been made.
Adama Fire on my mark.
Gaeta Sir, the Raiders are turning back.
Adama Not all of them.
Gaeta Uh, correction. Five have turned back. one is still en route back to the planet.
Eight What are you doing?
Three He wont launch against just one ship. He wont.
Leoben Thats not the issue. We made a decision. DAnna has to turn back.
Three No...
Caprica Call DAnna and Baltar. Turn them around now.
Three No.
Caprica What do you mean, no?
Three This is something that we have to do. He wont launch over one ship. Youll see.
Dualla You want me... You want me to rescue Captain Thrace?
Apollo Attempt the rescue.
Dualla Yes, sir. Foxfire one out.: We go.
Tigh Weapons are still hot.
Adama Safe all missiles. Close down the doors.
Three There. You see? Never over just one ship.
Cavil That is not a good sign, my friends.
Eight She defied us. Defied the group.
Leoben Its not about in the Eye of Jupiter. Its about her.
Caprica Its like we dont even know them anymore.
Cavil We may have to so something about this. We may have to do it sooner than later.
Athena Heras alive. Im her mother, and Im going to get her.
Helo Sharon, baby, listen to me, okay? We could take a Raptor, we can fly to the baseship ourselves. I dont -- I dont care anymore.
Athena We cant.
Helo Well find another way. We will.
Athena_quietly There is no other way.
Helo Dont ask me to do this, Sharon.
Athena Listen to me. You have always been the strong one. You believed in us when no one else would.
Athena Im begging you to do this. Find the courage to do this for both of us, okay?
Athena I love you.
Helo I love you too.
Marine Good, close it. Yes.
Adama Wait outside.
Roslin Sharons downloading into another body aboard a Cylon ship right now, isnt she?
Helo She begged me. She begged me to do it. Gods, if youd... seen the look in her eyes when I --
Adama She has important information on our defenses. Codes, procedures, the tactical situation down on the planets surface. The Cylons have access to all of that as well.
Helo She wont betray us. You know that. Its why you gave her the uniform.
Adama She may not have a choice. Did you consider that?
Helo She says she could resist, that she wouldnt let it happen. Shell get Hera... and shell come back.
Roslin Thats quite a leap of faith youve made, there, Captain. And if it involved your family only, Id say it was brave. But youve put the entire Fleet in jeopardy, are you aware of that?
Helo If you hadnt lied... and stolen our baby in the first place...
Helo We wouldnt be here at all.
Roslin I certainly played my part in bringing us to this moment. And theres plenty of blame to throw around and I accept it. And now all of our lives are in the hands of Sharon Agathon. All we can do is hope that your wife is worthy of the unconditional trust you place in her, Captain.
Roslin And you as well, Admiral.
Caprica Can you tell me what happened?
Athena They wouldnt let me see my daughter, so my husband shot me. It was the only way.
Caprica Well, its over now. The important thing is that youre here.
Athena Hows my daughter?
Caprica Shes getting worse.
Athena I want to see her.
Caprica ...And then what?
Athena What they did to me. Stealing my baby, and telling me she was dead. Proved it. Heras safer here. And so am I.
Apollo All right, before she went down, Starbuck spotted about fifteen-plus chromejobs advancing on us from here. To get to us, the toasters have to come through this canyon. This is a natural choke point. Thats where well ambush them. Guerilla style. Our mission is to hold the Temple here. If we fail, we blow it up. We fall back to these rendezvous points. And then we head into the mountains and we wait for rescue.
Anders Well, its a good a place as any to die, I suppose.
Dualla What do you think?
Fischer Well ... its a nice day for a walk.
Dualla Snipers!
Dualla Hey, take it easy, Fischer. ...Sarge? Sarge?
Chief Ah this is crazy, come on. Think, think.
Cally Galen, its Major Adama.
Chief Sir.
Apollo Chief, were in position. Any luck finding the Eye of Jupiter?
Chief No. Major, I need more time.
Apollo Get on it. The Cylons are on the move. Well hold them off as long as we can. Apollo out.
Chief Okay, people, listen up. Were running out of time.
Three Its so close.
Baltar I know. The answers to all your questions are down there in that Temple. Whats wrong?
Three Im worried, Gaius.
Baltar This is what weve been waiting for. You are the anointed one. Chosen by God to look on the faces of the Final Five Cylons. Its already written. You will succeed.
Three Thats what Im afraid of. To know the face of God is to know madness. The hybrid has looked into the space between life and death, and shes seen things that we cannot conceive of. But shes been driven mad as a result.
Baltar Have faith in God. Put your life in His hands. He will guide you to your destiny.
Three Im grateful to you. For everything.
Chip_Six Her destiny will part company from yours, Gaius. Shes not the chosen one, you are.
Baltar Yes, I know.: I know.
Apollo Okay, were set. And now we wait.
Barolay What happens if the Cylons dont dance to the Majors tune?
Man What happens is we get splattered all over these rocks.
Anders Shut up. This is his game, not ours. We just do what were told, and maybe we get out of here.
Man You really think these civvies can stop them?
Apollo Well, they stopped plenty of them on Caprica when we were running for our lives.
Apollo Okay, three clankers just entered our kill zone.
Mathias Gotta be their recon element.
Apollo Sykes, give em the signal.
Anders All right. Showtime, showtime.
Anders Theyre headed our way. Dont detonate till theyre all the way in.
Anders Wait for it. Come on, you sons of bitches. Come on.
Anders Now, now, now, now.
Barolay Man down! Gods damn it!
Anders Cease fire! Theyre pulling back! Theyre pulling back! Oh, frak! Oh! Gods damn it!
Apollo Come on!
Barolay Damn it.
Anders Oh, frak, frak.
Apollo Okay, this mans dead. We gotta pull him back. Sam, pull it together.
Apollo We bought ourselves a little time, but theyll be back. And with force. So dig in. Well need to hold them off until Chief finds the Eye. And keep your eyes out on those ridges.
Anders You have any word from Kara or Dee?
Apollo No.
Dualla Starbuck?: Star --
Starbuck Dee, why the hell didnt you sing out? I almost blew you away.
Dualla Yeah. Glad to see you too.
Dualla Okay, okay. Its okay, yeah.
Starbuck Lee sent you?
Dualla Yep. My husband... ordered me to risk my life for yours. Thats what Im gonna do. Im gonna bring Starbuck back to Apollo.
Caprica Shes here.
Athena Its me. Its Mommy, yes.: Whats wrong?
Boomer We tried everything. She didnt respond.
Caprica Look at that. Hera knows her. Thats amazing. You and she are biologically identical. Hera recognizes her mother.
Boomer Well, good, because you can have her. Im done with her.
Athena You dont mean that. I know you still care about Tyrol and Adama.
Boomer No. Im done with that part of my life. I learned that on New Caprica. Humans and Cylons were not meant to be together. We should just go our separate ways.
Athena Wanna lay down? Okay.
Athena Her bellys as hard as a rock. Have you noticed that before?
Caprica What do you think that means?
Athena Blocked intestine, maybe.
Boomer Our doctors examined her.
Athena Well, your doctors have never examined a child.
Athena Hera needs to be seen by a human doctor. I need to take her back to
Caprica You know that cant happen, what this child means to us. What she means to every living Cylon.
Boomer I should have known. Shes been planning this all alone.
Athena Feel her.
Boomer Shes right. Bellys as hard as a gourd.
Athena If you dont let me take her, the first of a new generation will die. God will never forgive you.
Boomer Maybe Cavils right. Maybe God never wanted us to have children in the first place.
Boomer Maybe itd be better for you if I just snapped your little neck!
Athena Dont! Please. Please dont kill my baby girl.
Athena Honey, oh.
Caprica I believe the future of the Cylon rests with this child. And the others who are gonna come after her.
Boomer So do I.
Caprica Theres a captured Raptor aboard. Lets go. Weve gotta get you back to
Barolay Here they come. Open fire!
Anders Tell em to blow the thing! The Cylons are closing in!
Cally Its the Major.
Chief Tyrol.
Apollo Tell me youve found the Eye of Jupiter.
Chief No, but Im getting close, Major. Ive deciphered some more of the glyphs. I got a reference to an eye, something about a star, and an explosion of some kind.
Apollo All right, cut to the chase, Chief. Do you have the Eye of Jupiter in your hands or not?
Chief No, Major.
Woman Cylon!
Apollo Its hot!
Apollo All right, Chief, listen to me. Thats it! Get your people to the rally point and blow the Temple. I repeat, blow the Temple.
Chief Yes, sir. Damn it.
Apollo All right, fall back! Mathias, fall back! Fall back! Fall back!
Chief All right, thats it, everybody. Drop what youre doing and get out.
Chief That means you, too, Cally.
Crew Come on! Leave the gear! Go!
Chief If I only had a little more time.
Cally Galen, its in the hands of the Gods now, Galen. Lets go. Theres nothing we can do!
Dualla Ships structurally intact.
Starbuck Okay. That means that the only thing keeping us grounded is the busted fly-by wire. So... you gotta bypass those bundles with datacord from the comm system. And then we ... may have a shot at getting out of here.
Dualla Theres only one left. Better save it for when you fly us out of here.
Starbuck I cant fly. Especially all whacked up on morph.
Dualla Well, thats just frakkin great.
Starbuck He wont cheat. Hes too honorable.
Dualla Unlike you.
Starbuck Yeah, unlike me. I love Sam, I hate Sam. I love Lee, I hate Lee. Gods, I have to cheat just to keep the pieces all nice and neat.
Dualla Stay with it. You still gotta walk me through these avionics.
Apollo The Cylons have reached the Temple. Chief, whats your status?
Chief Im wiring the last detonator.
Three The Eye of Jupiter has to be somewhere in this Temple.
Cavil Theyve wired it with explosives. Lets disconnect it.
Three Pull out the detonators. Quickly.
Apollo Chief, blow this thing! You out of your frakkin mind?!
Chief I cant do it.
Three Gaius!
Baltar Yes?
Three Help us!
Baltar Yeah.
Apollo Give me the control!
Three This just about does it.
Apollo Frak! What have you done? What have you done?
Chief Major, look.
Apollo What is that?
Chip_Six There it is, Gaius. It has the answers to all of your questions.
Baltar Thats the Eye?
Three What is?
Baltar Oh, uh... something the hybrid said, uh... Sapphire blue, shining like unto a star.
Cavil DAnna... you didnt come here looking for Earth. You came here looking for something else.
Kelly Picking up massive energy pulse from the central star.
Gaeta Sir, its a helium flash. The stars going nova.
Adama Novas gonna obliterate the entire planet in less than an hour.
Chief Major, look. Its the mandala from the Temple. This is supposed to be happening. Thats it. I was staring at it the whole time. The sun is going nova. The nova is the Eye of Jupiter.
Apollo All right, we can still blow it. We can still blow it.
Starbuck We just gotta make it into orbit.
Dualla Okay.
Starbuck Good.
Three This is my destiny. To see what lies between life and death.
Cavil And to look upon the faces of the Final Five. That cant happen.
Three This is my destiny.
Cavil Sorry, DAnna.
Three The Final Five. Is it really you?
Three You. Forgive me, I -- I had no idea.
Baltar No idea about what? What did you see? What... Who was it?
Three ... So beautiful...
Baltar What was? Tell me! Am I one of you?
Three You were right.
Baltar About what?: DAnna, did you see my face? I have to know, please. Please, stay with me.
Baltar Stay, I have to know! Tell me, I have to know! Did you see my face?! Am I a Cylon?
Baltar Frak it.
Baltar God, tell me the truth before I die.
Chief Welcome home, Mr. President.
Gaeta Admiral, the Cylon fleet just jumped away.
Tigh They dont wanna be here when that nova shock front gets here. Neither do we.
Adama Launch a rescue mission, now.
Gaeta We dont have much time before the nova fries everything in the system.
Tigh Its gonna be a photo finish.
Man All rescue ships from the planet accounted for.
Adama Count us down!
Gaeta Commence FTL.
Man Jump in three...two... one. Jump.
Tigh Hes not dead?
Chief No, unfortunately.
Tigh Take him to the bridge.
Helo Sharon?
Athena We have to get her to Doc Cottle right away.
Helo Okay.
Athena Hold your fire! Hold your fire. She helped us escape.
Tigh Get out of the way! Lieutenant!
Helo Sharon...
Adama I think the Chief is right. I think the nova does look like the mandala inside of this Temple.
Roslin Do you think the Thirteenth Tribe had a vision of what was to come?
Chief I dont know what else it could mean.
Tigh Maybe they saw another nova, and drew a picture of that. Youve seen one nova, youve seen them all.
Gaeta well, There was another nova.: Seen 4,000 years ago, around about when the Temple might have been built. Its 13,000 light years from our present position. Its a cloud of gas known as the Ionian Nebula.
Adama Maybe it was a road sign... showing the direction that they headed to next.
Helo So Starbuck, tell me, is that what you gotta do to get a little extra rack time around here?
Starbuck Did you just come by to frak with me?
Helo Actually, I wanted to know if you had any, uh... pictures of your old apartment on Caprica.
Starbuck_smiling Um...yeah, uh... the locker, top shelf. Cigar box. Why?
Helo Curious about something.
Starbuck Well, I hope you and Sharon arent planning on redecorating, cause youre not gonna get any bright ideas from my old place.
Helo_sweetly Oh, I remember. Ive seen better looking trainwrecks.
Starbuck Oh, thank you.
Helo But I do remember those paintings you did.
Starbuck What about em?
Helo This? Was on the Temple. Whered you get the idea to paint yours?
Starbuck I dont know. It was just something Ive been doodling since I was a kid, I liked the pattern.
Helo Well... they built the Temple 4,000 years ago.
Helo What is it?
Starbuck Just something Leoben said once. That I had a destiny, that it had already been written.
Cavil You know the drill. Long, deep, controlled breathing.
Cavil At least youll never have to go through this again. The decision wasnt easy, but the conclusion was inevitable. Your model is fundamentally flawed.
Three No. Its not a flaw to question your purpose. Is it? To wonder who programmed us, the way we think and why?
Cavil Well, thats the problem right there. The messianic conviction that youre on a special mission to enlighten us. Look at the damage its caused.
Three I would do it all again.
Cavil Yes, we know. Thats why weve decided to... box your entire line. Your consciousness, memory, every thought your model ever had... are going into cold storage. Indefinitely.
Three one must die to know the truth. There are five other Cylons, brother. I saw them. one day, youre gonna see them too. one day...
Cavil Good-bye.
Three Brother... brother...
Three Brother...
