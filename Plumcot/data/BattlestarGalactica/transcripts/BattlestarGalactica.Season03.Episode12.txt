lt_sharon_valerii Previously on
lt_felix_gaeta Theres enough algae on this planet to feed the entire fleet. But the star in the system is highly unstable. If you can believe it, on the verge of going supernova.
colonel_saul_tigh We just picked up four baseships inbound at high speed. Captain Adama, its just a matter of time until the Cylons find out what were up to on this planet.
officer_anastasia_dualla Starbuck has gone down!
samuel_anders I am going after my wife.
cpt_lee_adama I cant let you do that, Sam.
samuel_anders I am not asking you for permission.
cpt_lee_adama Sergeant Mathias?
lt_sharon_valerii What if I told you that your daughter was still alive?
lt_sharon_valerii Id say you were lying.
lt_sharon_valerii Shes on our baseship right now. Shes ill, and we dont know why.
chief_galen_tyrol I mean, I dont even know how I found this place. I just got this urge to start walking, and then suddenly, here it is.
chief_galen_tyrol The scriptures say this Temple is the final resting place of the Eye of Jupiter.
admiral_william_adama What exactly are we talking about?
president_laura_roslin Its a marker that was left behind by the Thirteenth Tribe. Its supposed to point the way to Earth.
danna_biers We want the Eye of Jupiter.
admiral_william_adama Make any attempt to attack this ship or the people on the planets surface, Ill launch every nuke Ive got.
admiral_william_adama Major, youve got to hold off the Cylons until Chief finds the Eye of Jupiter. If it looks like theyre gonna get into the Temple, your order is to blow it.
danna_biers We have to go down to the planet. I am so close to seeing the faces of the last five Cylons.
Hybrid#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode12 The Final Five revealed only to those who enter the Temple. only to the chosen one. The chosen one.
colonel_saul_tigh We just picked up six heavy Raiders heading down toward the planet.
admiral_william_adama Order nuclear ground-strike missiles Im not gonna let the Cylons get their hands on the Eye.
president_laura_roslin Are we prepared to sacrifice Lee?
lt_felix_gaeta Missiles are loaded, Admiral.
admiral_william_adama Release of nuclear weapons is now authorized.
admiral_william_adama Mr. Gaeta, disable launch and warhead safeties on tubes four through ten.
lt_felix_gaeta Safeties disabled. Warheads ... are armed.
admiral_william_adama XO, please input your firing code.
colonel_saul_tigh These nukes will obliterate anything or anyone within twenty klicks of the Temple.
admiral_william_adama I know.
leoben_conoy Hes gonna do it. Recall the Raiders immediately.
Eight#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode12 We agree. Bring them back.
john_cavil We agree. After all this time, we cant afford to lose everything.
number_six We agree. Bring them back.
samuel_anders If Kara dies out there... I swear to Gods, I will kill you myself.
cpt_lee_adama If she dies out there, Ill let you.
samuel_anders So what are we gonna do now, follow me around with a gun? Because that is the only way that I am not going after Kara.
cpt_lee_adama Private Sykes.
private_sykes Sir?
cpt_lee_adama Get Lieutenant Dualla on the line.
private_sykes Yes sir.
officer_anastasia_dualla Im here.
cpt_lee_adama Do you have eyeballs on Starbucks position?
officer_anastasia_dualla Negative, we have no visual on her Raptor, but I can see smoke from the crash site. She went down behind a hill, its a couple klicks away.
cpt_lee_adama Can you get to the Raptor?
officer_anastasia_dualla I dont know. Its pretty far away. Theres minimal cover.
cpt_lee_adama Is it doable?
officer_anastasia_dualla I dont know.
admiral_william_adama Key.
colonel_saul_tigh Standing by.
lt_felix_gaeta Launch sequence set to auto.
danna_biers They want the key to finding Earth as much as we do. He wont just destroy it.
leoben_conoy We spoke, and the decisions been made.
admiral_william_adama Fire on my mark.
lt_felix_gaeta Sir, the Raiders are turning back.
admiral_william_adama Not all of them.
lt_felix_gaeta Uh, correction. Five have turned back. one is still en route back to the planet.
Eight#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode12 What are you doing?
danna_biers He wont launch against just one ship. He wont.
leoben_conoy Thats not the issue. We made a decision. DAnna has to turn back.
danna_biers No...
number_six Call DAnna and Baltar. Turn them around now.
danna_biers No.
number_six What do you mean, no?
danna_biers This is something that we have to do. He wont launch over one ship. Youll see.
officer_anastasia_dualla You want me... You want me to rescue Captain Thrace?
cpt_lee_adama Attempt the rescue.
officer_anastasia_dualla Yes, sir. Foxfire one out.: We go.
colonel_saul_tigh Weapons are still hot.
admiral_william_adama Safe all missiles. Close down the doors.
danna_biers There. You see? Never over just one ship.
john_cavil That is not a good sign, my friends.
Eight#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode12 She defied us. Defied the group.
leoben_conoy Its not about in the Eye of Jupiter. Its about her.
number_six Its like we dont even know them anymore.
john_cavil We may have to so something about this. We may have to do it sooner than later.
lt_sharon_valerii Heras alive. Im her mother, and Im going to get her.
captain_karl_agathon Sharon, baby, listen to me, okay? We could take a Raptor, we can fly to the baseship ourselves. I dont -- I dont care anymore.
lt_sharon_valerii We cant.
captain_karl_agathon Well find another way. We will.
lt_sharon_valerii There is no other way.
captain_karl_agathon Dont ask me to do this, Sharon.
lt_sharon_valerii Listen to me. You have always been the strong one. You believed in us when no one else would.
lt_sharon_valerii Im begging you to do this. Find the courage to do this for both of us, okay?
lt_sharon_valerii I love you.
captain_karl_agathon I love you too.
marine_sgt_fischer Good, close it. Yes.
admiral_william_adama Wait outside.
president_laura_roslin Sharons downloading into another body aboard a Cylon ship right now, isnt she?
captain_karl_agathon She begged me. She begged me to do it. Gods, if youd... seen the look in her eyes when I --
admiral_william_adama She has important information on our defenses. Codes, procedures, the tactical situation down on the planets surface. The Cylons have access to all of that as well.
captain_karl_agathon She wont betray us. You know that. Its why you gave her the uniform.
admiral_william_adama She may not have a choice. Did you consider that?
captain_karl_agathon She says she could resist, that she wouldnt let it happen. Shell get Hera... and shell come back.
president_laura_roslin Thats quite a leap of faith youve made, there, Captain. And if it involved your family only, Id say it was brave. But youve put the entire Fleet in jeopardy, are you aware of that?
captain_karl_agathon If you hadnt lied... and stolen our baby in the first place...
captain_karl_agathon We wouldnt be here at all.
president_laura_roslin I certainly played my part in bringing us to this moment. And theres plenty of blame to throw around and I accept it. And now all of our lives are in the hands of Sharon Agathon. All we can do is hope that your wife is worthy of the unconditional trust you place in her, Captain.
president_laura_roslin And you as well, Admiral.
number_six Can you tell me what happened?
lt_sharon_valerii They wouldnt let me see my daughter, so my husband shot me. It was the only way.
number_six Well, its over now. The important thing is that youre here.
lt_sharon_valerii Hows my daughter?
number_six Shes getting worse.
lt_sharon_valerii I want to see her.
number_six ...And then what?
lt_sharon_valerii What they did to me. Stealing my baby, and telling me she was dead. Proved it. Heras safer here. And so am I.
cpt_lee_adama All right, before she went down, Starbuck spotted about fifteen-plus chromejobs advancing on us from here. To get to us, the toasters have to come through this canyon. This is a natural choke point. Thats where well ambush them. Guerilla style. Our mission is to hold the Temple here. If we fail, we blow it up. We fall back to these rendezvous points. And then we head into the mountains and we wait for rescue.
samuel_anders Well, its a good a place as any to die, I suppose.
officer_anastasia_dualla What do you think?
marine_sgt_fischer Well ... its a nice day for a walk.
officer_anastasia_dualla Snipers!
officer_anastasia_dualla Hey, take it easy, Fischer. ...Sarge? Sarge?
chief_galen_tyrol Ah this is crazy, come on. Think, think.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Galen, its Major Adama.
chief_galen_tyrol Sir.
cpt_lee_adama Chief, were in position. Any luck finding the Eye of Jupiter?
chief_galen_tyrol No. Major, I need more time.
cpt_lee_adama Get on it. The Cylons are on the move. Well hold them off as long as we can. Apollo out.
chief_galen_tyrol Okay, people, listen up. Were running out of time.
danna_biers Its so close.
dr_gaius_baltar I know. The answers to all your questions are down there in that Temple. Whats wrong?
danna_biers Im worried, Gaius.
dr_gaius_baltar This is what weve been waiting for. You are the anointed one. Chosen by God to look on the faces of the Final Five Cylons. Its already written. You will succeed.
danna_biers Thats what Im afraid of. To know the face of God is to know madness. The hybrid has looked into the space between life and death, and shes seen things that we cannot conceive of. But shes been driven mad as a result.
dr_gaius_baltar Have faith in God. Put your life in His hands. He will guide you to your destiny.
danna_biers Im grateful to you. For everything.
Chip_Six#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode12 Her destiny will part company from yours, Gaius. Shes not the chosen one, you are.
dr_gaius_baltar Yes, I know.: I know.
cpt_lee_adama Okay, were set. And now we wait.
jean_barolay What happens if the Cylons dont dance to the Majors tune?
Man#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode12 What happens is we get splattered all over these rocks.
samuel_anders Shut up. This is his game, not ours. We just do what were told, and maybe we get out of here.
Man#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode12 You really think these civvies can stop them?
cpt_lee_adama Well, they stopped plenty of them on Caprica when we were running for our lives.
cpt_lee_adama Okay, three clankers just entered our kill zone.
sgt_erin_mathias Gotta be their recon element.
cpt_lee_adama Sykes, give em the signal.
samuel_anders All right. Showtime, showtime.
samuel_anders Theyre headed our way. Dont detonate till theyre all the way in.
samuel_anders Wait for it. Come on, you sons of bitches. Come on.
samuel_anders Now, now, now, now.
jean_barolay Man down! Gods damn it!
samuel_anders Cease fire! Theyre pulling back! Theyre pulling back! Oh, frak! Oh! Gods damn it!
cpt_lee_adama Come on!
jean_barolay Damn it.
samuel_anders Oh, frak, frak.
cpt_lee_adama Okay, this mans dead. We gotta pull him back. Sam, pull it together.
cpt_lee_adama We bought ourselves a little time, but theyll be back. And with force. So dig in. Well need to hold them off until Chief finds the Eye. And keep your eyes out on those ridges.
samuel_anders You have any word from Kara or Dee?
cpt_lee_adama No.
officer_anastasia_dualla Starbuck?: Star --
captain_kara_thrace Dee, why the hell didnt you sing out? I almost blew you away.
officer_anastasia_dualla Yeah. Glad to see you too.
officer_anastasia_dualla Okay, okay. Its okay, yeah.
captain_kara_thrace Lee sent you?
officer_anastasia_dualla Yep. My husband... ordered me to risk my life for yours. Thats what Im gonna do. Im gonna bring Starbuck back to Apollo.
number_six Shes here.
lt_sharon_valerii Its me. Its Mommy, yes.: Whats wrong?
lt_sharon_valerii We tried everything. She didnt respond.
number_six Look at that. Hera knows her. Thats amazing. You and she are biologically identical. Hera recognizes her mother.
lt_sharon_valerii Well, good, because you can have her. Im done with her.
lt_sharon_valerii You dont mean that. I know you still care about Tyrol and Adama.
lt_sharon_valerii No. Im done with that part of my life. I learned that on New Caprica. Humans and Cylons were not meant to be together. We should just go our separate ways.
lt_sharon_valerii Wanna lay down? Okay.
lt_sharon_valerii Her bellys as hard as a rock. Have you noticed that before?
number_six What do you think that means?
lt_sharon_valerii Blocked intestine, maybe.
lt_sharon_valerii Our doctors examined her.
lt_sharon_valerii Well, your doctors have never examined a child.
lt_sharon_valerii Hera needs to be seen by a human doctor. I need to take her back to
number_six You know that cant happen, what this child means to us. What she means to every living Cylon.
lt_sharon_valerii I should have known. Shes been planning this all alone.
lt_sharon_valerii Feel her.
lt_sharon_valerii Shes right. Bellys as hard as a gourd.
lt_sharon_valerii If you dont let me take her, the first of a new generation will die. God will never forgive you.
lt_sharon_valerii Maybe Cavils right. Maybe God never wanted us to have children in the first place.
lt_sharon_valerii Maybe itd be better for you if I just snapped your little neck!
lt_sharon_valerii Dont! Please. Please dont kill my baby girl.
lt_sharon_valerii Honey, oh.
number_six I believe the future of the Cylon rests with this child. And the others who are gonna come after her.
lt_sharon_valerii So do I.
number_six Theres a captured Raptor aboard. Lets go. Weve gotta get you back to
jean_barolay Here they come. Open fire!
samuel_anders Tell em to blow the thing! The Cylons are closing in!
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Its the Major.
chief_galen_tyrol Tyrol.
cpt_lee_adama Tell me youve found the Eye of Jupiter.
chief_galen_tyrol No, but Im getting close, Major. Ive deciphered some more of the glyphs. I got a reference to an eye, something about a star, and an explosion of some kind.
cpt_lee_adama All right, cut to the chase, Chief. Do you have the Eye of Jupiter in your hands or not?
chief_galen_tyrol No, Major.
Woman#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode12 Cylon!
cpt_lee_adama Its hot!
cpt_lee_adama All right, Chief, listen to me. Thats it! Get your people to the rally point and blow the Temple. I repeat, blow the Temple.
chief_galen_tyrol Yes, sir. Damn it.
cpt_lee_adama All right, fall back! Mathias, fall back! Fall back! Fall back!
chief_galen_tyrol All right, thats it, everybody. Drop what youre doing and get out.
chief_galen_tyrol That means you, too, Cally.
Crew#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode12 Come on! Leave the gear! Go!
chief_galen_tyrol If I only had a little more time.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Galen, its in the hands of the Gods now, Galen. Lets go. Theres nothing we can do!
officer_anastasia_dualla Ships structurally intact.
captain_kara_thrace Okay. That means that the only thing keeping us grounded is the busted fly-by wire. So... you gotta bypass those bundles with datacord from the comm system. And then we ... may have a shot at getting out of here.
officer_anastasia_dualla Theres only one left. Better save it for when you fly us out of here.
captain_kara_thrace I cant fly. Especially all whacked up on morph.
officer_anastasia_dualla Well, thats just frakkin great.
captain_kara_thrace He wont cheat. Hes too honorable.
officer_anastasia_dualla Unlike you.
captain_kara_thrace Yeah, unlike me. I love Sam, I hate Sam. I love Lee, I hate Lee. Gods, I have to cheat just to keep the pieces all nice and neat.
officer_anastasia_dualla Stay with it. You still gotta walk me through these avionics.
cpt_lee_adama The Cylons have reached the Temple. Chief, whats your status?
chief_galen_tyrol Im wiring the last detonator.
danna_biers The Eye of Jupiter has to be somewhere in this Temple.
john_cavil Theyve wired it with explosives. Lets disconnect it.
danna_biers Pull out the detonators. Quickly.
cpt_lee_adama Chief, blow this thing! You out of your frakkin mind?!
chief_galen_tyrol I cant do it.
danna_biers Gaius!
dr_gaius_baltar Yes?
danna_biers Help us!
dr_gaius_baltar Yeah.
cpt_lee_adama Give me the control!
danna_biers This just about does it.
cpt_lee_adama Frak! What have you done? What have you done?
chief_galen_tyrol Major, look.
cpt_lee_adama What is that?
Chip_Six#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode12 There it is, Gaius. It has the answers to all of your questions.
dr_gaius_baltar Thats the Eye?
danna_biers What is?
dr_gaius_baltar Oh, uh... something the hybrid said, uh... Sapphire blue, shining like unto a star.
john_cavil DAnna... you didnt come here looking for Earth. You came here looking for something else.
Kelly#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode12 Picking up massive energy pulse from the central star.
lt_felix_gaeta Sir, its a helium flash. The stars going nova.
admiral_william_adama Novas gonna obliterate the entire planet in less than an hour.
chief_galen_tyrol Major, look. Its the mandala from the Temple. This is supposed to be happening. Thats it. I was staring at it the whole time. The sun is going nova. The nova is the Eye of Jupiter.
cpt_lee_adama All right, we can still blow it. We can still blow it.
captain_kara_thrace We just gotta make it into orbit.
officer_anastasia_dualla Okay.
captain_kara_thrace Good.
danna_biers This is my destiny. To see what lies between life and death.
john_cavil And to look upon the faces of the Final Five. That cant happen.
danna_biers This is my destiny.
john_cavil Sorry, DAnna.
danna_biers The Final Five. Is it really you?
danna_biers You. Forgive me, I -- I had no idea.
dr_gaius_baltar No idea about what? What did you see? What... Who was it?
danna_biers ... So beautiful...
dr_gaius_baltar What was? Tell me! Am I one of you?
danna_biers You were right.
dr_gaius_baltar About what?: DAnna, did you see my face? I have to know, please. Please, stay with me.
dr_gaius_baltar Stay, I have to know! Tell me, I have to know! Did you see my face?! Am I a Cylon?
dr_gaius_baltar Frak it.
dr_gaius_baltar God, tell me the truth before I die.
chief_galen_tyrol Welcome home, Mr. President.
lt_felix_gaeta Admiral, the Cylon fleet just jumped away.
colonel_saul_tigh They dont wanna be here when that nova shock front gets here. Neither do we.
admiral_william_adama Launch a rescue mission, now.
lt_felix_gaeta We dont have much time before the nova fries everything in the system.
colonel_saul_tigh Its gonna be a photo finish.
Man#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode12 All rescue ships from the planet accounted for.
admiral_william_adama Count us down!
lt_felix_gaeta Commence FTL.
Man#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode12 Jump in three...two... one. Jump.
colonel_saul_tigh Hes not dead?
chief_galen_tyrol No, unfortunately.
colonel_saul_tigh Take him to the bridge.
captain_karl_agathon Sharon?
lt_sharon_valerii We have to get her to Doc Cottle right away.
captain_karl_agathon Okay.
lt_sharon_valerii Hold your fire! Hold your fire. She helped us escape.
colonel_saul_tigh Get out of the way! Lieutenant!
captain_karl_agathon Sharon...
admiral_william_adama I think the Chief is right. I think the nova does look like the mandala inside of this Temple.
president_laura_roslin Do you think the Thirteenth Tribe had a vision of what was to come?
chief_galen_tyrol I dont know what else it could mean.
colonel_saul_tigh Maybe they saw another nova, and drew a picture of that. Youve seen one nova, youve seen them all.
lt_felix_gaeta well, There was another nova.: Seen 4,000 years ago, around about when the Temple might have been built. Its 13,000 light years from our present position. Its a cloud of gas known as the Ionian Nebula.
admiral_william_adama Maybe it was a road sign... showing the direction that they headed to next.
captain_karl_agathon So Starbuck, tell me, is that what you gotta do to get a little extra rack time around here?
captain_kara_thrace Did you just come by to frak with me?
captain_karl_agathon Actually, I wanted to know if you had any, uh... pictures of your old apartment on Caprica.
captain_kara_thrace Um...yeah, uh... the locker, top shelf. Cigar box. Why?
captain_karl_agathon Curious about something.
captain_kara_thrace Well, I hope you and Sharon arent planning on redecorating, cause youre not gonna get any bright ideas from my old place.
captain_karl_agathon Oh, I remember. Ive seen better looking trainwrecks.
captain_kara_thrace Oh, thank you.
captain_karl_agathon But I do remember those paintings you did.
captain_kara_thrace What about em?
captain_karl_agathon This? Was on the Temple. Whered you get the idea to paint yours?
captain_kara_thrace I dont know. It was just something Ive been doodling since I was a kid, I liked the pattern.
captain_karl_agathon Well... they built the Temple 4,000 years ago.
captain_karl_agathon What is it?
captain_kara_thrace Just something Leoben said once. That I had a destiny, that it had already been written.
john_cavil You know the drill. Long, deep, controlled breathing.
john_cavil At least youll never have to go through this again. The decision wasnt easy, but the conclusion was inevitable. Your model is fundamentally flawed.
danna_biers No. Its not a flaw to question your purpose. Is it? To wonder who programmed us, the way we think and why?
john_cavil Well, thats the problem right there. The messianic conviction that youre on a special mission to enlighten us. Look at the damage its caused.
danna_biers I would do it all again.
john_cavil Yes, we know. Thats why weve decided to... box your entire line. Your consciousness, memory, every thought your model ever had... are going into cold storage. Indefinitely.
danna_biers one must die to know the truth. There are five other Cylons, brother. I saw them. one day, youre gonna see them too. one day...
john_cavil Good-bye.
danna_biers Brother... brother...
danna_biers Brother...
