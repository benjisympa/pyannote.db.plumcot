Apollo No, Im sorry. I cant live like this.
Starbuck So I wont divorce, and you wont cheat. So where does that leave us?
Apollo Trapped.
Baltar Whats this?
Three This orders the summary executions of all the detainees listed on the next page. It requires your signature.
Gaeta This is a death warrant. Have you seen the names on this list? Do you have any idea what theyre about to do up there?
Chip_Six You really are a Cylon. A member of the Final Five. These feelings are just part of your programming.
Hybrid The Final Five revealed only to those who enter the Temple. only to the chosen one. The chosen one.
Chip_Six Her destiny will part company from yours, Gaius. Shes not the chosen one. You are.
Baltar Dear God, tell me the truth before I die. Am I a Cylon?
Chief_knocking_him_out Welcome home, Mr. President.
Chip_SixBaltar_VO Close your eyes, go to sleep/ Babys in the cradle counting sheep/ Climb up to your house of dreams/ Babys in the cradle fast asleep ...
Baltar ...Should I die before I wake...
Baltar_looking_mad Sorry, improvising.
Chip_Six Youre doing the right thing, Gaius.
Chip_Six Gaius?
Baltar Huh? Yeah. Yes.
Sergeant Wake up!
Chip_SixBaltar Close your eyes go to sleep/ Babys in the cradle counting sheep ...
Chip_Six House of dreams...
Baltar Wait. Wait a moment. I need some time to think this through.
Chip_Six_kissing_his_cheek_as_he_stares_out Too late, Gaius. Its time to learn the truth.
Gaeta_approaching Sergeant.
Sergeant Sorry, sir, no ones allowed to speak to the prisoner without direct presidential authorization.
Gaeta I already have authorization. I need to speak to the prisoner now.
Sergeant Step back, sir.
Chip_Six_as_he_dies Thats it, Gaius. Deep breaths. Deep breaths.
Six Thats it, Gaius, Deep breaths. Deep breaths.
Six The first times the hardest. Youre doing wonderfully.
Baltar Im alive?
Baltar Im alive. Thank God, Im alive!
Six_above I always told you to have faith.
Baltar_to_the_Six_on_his_right_hand Then no one was betrayed. I was never one of them. I am one of you.
Six_above_stroking_his_face_and_hair Is that what you think, Gaius?
Baltar I knew it. I knew it. I always knew I was different.
Baltar Special. Maybe a little gifted. Oh...
Baltar Ah...ah... ah! That was a bit rough, actually. That hurts.
Baltar Aah! Aah! Whats wrong?
Six_on_his_left You are, Gaius. Youre not Cylon, youre human. And youre dead!
Sergeant Hes alive.
Gaeta Ill get Cottle.
Apollo Well, Im just saying youre gonna be surprised.
Chief Yeah, well, Major...
Apollo Right this way.
Chief Joes? I think Ive seen a bar before.
Chief Youve got to be frakkin kidding me!
Apollo_laughing Come on. Hey, this way. Hey, Joe.
Joe_the_bartender Chief Tyrol, welcome. Any friend of the Majors is a friend of mine. Which means you get the good stuff.
Chief_laughing Thank you very much. Dont mind if I do. Im not going home tonight, so...
Apollo Whoa. You, uh, you and Cally have a fight?
Chief You didnt hear us? I figure we could have sold tickets. Ahh ... To marriage. Why we build bars.
Apollo_laughing Yeah. Yeah. Joe!
Cottle I warned about the dangers of sleep deprivation. Psychosis can make a man do strange things. And Baltars little hunger strike is not helping either.
Tigh The bastard wants to die that bad, I say let him.
Roslin Bottom line, we need Baltar to talk. If the other Cylon saw the same symbols that we saw, they could be on their way to Earth, they could be setting up an ambush by now. Im betting that after tonight, hell be more willing. Doc, wait an hour or two. I want him cogent. I also dont want him to starve.
Cottle Well, what do you expect me to do about it?
Roslin I expect you to make sure he eats.
Tigh Ill see about putting security cameras in that cell.
Roslin Uh, Mr. Gaeta. What, exactly, were you doing going to see Dr. Baltar in the middle of the night?
Gaeta Um... I couldnt sleep. And I guess I thought he might be willing to talk to me.
Adama We understand. Just leave his interrogation to us.
Gaeta_sad_and_a_little_sneaky Of course.
Dualla Youre up late.
Apollo You know, the Chief says Hi.
Dualla He one of your new drinking buddies?
Apollo You know, I would invite you, but you made it very clear its not your thing.
Dualla No, its your thing, and thats not what I was asking.
Apollo_lying_down Ive got a briefing at 0500.
Dualla Are we still on for dinner tomorrow?
Apollo_sighing Damn it. Yeah.
Dualla Cause I already switched watches.
Apollo Sure.
Dualla Itd be nice for a husband and wife to occasionally... Forget it.
Roslin_entering_Baltars_cell Thank you. You can leave the door open. Hi.
Baltar_still_standing Touch√©, Madame President.
Roslin I have no wish to see you suffer.
Baltar Really? Ive just had the pleasure of having a tube forced up my nose and down my throat.
Roslin_nodding_brightly Everybodys gotta eat. Its for your own good. And its nothing compared to what many of our people were subjected to in your jail cells on New Caprica.
Baltar_finally_sitting Not my jails. The Cylons.
Roslin Its an academic distinction at this point, Doctor. You know, none of us are enjoying this, so why dont you just tell me what I need to know, and your suffering will come to an end. And I promise you this.
Baltar I know nothing about the Cylon plans or their whereabouts. I witnessed nothing in that Temple. My information on Cylon intelligence is ... is limited, to say the least.
Roslin Prior to the attack on the Colonies, did you have high-level security clearance?
Baltar Yeah, so what?
Roslin Did you tell anybody about it? Did you let someone into the defense mainframe?
Chip_Six_appearing Careful, Gaius.
Roslin The blonde woman that I saw you with on Caprica just prior to the attack?
Chip_Six Shell flush you out of an airlock without a moments hesitation.
Chip_Six Unless, of course... that prospect no longer frightens you.
Baltar Lies. All lies. A rehash of all the other old lies. I did not collude... in the genocide of my own people.
Roslin This is Devlin and Maryanne McAllister, and their son and daughter. This is a family of four that was gunned down in their own home on suspicion of harboring insurgents...
Baltar -- I am not responsible...
Roslin_without_stopping_throwing_photographs_into_his_face -- I just wondered if you recognized even one of these faces. Did any image get through to you on the rare occasion when you ventured out ...
Baltar -- I am not responsible for the occupation any more than I am for the genocide...
Roslin -- From behind your sandbags and your razor wire to see what was happening to your people?! Your people! I need to know! Now! Colonel Tigh, get in here! Get this man out of here...
Baltar -- This is not about uncovering any legitimate threat ...
Roslin_making_a_sudden_jerking_motion -- Hes not gonna talk. I want you to take him, I want you to toss him out the nearest airlock ...
Baltar -- This is about exacting your pound of flesh...
Roslin -- Guards! Get in here now! Get rid of him ...
Baltar -- What happened to my fair trial?
Roslin -- Take him out of here!
Baltar_as_they_grab_him Get your hands off me. Get your motherfrakkin hands off me! I demand a fair trial! I am a citizen of the Colonies, and I demand a fair trial! A fair trial!
Roslin Take a good look, Doctor, these are just a fraction of the people you sent to their deaths -- rather fitting they should see you take your last steps...
Baltar -- Stop. Stop, wait! Stop!
Roslin -- What? What?!
Baltar -- You asked me if I know any of these people. I know that man...
Roslin -- Yes! Show me. Show me! Let him go. Let him go. Keep your guns up ...
Baltar -- This man. His name was Adrian Bauer. He was my lab assistant for three years on Caprica...
Roslin -- So what?
Baltar -- He was Geminese. I got him a visa. I introduced him to his wife. I am Godfather to their first child I wouldnt do anything to harm this man or his family. Or anybodys family. I am not a murderer. I am innocent. Why wont you believe me?!
Roslin -- Get him! Take him out of here!
Baltar -- Is this what you call Colonial justice? What did I ever do for you, huh? only save your bleeding life! Aah!
Adama You gave it your best shot. I understand.
Tigh Yeah, the bastard still wouldnt talk. Either hes got more stones than I gave him credit for, or...
Adama Or he knew you were bluffing.
Tigh_standing Well, what do we do with him now?
Adama There is one thing.
Roslin_finally_looking_up_speaking_softly Admiral?
Adama The military once ran an experimental interrogation program involving drugs. Hallucinogens, specifically. The goal of the program was to create a state of anxiety so intense that the subject believed that their very survival was at stake. The interrogators would exploit that. Become less an adversary, and more a lifeline. At least that was the idea. It might get Baltar to talk, tell us what the Cylons know about Earth. But its dangerous. Especially for someone in Baltars condition.
Roslinstands_up_looking_from_Tigh_to_Adama Are you telling me we have these drugs aboard
Starbuck_taking_a_drink Youre being awfully accommodating.
Anders_dressing Is that how it looks to you?
Starbuck_with_a_conspiratorial_grin Your estranged, two-timing bitch of a wife calls you up for a quickie, and you hop on the first shuttle? Id say yeah.
Anders Ive been thinking about some stuff, Kara.
Starbuck Yeah? Like what?
Anders Like... what that crazy skinjob Leoben said about you and a special destiny. I mean, what if theres something to that?
Starbuckis_silent_then_grins Kara Thrace and her special destiny? It sounds more like a bad cover band, Sam.
Anders Think about it, though. Why did I survive all those months on Caprica, waiting for you to return, if I was just gonna walk out on you? And you, I mean, did you go through that hell, locked in the fake house with that fake husband, just so you could ditch me? I dont think so. You know, when I think about it like that... Do you love him?
Starbuck_startled ...What?
Anders Lee, Kara. Do you love Lee?
Starbuck_nearly_crying Gods, Sam. Maybe. I dont know.
Anders_shaking_head Then you gotta go to him.
Dualla I thought you were off duty.
Apollo_getting_dressed_again I am, yeah. I was just gonna stop by the bar for a little while.
Dualla If youre gonna see Kara, just admit it.
Apollo Look, I told you theres nothing going on.
Dualla Yeah, you both told me Lee wont cheat, hes too noble. only problem is, its all a crock, isnt it?
Apollo You know what the only problem is? The only problem is that you dont trust me. Thats it. And this is just your own frakkin insecurities talking. Same as always. I mean, right from the get-go, I ... The very first morning that I proposed. You know what? Forget it. This is frakking pointless.
Dualla No, youre right. I did see this coming. And I was naive enough to marry you anyway. And you want to know why, Lee? Because I loved you. I loved you so frakking much. I thought I was lucky. Thats right, lucky. That I could have you ... for just as long as you or Kara would let me.
Apollo ... Dee, its... Come on.
Dualla_whimpers_and_pulls_away_then_looks_him_in_the_eye_sadly Its not a marriage, Lee. This is a lie. You want to be with Kara? Go ahead. I wont stand in your way. Its over.
Apollo Wait, where are you...?
Starbuck_shaking_her_head_sadly Sam.
Anders I gotta get going. This was fun.
Anders I love you.
Baltar Im a human being. Im a human being, I have rights. I said I have rights. Please.
Baltar Please help me!
Chip_Six Im not sure I can, Gaius. Pain is one thing, but this... Without free will, what are you? Can God even pity such a creature?
Baltar Why not just admit youre doing this for your own satisfaction?
Baltar Thats the truth, isnt it? I dont know why youre not putting the needle in yourself.
Cottle Hold his head.
Baltar Oh, no. No, no, no, no! No! No! Oh God!
Cottle Hes under.
Adama Try not to make any loud noise. Put the head strap on.
Baltar Where am I? Oh, my God, where am I?
Apollo What are you saying?
Starbuck If I leave Sam... Will you still leave Dee?
Apollo My Gods, Kara. I mean... You know, how do I know that tomorrow youre not gonna pull another 180? I mean these are our frakking marriages were talking about. Its not some stupid dogfight we can just jink our way out of.
Starbuck Think about it, Lee. Thats what youre best at.
Baltar Where am I? My God, where am I?
Adama_VO_echoing_like_Zeus Can you hear my voice? Can you hear me, Doctor?
Baltar Admiral, is that you?
Adama Im looking for you, Doctor.
Adama We cant find you. Can you tell us where you are?
Baltar Its water. Im in the water. Its cold, and its dark. I cant see anything.
Adama Is there anything that you can see that can tell us where you are?
Adama_VO Look for the light. Can you see the light?
Baltar Yes.
Adama Try to reach for the light.
Adama Thats it. Thats it. Thats it. Follow the light.
Baltar Caprica.
Baltar Caprica Six. She saved my life. Shielded me from the explosion.
Roslin Doctor, did you conspire with her to subvert our defense system?
Baltar Conspiracy requires intent!
Baltar I never intended... But she said deep down, Id always suspected.
Baltar But I didnt know. How could I know?
Baltar Did I conspire?
Baltar Did I?
Baltar No! No.
Baltar I dont know. No.
Baltar It wasnt my fault. It wasnt my fault! I am not ...
Baltar Responsible!
Baltar She... Caprica Six... she chose me. Chose me over all men. Chosen to be seduced Guided between the light and the dark. But is she an angel, or is she a demon? Is she imaginary, or is she real? Is she my own voice, or the voice...
Baltar I cant stay afloat much longer!
Adama Now give us details, Doctor. Give us details about the Cylons, or ... well let you drownd [
Baltar_screaming_madly Nooooooooo!
Apollo Hey, Chief.
Chief_sadly Why is it so frakkin hard? Why cant we just get back to normal?
Apollo Normal. What is normal anyway? Chief, you can tell me if Im out of line here, but, um... do you ever think about Sharon?
Chief_staring_at_his_glass No.
Apollo_refilling_Chiefs_drink Come on. You never wonder what if?
Chief No.
Baltar Look, dont leave me! Dont leave me. I know Im flawed, I never claimed to be... Yeah, mistakes, mistakes were made. Terrible mistakes. Were they mine? Am I solely to blame? I was a player, thats all. I was a player, I was struggling, trying to find my place in Gods plan. Gods resolve. I never intended for certain things to happen! Doesnt that matter?
Adama You took the Cylons to the Temple.
Adama_VO To the Eye of Jupiter. What did it tell them?
Adama What did it tell them about Earth?
Baltar I wasnt looking for ...
Adama_shining_the_light_on_him_again what were you looking for, doctor? What were you looking for?
Baltar Their faces, but they wouldnt show them to me.
Roslin Their faces? Whose faces?
Baltar The Five.
Baltar The Final Five.
Roslin The Final Five? Cylons?
Baltar I thought I might be one of them. I told them I wanted to be one of them.
Roslin A Cylon. Why?
Baltar All my sins forgiven. A new beginning.
Roslin Are you a Cylon, Dr. Baltar?
Baltar_sadly No.
Adama_in_his_ear Thats not good enough, Doctor. Tell me. Tell me what you told the Cylons.
Adama_VO What do they know? Tell me, or...
Adama Ill let you go, Doctor.
Adama_VO Ill have to let you go. Tell me, or Ill let you go, Doctor. Ill have to let you go. Ill have to let you go. Ill have to let you go ...
Apollo_bumping_drunkenly_into_a_crewman Watch where youre going!
Apollo Wheres my ring? Has anybody seen my ring? I lost my ring.
Apollo Has anybody seen my ring? Where is it?! Wheres my...
Cottle_as_the_monitor_beeps Admiral, were losing him. Thats enough. Im putting an end to this freak show right now.
Roslin Now, listen to this. Five final Cylon models. Five pillars of the Temple, for the five priests devoted to the one whose name cannot be spoken.
Tigh Come on, its all just mumbo jumbo.
Roslin Hes holding a lot back, Admiral. Im sure of it.
Adama Then maybe we should resort to more direct methods.
Tigh Direct methods? Now you have my vote.
Roslin_grossed_out No. We tried the stick. Its time to try the carrot. The thing hes most deeply afraid of is even if he talks, well kill him.
Tigh Smart man.
Roslin We have to ease his fear. Make him believe that if he collaborates, at the very least hell have his life.
Adama He wont buy that, coming from us.
Roslin Of course not. We have to find someone he trusts.
Baltar As perverse as it may seem, I may actually owe these people a debt of gratitude.
Apollo_sitting_with_Dualla_in_civvies you know, I realize theres probably nothing I can say that can make this right. But theres something you need to know. I asked you to marry me because I was in love with you. Just like Im in love with you now.
Baltar_turning_to_Gaeta They forced me... to admit my failings.
Baltar And now that I have, I feel positively liberated.
Apollo You were right, I loved Kara. And you know, maybe theres a part of me that always will.
Baltar In my heart, I know I have always done what Ive had to do.
Apollo But I married you. I married you. And you know, when I look back at our marriage, at the time that we have spent together... You are good for me, Dee. And I need you. And I dont think I ever really realized that, till I knew that I was losing you.
Gaeta I cant promise you a trial, Doctor. But Im sure that if youll give them something.
Gaeta_VO Anything...
Apollo but please just give me another chance. Thats all Im asking. Just give me a chance. Please.
Gaeta These charts that Ive been using to plot our course to Earth. Ive never been ... confident of my calculations.
Baltar_picking_up_the_pen Hmm, thats lucky, because the calculations are wrong. I detect a number of inconsistencies right off the bat. You see, these figures here are wrong.
Gaeta_staring_up_at_the_camera Thats exactly what I was afraid of.
Baltar The Cylon navigation systems are far more advanced than our own, but I have managed to commit many of their algorithms to memory.
Gaeta If you can offer them this kind of help, Im certain at the very least theyll spare your life. Maybe we can even get you out of this cell, and offer you some proper quarters.
Baltar Creature comforts, theres the clincher.
Gaeta Sorry?
Baltar Where is it?
Gaeta Um, where is what, Doctor?
Baltar_scornfully Where is what?
Tigh So much for that little stratagem.
Baltar_on_CCTV Hello.
Anders Hey. You all right? Listen, we dont have to stay here if you dont want to, okay?
Starbuck Uh... Yeah.
Anders Two whiskeys, straight up.
Baltar I should have known that youd betray me. What did you tell them? That you stayed behind till the grisly end on New Caprica, so you could what? So you could, uh -- you could feed information to the Resistance? Who do you think allowed you to do that?
Gaeta_grossed_out Thats a lie!
Baltar No, its not a lie. You think Im blind? You see, I literally had a gun pointed to my head. But nobody forced you to play both sides. So Im asking you, Mr. Gaeta... who is the real traitor in this room?
Anders_smiling To the first of many.
Anders Lets do another.
Starbuck Yeah.
Gaeta I am not a traitor.
Baltar Because there are far worse things than being a traitor. Arent there, Felix? If your friends only knew the truth. Dont worry. Well keep that a secret.
Adama We gotta get in there.
Gaeta Get away from me!
Gaeta Frak you!
Sergeant_entering_with_the_others_on_his_heel Lieutenant Gaeta, step away from the prisoner, now! Step away from the prisoner. I will not ask you again.
Adama Stand down, Sergeant. Step back, Mr. Gaeta!
Gaeta No, no! No sir, I cant. I cant let him live, not after what hes done!
Roslinlooks_from_Adama_to_Gaeta_circles_around_in_front_of_him Mr. Gaeta. Mr. Gaeta, wait please. Look at me. I understand what youre feeling.
Gaeta_shuffling_away_from_her No you dont!
Roslin Yes, I do. The other night, you didnt come here to interrogate Dr. Baltar, you came here to kill him, didnt you? I understand that. I do.
Roslin Whats his condition?
Cottle He missed the artery. Hell live. Better get him to sick bay. Get a gurney in here right away.
Roslin_to_the_Sergeant_helping_Gaeta_up Go easy on him.
Chip_Six all things considered, Gaius, it could have been worse. Much worse. And well ... Youre not one of the Five, you certainly have the luck of the Gods.
Baltar Well, I am the chosen one.
Chip_Six You didnt go tell them that, did you?
Baltar Huh? No. Everybodys gotta have a secret.
Roslin_to_the_Marines_handling_her Gentle...
Roslin Thank you.
Roslin All we really know is that Baltar was not involved in the attack, and we need more.
Caprica And I need to know that I wont be airlocked.
Roslin No. You will not be airlocked. You have my word.
Caprica Like you gave Leoben your word? Before sending him reeling out into space?
Caprica Yeah, he told us.
Roslin_lying_on_the_couch I told him I didnt take any satisfaction in seeing his pain. But the truth is, I was willing to see him endure a great deal of suffering, in order to get what I wanted. It wasnt some intelligence or some truth. I wanted a genuine admission of guilt.
Adama Thats something that youre not gonna get from someone like Baltar. He doesnt see himself that way. Its not who he is. In his eyes hes the victim, not the criminal.
Adama Its not too late for him to just disappear.
Roslinsmiles_sadly_and_puts_her_hand_on_his_arm_whispering We cant do that. For all his crimes, hes one of us.
Adama So what happens next?
Roslin We give him his trial.
