cpt_lee_adama No, Im sorry. I cant live like this.
captain_kara_thrace So I wont divorce, and you wont cheat. So where does that leave us?
cpt_lee_adama Trapped.
dr_gaius_baltar Whats this?
danna_biers This orders the summary executions of all the detainees listed on the next page. It requires your signature.
lt_felix_gaeta This is a death warrant. Have you seen the names on this list? Do you have any idea what theyre about to do up there?
Chip_Six#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode13 You really are a Cylon. A member of the Final Five. These feelings are just part of your programming.
Hybrid#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode13 The Final Five revealed only to those who enter the Temple. only to the chosen one. The chosen one.
Chip_Six#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode13 Her destiny will part company from yours, Gaius. Shes not the chosen one. You are.
dr_gaius_baltar Dear God, tell me the truth before I die. Am I a Cylon?
chief_galen_tyrol Welcome home, Mr. President.
Chip_SixBaltar_VO#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode13 Close your eyes, go to sleep/ Babys in the cradle counting sheep/ Climb up to your house of dreams/ Babys in the cradle fast asleep ...
dr_gaius_baltar ...Should I die before I wake...
dr_gaius_baltar Sorry, improvising.
Chip_Six#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode13 Youre doing the right thing, Gaius.
Chip_Six#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode13 Gaius?
dr_gaius_baltar Huh? Yeah. Yes.
Sergeant#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode13 Wake up!
Chip_SixBaltar#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode13 Close your eyes go to sleep/ Babys in the cradle counting sheep ...
Chip_Six#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode13 House of dreams...
dr_gaius_baltar Wait. Wait a moment. I need some time to think this through.
Chip_Six_kissing_his_cheek_as_he_stares_out#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode13 Too late, Gaius. Its time to learn the truth.
lt_felix_gaeta Sergeant.
Sergeant#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode13 Sorry, sir, no ones allowed to speak to the prisoner without direct presidential authorization.
lt_felix_gaeta I already have authorization. I need to speak to the prisoner now.
Sergeant#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode13 Step back, sir.
Chip_Six_as_he_dies#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode13 Thats it, Gaius. Deep breaths. Deep breaths.
number_six Thats it, Gaius, Deep breaths. Deep breaths.
number_six The first times the hardest. Youre doing wonderfully.
dr_gaius_baltar Im alive?
dr_gaius_baltar Im alive. Thank God, Im alive!
number_six I always told you to have faith.
dr_gaius_baltar Then no one was betrayed. I was never one of them. I am one of you.
number_six Is that what you think, Gaius?
dr_gaius_baltar I knew it. I knew it. I always knew I was different.
dr_gaius_baltar Special. Maybe a little gifted. Oh...
dr_gaius_baltar Ah...ah... ah! That was a bit rough, actually. That hurts.
dr_gaius_baltar Aah! Aah! Whats wrong?
number_six You are, Gaius. Youre not Cylon, youre human. And youre dead!
Sergeant#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode13 Hes alive.
lt_felix_gaeta Ill get Cottle.
cpt_lee_adama Well, Im just saying youre gonna be surprised.
chief_galen_tyrol Yeah, well, Major...
cpt_lee_adama Right this way.
chief_galen_tyrol Joes? I think Ive seen a bar before.
chief_galen_tyrol Youve got to be frakkin kidding me!
cpt_lee_adama Come on. Hey, this way. Hey, Joe.
joe Chief Tyrol, welcome. Any friend of the Majors is a friend of mine. Which means you get the good stuff.
chief_galen_tyrol Thank you very much. Dont mind if I do. Im not going home tonight, so...
cpt_lee_adama Whoa. You, uh, you and Cally have a fight?
chief_galen_tyrol You didnt hear us? I figure we could have sold tickets. Ahh ... To marriage. Why we build bars.
cpt_lee_adama Yeah. Yeah. Joe!
dr_cottle I warned about the dangers of sleep deprivation. Psychosis can make a man do strange things. And Baltars little hunger strike is not helping either.
colonel_saul_tigh The bastard wants to die that bad, I say let him.
president_laura_roslin Bottom line, we need Baltar to talk. If the other Cylon saw the same symbols that we saw, they could be on their way to Earth, they could be setting up an ambush by now. Im betting that after tonight, hell be more willing. Doc, wait an hour or two. I want him cogent. I also dont want him to starve.
dr_cottle Well, what do you expect me to do about it?
president_laura_roslin I expect you to make sure he eats.
colonel_saul_tigh Ill see about putting security cameras in that cell.
president_laura_roslin Uh, Mr. Gaeta. What, exactly, were you doing going to see Dr. Baltar in the middle of the night?
lt_felix_gaeta Um... I couldnt sleep. And I guess I thought he might be willing to talk to me.
admiral_william_adama We understand. Just leave his interrogation to us.
lt_felix_gaeta Of course.
officer_anastasia_dualla Youre up late.
cpt_lee_adama You know, the Chief says Hi.
officer_anastasia_dualla He one of your new drinking buddies?
cpt_lee_adama You know, I would invite you, but you made it very clear its not your thing.
officer_anastasia_dualla No, its your thing, and thats not what I was asking.
cpt_lee_adama Ive got a briefing at 0500.
officer_anastasia_dualla Are we still on for dinner tomorrow?
cpt_lee_adama Damn it. Yeah.
officer_anastasia_dualla Cause I already switched watches.
cpt_lee_adama Sure.
officer_anastasia_dualla Itd be nice for a husband and wife to occasionally... Forget it.
president_laura_roslin Thank you. You can leave the door open. Hi.
dr_gaius_baltar Touch√©, Madame President.
president_laura_roslin I have no wish to see you suffer.
dr_gaius_baltar Really? Ive just had the pleasure of having a tube forced up my nose and down my throat.
president_laura_roslin Everybodys gotta eat. Its for your own good. And its nothing compared to what many of our people were subjected to in your jail cells on New Caprica.
dr_gaius_baltar Not my jails. The Cylons.
president_laura_roslin Its an academic distinction at this point, Doctor. You know, none of us are enjoying this, so why dont you just tell me what I need to know, and your suffering will come to an end. And I promise you this.
dr_gaius_baltar I know nothing about the Cylon plans or their whereabouts. I witnessed nothing in that Temple. My information on Cylon intelligence is ... is limited, to say the least.
president_laura_roslin Prior to the attack on the Colonies, did you have high-level security clearance?
dr_gaius_baltar Yeah, so what?
president_laura_roslin Did you tell anybody about it? Did you let someone into the defense mainframe?
Chip_Six_appearing#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode13 Careful, Gaius.
president_laura_roslin The blonde woman that I saw you with on Caprica just prior to the attack?
Chip_Six#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode13 Shell flush you out of an airlock without a moments hesitation.
Chip_Six#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode13 Unless, of course... that prospect no longer frightens you.
dr_gaius_baltar Lies. All lies. A rehash of all the other old lies. I did not collude... in the genocide of my own people.
president_laura_roslin This is Devlin and Maryanne McAllister, and their son and daughter. This is a family of four that was gunned down in their own home on suspicion of harboring insurgents...
dr_gaius_baltar -- I am not responsible...
president_laura_roslin -- I just wondered if you recognized even one of these faces. Did any image get through to you on the rare occasion when you ventured out ...
dr_gaius_baltar -- I am not responsible for the occupation any more than I am for the genocide...
president_laura_roslin -- From behind your sandbags and your razor wire to see what was happening to your people?! Your people! I need to know! Now! Colonel Tigh, get in here! Get this man out of here...
dr_gaius_baltar -- This is not about uncovering any legitimate threat ...
president_laura_roslin -- Hes not gonna talk. I want you to take him, I want you to toss him out the nearest airlock ...
dr_gaius_baltar -- This is about exacting your pound of flesh...
president_laura_roslin -- Guards! Get in here now! Get rid of him ...
dr_gaius_baltar -- What happened to my fair trial?
president_laura_roslin -- Take him out of here!
dr_gaius_baltar Get your hands off me. Get your motherfrakkin hands off me! I demand a fair trial! I am a citizen of the Colonies, and I demand a fair trial! A fair trial!
president_laura_roslin Take a good look, Doctor, these are just a fraction of the people you sent to their deaths -- rather fitting they should see you take your last steps...
dr_gaius_baltar -- Stop. Stop, wait! Stop!
president_laura_roslin -- What? What?!
dr_gaius_baltar -- You asked me if I know any of these people. I know that man...
president_laura_roslin -- Yes! Show me. Show me! Let him go. Let him go. Keep your guns up ...
dr_gaius_baltar -- This man. His name was Adrian Bauer. He was my lab assistant for three years on Caprica...
president_laura_roslin -- So what?
dr_gaius_baltar -- He was Geminese. I got him a visa. I introduced him to his wife. I am Godfather to their first child I wouldnt do anything to harm this man or his family. Or anybodys family. I am not a murderer. I am innocent. Why wont you believe me?!
president_laura_roslin -- Get him! Take him out of here!
dr_gaius_baltar -- Is this what you call Colonial justice? What did I ever do for you, huh? only save your bleeding life! Aah!
admiral_william_adama You gave it your best shot. I understand.
colonel_saul_tigh Yeah, the bastard still wouldnt talk. Either hes got more stones than I gave him credit for, or...
admiral_william_adama Or he knew you were bluffing.
colonel_saul_tigh Well, what do we do with him now?
admiral_william_adama There is one thing.
president_laura_roslin Admiral?
admiral_william_adama The military once ran an experimental interrogation program involving drugs. Hallucinogens, specifically. The goal of the program was to create a state of anxiety so intense that the subject believed that their very survival was at stake. The interrogators would exploit that. Become less an adversary, and more a lifeline. At least that was the idea. It might get Baltar to talk, tell us what the Cylons know about Earth. But its dangerous. Especially for someone in Baltars condition.
president_laura_roslin Are you telling me we have these drugs aboard
captain_kara_thrace Youre being awfully accommodating.
samuel_anders Is that how it looks to you?
captain_kara_thrace Your estranged, two-timing bitch of a wife calls you up for a quickie, and you hop on the first shuttle? Id say yeah.
samuel_anders Ive been thinking about some stuff, Kara.
captain_kara_thrace Yeah? Like what?
samuel_anders Like... what that crazy skinjob Leoben said about you and a special destiny. I mean, what if theres something to that?
captain_kara_thrace Kara Thrace and her special destiny? It sounds more like a bad cover band, Sam.
samuel_anders Think about it, though. Why did I survive all those months on Caprica, waiting for you to return, if I was just gonna walk out on you? And you, I mean, did you go through that hell, locked in the fake house with that fake husband, just so you could ditch me? I dont think so. You know, when I think about it like that... Do you love him?
captain_kara_thrace ...What?
samuel_anders Lee, Kara. Do you love Lee?
captain_kara_thrace Gods, Sam. Maybe. I dont know.
samuel_anders Then you gotta go to him.
officer_anastasia_dualla I thought you were off duty.
cpt_lee_adama I am, yeah. I was just gonna stop by the bar for a little while.
officer_anastasia_dualla If youre gonna see Kara, just admit it.
cpt_lee_adama Look, I told you theres nothing going on.
officer_anastasia_dualla Yeah, you both told me Lee wont cheat, hes too noble. only problem is, its all a crock, isnt it?
cpt_lee_adama You know what the only problem is? The only problem is that you dont trust me. Thats it. And this is just your own frakkin insecurities talking. Same as always. I mean, right from the get-go, I ... The very first morning that I proposed. You know what? Forget it. This is frakking pointless.
officer_anastasia_dualla No, youre right. I did see this coming. And I was naive enough to marry you anyway. And you want to know why, Lee? Because I loved you. I loved you so frakking much. I thought I was lucky. Thats right, lucky. That I could have you ... for just as long as you or Kara would let me.
cpt_lee_adama ... Dee, its... Come on.
officer_anastasia_dualla Its not a marriage, Lee. This is a lie. You want to be with Kara? Go ahead. I wont stand in your way. Its over.
cpt_lee_adama Wait, where are you...?
captain_kara_thrace Sam.
samuel_anders I gotta get going. This was fun.
samuel_anders I love you.
dr_gaius_baltar Im a human being. Im a human being, I have rights. I said I have rights. Please.
dr_gaius_baltar Please help me!
Chip_Six#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode13 Im not sure I can, Gaius. Pain is one thing, but this... Without free will, what are you? Can God even pity such a creature?
dr_gaius_baltar Why not just admit youre doing this for your own satisfaction?
dr_gaius_baltar Thats the truth, isnt it? I dont know why youre not putting the needle in yourself.
dr_cottle Hold his head.
dr_gaius_baltar Oh, no. No, no, no, no! No! No! Oh God!
dr_cottle Hes under.
admiral_william_adama Try not to make any loud noise. Put the head strap on.
dr_gaius_baltar Where am I? Oh, my God, where am I?
cpt_lee_adama What are you saying?
captain_kara_thrace If I leave Sam... Will you still leave Dee?
cpt_lee_adama My Gods, Kara. I mean... You know, how do I know that tomorrow youre not gonna pull another 180? I mean these are our frakking marriages were talking about. Its not some stupid dogfight we can just jink our way out of.
captain_kara_thrace Think about it, Lee. Thats what youre best at.
dr_gaius_baltar Where am I? My God, where am I?
Adama_VO_echoing_like_Zeus#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode13 Can you hear my voice? Can you hear me, Doctor?
dr_gaius_baltar Admiral, is that you?
admiral_william_adama Im looking for you, Doctor.
admiral_william_adama We cant find you. Can you tell us where you are?
dr_gaius_baltar Its water. Im in the water. Its cold, and its dark. I cant see anything.
admiral_william_adama Is there anything that you can see that can tell us where you are?
Adama_VO#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode13 Look for the light. Can you see the light?
dr_gaius_baltar Yes.
admiral_william_adama Try to reach for the light.
admiral_william_adama Thats it. Thats it. Thats it. Follow the light.
dr_gaius_baltar Caprica.
dr_gaius_baltar Caprica Six. She saved my life. Shielded me from the explosion.
president_laura_roslin Doctor, did you conspire with her to subvert our defense system?
dr_gaius_baltar Conspiracy requires intent!
dr_gaius_baltar I never intended... But she said deep down, Id always suspected.
dr_gaius_baltar But I didnt know. How could I know?
dr_gaius_baltar Did I conspire?
dr_gaius_baltar Did I?
dr_gaius_baltar No! No.
dr_gaius_baltar I dont know. No.
dr_gaius_baltar It wasnt my fault. It wasnt my fault! I am not ...
dr_gaius_baltar Responsible!
dr_gaius_baltar She... Caprica Six... she chose me. Chose me over all men. Chosen to be seduced Guided between the light and the dark. But is she an angel, or is she a demon? Is she imaginary, or is she real? Is she my own voice, or the voice...
dr_gaius_baltar I cant stay afloat much longer!
admiral_william_adama Now give us details, Doctor. Give us details about the Cylons, or ... well let you drownd [
dr_gaius_baltar Nooooooooo!
cpt_lee_adama Hey, Chief.
chief_galen_tyrol Why is it so frakkin hard? Why cant we just get back to normal?
cpt_lee_adama Normal. What is normal anyway? Chief, you can tell me if Im out of line here, but, um... do you ever think about Sharon?
chief_galen_tyrol No.
cpt_lee_adama Come on. You never wonder what if?
chief_galen_tyrol No.
dr_gaius_baltar Look, dont leave me! Dont leave me. I know Im flawed, I never claimed to be... Yeah, mistakes, mistakes were made. Terrible mistakes. Were they mine? Am I solely to blame? I was a player, thats all. I was a player, I was struggling, trying to find my place in Gods plan. Gods resolve. I never intended for certain things to happen! Doesnt that matter?
admiral_william_adama You took the Cylons to the Temple.
Adama_VO#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode13 To the Eye of Jupiter. What did it tell them?
admiral_william_adama What did it tell them about Earth?
dr_gaius_baltar I wasnt looking for ...
admiral_william_adama what were you looking for, doctor? What were you looking for?
dr_gaius_baltar Their faces, but they wouldnt show them to me.
president_laura_roslin Their faces? Whose faces?
dr_gaius_baltar The Five.
dr_gaius_baltar The Final Five.
president_laura_roslin The Final Five? Cylons?
dr_gaius_baltar I thought I might be one of them. I told them I wanted to be one of them.
president_laura_roslin A Cylon. Why?
dr_gaius_baltar All my sins forgiven. A new beginning.
president_laura_roslin Are you a Cylon, Dr. Baltar?
dr_gaius_baltar No.
admiral_william_adama Thats not good enough, Doctor. Tell me. Tell me what you told the Cylons.
Adama_VO#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode13 What do they know? Tell me, or...
admiral_william_adama Ill let you go, Doctor.
Adama_VO#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode13 Ill have to let you go. Tell me, or Ill let you go, Doctor. Ill have to let you go. Ill have to let you go. Ill have to let you go ...
cpt_lee_adama Watch where youre going!
cpt_lee_adama Wheres my ring? Has anybody seen my ring? I lost my ring.
cpt_lee_adama Has anybody seen my ring? Where is it?! Wheres my...
dr_cottle Admiral, were losing him. Thats enough. Im putting an end to this freak show right now.
president_laura_roslin Now, listen to this. Five final Cylon models. Five pillars of the Temple, for the five priests devoted to the one whose name cannot be spoken.
colonel_saul_tigh Come on, its all just mumbo jumbo.
president_laura_roslin Hes holding a lot back, Admiral. Im sure of it.
admiral_william_adama Then maybe we should resort to more direct methods.
colonel_saul_tigh Direct methods? Now you have my vote.
president_laura_roslin No. We tried the stick. Its time to try the carrot. The thing hes most deeply afraid of is even if he talks, well kill him.
colonel_saul_tigh Smart man.
president_laura_roslin We have to ease his fear. Make him believe that if he collaborates, at the very least hell have his life.
admiral_william_adama He wont buy that, coming from us.
president_laura_roslin Of course not. We have to find someone he trusts.
dr_gaius_baltar As perverse as it may seem, I may actually owe these people a debt of gratitude.
cpt_lee_adama you know, I realize theres probably nothing I can say that can make this right. But theres something you need to know. I asked you to marry me because I was in love with you. Just like Im in love with you now.
dr_gaius_baltar They forced me... to admit my failings.
dr_gaius_baltar And now that I have, I feel positively liberated.
cpt_lee_adama You were right, I loved Kara. And you know, maybe theres a part of me that always will.
dr_gaius_baltar In my heart, I know I have always done what Ive had to do.
cpt_lee_adama But I married you. I married you. And you know, when I look back at our marriage, at the time that we have spent together... You are good for me, Dee. And I need you. And I dont think I ever really realized that, till I knew that I was losing you.
lt_felix_gaeta I cant promise you a trial, Doctor. But Im sure that if youll give them something.
Gaeta_VO#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode13 Anything...
cpt_lee_adama but please just give me another chance. Thats all Im asking. Just give me a chance. Please.
lt_felix_gaeta These charts that Ive been using to plot our course to Earth. Ive never been ... confident of my calculations.
dr_gaius_baltar Hmm, thats lucky, because the calculations are wrong. I detect a number of inconsistencies right off the bat. You see, these figures here are wrong.
lt_felix_gaeta Thats exactly what I was afraid of.
dr_gaius_baltar The Cylon navigation systems are far more advanced than our own, but I have managed to commit many of their algorithms to memory.
lt_felix_gaeta If you can offer them this kind of help, Im certain at the very least theyll spare your life. Maybe we can even get you out of this cell, and offer you some proper quarters.
dr_gaius_baltar Creature comforts, theres the clincher.
lt_felix_gaeta Sorry?
dr_gaius_baltar Where is it?
lt_felix_gaeta Um, where is what, Doctor?
dr_gaius_baltar Where is what?
colonel_saul_tigh So much for that little stratagem.
dr_gaius_baltar Hello.
samuel_anders Hey. You all right? Listen, we dont have to stay here if you dont want to, okay?
captain_kara_thrace Uh... Yeah.
samuel_anders Two whiskeys, straight up.
dr_gaius_baltar I should have known that youd betray me. What did you tell them? That you stayed behind till the grisly end on New Caprica, so you could what? So you could, uh -- you could feed information to the Resistance? Who do you think allowed you to do that?
lt_felix_gaeta Thats a lie!
dr_gaius_baltar No, its not a lie. You think Im blind? You see, I literally had a gun pointed to my head. But nobody forced you to play both sides. So Im asking you, Mr. Gaeta... who is the real traitor in this room?
samuel_anders To the first of many.
samuel_anders Lets do another.
captain_kara_thrace Yeah.
lt_felix_gaeta I am not a traitor.
dr_gaius_baltar Because there are far worse things than being a traitor. Arent there, Felix? If your friends only knew the truth. Dont worry. Well keep that a secret.
admiral_william_adama We gotta get in there.
lt_felix_gaeta Get away from me!
lt_felix_gaeta Frak you!
Sergeant_entering_with_the_others_on_his_heel#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode13 Lieutenant Gaeta, step away from the prisoner, now! Step away from the prisoner. I will not ask you again.
admiral_william_adama Stand down, Sergeant. Step back, Mr. Gaeta!
lt_felix_gaeta No, no! No sir, I cant. I cant let him live, not after what hes done!
president_laura_roslin Mr. Gaeta. Mr. Gaeta, wait please. Look at me. I understand what youre feeling.
lt_felix_gaeta No you dont!
president_laura_roslin Yes, I do. The other night, you didnt come here to interrogate Dr. Baltar, you came here to kill him, didnt you? I understand that. I do.
president_laura_roslin Whats his condition?
dr_cottle He missed the artery. Hell live. Better get him to sick bay. Get a gurney in here right away.
president_laura_roslin Go easy on him.
Chip_Six#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode13 all things considered, Gaius, it could have been worse. Much worse. And well ... Youre not one of the Five, you certainly have the luck of the Gods.
dr_gaius_baltar Well, I am the chosen one.
Chip_Six#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode13 You didnt go tell them that, did you?
dr_gaius_baltar Huh? No. Everybodys gotta have a secret.
president_laura_roslin Gentle...
president_laura_roslin Thank you.
president_laura_roslin All we really know is that Baltar was not involved in the attack, and we need more.
Caprica#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode13 And I need to know that I wont be airlocked.
president_laura_roslin No. You will not be airlocked. You have my word.
Caprica#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode13 Like you gave Leoben your word? Before sending him reeling out into space?
Caprica#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode13 Yeah, he told us.
president_laura_roslin I told him I didnt take any satisfaction in seeing his pain. But the truth is, I was willing to see him endure a great deal of suffering, in order to get what I wanted. It wasnt some intelligence or some truth. I wanted a genuine admission of guilt.
admiral_william_adama Thats something that youre not gonna get from someone like Baltar. He doesnt see himself that way. Its not who he is. In his eyes hes the victim, not the criminal.
admiral_william_adama Its not too late for him to just disappear.
president_laura_roslin We cant do that. For all his crimes, hes one of us.
admiral_william_adama So what happens next?
president_laura_roslin We give him his trial.
