Helo Previously, on
Helo We all made sacrifices.
Tigh That so?
Helo Yes, thats right.
Tigh Then how come some Cylon-lover is holding down my post?
Sharon Heras alive. Im her mother, and Im going to get her. Im begging you to do this.
Roslin Youve put the entire Fleet in jeopardy. Are you aware of that?
Helo Im not a traitor. I did what I thought was right. Shell get Hera.
Caprica Lets go.
Sharon_shielding_Caprica Whoa, whoa! Hold your fire!
Tigh Get out of the way. Throw that thing in the brig.
Baltar I demand my rights as a colonial citizen to legal representation and full due process.
Roslin Do you?
Adama So what happens next?
Roslin We give him his trial.
Cally Do they really think they can squeeze more civvies onto the starboard Hangar deck?
Chief Thats why Helo was transferred down here -- to manage the civilian refugees.
Gaeta Sir weve got the breakdown on the
Tigh Oh, boy...
Adama Helo may be overmatched down there.
Sharon So a pretty rough night last night, huh?
Sharon Hey, I said you didnt sleep so well.
Helo Oh, stupid dream. Whatever.
Sharon So youre okay?
Helo Yeah.
Sharon Theyre about to increase the population down there by 300 and youre okay.
Helo Yeah. I dont know where Im gonna put them, but its not like Im walking around taking my own pulse. Im fine.
Apollo Hey, there he is.
Starbuck If it isnt the Mayor of Dogville.
Racetrack Hey, cut him some slack, guys.
Starbuck I hear you just got a new shipload of subjects.
Racetrack Helo, come here. Come here. Listen, I need a favor. I have a date tonight with this ripped and ready nugget that I want to break in, you know, just right. Think you could wrangle me up one of those cute little sexy cubicles you got down there?
Helo Yeah, yeah.
Apollo Well see you around, Helo.
Helo Yeah, you guys know where to find me.
Sharon Youre gonna check up on Hera, right?
Helo Yes, Im gonna check up on Hera.
Sharon Okay. I love you.
Helo I love you too.
Helo Welcome aboard. You need to keep moving. Well deal with your questions later. Come on, people, I need you to keep moving. Welcome aboard, but you need to keep moving. I know, I know. Well deal with your concerns. Keep moving, keep moving. Welcome aboard
Buckminster Where are you putting the Sagittarons?
Helo Living arrangements havent been made yet, sir, I need you to keep moving.
Buckminster We want to be with our own!
Tigh You heard the man. Move your ass. Move!
Helo Ive got this under control here, Colonel.
Tigh yeah, sure you do.
Robert Excuse me, maam, could I have a brief look at your son?
King No no, no, no, were fine, were fine. We dont need a doctor.
Robert I know, I know.
King Look, we dont need a doctor. Were Sagittaron. We dont believe in medicine.
Dualla Its all right, maam, this is Dr. Robert. Hes our civilian doctor, he has nothing to do with the military. Well respect your traditions. You can trust me, Im Sagittaron. Its okay.
Robert All right?
Dualla Its okay.
Robert_checking_out_the_boy You feel that? Would you open your mouth for me, please? Open wide. All right. Look at this. Okay, you feel anything? How about here?
King All right, thats enough.
Willie Get your hands off me!
King Thats enough, thats enough. Thank you very much.
Dualla Okay, settle down.
Robert Sir --
Buckminster You just keep your hands to yourself.
Robert Okay, yeah.
Tigh Mike, you brain-dead card cheat. You still owe me that drink.
Robert_noticing_the_epidemic Saul, get out of here. Now.
Tigh Well, youre in a good mood today.
Helo_comes_up Hey, Doc, I dont know, but meme of these people they look, um...
Robert Sick.
Helo Sick, yeah.
Dualla Medic! Dr. Robert!
Robert_running Leave, Saul.
Tigh Yeah
King No, you keep your hands off my son.
Marine Ive got him.
King No! No! Where are they taking him?
Dualla Its all right, maam. Just walk this way.
Tigh So? What have we got here, Mike?
Robert Mellorak sickness. It originates in the kidneys and then rapidly attacks the respiratory and the immune system.
Cottle Its a nasty bit of business. If you dont treat the first symptoms within 48 hours, itll kill you within three to five days.
Adama How contagious is it?
Robert Well, its not airborne, so we lucked out there. Its spread through human contact. Saliva, sexual intercourse, through the skin. Right now it seems confined to the Sagittarons.
Tigh Thats good; theyre welcome to it.
Robert Its obviously spreading down there. Where we were working.
Adama Its curable?
Cottle Absolutely, yes. A shot of bitamucin and youre right as rain in a day or two. And sedatives alleviate the symptoms. But I dont know how long our stock of bitamucin will hold out, so we should probably conserve it and only inoculate after the first symptoms show.
Adama This is a civilian infection, Dr. Robert, so its in your hands. But I want Tyrol and the crew immunized before they get sick. I dont need any downtime.
Cottle If we disinfect everything and stress hygiene, some people wont get sick. And, uh, they wont need the medicine.
Helo Then shouldnt we get everyone to the showers? Especially the Sagittarons. We should make an announcement.
Robert -- No, no, we dont want to single them out anymore than we already have to. Well have a riot on our hands. Now, if it were up to me, I would say just get the Sagittarons settled and then deal with the civvies that have already arrived.
Cottle Huh. Well, at least you wont have to worry about having enough medicine for the Sagittarons.
Adama Yeah. Most of them are gonna refuse it. People are gonna die.
Cottle The last 3,000 years medicines been just the great curse.
Tigh Thats because theyre a bunch of stubborn, root-sucking jackasses holding onto traditions that are a thousand years old.
Man Drink this.
Robert Stink enough for you in here?
Helo Yeah, its a really potent smell.
Robert Thats burdock root. Sagittarons use it as a calmative.
Helo Does it work?
Robert Hell, I dont know. Theyre all gonna die anyway.
Zarek Tell me there wont be a trial.
Roslin_patiently Gaius Baltar will be tried for high crimes and treason. A tribunal of judges will hear the evidence against him, a verdict will be read, he will be found guilty. And he will be finally held responsible for his actions. If you can summon up a little patience, as I have done, we will get through this ordeal.
Zarek Listen to me, Baltar will get his trial. And this is what youll get. A hurricane. The media will descend on you and watch and scrutinize and question your every move. You will have sectarian violence. You will have assassination attempts. You will have civil unrest on a scale weve never seen. Work, labor, everyday routine in this Fleet will come to a complete halt. This trial is going to bring the entire Fleet down.
Tory Mr. Vice President, we have a security plan in order which includes rapid Marine deployment, increased CAP operations, security details...
Zarek -- A hurricane, Laura. If I were you, Id declare martial law during the trial. Youre gonna need a lot more than a little patience to survive. Im here if you need me.
Tory Your best friend, your worst enemy.
Roslin Ive never seen him like that. He was truly frightened.
Man We are not sick. Sagges brought the sickness with them. Send then back.
Helo Okay, sir, where do you suggest that I send them?
Man I dont know. Figure it out.
Helo Okay, your concerns have been noted. Were gonna do the best we can.
Man Yeah, right.
Helo Yes. Can I help you?
King My son is dead.
Helo_nods ...Im sorry. Thats a soma braid, right? You Sagittarons believe its supposed to bring good health? Look, Im sorry. Its not enough. If you dont treat the disease, its fatal, okay? This -- this didnt have to happen!
King Yes, it did. He was killed.
Helo No, maam, he died. Okay? He died because he needed real medicine.
King He died because I made a mistake.
Helo Okay. Okay, good, yeah. And please, tell the others.
King I will. I will tell them not to trust him. They warned me about him, but I wouldnt listen. I didnt want my son to die. I took a chance. I went to Dr. Robert. I let the doctor give the medicine to Willie.
Helo Maam. You waited too long.
King Willie had been sick for less than 12 hours. He was 19. He is dead. That doctor killed my son.
Robert We lost another one last night.
Helo Yeah, Willie King.
Robert No, a three-year-old girl whose parents refused to let me treat her. Willie Kings mother lost Willie King. Its a shame, he was a goner. You saw him when he was in here. He was at least three days symptomatic.
Helo You explained this to the mother.
Robert Yes, of course I did. I mean, what the hell am I supposed to say to her? Sorry, maam, but if you wouldve just turned the corner a little sooner on your superstitious crap, we couldve saved your son? Get your shirt off, would you?
Helo Excuse me?
Robert Im gonna vaccinate you.
Helo But Im not sick. I thought we were rationing.
Robert You think Im gonna wait until youre on your back for a day? Who the hell else is gonna help me around here?
Helo Okay, okay.
Robert Okay. Oh, I talked to Tigh. He was asking about you. I told him you were doing a hell of a job. I wouldnt wish this place on anybody. Come on, you ready?
Helo Yeah.
Robert This might sting a bit. ...Youre done.
Apollo Come on. All right, hands of stone, let me see what you got.
Connor Put it in the hole, Marge.
Marge Wanna know my secret, Connor? I pretend this thing is your face.
Starbuck Hey, its Mellorak man. Everybody run.
Helo Relax, the doc dosed me.
Gaeta_smoking I hear its pretty rough down there, huh?
Helo only if youre a Sagittaron... Dying, you know, it just seems so senseless.
Chief Yeah, well, youll get no tears from me. Its bad enough my gangs gotta sweat through their stench. I have feeling one of these days were gonna wake up in the morning, Im gonna be really pissed cause were out of meds, cause those frakkoids saw the light and now we gotta share.
Apollo You gonna babble or shoot?
Chief_shoots_and_sits None of those religious freaks lifted a finger on New Caprica against the Cylons.
Apollo Hey, Chief, knock it off.
Chief Well, a lot of good Resistance people lost their lives...
Apollo -- Hey, I said knock it off. All right?
Chief Oh. Sorry, Dee!
Dualla Its all right. I have more of a reason to be mad at them then you do. I am Sagittaron. Most of them are paranoid, pigheaded, and argumentative.
Helo Yeah well, theyre sure making it miserable for Dr. Robert.
Dualla Medicines an abomination, its a sin against the Gods. Physicians are reading disease, because they refuse to acknowledge that the body...
Apollo_when_she_makes_the_shot --There you go!
Dualla ... And the mind are myths.
Apollo Well, this bodys no myth.
Dualla If I get sick, Im going to see Dr. Robert.
Apollo Youre not getting sick.
Dualla Anyone but Cottle. Nearsighted bastard ... may as well use a spike instead of a needle.
Sharon So theyre treating you well, then?
Caprica Yeah, well enough. Take a while to get to the point though, dont they?
Sharon Look, Six. I want to thank you for what you did. Im still not sure why you did it, though.
Chip_Gaius Exactly.
Chip_Gaius What are we doing here? How could you possibly throw yourself on the mercy of these people?
Sharon And d now youre here.
Caprica ...Yeah.
Sharon Your best chance of survival is to work with them. And that means to help them expose Baltar for his crimes.
Sharon Look, I gotta go. So Im gonna look into some clothes for you. Please take care of yourself.
Caprica Hey...
Caprica ... Thank you for the visit. To have some company... Thank you.
Sharon Yeah. I care about you.
Chip_Gaius Do you think any of them care about you?
Caprica I imagine they dont.
Chip_Gaius So what are you doing here again?
Caprica Im still trying to figure that out.
Chip_Gaius So youre here to save him, are you?
Caprica I told you I dont know.
Chip_Gaius You are here because you want to be human.
Chip_Gaius But theres a trick to being a human: you have to think only about yourself.
Roslin ...Okay. What do you think shes doing now?
Tory I dont know.
Roslin Like shes talking to something or someone. I dont know. Ive seen her do it before.
Buckminster Youre not gonna kill any more of us!
Marines Stay back!
Buckminster_and_others Get him! Thats him, hes the one! Dr. Robert, he murdered them! Hes trying to kill us!
Marines Get back! Stay back! Stay back!
Robert Get off of me!
Helo_running_in Stay back! Everybody back! Step away! Get off him now! Move back, move back! Back away now!
Buckminster He killed my father!
Robert I tried to help him, you ignorant fool!
Helo Okay, get behind me.
Helo So you immunized the old man, but he later died? Buckminster and his father are fundamentalists. What made them change their minds about getting immunized?
Robert Change their mind? Who said they changed their mind? I administered the bitamucin on my own.
Helo Without their consent?
Robert Look, it was the middle of the night. I was doing my rounds, and the old man was screaming in pain. I mean, what was I supposed to do?
Helo Okay, I dont understand. Arent we rationing? It was well after the 48 hours.
Robert Yeah, thats right, but its not exact. Everybodys different. ...Okay, he was marginal. Look, Im not gonna sit here and apologize to you for doing my job. I got two Picons down there that are starting to show symptoms. Now w Im gonna go treat them, if its alright with you.
Helo The doctors version of when he administered the drug greatly differed from that of Mrs. King.
Adama Who?
Helo The woman, King -- the one I told you about, Mrs. King. Her son started showing symptoms. She immediately took him to Robert for treatment. The boy still died. In the other case, Robert treated a Sagittaron without the mans consent.
Cottle Well, thats something we probably should have done to all of them in the first place, this disease wouldve been gone by now. The only reason we didnt is were trying respect the customs of the Sagittarons.
Helo But thats the point, he didnt respect them. Sir, people could be dying under Roberts care.
Cottle People die under my care every day, it goes with the damn job.
Helo Killing doesnt.
Tigh Killing? You are way out of line. Micah Robert deserves better than this.
Helo Even if Im wrong, even if he isnt treating some of these people unethically, Im concerned hes created a situation down there. Its bad.
Adama Captain. I have the former President of the Colonies sitting in a prison cell, and a Cylon woman is in custody, and a population that would love nothing more than to tear both of them apart. My ship is overcrowded, and I have an epidemic on my hands. Now the question is: are you capable of doing your job? And are you going to stop making these unfounded accusations? Are you?
Helo ...Yes, sir.
Adama Dismissed.
Tigh_following_him_out Agathon! Why dont you knock it off, Helo. Get your teeth out of the Docs ass. Its not doing you any good.
Helo With all due respect, sir, I think Micah Robert might be hurting people.
Tigh He is the only one whos had anything good to say about you in as long as I can remember. You may as well take whatever credibility you have left and chuck it out an airlock. You seriously want to stand up for these crazy frakkin people? What is it with you? You just like being on the outside looking in, do you?
Helo I dont quite know what you mean by that sir, unless youre referring to my wife. Again.
Tigh Mike Robert is a stand-up guy. A Caprican, one of our own. A man I can trust. on New Caprica, he worked with the Resistance. He patched up my eye. He fought the enemy. While you were snuggled up in bed with your Cylon wife every night --
Marine Colonel! You okay?
Tigh So you do give a frak what your friends think. Good for you! Thats how it should be. But you know what? I give a frak too. About friends, about loyalty. You keep soiling Mike Roberts good name, and we are gonna finish this. Hows that sound to you?
Tigh You better have the Doc take look at that hand, now.
Helo Sorry but youre going to have to wait ...
Helo Excuse me, excuse me. 15 minutes, people. Ill be back in 15 minutes. Im sorry.
Helo Excuse me, excuse me ... Sir, get your hand off me...
Helo Sharon!
Sharon Helo...
Helo Hey, whats going on?
Sharon Hows Hera?
Helo ... What do you mean, Hows Hera?
Sharon She got sick about an hour ago? They pulled me off CAP.
Helo What are you talking about? No one told me.
Sharon They sent her to Dr. Robert...
Helo Okay, you know what? I dont know if she needs this.
Sharon Helo, this is serious. She could die from this.
Robert_injecting_Hera All right, here we go, here we go.
Sharon All right, look at this. Look at this. Here, heres your toy. Good girl, thats a good girl.
Robert Now, these are a sedative in pill form. Just give her a half every six hours, just crush it up.
Sharon Okay.
Robert Okay?
Sharon And shell be okay, though?
Robert And shell be fine. You can take her home.
Sharon Thank you, Doctor.
Robert_chuckling Okay.
Sharon Bye-bye!
Robert All right, bye-bye.
Sharon Were going. Say Bye-bye!
Robert Bye-bye.
Robert Shell be fine. All right?
Helo Okay.
Robert Mm-hmm. Oh, um, listen. Would you give this to Mrs. King? This is ... belonged to her son, I know shed want it back. All right?
Helo_approaching_Mrs_King Hi... Dr. Robert gave me this to give to you.
King He gave you this. Huh.
King How is your daughter?
Helo Shes fine, thanks.
King Good.
Helo Mrs. King, please. I need to ask you something. If you thought Dr. Robert was dangerous, why let him treat your son? I mean, you said you were warned...
King I couldnt believe anyone could have that much hate inside of them.
Helo But you understand how some of this doesnt...
King -- I am through talking. Talking isnt going to bring Willie back. I think you should leave now.
Helo Mrs. King, I ...Im sorry.
Sharon You seem angry.
Helo Im not, Im just... Work.
Sharon Its okay that you hate your job. Its okay to admit it, too.
Helo Its not the job! I know the job sucks, I dont need to be reminded of it!
Sharon Okay. Then what is it?
Helo Look... Its what I see every day, okay? Its hard to not see it.
Sharon See what? Talk to me, Karl.
Helo I dont know, I ... I keep doing it. You know, I keep doing it, I keep ending up on the wrong side of everything. You know, maybe Tighs right. Maybe I want it that way. What if Im flying a desk not because Im good at it, not because Im right guy for the job, but because its the right punishment for the guy who crosses the line, and everybody knows it? Maybe I belong in Dogville.
Sharon_doing_laundry Youre saying ... Leave it.
Helo What does that mean, Just leave it?
Sharon It means its your job to manage these people, Helo, and youve just got to do it.
Helo Yeah, you know what? Youre right. Its me. Its all in my frakkin head.
Sharon I didnt say that ... Where are you going?
Helo I dont know.
Helo Doc?
Cottle_entering You ought to try a bed, Helo. Youll get more sleep that way.
Helo_standing Hes killing them. Its right here.
Cottle You get your righteous ass out of here right now, before I have the old man lock you up and throw away the key.
Helo No, listen to me! He killed them on New Caprica! Look. Guy goes in for a cough, he dies of heart failure. Here, see for yourself. This one, woman had simple appendicitis, she died on the operating table. Of the Picons he treated, 12% of them died, Capricans -- oh, he likes Capricans -- the mortality rate was 6%. Sagittarons? 90%. 90% of the Sagittarons died while in his care.
Cottle -- I am not going to listen to this, do you hear me? That man has his hands full down there!
Helo Hes singling out Sagittarons! That doesnt bother you?
Cottle What exactly...
Helo -- Doctor, that doesnt bother you?
Cottle What exactly is he doing?
Helo I dont know. Im not a doctor...
Cottle -- Well now, thats the first sensible thing youve said.
Helo Listen to me, I dont think hes giving them the medicine .. something, hes doing something.
Cottle My Gods, youre not going to let it go, are you?
Helo Please, can you do an autopsy on Mrs. Kings son, to see how he died? Ill let it go, I will, I promise, I will let it go. Just check.
Cottle I did. I checked Kings son. Mellorak sickness. He had bitamucin in his system. All right, now, thats it. Now, you just leave it! And get out of here!
Dualla Hey, Doc? I dont really feel so good. Think I could get some of that bitamucin?
Sharon_whispering Who is it?
Sharon Hey, Hera. Its okay.
Helo Mrs. King?
King Your friend, the soldier. Dualla. Shes sick. She went to the doctor. She went to the doctor to...
Helo -- Hold up, slow down, what...
King -- No, you listen to me. We lost two more tonight: Sagittarons, who let that murderer treat them. You have to do something.
Sharon Excuse me, what is she doing here?
Marines There she is!
Marine Maam, youre not supposed to be here. Let go now.
Marine Sorry, Captain. Frakkin refugees. I dont know how she snuck through. Morning, sir.
Sharon Dont. Dont even think it.
Helo Sharon, its Dualla. Dualla went down there.
Sharon She has a husband.
Helo Yeah, and hes out flying CAP.
Sharon Shell be fine. Shell take her meds, shell be fine. You know whats all over the ship? You and the Sagittarons. How you might actually be listening to them.
Helo Thats my job.
Sharon Theyre dying because theyre refusing medication, Karl.
Helo You want me to look the other way, is that it? Is that it? Our daughters fine, thats all that matters?
Sharon No!
Helo Or is it because as long as everyone hates the Sagittarons theyll forget youre a Cylon for five minutes?
Sharon_standing_up_so_fast You shut the frak up. Yeah, I want you to look the other way. I have to fight every single day on this ship to be accepted...
Helo This has nothing to do with you! Okay? You think thats who I am? Thats what Ive become, thats my defining characteristic? The guy married to a Cylon? This guys dirty. I think hes a liar, and I think hes killing people because hes a racist son of a bitch.
Helo Make a hole! Make a hole! Get out of the way! Get out of the way, get out of the way.
Helo Dee? Dee. Dualla?
Helo Dualla. No, no. No no no, no no, no! No!
Helo Dualla, hey! Oh, hey! What are you doing here?
Dualla Went to Dr. Robert ... He gave me something ... It kicked the frak out of me ...Wheres Lee?
Helo Were gonna go see him. Come on, come on. I gotta take you to Cottle.
Dualla No.
Helo Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on.
Dualla Hes got hands of stone...
Helo I know, I know, come on.
Robert_appearing Hey, hey, what the hell are you doing here?
Helo Shes coming with me.
Robert No, shes not. Shes in no condition to go anywhere.
Helo Im taking her to Cottle. Just to be sure.
Robert What do you mean just to be ... Hey, get the hell out of here!
Helo Get the frak out of my way, doctor! Now! Come on, Dee, come on.
Robert Security!
Robert Agathon. Hes lost, I dont ... Hes hurting one of my patients.
Helo You poisoned her! Im taking her to Cottle.
Robert Get the XO!
Dualla_drowsily No, leave me alone. Not Cottle. Please, just leave me alone.
Marine Captain, whats going on? Sir?
Dualla Leave me alone.
Marine Captain!
Dualla I want to sleep.
Helo No no no, Dee, we gotta go.
Marine Captain, she doesnt want to go! Sir, she says she doesnt want to go.
Helo Get your hand off of me, Sergeant!
Marine Stand down or well move, Agathon!
Helo You stand down! Get your gun out of my face, Sergeant!
Sergeant Cool it!
Robert I dont know what kind of a crusade youre on, or who youre trying to impress, but it seriously is not working.
Helo Youre killing them, Robert. I know youre doing it!
Tigh Stand down.
Robert Saul. You told me he was a flake, you didnt tell me he was dangerous!
Tigh -- Shut the frak up.: How is she?
Cottle Shes been sedated, but shes okay.
Robert Wait a minute -- You dont believe him, do you? Hes seriously delusional. Needs help.
Tigh Yeah, and we shouldve given it to him.
Helo Doc?
Cottle I didnt check Willies blood until a couple of hours ago. I was exhausted, and Ill admit the Sagittarons annoy the hell out of me, and I didnt want to go against my colleague ... But you were right about the records, Helo. There was no bitamucin in the King boys body.
Robert He died because it was too late...
Cottle No, he didnt. He died of acute cell destruction. He was injected with a toxic bisphosphonate.
Robert Now, obviously you got a wrong reading here. Now, I dont know what else these people--
Cottle -- No! The old man, Mr. Buckminster, died of the same thing. There was no bitamucin in his system.
Helo You killed him, you sick frak.
Robert You ought to be on your knees thanking me for saving your daughters life!
Robert For having the meds to cure her of her illness. Now, you know how painful this disease is at the end. And they dont want our help. Now, why waste time and meds and space on them, when all of those resources could go to those who really deserve it? Who gets the medication when theres not enough to go around -- the Sagittaron who wont even raise a finger to save his own race, or a Viper pilot?
Cottle What the hell happened to do no harm, Doctor?
Robert Look, I intervened because someone has to make the tough choices here. But it doesnt matter, it doesnt matter, because look at them! Theyre gonna destroy themselves anyway. Look at them, look at them. Theyre like worms crawling on a hot rock. Remember what you used to say, Saul? Aside from a Cylon, is there anything that you hate more than a Sagittaron?
Tigh Ill tell you what I hate, Mike: Being wrong. Captain Agathon.
Helo Sir?
Tigh Arrest this son of a bitch. Gag him if you have to.
Helo My pleasure, sir.
Robert_pointing_at_Dee I didnt harm her!
Helo Right, shes one of the good ones.
Helo Sir, you wanted to see me?
Adama Yes, Captain. Please, sit down. Theres hate, and theres allowing hate. Two sides of the same coin, really. Were guilty of both. Somewhere, we got lost. You being the lone voice in the wilderness, we were bound to stay that way for a while. This is my ship. And I owe you an apology.
Helo Thats not necessary, sir.
Adama All the same, you still have it. Thatll be all, Captain.
Helo Admiral. The infected Cylons? I did it. I reversed the air purification system and they, um ... suffocated.
Adama Are you sure you wanna have this conversation, Captain?
Helo Yes, sir.)
