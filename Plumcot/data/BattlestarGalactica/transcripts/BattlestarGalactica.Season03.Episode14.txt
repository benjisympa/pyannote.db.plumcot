captain_karl_agathon Previously, on
captain_karl_agathon We all made sacrifices.

lt_sharon_valerii Heras alive. Im her mother, and Im going to get her. Im begging you to do this.
president_laura_roslin Youve put the entire Fleet in jeopardy. Are you aware of that?
captain_karl_agathon Im not a traitor. I did what I thought was right. Shell get Hera.
number_six Lets go.
lt_sharon_valerii Whoa, whoa! Hold your fire!
colonel_saul_tigh Get out of the way. Throw that thing in the brig.
dr_gaius_baltar I demand my rights as a colonial citizen to legal representation and full due process.
president_laura_roslin Do you?
admiral_william_adama So what happens next?
president_laura_roslin We give him his trial.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Do they really think they can squeeze more civvies onto the starboard Hangar deck?
chief_galen_tyrol Thats why Helo was transferred down here -- to manage the civilian refugees.
lt_felix_gaeta Sir weve got the breakdown on the
colonel_saul_tigh Oh, boy...
admiral_william_adama Helo may be overmatched down there.
lt_sharon_valerii So a pretty rough night last night, huh?
lt_sharon_valerii Hey, I said you didnt sleep so well.
captain_karl_agathon Oh, stupid dream. Whatever.
lt_sharon_valerii So youre okay?
captain_karl_agathon Yeah.
lt_sharon_valerii Theyre about to increase the population down there by 300 and youre okay.
captain_karl_agathon Yeah. I dont know where Im gonna put them, but its not like Im walking around taking my own pulse. Im fine.
cpt_lee_adama Hey, there he is.
captain_kara_thrace If it isnt the Mayor of Dogville.
racetrack Hey, cut him some slack, guys.
captain_kara_thrace I hear you just got a new shipload of subjects.
racetrack Helo, come here. Come here. Listen, I need a favor. I have a date tonight with this ripped and ready nugget that I want to break in, you know, just right. Think you could wrangle me up one of those cute little sexy cubicles you got down there?
captain_karl_agathon Yeah, yeah.
cpt_lee_adama Well see you around, Helo.
captain_karl_agathon Yeah, you guys know where to find me.
lt_sharon_valerii Youre gonna check up on Hera, right?
captain_karl_agathon Yes, Im gonna check up on Hera.
lt_sharon_valerii Okay. I love you.
captain_karl_agathon I love you too.
captain_karl_agathon Welcome aboard. You need to keep moving. Well deal with your questions later. Come on, people, I need you to keep moving. Welcome aboard, but you need to keep moving. I know, I know. Well deal with your concerns. Keep moving, keep moving. Welcome aboard
mr_buckminster Where are you putting the Sagittarons?
captain_karl_agathon Living arrangements havent been made yet, sir, I need you to keep moving.
mr_buckminster We want to be with our own!
colonel_saul_tigh You heard the man. Move your ass. Move!
captain_karl_agathon Ive got this under control here, Colonel.
colonel_saul_tigh yeah, sure you do.
dr_michael_robert Excuse me, maam, could I have a brief look at your son?
mrs_king No no, no, no, were fine, were fine. We dont need a doctor.
dr_michael_robert I know, I know.
mrs_king Look, we dont need a doctor. Were Sagittaron. We dont believe in medicine.
officer_anastasia_dualla Its all right, maam, this is Dr. Robert. Hes our civilian doctor, he has nothing to do with the military. Well respect your traditions. You can trust me, Im Sagittaron. Its okay.
dr_michael_robert All right?
officer_anastasia_dualla Its okay.
dr_michael_robert You feel that? Would you open your mouth for me, please? Open wide. All right. Look at this. Okay, you feel anything? How about here?
mrs_king All right, thats enough.
willie_king Get your hands off me!
mrs_king Thats enough, thats enough. Thank you very much.
officer_anastasia_dualla Okay, settle down.
dr_michael_robert Sir --
mr_buckminster You just keep your hands to yourself.
dr_michael_robert Okay, yeah.
colonel_saul_tigh Mike, you brain-dead card cheat. You still owe me that drink.
dr_michael_robert Saul, get out of here. Now.
colonel_saul_tigh Well, youre in a good mood today.
captain_karl_agathon Hey, Doc, I dont know, but meme of these people they look, um...
dr_michael_robert Sick.
captain_karl_agathon Sick, yeah.
officer_anastasia_dualla Medic! Dr. Robert!
dr_michael_robert Leave, Saul.
colonel_saul_tigh Yeah
mrs_king No, you keep your hands off my son.
marine_allan_nowart Ive got him.
mrs_king No! No! Where are they taking him?
officer_anastasia_dualla Its all right, maam. Just walk this way.
colonel_saul_tigh So? What have we got here, Mike?
dr_michael_robert Mellorak sickness. It originates in the kidneys and then rapidly attacks the respiratory and the immune system.
dr_cottle Its a nasty bit of business. If you dont treat the first symptoms within 48 hours, itll kill you within three to five days.
admiral_william_adama How contagious is it?
dr_michael_robert Well, its not airborne, so we lucked out there. Its spread through human contact. Saliva, sexual intercourse, through the skin. Right now it seems confined to the Sagittarons.
colonel_saul_tigh Thats good; theyre welcome to it.
dr_michael_robert Its obviously spreading down there. Where we were working.
admiral_william_adama Its curable?
dr_cottle Absolutely, yes. A shot of bitamucin and youre right as rain in a day or two. And sedatives alleviate the symptoms. But I dont know how long our stock of bitamucin will hold out, so we should probably conserve it and only inoculate after the first symptoms show.
admiral_william_adama This is a civilian infection, Dr. Robert, so its in your hands. But I want Tyrol and the crew immunized before they get sick. I dont need any downtime.
dr_cottle If we disinfect everything and stress hygiene, some people wont get sick. And, uh, they wont need the medicine.
captain_karl_agathon Then shouldnt we get everyone to the showers? Especially the Sagittarons. We should make an announcement.
dr_michael_robert -- No, no, we dont want to single them out anymore than we already have to. Well have a riot on our hands. Now, if it were up to me, I would say just get the Sagittarons settled and then deal with the civvies that have already arrived.
dr_cottle Huh. Well, at least you wont have to worry about having enough medicine for the Sagittarons.
admiral_william_adama Yeah. Most of them are gonna refuse it. People are gonna die.
dr_cottle The last 3,000 years medicines been just the great curse.
colonel_saul_tigh Thats because theyre a bunch of stubborn, root-sucking jackasses holding onto traditions that are a thousand years old.
Man#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode14 Drink this.
dr_michael_robert Stink enough for you in here?
captain_karl_agathon Yeah, its a really potent smell.
dr_michael_robert Thats burdock root. Sagittarons use it as a calmative.
captain_karl_agathon Does it work?
dr_michael_robert Hell, I dont know. Theyre all gonna die anyway.
tom_zarek Tell me there wont be a trial.
president_laura_roslin Gaius Baltar will be tried for high crimes and treason. A tribunal of judges will hear the evidence against him, a verdict will be read, he will be found guilty. And he will be finally held responsible for his actions. If you can summon up a little patience, as I have done, we will get through this ordeal.
tom_zarek Listen to me, Baltar will get his trial. And this is what youll get. A hurricane. The media will descend on you and watch and scrutinize and question your every move. You will have sectarian violence. You will have assassination attempts. You will have civil unrest on a scale weve never seen. Work, labor, everyday routine in this Fleet will come to a complete halt. This trial is going to bring the entire Fleet down.
tory_foster Mr. Vice President, we have a security plan in order which includes rapid Marine deployment, increased CAP operations, security details...
tom_zarek -- A hurricane, Laura. If I were you, Id declare martial law during the trial. Youre gonna need a lot more than a little patience to survive. Im here if you need me.
tory_foster Your best friend, your worst enemy.
president_laura_roslin Ive never seen him like that. He was truly frightened.
Man#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode14 We are not sick. Sagges brought the sickness with them. Send then back.
captain_karl_agathon Okay, sir, where do you suggest that I send them?
Man#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode14 I dont know. Figure it out.
captain_karl_agathon Okay, your concerns have been noted. Were gonna do the best we can.
Man#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode14 Yeah, right.
captain_karl_agathon Yes. Can I help you?
mrs_king My son is dead.
captain_karl_agathon ...Im sorry. Thats a soma braid, right? You Sagittarons believe its supposed to bring good health? Look, Im sorry. Its not enough. If you dont treat the disease, its fatal, okay? This -- this didnt have to happen!
mrs_king Yes, it did. He was killed.
captain_karl_agathon No, maam, he died. Okay? He died because he needed real medicine.
mrs_king He died because I made a mistake.
captain_karl_agathon Okay. Okay, good, yeah. And please, tell the others.
mrs_king I will. I will tell them not to trust him. They warned me about him, but I wouldnt listen. I didnt want my son to die. I took a chance. I went to Dr. Robert. I let the doctor give the medicine to Willie.
captain_karl_agathon Maam. You waited too long.
mrs_king Willie had been sick for less than 12 hours. He was 19. He is dead. That doctor killed my son.
dr_michael_robert We lost another one last night.
captain_karl_agathon Yeah, Willie King.
dr_michael_robert No, a three-year-old girl whose parents refused to let me treat her. Willie Kings mother lost Willie King. Its a shame, he was a goner. You saw him when he was in here. He was at least three days symptomatic.
captain_karl_agathon You explained this to the mother.
dr_michael_robert Yes, of course I did. I mean, what the hell am I supposed to say to her? Sorry, maam, but if you wouldve just turned the corner a little sooner on your superstitious crap, we couldve saved your son? Get your shirt off, would you?
captain_karl_agathon Excuse me?
dr_michael_robert Im gonna vaccinate you.
captain_karl_agathon But Im not sick. I thought we were rationing.
dr_michael_robert You think Im gonna wait until youre on your back for a day? Who the hell else is gonna help me around here?
captain_karl_agathon Okay, okay.
dr_michael_robert Okay. Oh, I talked to Tigh. He was asking about you. I told him you were doing a hell of a job. I wouldnt wish this place on anybody. Come on, you ready?
captain_karl_agathon Yeah.
dr_michael_robert This might sting a bit. ...Youre done.
cpt_lee_adama Come on. All right, hands of stone, let me see what you got.
charlie_connor Put it in the hole, Marge.
Marge#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode14 Wanna know my secret, Connor? I pretend this thing is your face.
captain_kara_thrace Hey, its Mellorak man. Everybody run.
captain_karl_agathon Relax, the doc dosed me.
lt_felix_gaeta I hear its pretty rough down there, huh?
captain_karl_agathon only if youre a Sagittaron... Dying, you know, it just seems so senseless.
chief_galen_tyrol Yeah, well, youll get no tears from me. Its bad enough my gangs gotta sweat through their stench. I have feeling one of these days were gonna wake up in the morning, Im gonna be really pissed cause were out of meds, cause those frakkoids saw the light and now we gotta share.
cpt_lee_adama You gonna babble or shoot?
chief_galen_tyrol None of those religious freaks lifted a finger on New Caprica against the Cylons.
cpt_lee_adama Hey, Chief, knock it off.
chief_galen_tyrol Well, a lot of good Resistance people lost their lives...
cpt_lee_adama -- Hey, I said knock it off. All right?
chief_galen_tyrol Oh. Sorry, Dee!
officer_anastasia_dualla Its all right. I have more of a reason to be mad at them then you do. I am Sagittaron. Most of them are paranoid, pigheaded, and argumentative.
captain_karl_agathon Yeah well, theyre sure making it miserable for Dr. Robert.
officer_anastasia_dualla Medicines an abomination, its a sin against the Gods. Physicians are reading disease, because they refuse to acknowledge that the body...
cpt_lee_adama --There you go!
officer_anastasia_dualla ... And the mind are myths.
cpt_lee_adama Well, this bodys no myth.
officer_anastasia_dualla If I get sick, Im going to see Dr. Robert.
cpt_lee_adama Youre not getting sick.
officer_anastasia_dualla Anyone but Cottle. Nearsighted bastard ... may as well use a spike instead of a needle.
lt_sharon_valerii So theyre treating you well, then?
number_six Yeah, well enough. Take a while to get to the point though, dont they?
lt_sharon_valerii Look, Six. I want to thank you for what you did. Im still not sure why you did it, though.
Chip_Gaius#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode14 Exactly.
Chip_Gaius#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode14 What are we doing here? How could you possibly throw yourself on the mercy of these people?
lt_sharon_valerii And d now youre here.
number_six ...Yeah.
lt_sharon_valerii Your best chance of survival is to work with them. And that means to help them expose Baltar for his crimes.
lt_sharon_valerii Look, I gotta go. So Im gonna look into some clothes for you. Please take care of yourself.
number_six Hey...
number_six ... Thank you for the visit. To have some company... Thank you.
lt_sharon_valerii Yeah. I care about you.
Chip_Gaius#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode14 Do you think any of them care about you?
number_six I imagine they dont.
Chip_Gaius#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode14 So what are you doing here again?
number_six Im still trying to figure that out.
Chip_Gaius#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode14 So youre here to save him, are you?
number_six I told you I dont know.
Chip_Gaius#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode14 You are here because you want to be human.
Chip_Gaius#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode14 But theres a trick to being a human: you have to think only about yourself.
president_laura_roslin ...Okay. What do you think shes doing now?
tory_foster I dont know.
president_laura_roslin Like shes talking to something or someone. I dont know. Ive seen her do it before.
mr_buckminster Youre not gonna kill any more of us!
Marines#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode14 Stay back!
Buckminster_and_others#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode14 Get him! Thats him, hes the one! Dr. Robert, he murdered them! Hes trying to kill us!
Marines#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode14 Get back! Stay back! Stay back!
dr_michael_robert Get off of me!
captain_karl_agathon Stay back! Everybody back! Step away! Get off him now! Move back, move back! Back away now!
mr_buckminster He killed my father!
dr_michael_robert I tried to help him, you ignorant fool!
captain_karl_agathon Okay, get behind me.
captain_karl_agathon So you immunized the old man, but he later died? Buckminster and his father are fundamentalists. What made them change their minds about getting immunized?
dr_michael_robert Change their mind? Who said they changed their mind? I administered the bitamucin on my own.
captain_karl_agathon Without their consent?
dr_michael_robert Look, it was the middle of the night. I was doing my rounds, and the old man was screaming in pain. I mean, what was I supposed to do?
captain_karl_agathon Okay, I dont understand. Arent we rationing? It was well after the 48 hours.
dr_michael_robert Yeah, thats right, but its not exact. Everybodys different. ...Okay, he was marginal. Look, Im not gonna sit here and apologize to you for doing my job. I got two Picons down there that are starting to show symptoms. Now w Im gonna go treat them, if its alright with you.
captain_karl_agathon The doctors version of when he administered the drug greatly differed from that of Mrs. King.
admiral_william_adama Who?
captain_karl_agathon The woman, King -- the one I told you about, Mrs. King. Her son started showing symptoms. She immediately took him to Robert for treatment. The boy still died. In the other case, Robert treated a Sagittaron without the mans consent.
dr_cottle Well, thats something we probably should have done to all of them in the first place, this disease wouldve been gone by now. The only reason we didnt is were trying respect the customs of the Sagittarons.
captain_karl_agathon But thats the point, he didnt respect them. Sir, people could be dying under Roberts care.
dr_cottle People die under my care every day, it goes with the damn job.
captain_karl_agathon Killing doesnt.
colonel_saul_tigh Killing? You are way out of line. Micah Robert deserves better than this.
captain_karl_agathon Even if Im wrong, even if he isnt treating some of these people unethically, Im concerned hes created a situation down there. Its bad.
admiral_william_adama Captain. I have the former President of the Colonies sitting in a prison cell, and a Cylon woman is in custody, and a population that would love nothing more than to tear both of them apart. My ship is overcrowded, and I have an epidemic on my hands. Now the question is: are you capable of doing your job? And are you going to stop making these unfounded accusations? Are you?
captain_karl_agathon ...Yes, sir.
admiral_william_adama Dismissed.
colonel_saul_tigh Agathon! Why dont you knock it off, Helo. Get your teeth out of the Docs ass. Its not doing you any good.
captain_karl_agathon With all due respect, sir, I think Micah Robert might be hurting people.
colonel_saul_tigh He is the only one whos had anything good to say about you in as long as I can remember. You may as well take whatever credibility you have left and chuck it out an airlock. You seriously want to stand up for these crazy frakkin people? What is it with you? You just like being on the outside looking in, do you?
captain_karl_agathon I dont quite know what you mean by that sir, unless youre referring to my wife. Again.
colonel_saul_tigh Mike Robert is a stand-up guy. A Caprican, one of our own. A man I can trust. on New Caprica, he worked with the Resistance. He patched up my eye. He fought the enemy. While you were snuggled up in bed with your Cylon wife every night --
marine_allan_nowart Colonel! You okay?
colonel_saul_tigh So you do give a frak what your friends think. Good for you! Thats how it should be. But you know what? I give a frak too. About friends, about loyalty. You keep soiling Mike Roberts good name, and we are gonna finish this. Hows that sound to you?
colonel_saul_tigh You better have the Doc take look at that hand, now.
captain_karl_agathon Sorry but youre going to have to wait ...
captain_karl_agathon Excuse me, excuse me. 15 minutes, people. Ill be back in 15 minutes. Im sorry.
captain_karl_agathon Excuse me, excuse me ... Sir, get your hand off me...
captain_karl_agathon Sharon!
lt_sharon_valerii Helo...
captain_karl_agathon Hey, whats going on?
lt_sharon_valerii Hows Hera?
captain_karl_agathon ... What do you mean, Hows Hera?
lt_sharon_valerii She got sick about an hour ago? They pulled me off CAP.
captain_karl_agathon What are you talking about? No one told me.
lt_sharon_valerii They sent her to Dr. Robert...
captain_karl_agathon Okay, you know what? I dont know if she needs this.
lt_sharon_valerii Helo, this is serious. She could die from this.
dr_michael_robert All right, here we go, here we go.
lt_sharon_valerii All right, look at this. Look at this. Here, heres your toy. Good girl, thats a good girl.
dr_michael_robert Now, these are a sedative in pill form. Just give her a half every six hours, just crush it up.
lt_sharon_valerii Okay.
dr_michael_robert Okay?
lt_sharon_valerii And shell be okay, though?
dr_michael_robert And shell be fine. You can take her home.
lt_sharon_valerii Thank you, Doctor.
dr_michael_robert Okay.
lt_sharon_valerii Bye-bye!
dr_michael_robert All right, bye-bye.
lt_sharon_valerii Were going. Say Bye-bye!
dr_michael_robert Bye-bye.
dr_michael_robert Shell be fine. All right?
captain_karl_agathon Okay.
dr_michael_robert Mm-hmm. Oh, um, listen. Would you give this to Mrs. King? This is ... belonged to her son, I know shed want it back. All right?
captain_karl_agathon Hi... Dr. Robert gave me this to give to you.
mrs_king He gave you this. Huh.
mrs_king How is your daughter?
captain_karl_agathon Shes fine, thanks.
mrs_king Good.
captain_karl_agathon Mrs. King, please. I need to ask you something. If you thought Dr. Robert was dangerous, why let him treat your son? I mean, you said you were warned...
mrs_king I couldnt believe anyone could have that much hate inside of them.
captain_karl_agathon But you understand how some of this doesnt...
mrs_king -- I am through talking. Talking isnt going to bring Willie back. I think you should leave now.
captain_karl_agathon Mrs. King, I ...Im sorry.
lt_sharon_valerii You seem angry.
captain_karl_agathon Im not, Im just... Work.
lt_sharon_valerii Its okay that you hate your job. Its okay to admit it, too.
captain_karl_agathon Its not the job! I know the job sucks, I dont need to be reminded of it!
lt_sharon_valerii Okay. Then what is it?
captain_karl_agathon Look... Its what I see every day, okay? Its hard to not see it.
lt_sharon_valerii See what? Talk to me, Karl.
captain_karl_agathon I dont know, I ... I keep doing it. You know, I keep doing it, I keep ending up on the wrong side of everything. You know, maybe Tighs right. Maybe I want it that way. What if Im flying a desk not because Im good at it, not because Im right guy for the job, but because its the right punishment for the guy who crosses the line, and everybody knows it? Maybe I belong in Dogville.
lt_sharon_valerii Youre saying ... Leave it.
captain_karl_agathon What does that mean, Just leave it?
lt_sharon_valerii It means its your job to manage these people, Helo, and youve just got to do it.
captain_karl_agathon Yeah, you know what? Youre right. Its me. Its all in my frakkin head.
lt_sharon_valerii I didnt say that ... Where are you going?
captain_karl_agathon I dont know.
captain_karl_agathon Doc?
dr_cottle You ought to try a bed, Helo. Youll get more sleep that way.
captain_karl_agathon Hes killing them. Its right here.
dr_cottle You get your righteous ass out of here right now, before I have the old man lock you up and throw away the key.
captain_karl_agathon No, listen to me! He killed them on New Caprica! Look. Guy goes in for a cough, he dies of heart failure. Here, see for yourself. This one, woman had simple appendicitis, she died on the operating table. Of the Picons he treated, 12% of them died, Capricans -- oh, he likes Capricans -- the mortality rate was 6%. Sagittarons? 90%. 90% of the Sagittarons died while in his care.
dr_cottle -- I am not going to listen to this, do you hear me? That man has his hands full down there!
captain_karl_agathon Hes singling out Sagittarons! That doesnt bother you?
dr_cottle What exactly...
captain_karl_agathon -- Doctor, that doesnt bother you?
dr_cottle What exactly is he doing?
captain_karl_agathon I dont know. Im not a doctor...
dr_cottle -- Well now, thats the first sensible thing youve said.
captain_karl_agathon Listen to me, I dont think hes giving them the medicine .. something, hes doing something.
dr_cottle My Gods, youre not going to let it go, are you?
captain_karl_agathon Please, can you do an autopsy on Mrs. Kings son, to see how he died? Ill let it go, I will, I promise, I will let it go. Just check.
dr_cottle I did. I checked Kings son. Mellorak sickness. He had bitamucin in his system. All right, now, thats it. Now, you just leave it! And get out of here!
officer_anastasia_dualla Hey, Doc? I dont really feel so good. Think I could get some of that bitamucin?
lt_sharon_valerii Who is it?
lt_sharon_valerii Hey, Hera. Its okay.
captain_karl_agathon Mrs. King?
mrs_king Your friend, the soldier. Dualla. Shes sick. She went to the doctor. She went to the doctor to...
captain_karl_agathon -- Hold up, slow down, what...
mrs_king -- No, you listen to me. We lost two more tonight: Sagittarons, who let that murderer treat them. You have to do something.
lt_sharon_valerii Excuse me, what is she doing here?
Marines#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode14 There she is!
marine_allan_nowart Maam, youre not supposed to be here. Let go now.
marine_allan_nowart Sorry, Captain. Frakkin refugees. I dont know how she snuck through. Morning, sir.
lt_sharon_valerii Dont. Dont even think it.
captain_karl_agathon Sharon, its Dualla. Dualla went down there.
lt_sharon_valerii She has a husband.
captain_karl_agathon Yeah, and hes out flying CAP.
lt_sharon_valerii Shell be fine. Shell take her meds, shell be fine. You know whats all over the ship? You and the Sagittarons. How you might actually be listening to them.
captain_karl_agathon Thats my job.
lt_sharon_valerii Theyre dying because theyre refusing medication, Karl.
captain_karl_agathon You want me to look the other way, is that it? Is that it? Our daughters fine, thats all that matters?
lt_sharon_valerii No!
captain_karl_agathon Or is it because as long as everyone hates the Sagittarons theyll forget youre a Cylon for five minutes?
lt_sharon_valerii You shut the frak up. Yeah, I want you to look the other way. I have to fight every single day on this ship to be accepted...
captain_karl_agathon This has nothing to do with you! Okay? You think thats who I am? Thats what Ive become, thats my defining characteristic? The guy married to a Cylon? This guys dirty. I think hes a liar, and I think hes killing people because hes a racist son of a bitch.
captain_karl_agathon Make a hole! Make a hole! Get out of the way! Get out of the way, get out of the way.
captain_karl_agathon Dee? Dee. Dualla?
captain_karl_agathon Dualla. No, no. No no no, no no, no! No!

captain_karl_agathon You stand down! Get your gun out of my face, Sergeant!
Sergeant#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode14 Cool it!
dr_michael_robert I dont know what kind of a crusade youre on, or who youre trying to impress, but it seriously is not working.
captain_karl_agathon Youre killing them, Robert. I know youre doing it!
colonel_saul_tigh Stand down.
dr_michael_robert Saul. You told me he was a flake, you didnt tell me he was dangerous!
colonel_saul_tigh -- Shut the frak up.: How is she?
dr_cottle Shes been sedated, but shes okay.
dr_michael_robert Wait a minute -- You dont believe him, do you? Hes seriously delusional. Needs help.
colonel_saul_tigh Yeah, and we shouldve given it to him.
captain_karl_agathon Doc?
dr_cottle I didnt check Willies blood until a couple of hours ago. I was exhausted, and Ill admit the Sagittarons annoy the hell out of me, and I didnt want to go against my colleague ... But you were right about the records, Helo. There was no bitamucin in the King boys body.
dr_michael_robert He died because it was too late...
dr_cottle No, he didnt. He died of acute cell destruction. He was injected with a toxic bisphosphonate.
dr_michael_robert Now, obviously you got a wrong reading here. Now, I dont know what else these people--
dr_cottle -- No! The old man, Mr. Buckminster, died of the same thing. There was no bitamucin in his system.
captain_karl_agathon You killed him, you sick frak.
dr_michael_robert You ought to be on your knees thanking me for saving your daughters life!
dr_michael_robert For having the meds to cure her of her illness. Now, you know how painful this disease is at the end. And they dont want our help. Now, why waste time and meds and space on them, when all of those resources could go to those who really deserve it? Who gets the medication when theres not enough to go around -- the Sagittaron who wont even raise a finger to save his own race, or a Viper pilot?
dr_cottle What the hell happened to do no harm, Doctor?
dr_michael_robert Look, I intervened because someone has to make the tough choices here. But it doesnt matter, it doesnt matter, because look at them! Theyre gonna destroy themselves anyway. Look at them, look at them. Theyre like worms crawling on a hot rock. Remember what you used to say, Saul? Aside from a Cylon, is there anything that you hate more than a Sagittaron?
colonel_saul_tigh Ill tell you what I hate, Mike: Being wrong. Captain Agathon.
captain_karl_agathon Sir?
colonel_saul_tigh Arrest this son of a bitch. Gag him if you have to.
captain_karl_agathon My pleasure, sir.
dr_michael_robert I didnt harm her!
captain_karl_agathon Right, shes one of the good ones.
captain_karl_agathon Sir, you wanted to see me?
admiral_william_adama Yes, Captain. Please, sit down. Theres hate, and theres allowing hate. Two sides of the same coin, really. Were guilty of both. Somewhere, we got lost. You being the lone voice in the wilderness, we were bound to stay that way for a while. This is my ship. And I owe you an apology.
captain_karl_agathon Thats not necessary, sir.
admiral_william_adama All the same, you still have it. Thatll be all, Captain.
captain_karl_agathon Admiral. The infected Cylons? I did it. I reversed the air purification system and they, um ... suffocated.
admiral_william_adama Are you sure you wanna have this conversation, Captain?
captain_karl_agathon Yes, sir.)
