Adama Previously on
Adama Congratulations on making Captain. Sorry I wasnt there.
Apollo Thank you, sir. Hows my mother?
Adama Getting married.
Roslin In the mountains north of here theres this little stream. The water is so clear, its like looking through glass. I am thinking of building a cabin.
Lee You and Cally have a fight?
Chief you didnt hear us? I figured we should have sold tickets.
Adama Its not too late for Baltar to just disappear.
Roslin We cant do that. For all his crimes, hes one of us.
Adama So what happens next?
Roslin We give him his trial.
Intercom Colonel Tigh to see you, Admiral.
Adama Enter.
Adama Youre up early.
Tigh Couldnt sleep, thought Id make myself useful. Happy anniversary, Bill.
Cally Hey, its okay. Its okay.
Chief I dont know where, just double-check it for me.
Cally Daddys getting good at this.
Chief Daddys tired of burning his wrists. Im gonna get ready. We got morning watch.
Cally I thought we were spending the day with Nicky.
Chief Yeah, so did I, until Laskin and Perry called in sick.
Cally Its okay. Shh, shh. So you volunteered in their place? We barely get a moment off as it is.
Chief Cally, you know the deck is short-handed.
Cally The deck has been short-handed since we got here. All I know is the frakking daycare workers see more of Nick than we do.
Chief Yeah well until the daycare workers figure out how to strip a Viper, this is the way its gonna be. Hey, buddy, come here. Oh, oh, oh, I know. I know, I know. You just laid down too, didnt you? Come here, I got you. There you go. Ill take him to daycare.
Cally_grabbing_diaper_bag Hey! forgetting something?
Adama Whats on the duty schedule?
Tigh Nothing sexy. A CO2 scrubbers out near sickbay. Broken water line in the galley. Oh, now that most of our Vipers are out of dry-dock Chiefs gonna have us look at the servos in airlock 12.
Tigh_offering_something_for_Adama_to_sign Would you please...
Adama Is that it?
Tigh_sighing The Fleets quiet. You could use some time for yourself. I can handle first watch.
Adama Ill be keeping my schedule. This is just another day.
Carolanne_voiceover Just another day? Maybe I should have married him instead of you.
Adama_voiceover I could have sold tickets to that.
Carolanne We had some good times. But more bad. But you keep bringing me back anyway, just this one day, year after year. only thing I cant understand is... Why?
Adama Neither do I.
Jaffee Excuse me, sir.
Adama Put it on the table, Private...?
Jaffee Jaffee, sir.
Jaffee Will there be anything else, Admiral?
Adama Thatll be all, Jaffee.
Carolanne_voiceover Its going to be a long day.
Adama_voiceover It always is.
Seelix Morning, Chief.
Cally Is Nicky okay?
Chief Yeah, hes fine. First time he didnt cry when I dropped him off at daycare. So, Figurski, you gonna at least pretend to do something today?
Figurski Frakking scrubber. It takes Adama two seconds to sign off on an order thats gonna take us all day to finish.
Chief Well, take you all day anyhow. Seelix, Cally, youre with me. Airlock 12.
Cally Seelix, can you get the door?
Seelix Yeah.
Cally This place is a frakking mess!
Chief Yeah, the Cylons blew the hell out of it. Nobodys been down here since damage control plugged the holes. Seelix, can you hear me in there?
Seelix Yeah.
Chief You want to see if I can find the electrical diagrams for the airlock?
Seelix You bet. Ew, I did find somebodys year-old lunch.
Cally He didnt even cry?
Chief Cal, I told you. Nicky is fine.
Cally Yeah, and anybody could have dragged a toolbag down here. It didnt have to be me.
Chief Yeah, well, it had to be somebody. You know these gearing systems better than anybody. What do you want me to do, give you special treatment because youre my wife? How would that look?
Cally I dont care!
Cally We keep trying to pretend like nothings changed, that our lives are exactly like they were before we went to New Caprica. But it is different. Were married, we have a son.
Chief Yeah, its just a little rough patch.
Cally What if rough patches are all we have left? We said we were gonna raise Nicky ourselves, remember?
Chief Yeah, well. We swore a lot of things. The Cylons didnt exactly cooperate, did they? You want to give me those wire cutters?
Cally What the hell?
Chief Oh, for fraks sake. Seelix, what are you doing? Open the door.
Seelix I didnt do anything. Chief, Im picking up a pressure differential in there. I mean, its nothing drastic, but you guys are definitely losing air.
Chief Well, it doesnt take much. once the airflow sensors detect a big enough leak, all the doors are designed to drop automatically. Its just a safety precaution.
Cally I feel safer already.
Seelix_voiceover Wait a second, are you saying that the hulls been breached?
Chief Well, breached is a bit dramatic, but the airs going somewhere. one of these patches must have cracked when we came in. As soon as we plug it and restore the pressure, the door should open.
Cally Then we can pull the work orders on whoever made these frakking walls and kick their asses.
Chief Yeah, well, the most important thing is to keep breathing. So lets just find the leak. This is it over here, this one.
Adama Leeson takes first watch. Leeson takes first watch. Kinsey checks the roster. Kinsey checks the roster. Jaffee brings me coffee. Jaffee brings me coffee.
Carolanne Are you still doing that? The memory exercises? Do you really think they expect you to know all of their names?
Adama You never change, do you?
Carolanne_chuckling one of the joys of being long dead. I suppose. Now hurry, youre going to be late meeting Laura. Maybe shes got a thing for bad boys. She wouldnt be the first.
Adama Shes the President of the Twelve Colonies.
Carolanne Oh, Im sorry. Im sorry, of course. Since youve created one godlike facade for yourself, why not invent another one for her?
Carolanne_voiceover Its another excuse to keep your distance.
Roslin Admiral.
Adama Madame President.
Roslin How are you?
Adama Very good.
Roslin Im sorry, Im sure this all could have been done over the wireless, but very frankly, I was going a little stir-crazy on
Adama Deep space pilots call it OBE.
Roslin Whats OBE?
Adama Overcome By Events.
Roslin Well, you may not feel that way after you finish this. Tory actually drew up an agenda.
Adama Baltar again. Hmm. Cant we just give him back to the Cylons?
Roslin Oh, you know how much I love that idea. Unfortunately, given what little I was able to glean from the Caprica Six, I dont think the Cylons would take him back. So were stuck.
Adama Fine. Then try the son of a bitch and be done with it.
Roslin We have give him a trial, but under what law? Caprican? Picon? Tauron? Do we give him a jury trial, do we set up a tribunal? We dont even have anything closely resembling a comprehensive law library, and this Fleet is not exact brimming with legal talent.
Adama You bring lawyers into this, theyre gonna drag you around for months.
Roslin Wasnt your father an attorney, on Caprica?
Adama Yes. And I told you that I didnt get along with him very well.
Roslin Oh, right. Okay, I need to set up an organizing committee, though frankly, trying to get a room full of legal scholars to stay on task is like herding cats. And so I need to set up a chairman of this committee, somebody who can make a hard decision and who wont get seduced and bogged down by all the legalese.
Adama Do you have a candidate?
Roslin As a matter fact I do. I was thinking Lee... Like grandfather, like grandson, perhaps. What do you think?
Adama Im not gonna say hes incapable of handling it, but hes never shown any type of interest in law.
Roslin I know, but heres the thing. We need the lawyers to parse the law, but we really need people who actually know the difference between right and wrong. Thats Lee.
Adama Ill talk to him.
Roslin Good. Admiral, I was wondering if youd mind if I stayed on your ship for the rest of the day.
Adama Please. By all means.
Roslin This is very difficult for me to say, but Im going to go to the gym.
Adama Prepare yourself. on its best day it smells like the inside of a shoe.
Chief See if theres another patch in there. I want to double up on this one, make sure it holds. Come on, Cal, fasters better. The sooner we do this, the sooner we get out.
Cally I heard you the first time.
Randoms Sir. Sir. Admiral.
Carolanne_voiceover Youre getting better at ignoring all of that. That sudden hush, those sidelong glances. That really used to get to you.
Adama I dont ever recall being able to intimidate you.
Carolanne Thats right. But I knew you long before you were the Admiral. Back when you were just Bill, the husband who wasnt there. The father who left. Just Bill. Who is Bill Adama anyway? Still a good question.
Carolanne_voiceover I wonder if Ill get an answer.
Narcho 49 days without a sighting. Maybe we finally scared the toasters off.
Starbuck Oh yeah, Nacho, your crap flyings putting the fear of the Gods in them.
Helo Whats up, buddy?
Helo Whats the matter with you?
Hotdog Sorry. Ive got the weirdest rash...
Helo_moving_over_away_from_him Really? Hope she was worth it, buddy.
Apollo_entering Ten-hut! ...At ease. Before we get started, I want a show of hands. How many of you boneheads know how to count? Because I keep hearing numbers being thrown around the hangar deck. 47, and then 48. Now 49 days since our last enemy contact. Now, I realize that any higher maths probably beyond most of you, so Im gonna make this real simple for you. one is the only number you need to remember. Because all it takes is one pilot to let his guard down, one ECO to miss a dradis contact, and suddenly the Cylons are on top of us. Thats when people die.
Adama_voiceover Hes like both of us.
Adama Proud, stubborn, and angry. But hes coming into his own. Especially in the last few months.
Carolanne Dont tell me. Tell him!
Adama He knows.
Carolanne Knows what? That the Admirals going to give him a good performance review? Or that his father loves him? Dont tell me the Admirals facade extends to Lee too.
Apollo Formation flying. Deflection shooting. Tactics. Doing touch and goes until every last one of you hits an okay three. Red and blue sections will go first, yellow and green will follow. Skids up in ten minutes. Dismissed.
Apollo Starbuck, if youve got a problem, I dont want to hear about it.
Starbuck_proudly Mm. My only problem is that you didnt preach that sermon a week ago. You might want to find some new material though -- the old mans been using that one fatal mistake line since we got here.
Apollo Well, if youre gonna steal, steal from the best.
Starbuck_leaving Sir.
Adama Pretty tough on them today.
Apollo Well, a kick in the butt is worth a thousand words. Gods know you kicked mine enough. Everything okay?
Adama Yeah, its been one of those mornings. President wants to take the fast track on Baltars trial. Shes looking for someone to take charge of the preliminaries, help cobble together the legal framework. She wants me to assign you.
Apollo Youre kidding.
Adama Interested?
Apollo Uh, more surprised. Did she say why she asked for me?
Adama Well, shes gonna need someone she can trust, you definitely fit that. I remember when you were younger, youd go visit your grandfathers house, and you were fascinated with his papers and his law books.
Apollo And there was me thinking I was being sly, sneaking off into his office all by myself. Yeah, I guess its a pipe dream now, but for five minutes there I really did consider lawyer as one of a dozen careers that I could go into, before I joined the service.
Adama Hmm. I never knew that.
Apollo Well, it was probably during one of my, um, angry at dad phases. Anyway, its impossible.
Apollo Even if I wanted to help out, theres no way. The CAGs duty is already 24/7, even on a light week.
Adama Yeah, I assumed that.
Narcho Major, were ready for you.
Apollo Excuse me...
Chief Okay, well, ones gonna have to do. Seelix, check the pressure. If that patch holds, were gonna equalize in a few minutes. This doors gonna open.
Seelix_voiceover Okay.
Cally Oh, for fraks sakes.
Chief Gods.
Adama How they doing?
Apollo Still alive.
Public_Address This is a Condition Three alert. Hull breach on Deck 14.
Adama Chief!
Chief Admiral. I seem to have turned this into a full-blown fubar. Youd be doing us a hell of a favor getting those doors open.
Adama We gotta get them out of there.
Chief Keep moving. Keep moving.
Apollo The airlocks designed to lock down if the pressure increases unexpectedly, so as soon as the patch...
Adama -- I know the system. We have redundancies. We have...
Apollo The manual override is down, theres no way of getting those inner doors to open. The thing mustve taken heavy damage on the way out of New Caprica.
Tigh Whole ships take a pounding. We need six weeks in dry-dock just to hammer out the dings, let alone tackle the structural damage.
Adama How much time do they have?
Apollo With a leak that size, theyll be out of air in half an hour, maybe less. Those are blast doors. It would take at least an hour to cut through them.
Tigh Why dont we put explosives in the observation booth? Blow the glass, pull them out.
Apollo No, the glass is strong enough to withstand a tylium explosion. Anything strong enough to take out the glass will take out Tyrol and Cally at the same time.
Adama I need a rescue plan. Not excuses.
Apollo Seven seconds.
Starbuck Then another ten to re-pressurize since well doing this in open space. Thats pushing it.
Sharon All right, this might be a stupid question, but has anyone ever tried a rescue like this before?
Starbuck No ones ever been crazy enough.
Apollo Doesnt matter, were out of time. Prep for launch. Weve only got 18 minutes left.
Sharon All right, lets go, were on.
Cally_gesturing_Chief_to_the_window Galen.
Adama Airlocks still jammed, Chief. Overrides are not responding.
Chief Guys, were kind of running out of options.
Adama Im going to take you out through the front door.
Chief Youll put a ship out there and rig up some kind of docking collar?
Adama Youll be out of air in a few minutes. Theres no time for a collar.
Cally Sir, if youre talking about an EVA, we dont have pressure suits.
Adama We dont have a choice.
Adama Athenas gonna position her Raptor in front of the airlock, hatch open. Were gonna blow the bolts right off of that door, and when it opens, youre gonna have to jump for it. Now, listen to me, both of you. You can do this. People have been able to live up to a minute in exposure to vacuum without a suit.
Chief Admiral, I dont know.
Adama Well talk later. Get ready.
Operator Athena, Galactica. You have priority clearance. All other traffic is being waved away.
Cally Wait. What about Nicky?
Chief_flagging Admirals right, we have to prep. Gotta move everything away from here to the door.
Cally Galen... we both know what happens to kids in the Fleet when their parents arent there for them.
Chief Apollo and Dee. Theyd take care of him.
Cally No. No pilots. Hes not going through this twice. Sir? Theres a civilian family, the mothers name is Susan Deckler. She has a little girl. If anything happens to us...
Adama_voiceover Ill see to it.
Chief I was being selfish. I wanted you with me, like old times. I didnt think about Nick. Im sorry.
Cally Hey. Hey. Admirals gonna get us out of here, okay? Were gonna take care of Nicky.
Tigh More than a few seconds out there, were talking severe exposure. Decompression sickness. At the very least, hypothermia. They could freeze to death.
Adama Make sure Cottles got his hyperbaric chamber ready.
Cally Im sorry.
Apollo Galactica, Apollo. Bringing raptor into position at Airlock 12.
Chief Put your mask on.
Apollo All right, listen up. We dont have time to hang back until the airlock doors blow, so were liable to experience some turbulence from the residual oxygen, maybe even some shrapnel hits. Athena, youre gonna have to be ready to compensate.
Athena Im on it, Major. Well hold position until Chief and Cally are secured.
Starbuck Lets just get this done.
Apollo Galactica, Apollo. Raptor door is open, were standing by ready to execute.
Adama Chief, Cally, Raptors in position. We gotta go now. Get ready to blow the hatch on my mark.
Chief Okay. No matter what, you hang onto me. Dont let go.
Adama Three! Two! one. Do it.
Apollo Whoa, watch out! Bank right, bank right!
Sharon Im in position!
Apollo Pull up your nose! Pull up!
Sharon Got it!
Apollo Hold it right there!
Apollo Galactica, Apollo. Raptor secured and pressurized. Theyre in rough shape, we gotta get em to sickbay right away.
Adama Come in. So any word on Chief and Cally?
Apollo Theyre alive. But Doc Cottles still evaluating their condition. So are you gonna tell me whats going on with you?
Adama_showing_the_picture Its this day.
Apollo My Gods, your wedding anniversary. I had ... totally forgotten.
Adama Probably seems foolish. Especially the way that it all ended up, but... Still. It still means something to me. Weve never talked about it. The divorce. Your mother... It was a bad time for all of us. Your mother gave you and your brother a home. Stability.
Apollo Dad, I know you want to believe that, but um... You know what? Forget it. It was a long time ago.
Adama You have something to say son, just say it.
Apollo Well Dad, we had four walls. But stability? My Gods, you knew what mom was like. I mean, the mood swings? Its why you left her.
Adama We had problems, but she cared deeply for you and your brother.
Apollo Well, then things changed after you left. I mean, there were times when she lost control.
Carolanne Dont listen to him, Bill.
Apollo And she would try and apologize She would promise she would make things better. But then she would just start drinking, and then all of her good intentions would just go out the frakkin...
Adama Is it true?
Carolanne I cant believe youd even ask me that.
Adama Damn it, is it true?
Apollo And then one day, finally the apologies even stopped.
Adama Thats enough.
Carolanne You walked out on me! You walked on me! The brilliant Commander! Who could lead all of his men into combat, but he couldnt find a way to live with his own family! Never lived anywhere for more than six months. Just following you around from one base to another. Waiting for you to come home. But you werent here for any of us! Whatever was easiest for the great Adama!
Adama They needed you. They were our children
Carolanne They needed a father. All through your glorious career, you have prided yourself on being a leader of men, judging people. Always making the hard call. But when it came to the biggest decision of your life. Oh, Bill, you blew it. We were wrong for each other from ? but you just couldnt accept that. Thats it. Thats why you keep calling me back. Because if you had made that mistake, it would just call into question all of your other decisions.
Adama She was still your mother, Lee. I loved her.
Apollo I believe you. I just dont think she ever loved you.
Random Hes right here...
Seelix Hey, I dropped by daycare. Somebody wanted to see you. Whos that?
Chief Hey, little man.
Seelix Hows she doing?
Chief Doc Cottle says shes gonna be okay, but its gonna be a while before shes 100%.
Seelix_helping_him_stand Careful. ...Yeah?
Chief Yeah, Im fine. Oh, I know. Come here. ! I got you buddy. you want to go see mommy? Go see mommy. Hey, yeah. Lets go see mommy. Come on. Shes over here, yeah. Heh!
Chief Cal. Cal, sweetie. Look whos here. Look whos here.
Adama_entering Seelix.
Chief No matter what, I dont know how, we will manage, find a balance. You and me. We will take care of Nick, okay. I love you.
Chief Oh, look. Theres mommys hand. There. There.
Apollo Hey.
Dualla_waking Hey. How are you?
Apollo Good. So whats this?
Dualla Oh, it was here when I got in. Its from your father.
Apollo Is it ticking?
Dualla Heh. He left you a note.
Apollo Caprican criminal codes. These are my grandfathers law books.
Dualla Your dad mustve had these in storage all this time. Whys he giving them to you now?
Roslin Im glad you stopped by. I have something for you. This was given to me by one of the colonists down on New Caprica. And I forgot about it, but Tory found it in a pile old clothes.
Roslin Dont let the title fool you. Its a pretty good mystery. I think youll like it. And its not a loan, its a gift.
Adama You u ever think about the times much on New Caprica?
Roslin I try to think about the good times, yes I do.
Adama one particular stands out in my mind. You were wearing your really bright red dress. Said you wanted to build a cabin.
Roslin It was Baltars Groundbreaking ceremony. I got a little silly that night.
Adama You ever wonder what wouldve happened if the Cylons hadnt have come back?
Roslin I think given Baltar and the terrain we couldnt have made a go of it. What about you? Do you think you would have stayed on Galactica? Or do you think you would have settled?
Adama Its pretty hypothetical, isnt it?
Roslin It is. Until it isnt. Did I just say that?
Adama Its worth it just seeing you laugh like that. Weve been at war so long sometimes we forget what we fighting for. Raise our kids in peace, enjoy one anothers company. Live life as people again.
Roslin Like that night on New Caprica, thats really what we are talking about here now, isnt it?
Adama That, and... Other times...
Roslin So if the Cylons hadnt come back?
Adama But they did. We have certain responsibilities.
Roslin Yes, we do, sir. And uh, I will be back in a few days, and if youd like, we can... talk more about that night.
Roslin Bill? The answers yes. I absolutely wouldve built the cabin.
Carolanne Go ahead. Put it away, like you have after every anniversary. Promise me you wont take it out again.
Adama Itd be easier to hate you. But that would be a lie, Carolanne. And theres been enough of that through our lives.
Carolanne_regretful We had something, didnt we.
Adama Yeah. We had something.
Adama See you next year.
