admiral_william_adama Congratulations on making Captain. Sorry I wasnt there.
cpt_lee_adama Thank you, sir. Hows my mother?
admiral_william_adama Getting married.
president_laura_roslin In the mountains north of here theres this little stream. The water is so clear, its like looking through glass. I am thinking of building a cabin.
cpt_lee_adama You and Cally have a fight?
chief_galen_tyrol you didnt hear us? I figured we should have sold tickets.
admiral_william_adama Its not too late for Baltar to just disappear.
president_laura_roslin We cant do that. For all his crimes, hes one of us.
admiral_william_adama So what happens next?
president_laura_roslin We give him his trial.
Intercom#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode15 Colonel Tigh to see you, Admiral.
admiral_william_adama Enter.
admiral_william_adama Youre up early.
colonel_saul_tigh Couldnt sleep, thought Id make myself useful. Happy anniversary, Bill.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Hey, its okay. Its okay.
chief_galen_tyrol I dont know where, just double-check it for me.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Daddys getting good at this.
chief_galen_tyrol Daddys tired of burning his wrists. Im gonna get ready. We got morning watch.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson I thought we were spending the day with Nicky.
chief_galen_tyrol Yeah, so did I, until Laskin and Perry called in sick.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Its okay. Shh, shh. So you volunteered in their place? We barely get a moment off as it is.
chief_galen_tyrol Cally, you know the deck is short-handed.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson The deck has been short-handed since we got here. All I know is the frakking daycare workers see more of Nick than we do.
chief_galen_tyrol Yeah well until the daycare workers figure out how to strip a Viper, this is the way its gonna be. Hey, buddy, come here. Oh, oh, oh, I know. I know, I know. You just laid down too, didnt you? Come here, I got you. There you go. Ill take him to daycare.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Hey! forgetting something?
admiral_william_adama Whats on the duty schedule?
colonel_saul_tigh Nothing sexy. A CO2 scrubbers out near sickbay. Broken water line in the galley. Oh, now that most of our Vipers are out of dry-dock Chiefs gonna have us look at the servos in airlock 12.
colonel_saul_tigh Would you please...
admiral_william_adama Is that it?
colonel_saul_tigh The Fleets quiet. You could use some time for yourself. I can handle first watch.
admiral_william_adama Ill be keeping my schedule. This is just another day.
carolanne_adama Just another day? Maybe I should have married him instead of you.
admiral_william_adama I could have sold tickets to that.
carolanne_adama We had some good times. But more bad. But you keep bringing me back anyway, just this one day, year after year. only thing I cant understand is... Why?
admiral_william_adama Neither do I.
pvt_stewart_jaffee Excuse me, sir.
admiral_william_adama Put it on the table, Private...?
pvt_stewart_jaffee Jaffee, sir.
pvt_stewart_jaffee Will there be anything else, Admiral?
admiral_william_adama Thatll be all, Jaffee.
carolanne_adama Its going to be a long day.
admiral_william_adama It always is.
ensign_diana_seelix Morning, Chief.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Is Nicky okay?
chief_galen_tyrol Yeah, hes fine. First time he didnt cry when I dropped him off at daycare. So, Figurski, you gonna at least pretend to do something today?
specialist_3rd_class_anthony_figurski Frakking scrubber. It takes Adama two seconds to sign off on an order thats gonna take us all day to finish.
chief_galen_tyrol Well, take you all day anyhow. Seelix, Cally, youre with me. Airlock 12.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Seelix, can you get the door?
ensign_diana_seelix Yeah.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson This place is a frakking mess!
chief_galen_tyrol Yeah, the Cylons blew the hell out of it. Nobodys been down here since damage control plugged the holes. Seelix, can you hear me in there?
ensign_diana_seelix Yeah.
chief_galen_tyrol You want to see if I can find the electrical diagrams for the airlock?
ensign_diana_seelix You bet. Ew, I did find somebodys year-old lunch.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson He didnt even cry?
chief_galen_tyrol Cal, I told you. Nicky is fine.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Yeah, and anybody could have dragged a toolbag down here. It didnt have to be me.
chief_galen_tyrol Yeah, well, it had to be somebody. You know these gearing systems better than anybody. What do you want me to do, give you special treatment because youre my wife? How would that look?
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson I dont care!
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson We keep trying to pretend like nothings changed, that our lives are exactly like they were before we went to New Caprica. But it is different. Were married, we have a son.
chief_galen_tyrol Yeah, its just a little rough patch.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson What if rough patches are all we have left? We said we were gonna raise Nicky ourselves, remember?
chief_galen_tyrol Yeah, well. We swore a lot of things. The Cylons didnt exactly cooperate, did they? You want to give me those wire cutters?
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson What the hell?
chief_galen_tyrol Oh, for fraks sake. Seelix, what are you doing? Open the door.
ensign_diana_seelix I didnt do anything. Chief, Im picking up a pressure differential in there. I mean, its nothing drastic, but you guys are definitely losing air.
chief_galen_tyrol Well, it doesnt take much. once the airflow sensors detect a big enough leak, all the doors are designed to drop automatically. Its just a safety precaution.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson I feel safer already.
ensign_diana_seelix Wait a second, are you saying that the hulls been breached?
chief_galen_tyrol Well, breached is a bit dramatic, but the airs going somewhere. one of these patches must have cracked when we came in. As soon as we plug it and restore the pressure, the door should open.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Then we can pull the work orders on whoever made these frakking walls and kick their asses.
chief_galen_tyrol Yeah, well, the most important thing is to keep breathing. So lets just find the leak. This is it over here, this one.
admiral_william_adama Leeson takes first watch. Leeson takes first watch. Kinsey checks the roster. Kinsey checks the roster. Jaffee brings me coffee. Jaffee brings me coffee.
carolanne_adama Are you still doing that? The memory exercises? Do you really think they expect you to know all of their names?
admiral_william_adama You never change, do you?
carolanne_adama one of the joys of being long dead. I suppose. Now hurry, youre going to be late meeting Laura. Maybe shes got a thing for bad boys. She wouldnt be the first.
admiral_william_adama Shes the President of the Twelve Colonies.
carolanne_adama Oh, Im sorry. Im sorry, of course. Since youve created one godlike facade for yourself, why not invent another one for her?
carolanne_adama Its another excuse to keep your distance.
president_laura_roslin Admiral.
admiral_william_adama Madame President.
president_laura_roslin How are you?
admiral_william_adama Very good.
president_laura_roslin Im sorry, Im sure this all could have been done over the wireless, but very frankly, I was going a little stir-crazy on
admiral_william_adama Deep space pilots call it OBE.
president_laura_roslin Whats OBE?
admiral_william_adama Overcome By Events.
president_laura_roslin Well, you may not feel that way after you finish this. Tory actually drew up an agenda.
admiral_william_adama Baltar again. Hmm. Cant we just give him back to the Cylons?
president_laura_roslin Oh, you know how much I love that idea. Unfortunately, given what little I was able to glean from the Caprica Six, I dont think the Cylons would take him back. So were stuck.
admiral_william_adama Fine. Then try the son of a bitch and be done with it.
president_laura_roslin We have give him a trial, but under what law? Caprican? Picon? Tauron? Do we give him a jury trial, do we set up a tribunal? We dont even have anything closely resembling a comprehensive law library, and this Fleet is not exact brimming with legal talent.
admiral_william_adama You bring lawyers into this, theyre gonna drag you around for months.
president_laura_roslin Wasnt your father an attorney, on Caprica?
admiral_william_adama Yes. And I told you that I didnt get along with him very well.
president_laura_roslin Oh, right. Okay, I need to set up an organizing committee, though frankly, trying to get a room full of legal scholars to stay on task is like herding cats. And so I need to set up a chairman of this committee, somebody who can make a hard decision and who wont get seduced and bogged down by all the legalese.
admiral_william_adama Do you have a candidate?
president_laura_roslin As a matter fact I do. I was thinking Lee... Like grandfather, like grandson, perhaps. What do you think?
admiral_william_adama Im not gonna say hes incapable of handling it, but hes never shown any type of interest in law.
president_laura_roslin I know, but heres the thing. We need the lawyers to parse the law, but we really need people who actually know the difference between right and wrong. Thats Lee.
admiral_william_adama Ill talk to him.
president_laura_roslin Good. Admiral, I was wondering if youd mind if I stayed on your ship for the rest of the day.
admiral_william_adama Please. By all means.
president_laura_roslin This is very difficult for me to say, but Im going to go to the gym.
admiral_william_adama Prepare yourself. on its best day it smells like the inside of a shoe.
chief_galen_tyrol See if theres another patch in there. I want to double up on this one, make sure it holds. Come on, Cal, fasters better. The sooner we do this, the sooner we get out.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson I heard you the first time.
Randoms#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode15 Sir. Sir. Admiral.
carolanne_adama Youre getting better at ignoring all of that. That sudden hush, those sidelong glances. That really used to get to you.
admiral_william_adama I dont ever recall being able to intimidate you.
carolanne_adama Thats right. But I knew you long before you were the Admiral. Back when you were just Bill, the husband who wasnt there. The father who left. Just Bill. Who is Bill Adama anyway? Still a good question.
carolanne_adama I wonder if Ill get an answer.
Narcho#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode15 49 days without a sighting. Maybe we finally scared the toasters off.
captain_kara_thrace Oh yeah, Nacho, your crap flyings putting the fear of the Gods in them.
captain_karl_agathon Whats up, buddy?
captain_karl_agathon Whats the matter with you?
lt_brendan_constanza Sorry. Ive got the weirdest rash...
captain_karl_agathon Really? Hope she was worth it, buddy.
cpt_lee_adama Ten-hut! ...At ease. Before we get started, I want a show of hands. How many of you boneheads know how to count? Because I keep hearing numbers being thrown around the hangar deck. 47, and then 48. Now 49 days since our last enemy contact. Now, I realize that any higher maths probably beyond most of you, so Im gonna make this real simple for you. one is the only number you need to remember. Because all it takes is one pilot to let his guard down, one ECO to miss a dradis contact, and suddenly the Cylons are on top of us. Thats when people die.
admiral_william_adama Hes like both of us.
admiral_william_adama Proud, stubborn, and angry. But hes coming into his own. Especially in the last few months.
carolanne_adama Dont tell me. Tell him!
admiral_william_adama He knows.
carolanne_adama Knows what? That the Admirals going to give him a good performance review? Or that his father loves him? Dont tell me the Admirals facade extends to Lee too.
cpt_lee_adama Formation flying. Deflection shooting. Tactics. Doing touch and goes until every last one of you hits an okay three. Red and blue sections will go first, yellow and green will follow. Skids up in ten minutes. Dismissed.
cpt_lee_adama Starbuck, if youve got a problem, I dont want to hear about it.
captain_kara_thrace Mm. My only problem is that you didnt preach that sermon a week ago. You might want to find some new material though -- the old mans been using that one fatal mistake line since we got here.
cpt_lee_adama Well, if youre gonna steal, steal from the best.
captain_kara_thrace Sir.
admiral_william_adama Pretty tough on them today.
cpt_lee_adama Well, a kick in the butt is worth a thousand words. Gods know you kicked mine enough. Everything okay?
admiral_william_adama Yeah, its been one of those mornings. President wants to take the fast track on Baltars trial. Shes looking for someone to take charge of the preliminaries, help cobble together the legal framework. She wants me to assign you.
cpt_lee_adama Youre kidding.
admiral_william_adama Interested?
cpt_lee_adama Uh, more surprised. Did she say why she asked for me?
admiral_william_adama Well, shes gonna need someone she can trust, you definitely fit that. I remember when you were younger, youd go visit your grandfathers house, and you were fascinated with his papers and his law books.
cpt_lee_adama And there was me thinking I was being sly, sneaking off into his office all by myself. Yeah, I guess its a pipe dream now, but for five minutes there I really did consider lawyer as one of a dozen careers that I could go into, before I joined the service.
admiral_william_adama Hmm. I never knew that.
cpt_lee_adama Well, it was probably during one of my, um, angry at dad phases. Anyway, its impossible.
cpt_lee_adama Even if I wanted to help out, theres no way. The CAGs duty is already 24/7, even on a light week.
admiral_william_adama Yeah, I assumed that.
Narcho#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode15 Major, were ready for you.
cpt_lee_adama Excuse me...
chief_galen_tyrol Okay, well, ones gonna have to do. Seelix, check the pressure. If that patch holds, were gonna equalize in a few minutes. This doors gonna open.
ensign_diana_seelix Okay.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Oh, for fraks sakes.
chief_galen_tyrol Gods.
admiral_william_adama How they doing?
cpt_lee_adama Still alive.
Public_Address#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode15 This is a Condition Three alert. Hull breach on Deck 14.
admiral_william_adama Chief!
chief_galen_tyrol Admiral. I seem to have turned this into a full-blown fubar. Youd be doing us a hell of a favor getting those doors open.
admiral_william_adama We gotta get them out of there.
chief_galen_tyrol Keep moving. Keep moving.
cpt_lee_adama The airlocks designed to lock down if the pressure increases unexpectedly, so as soon as the patch...
admiral_william_adama -- I know the system. We have redundancies. We have...
cpt_lee_adama The manual override is down, theres no way of getting those inner doors to open. The thing mustve taken heavy damage on the way out of New Caprica.
colonel_saul_tigh Whole ships take a pounding. We need six weeks in dry-dock just to hammer out the dings, let alone tackle the structural damage.
admiral_william_adama How much time do they have?
cpt_lee_adama With a leak that size, theyll be out of air in half an hour, maybe less. Those are blast doors. It would take at least an hour to cut through them.
colonel_saul_tigh Why dont we put explosives in the observation booth? Blow the glass, pull them out.
cpt_lee_adama No, the glass is strong enough to withstand a tylium explosion. Anything strong enough to take out the glass will take out Tyrol and Cally at the same time.
admiral_william_adama I need a rescue plan. Not excuses.
cpt_lee_adama Seven seconds.
captain_kara_thrace Then another ten to re-pressurize since well doing this in open space. Thats pushing it.
lt_sharon_valerii All right, this might be a stupid question, but has anyone ever tried a rescue like this before?
captain_kara_thrace No ones ever been crazy enough.
cpt_lee_adama Doesnt matter, were out of time. Prep for launch. Weve only got 18 minutes left.
lt_sharon_valerii All right, lets go, were on.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Galen.
admiral_william_adama Airlocks still jammed, Chief. Overrides are not responding.
chief_galen_tyrol Guys, were kind of running out of options.
admiral_william_adama Im going to take you out through the front door.
chief_galen_tyrol Youll put a ship out there and rig up some kind of docking collar?
admiral_william_adama Youll be out of air in a few minutes. Theres no time for a collar.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Sir, if youre talking about an EVA, we dont have pressure suits.
admiral_william_adama We dont have a choice.
admiral_william_adama Athenas gonna position her Raptor in front of the airlock, hatch open. Were gonna blow the bolts right off of that door, and when it opens, youre gonna have to jump for it. Now, listen to me, both of you. You can do this. People have been able to live up to a minute in exposure to vacuum without a suit.
chief_galen_tyrol Admiral, I dont know.
admiral_william_adama Well talk later. Get ready.
Operator#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode15 Athena, Galactica. You have priority clearance. All other traffic is being waved away.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Wait. What about Nicky?
chief_galen_tyrol Admirals right, we have to prep. Gotta move everything away from here to the door.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Galen... we both know what happens to kids in the Fleet when their parents arent there for them.
chief_galen_tyrol Apollo and Dee. Theyd take care of him.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson No. No pilots. Hes not going through this twice. Sir? Theres a civilian family, the mothers name is Susan Deckler. She has a little girl. If anything happens to us...
admiral_william_adama Ill see to it.
chief_galen_tyrol I was being selfish. I wanted you with me, like old times. I didnt think about Nick. Im sorry.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Hey. Hey. Admirals gonna get us out of here, okay? Were gonna take care of Nicky.
colonel_saul_tigh More than a few seconds out there, were talking severe exposure. Decompression sickness. At the very least, hypothermia. They could freeze to death.
admiral_william_adama Make sure Cottles got his hyperbaric chamber ready.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Im sorry.
cpt_lee_adama Galactica, Apollo. Bringing raptor into position at Airlock 12.
chief_galen_tyrol Put your mask on.
cpt_lee_adama All right, listen up. We dont have time to hang back until the airlock doors blow, so were liable to experience some turbulence from the residual oxygen, maybe even some shrapnel hits. Athena, youre gonna have to be ready to compensate.
lt_sharon_valerii, Im on it, Major. Well hold position until Chief and Cally are secured.
captain_kara_thrace Lets just get this done.
cpt_lee_adama Galactica, Apollo. Raptor door is open, were standing by ready to execute.
admiral_william_adama Chief, Cally, Raptors in position. We gotta go now. Get ready to blow the hatch on my mark.
chief_galen_tyrol Okay. No matter what, you hang onto me. Dont let go.
admiral_william_adama Three! Two! one. Do it.
cpt_lee_adama Whoa, watch out! Bank right, bank right!
lt_sharon_valerii Im in position!
cpt_lee_adama Pull up your nose! Pull up!
lt_sharon_valerii Got it!
cpt_lee_adama Hold it right there!
cpt_lee_adama Galactica, Apollo. Raptor secured and pressurized. Theyre in rough shape, we gotta get em to sickbay right away.
admiral_william_adama Come in. So any word on Chief and Cally?
cpt_lee_adama Theyre alive. But Doc Cottles still evaluating their condition. So are you gonna tell me whats going on with you?
admiral_william_adama Its this day.
cpt_lee_adama My Gods, your wedding anniversary. I had ... totally forgotten.
admiral_william_adama Probably seems foolish. Especially the way that it all ended up, but... Still. It still means something to me. Weve never talked about it. The divorce. Your mother... It was a bad time for all of us. Your mother gave you and your brother a home. Stability.
cpt_lee_adama Dad, I know you want to believe that, but um... You know what? Forget it. It was a long time ago.
admiral_william_adama You have something to say son, just say it.
cpt_lee_adama Well Dad, we had four walls. But stability? My Gods, you knew what mom was like. I mean, the mood swings? Its why you left her.
admiral_william_adama We had problems, but she cared deeply for you and your brother.
cpt_lee_adama Well, then things changed after you left. I mean, there were times when she lost control.
carolanne_adama Dont listen to him, Bill.
cpt_lee_adama And she would try and apologize She would promise she would make things better. But then she would just start drinking, and then all of her good intentions would just go out the frakkin...
admiral_william_adama Is it true?
carolanne_adama I cant believe youd even ask me that.
admiral_william_adama Damn it, is it true?
cpt_lee_adama And then one day, finally the apologies even stopped.
admiral_william_adama Thats enough.
carolanne_adama You walked out on me! You walked on me! The brilliant Commander! Who could lead all of his men into combat, but he couldnt find a way to live with his own family! Never lived anywhere for more than six months. Just following you around from one base to another. Waiting for you to come home. But you werent here for any of us! Whatever was easiest for the great Adama!
admiral_william_adama They needed you. They were our children
carolanne_adama They needed a father. All through your glorious career, you have prided yourself on being a leader of men, judging people. Always making the hard call. But when it came to the biggest decision of your life. Oh, Bill, you blew it. We were wrong for each other from ? but you just couldnt accept that. Thats it. Thats why you keep calling me back. Because if you had made that mistake, it would just call into question all of your other decisions.
admiral_william_adama She was still your mother, Lee. I loved her.
cpt_lee_adama I believe you. I just dont think she ever loved you.
Random#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode15 Hes right here...
ensign_diana_seelix Hey, I dropped by daycare. Somebody wanted to see you. Whos that?
chief_galen_tyrol Hey, little man.
ensign_diana_seelix Hows she doing?
chief_galen_tyrol Doc Cottle says shes gonna be okay, but its gonna be a while before shes 100%.
ensign_diana_seelix Careful. ...Yeah?
chief_galen_tyrol Yeah, Im fine. Oh, I know. Come here. ! I got you buddy. you want to go see mommy? Go see mommy. Hey, yeah. Lets go see mommy. Come on. Shes over here, yeah. Heh!
chief_galen_tyrol Cal. Cal, sweetie. Look whos here. Look whos here.
admiral_william_adama Seelix.
chief_galen_tyrol No matter what, I dont know how, we will manage, find a balance. You and me. We will take care of Nick, okay. I love you.
chief_galen_tyrol Oh, look. Theres mommys hand. There. There.
cpt_lee_adama Hey.
officer_anastasia_dualla Hey. How are you?
cpt_lee_adama Good. So whats this?
officer_anastasia_dualla Oh, it was here when I got in. Its from your father.
cpt_lee_adama Is it ticking?
officer_anastasia_dualla Heh. He left you a note.
cpt_lee_adama Caprican criminal codes. These are my grandfathers law books.
officer_anastasia_dualla Your dad mustve had these in storage all this time. Whys he giving them to you now?
president_laura_roslin Im glad you stopped by. I have something for you. This was given to me by one of the colonists down on New Caprica. And I forgot about it, but Tory found it in a pile old clothes.
president_laura_roslin Dont let the title fool you. Its a pretty good mystery. I think youll like it. And its not a loan, its a gift.
admiral_william_adama You u ever think about the times much on New Caprica?
president_laura_roslin I try to think about the good times, yes I do.
admiral_william_adama one particular stands out in my mind. You were wearing your really bright red dress. Said you wanted to build a cabin.
president_laura_roslin It was Baltars Groundbreaking ceremony. I got a little silly that night.
admiral_william_adama You ever wonder what wouldve happened if the Cylons hadnt have come back?
president_laura_roslin I think given Baltar and the terrain we couldnt have made a go of it. What about you? Do you think you would have stayed on Galactica? Or do you think you would have settled?
admiral_william_adama Its pretty hypothetical, isnt it?
president_laura_roslin It is. Until it isnt. Did I just say that?
admiral_william_adama Its worth it just seeing you laugh like that. Weve been at war so long sometimes we forget what we fighting for. Raise our kids in peace, enjoy one anothers company. Live life as people again.
president_laura_roslin Like that night on New Caprica, thats really what we are talking about here now, isnt it?
admiral_william_adama That, and... Other times...
president_laura_roslin So if the Cylons hadnt come back?
admiral_william_adama But they did. We have certain responsibilities.
president_laura_roslin Yes, we do, sir. And uh, I will be back in a few days, and if youd like, we can... talk more about that night.
president_laura_roslin Bill? The answers yes. I absolutely wouldve built the cabin.
carolanne_adama Go ahead. Put it away, like you have after every anniversary. Promise me you wont take it out again.
admiral_william_adama Itd be easier to hate you. But that would be a lie, Carolanne. And theres been enough of that through our lives.
carolanne_adama We had something, didnt we.
admiral_william_adama Yeah. We had something.
admiral_william_adama See you next year.
