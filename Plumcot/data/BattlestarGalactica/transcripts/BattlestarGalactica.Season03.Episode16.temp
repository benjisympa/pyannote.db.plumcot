Chief Previously on Battlestar Galactica...
Baltar I demand my rights as a Colonial citizen to legal representation and full due process.
Roslin Do you.
Adama So what happens next?
Roslin We give him his trial.
Chief My father was a priest, my mother an Oracle. Ive served on the Battlestar since I was 18 years old.
Chief When you elected me union president, I promised I would keep us working... You must throw your body on the gears and on the levers and on the machine itself, and make it stop.
Teamsters Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike!
Cally Youre pretending like nothings changed, that our lives are exactly like they were before we went to New Caprica. But it is different.
Chief Yeah, were just goin through a little rough patch.
Cally What if rough patches are all we have left?
Chief Figurski, Pollux, Sanchez, youre gonna be rehabbing mule engines tonight, so dont make after-dinner plans.
Figurski Thought we were subbing out mule maintenance to the civvies in Dogsville.
Chief Yeah, I dont got enough mechanics down there... Check flow rate.
Pollux Flow rate steady at two-niner-zero. Hey, when are we getting some rack around here, Chief? Im standing double watches the last two weeks.
Chief I know, I know.
Pollux Plus, I still got the ringin in my ears.
Deck_Hands Im sorry, I cant hear you. Ive got ringin. Whats that?
Pollux Pretty funny, guys.
Deck_Hand Okay, fusion indicators are out. Get the wing tank switch to fuel. Power off. All right, tank off. Thats it. Kill the fueling station. Pull the hose. LT, youre tanked up and ready to roll.
Racetrack Roger that, Chief. Ready to roll.
Seelix Laundry call. Figurski, Pollux, Redford, grab your crap before I chuck it in the cycler.
Figurski Fold my undies the way I like?
Seelix Frak off.
Figurski Oh, nice mouth. Think they let officers talk like that? Gonna have to change your ways when you get them wings.
Seelix Not getting wings. They rejected my application for flight training.
Pollux But you aced the written exam, interview went well...
Seelix Yeah, well, in turns out Im in a critical position and my leaving would cause severe mission degradation.
Cally That sucks.
Pollux Critical position my ass. They just dont want knuckledraggers stinking up the pilot ready room.
Chief All right, thats enough. Lock it up. Thats enough.
Chief Look, the CAG told me you got bounced from flight training. Im sorry about that, it sucks. Truth is, we need you down here. Youre the best avionics specialist weve got.
Figurski And she knows how to fold a mans undies.
Figurski Are you crazy? Ill take you apart!
Chief Hey, shut up, Figurski! Ill pop you in the mouth myself. Now get back to work. (
Seelix Let go of me.
Chief Hey. Hey, hey. Listen to me.
Seelix Ok....
Chief You do important work down here. Just as important as sitting in a cockpit.
Seelix Thanks, Chief. ...Im gonna ... deliver some more important laundry.
Racetrack Raptor away. Readings nominal. Everything looks good, setting course, heading two-niner-six-five...
Skulls What the frak?
Racetrack Flameout. RCS thrusters jammed. Restart... No go.
Skulls Galactica, Skulls. Engine two thrusters stuck in full position, engine one wont start.
Racetrack Theres a fire in engine two. Its gonna blow. Get your ass up here!
Racetrack Eject! Eject! Eject!
Adama You got off lucky. A dozen injuries, no fatalities.
Roslin Thank you. You shouldve seen Torys shoulder, I had to help Cottle put it back in alignment. Ugh. You know I am so busy, I hardly ever make it down to this end of the ship. And now Im gonna be living here for God knows how long, until they repair the bulkheads.
Adama Well, if the quarters become cramped, youre always welcome in one of my beds. ...In a manner of speaking.
Roslin_laughing Do you have any better idea of what happened to your Raptor?
Adama Were still investigating the situation, but it seems that the tylium was seriously contaminated with impurities. Most likely, its a problem with the refining process.
Roslin The hells goin on there? That refinery used to be the most reliable ship in the Fleet. Now every day, I start with a stack of messages from the chief -- what is his name?
Adama Xeno Fenner.
Roslin Fenner. Complaining about living conditions, and deliveries, and, uh, spare parts ... and compensation, if you can believe that. Were on the run for our lives, and the guy wants to talk about overtime bonuses.
Adama Well, weve been more than patient with Fenner and his production problems. Two weeks of sitting here waiting for him to get his act together... I dont know about you, but Im ready to get back on the road to finding Earth.
Roslin Is that a hint of hope I hear? Has the skeptic suddenly decided that were on the road to Earth after all?
Adama Have I ever doubted it?
Fenner Ive got people working eighteen-hour shifts for the past six months. How long you think a man can keep that up?
Adama If the Cylons show up we have enough fuel to jump the entire Fleet what, once?
Roslin Hmm.
Adama Maybe twice. Thats a margin thats much too narrow for me. How about for you, and your men? You have a problem. Fix it.
Roslin Just get the gas flowing, and then well talk. I promise you that.
Fenner Then well talk. Its always later. You know, its funny that when the gas flows, my phone calls dont get returned, but the minute theres a glitch in the fuel supply, Ive got facetime with the President and the Admiral? Hmm. Maybe we should just start having more glitches.
Roslin Is that a threat?
Fenner Its like the book says: If you hear the people, youll never have to fear the people.
Roslin Did you say
Fenner Mm-hmm.
Roslin Guards, arrest him for extortion and interrupting vital services during a time of war. Go ahead, take him away. Thats it, go. Out of here. Gone.
Marine Come with me, sir.
Adama What the hell was that?
Roslin He was quoting from
Adama The ramblings that his lawyer smuggled out of the brig?
Roslin Hes having it reprinted and passed out among the Fleet, and hes calling it
Chief Ooh, algae meat loaf! Starting to be a favorite.
Cally Its not for you. Remember our little talk?
Chief Oh, but todays my cheat day.
Cally The last three days have been your cheat day.
Chief Really? Yee. You were moving better yesterday. That how the bends are supposed to work?
Cally Im just upset about Seelix, so Im tensing up.
Chief They should have just told her right off the bat what the Fleet priorities are. Should have said that they needed knuckledraggers more than they need pilots.
Cally It isnt about Fleet priorities. Were not part of the ruling class, so were stuck doing the dirty work.
Chief Ruling class? Whered you get that?
Cally Something I read. ...By Baltar.
Chief Those frakking rags making their way around the Fleet, I cant believe that anybodys reading anything written by that guy.
Cally Thats what I thought too, but... You ever wonder why all the pilots and the officers come from the rich Colonies, like Caprica, and Virgon, Tauron... While all the knuckledraggers come from the poor Colonies like Aerelon and Sagittaron? And Geminon?
Chief Yeah, thats just trash talk on the deck.
Cally Really? Name one officer on the Fleet that comes from a poor Colony.
Chief Dualla, Lieutenant Duallas from Sagittaron.
Cally Case in point! How did she get promoted? She married an officer from Caprica.
Chief_answering_phone Tyrol.
Adama Chief, the foreman of the fuel refinery has just been arrested.
Chief Xeno Fenner?
Adama Do you know him?
Cally Did something happen to Xeno?
Chief Arrested. Uh, yes sir, he was in the union on New Caprica, seemed like a good guy. Whatd he do?
Adama He pissed off the President. But the bigger problem right now is the refining operation. I need someone to go over there and get that fuel ship moving again. Pick a team, get your gear, and be on the hangar deck in an hour.
Chief Yes, sir.
Cally I dont understand. What happened to Xeno?
Chief He pissed off the President.
Cally What, you can get arrested for that now?
Chief I think the Admiral was kidding.
Cally Yeah. You ever think about the union?
Chief Sure, but thats gone now.
Cally New Capricas gone, but all the people in the union are still here. only difference is, now they dont have anyone to stand up for them.
Chief I gotta go.
Baltar I do hope youre enjoying yourselves. Its not enough you have to interrupt my sleep and put filth in my food, now you have to destroy my stuff as well. Youre pathetic! Youre utterly and totally...
Roslin -- Hello, Doctor. Why dont you do yourself a favor? Hand over the pages and stop all this nonsense.
Baltar I dont what youre talking about.
Roslin Turn him around. The pages to your book.
Baltar So youve read it. The people are reading it, and now youre sorry.
Roslin Weve known that your lawyer was smuggling the pages out of here for weeks, so we intercepted them, and Im afraid Im the only one whos read them. And I am dying to see how it ends. Really, what were you thinking, though? Casting yourself as a man of the people, the son of a farmer? A revolutionary? Oh please.
Baltar It may come as some surprise to you, Madame President, but I wish to strike a chord with the common man.
Roslin Hand over those pages or Ill have these guards search you. Make a choice. Gentlemen, proceed.
Six Dont bend to her, Gaius. Show her that she cant break you. Keep your dignity?
Baltar Perhaps youll consider writing a blurb for the back cover.
Roslin Thank you, Doctor.
Marine Close cell!
Six Its all right, Gaius. Everythingll be okay.
Cabott Tyrol.
Chief Cabott, hey! How you doing? Good to see you!
Cabott_getting_him_dirty Sorry.
Chief Its inevitable!
Cabott Listen, hey, I gotta tell ya -- we were all feelin a lot better when we heard they were sending you.
Chief Oh, yeah?
Cabott You bet. Ive been talking you up, tellin everybody how the union on New Caprica really stood up for the little guy.
Chief Yeah, well...
Cabott Youre looking down at the Fleets entire fuel supply of tylium.
Chief How many jumps you think we got?
Cabott Huh. Wed be lucky if we get out of the system.
Chief Well, you better give us the nickel tour, see where we stand.
Chief Its a big operation.
Cabott Yeah, well, you should see this place when its up and running. Loud as an A-bomb, just about as safe. Listen, we really need this downtime. I mean, look around you. Next time some machine fraks up, it might not just take out a Raptor. This ship, it really is a big bomb waitin to go up.
Chief Yeah, look, I understand the risk, but I need to see it working, so pull your guys off and lets fire it up.
Milo It aint gonna work.
Chief You work here?
Cabott This is Milo. Hes the best, uh, grease jockey I got.
Chief Milo, huh? Tell me, Milo, so why is it not gonna work? Is there something you guys arent telling me? Come on. ...Okay. Guess Im just gonna have to have a look for myself. Is that pressure relief? Seals are missing.
Milo They all are.
Chief Without pressure seals, the machinery wont run. Well, where are they?
Milo Guess they got lost, huh?
Chief Guys, you cant be frakkin around with this stuff. The Admiral wont stand for it...
Milo The Admiral can kiss my ass...
Cabott -- Hey, hey. Come on, Chief. You know what this is about. I guess when working conditions improve, they let Xeno outta jail, well be able to find those seals. Until then, it looks like this ship isnt gonna be refining another drop of tylium. And that means this Fleet aint going anywhere.
Chief Ive executed a search of the ship, but the seals have not turned up.
Adama You know that this was sabotage. Im inclined to have them locked up.
Chief Sir, please. They could have rigged something to have me injured, they could have contaminated the fuel on purpose and left all of our ships dead in the air.
Roslin Good Gods.
Chief All they did do, was buy themselves some time. Look. The machinery does need overhauling, theres a reason that the quality control is failing. You realize most of the workers on that ship have not had a day off since the original attack on the Colonies? Its like slave labor.
Adama Dont be absurd.
Chief The men and women aboard that ship are stuck there. They cant leave, they cant transfer. They have no control over their lives.
Roslin And the work is hard, we know that. Do they think theyre having a picnic at the algae processing plant, or munitions? Or waste processing? The Fleet is filled with ships with people working under horrific conditions, and nobodys having a good time.
Chief Well, I think that if we at least release Xeno and start talking to them about improving working conditions and living conditions that the protest will go away, theyll return the pressure seals, and well get the fuel contamination problem under control.
Roslin Extortion is not an acceptable method of protest. What are the names of the leaders?
Chief ...Just Cabott.
Roslin I will issue a warrant for his arrest.
Adama Put him in the brig, have him sweat it out.
Chief Admiral, Madame President, theyre just trying to...
Roslin -- Chief. Huh uh. Were done.
Chief_unable_to_sleep Im gonna go check on Cabott and Xeno.
Marine Chief.
Fenner Hey.
Chief Hey.
Fenner You gotta get him outta here.
Chief What the hell happened to his hands?
Fenner Wake up in the middle of the night, hes scratching the walls. Just keeps scratching them, till his fingers are bleeding.
Cabott ...Say it doesnt matter...
Fenner He was in Cylon detention on New Caprica, you remember? He came out squirrelly, and this is not helping. Come on, you gotta get him outta here.
Cabott ...It doesnt matter... I wont say...
Chief Where are the seals?
Fenner Oh, you son of a bitch.
Chief Come on.
Fenner Come on, Galen! You gotta get him outta here!
Chief Cabott!
Cabott No, I wont.
Chief Cabott, look at me! Cabott, listen to me, where are the seals?
Cabott I wouldnt say. It doesnt matter.
Chief Cabott, I can get you out of there. Where are the seals? Tell me where the seals are. Where are the seals?
Fenner Galen, for Gods sakes, get him outta there!
Chief Where? Where are the seals? Where are they?!
Cabott It doesnt -- it doesnt matter! It doesnt matter!
Fenner Look at him!
Chief Where are the seals?
Cabott It doesnt matter! It doesnt matter!
Chief Where are they?!
Cabott It doesnt matter!
Fenner The air vent, all right? Theyre in the central stern air vent!
Chief Tell the President to release them.
Chief All right, thats the last one. Lets fire this up. Get back to work.
Fenner Yes sir, whatever you say, boss.
Milo Hey, hey, hey. Can I throw the switch?
Chief ...How old are you?
Milo Twelve. Almost. But I can run every machine we got. only thing I havent done is turn the whole thing on.
Chief Its all yours.
Chief There are kids down there, Madame President.
Roslin Theres children on every ship in the Fleet.
Chief These children work in the refinery. Theyre twelve, fifteen years old.
Roslin Thereve been families aboard the refinery ever since its beginning, and others were picked up after the Cylons attacked the Colonies. Over the past two years, the parents have been teaching the children how to operate the machinery. They have been passing along their skills. It is perfectly normal. It is not ideal, I know that, but there is nothing ideal about this Fleet.
Chief Do you see whats happening? The jobs are starting to be inherited, Madame President. We dont know how long were gonna be on these ships, what if its ten years? So I train my son to be a deckhand because thats what I am, and thats all he can ever be? Is that the future we want?
Roslin ...Thats a really good point. Tory, I want you to make a list of everyone in the Fleet who has a work history appropriate to the refinery. Factory workers, mechanics, whatever you think. Give it to the Chief, and I want you to hold a public lottery. And we will take people from other vessels, and we will put them on shifts in the refinery. Hows that, Chief?
Chief Thank you.
Roslin Thank you.
Chief So thats our allotment for Dogsville. Get these people on these ships before they know where theyre going.
Figurski Hm. All right, people! Lets go!
Danny Excuse me, sir? Hi, um, I dont really know who Im supposed to talk to you about this, but I dont really think Im what you guys are looking for. I dont really have the skills.
Chief Whats your name?
Danny Uh, Danny Noon.
Figurski Noon? Noon. Noon, Daniel. ...Says youre a farmer.
Chief Farmer. Yeah, thats what were looking for, people to work with heavy machinery.
Danny No, but I dont, not really. Sir, I worked on a farm for a summer, cause I was saving up to go to college -- architecture -- but then the Cylons attacked, and... Now Im a farmer? How is that fair? How is that in any way fair?
Chief Just give me a second.
Figurski We make an exception for this guy, theres gonna be fifteen more right behind him.
Chief Look at him though. Hes a kid.
Figurski Well...?
Chief Fine. Put him in the ship. Uh, look... this is just a temporary thing, okay?
Danny No, wait. Hold on. I am not a farmer.
Chief Yeah. Its not permanent.
Danny No, wait. Can you just check my record?
Figurski Yeah.
Danny I... No, no. Excuse me, who am I supposed to talk to about this? Who am I supposed to talk to about this? You dont understand, Im not a farmer! Hey! Stop it! Im not a farmer!
Baltar What are you doing here?
Chief Your book. Fact or fiction?
Baltar So you read it? Well, that proves that the Presidents an accomplished liar. She told me it hadnt gone out. So, what do you make of it?
Chief I think that its a pile of crap.
Baltar Obviously, my analysis of a bifurcated society scares you. But everything in my book happens to be true.
Chief Oh, its true? Its true that youre a farmboy from Aerelon?
Baltar Yes I am, as a matter of fact. I was born and raised on a dairy outside the town of Cuffles Breath Wash, on Aerelon.
Chief Why do I have such a hard time picturing you milking cows and shoveling manure?
Baltar Lack of imagination?
Chief Or maybe that your little tale is manure.
Baltar Hmm.
Chief Ive known people from Aerelon. You dont sound anything like them.
Baltar I dont sound like Im from Aerelon?
Chief No.
Baltar Well, you know, I take that as a particular compliment. I dont know about you, but Ive always founds the Aerelon dialect to be particularly hard on the ears.
Chief You do realize that none of that exists here.
Baltar Ha! Coming from the mouth of a mechanic.
Chief Weve kept democracy. We have government, we have rights, we have elections...
Baltar Well, then you should feel perfectly happy, shouldnt you? Perfectly at ease. Go home, leave me in peace. After all, thats what the aristocracy wants. It wants the working class to feel looked after, while they scrabble around for scraps from the masters table.
Baltar Theres a question I ask at the end of my book, Ill save you the trouble of reading it: Do you honestly believe that the Fleet will ever be commanded by somebody whose last name is not Adama? There it is, Chief. one set of rules for the aristocracy, and one set of rules for the rest of us.
PA ...Cleanup crew report for duty in the starboard bay... one minute to ...
Fenner Weve given assignments to all the new workers from the lottery.
Chief Looks like you put em right to work.
Fenner Yeah, yeah, theyre okay. Theyre a little skittish, but theyll catch on. Right up heres where we had the problem last time. Got all kinds of gear slippage, temperature variations... We didnt know the dross wasnt getting burned off.
Chief Thats your bad fuel?
Fenner Yeah, its running now. Weve got half a dozen other places on the line that could frak us....
Chief Whats that? Whoa! Thats it! Hit the switch!
Fenner No, no, no, not when its jammed. The whole system will seize up. Gotta fix it, otherwise the ore still in the chambers will superheat and set off a reaction thatll blow us all to hell. Hurry! We gotta get this going!
Chief Right here, this is it.
Fenner You got it?
Chief Yeah.
Fenner Get it out of there.
Chief I cant get my hand around it.
Fenner Careful! Careful!
Chief Ah! Its too small. I cant get under it.
Worker We got some hot rocks up there! You gotta get this thing started, fast!
Fenner Give it a yank! Give it a yank!
Chief I just cant get my hand around it. I cant get my hand on it!
Danny I can try. I can try.
Fenner Get in there.
Danny I can probably get it.
Chief Come on, Danny.
Fenner If he clears it the belts gonna jump, so you gotta be careful. There he goes.
Workers There you go! You got it. You got it, attaboy. Careful... Come on, Danny. Get movin, thats it. Attaboy, now grab it. Now pull it, pull it towards you. Pull hard, Danny. Pull hard! Pull it hard. There it is.
Chief All right! Good work, Danny. Good work!
Fenner Attaboy, Danny. Get outta there. Come on out. Come on out. Come on out. Come on out.
Dannys_arm_falls_split_open_and_useless Aah! Aah!
Fenner Medic! Medic, now!
Fenner Take it easy, buddy. Weve got you. Were gonna lay you down. Its okay, buddy. Great job. Well fix you up. Youre gonna be okay.
Seelix_tending_Danny I need more gauze, just calm down.
Chief This plant is off-line! Were on strike.
Pollux No, no, no, no! Action time!
Figurski Need something, Captain?
Starbuck Yeah, I frackin need something, I need my Viper.
Pollux Sorry, Captain. Vital missions only. CAPs already up, we did our job.
Racetrack What do you mean, vital missions only? on whose orders?
Pollux Cally relayed the orders from Chief Tyrol. Were on strike.
Chief Admiral.
Adama Are you aware that your deck gang is participating in a work stoppage?
Chief Its called a general strike, sir.
Adama Its a mutiny. And do you know what we do with mutineers? We shoot them, Chief.
Chief Were leaving people behind, Admiral. People are locked into their jobs. They have no control over their lives, they have no say. Were abandoning them to their fate, its like weve marooned them on a planet.
Adama That is not the issue. The men and women on this ship are not allowed to disobey an order, especially in support of some kind of frakking labor dispute.
Chief We launched the CAP. No one has abandoned their post, were not putting anyone in danger.
Adama This is mutiny. And it stops now.
Chief Admiral, all I want is a sit down with the President.
Adama_on_phone This is the Admiral. Arrest Cally Tyrol. Take her under armed guard directly to the starboard repair bay.
Chief Repair bay? What are you doing?
Adama Im gonna put her up against the bulkhead and Im gonna shoot her. As a mutineer.
Chief are you out of your frakking mind? Cally was just following my orders.
Adama Shes a ringleader, so she goes first. And then the rest of your dead gang. Figurski, Seelix, Pollux.
Chief_slamming_the_bars You wont do this. We have a son!
Adama Understand me. The very survival of this ship may depend on someone getting an order that they dont want to do, and if they hesitate, if they feel that orders are sometimes optional, then this ship will perish. And so will your son. And the entire human race. I dont want to do this, Chief, but I will put ten Callys up against the wall to make sure that this ship and this Fleet are not destroyed.
Chief Fine. Ill call it off.
Adama_back_to_phone This is the Admiral. Do you have Cally in custody? Put her on. (
Chief_on_phone You okay?
Cally Dont worry about me, Ive been in the brig before.
Chief Everythings okay. Call off the strike.
Cally Did they cave?
Chief ...Yeah. Call it off.
Cally I knew it. Okay, Ill take care of it. Galen, Im proud of you.
Chief Give the phone to the Marine.
Adama_to_phone Release her. (
Roslin Would you like another drink?
Chief Ah, I think Ive had enough. Madame President, Ive seen people drafted into service based purely on where they were born.
Roslin Theyve also been selected based on their skills.
Chief Which is a result of where they were born. Capricans are more likely to be professionals, Aerelons are more likely to be farmers. Its a fact of life.
Roslin Its a fact I cant change.
Chief True. But I think we can level the playing field. There are a lot of dirty jobs that need to be done every day in this Fleet. Cleaning, hauling, low-level maintenance. Things like that. These are the kind of jobs that I think should be allocated to people who... Well, people like yourself, no offense.
Roslin None taken. Go ahead.
Chief Let some of the people on Colonial one get their hands dirty for a change.
Roslin Done. What else?
Chief People that are in dangerous and high-stress jobs need to be rotated out for R&R. And in order to do that, we need a formal training program.
Roslin We can talk about a training program later, but right now, we need to focus on maintaining the workforce that we have, and this is gonna have to be an area where the union gives ground.
Chief The union?
Roslin Oh Im sorry. I thought you were engaged in collective bargaining on behalf of the Colonial Workers Alliance. If thats not the case, then...
Chief Madame President, that union died on New Caprica.
Roslin Chief, the workers in this Fleet, they need someone to represent them and their interests. And if this society is becoming truly polarized between an entrenched political class and a disenfranchised underclass, we are doomed. We wont need the Cylons to destroy us, well destroy ourselves. The Fleet that arrives at Earth will not represent Colonial society at all. I am willing to fight for that society until my dying breath. I would love it if you would fight for that society as well.
Chief I will. I will, Madame President, I will.
Chief Pollux and Herschel, you are on, uh, fueling ... 4372...
Starbuck Chief Tyrol?
Chief Hey, Captain.
Starbuck Chief, one of my nuggets failed to show up for basic flight instruction this morning.
Chief Im sorry to hear that, Captain.
Starbuck So maybe you can tell me where the hell Diana Seelix is.
Chief Seelix, front and center.
Starbuck Flight instruction began twenty minutes ago, Seelix. You wanna be a pilot or not?
Seelix Yes, sir, but I thought that the...
Starbuck -- You will think when I tell you to think, nugget! And you might want to look at the plan of the day, cause then maybe youll know where youre supposed to be, and you might actually get there on time... And youre out of uniform to boot.
Chief Oh, Im sorry, Captain. I think I can handle that.
Starbuck Thank you, Chief.
Chief_handing_Kara_his_equipment Hold this. (
Seelix Thank you, Chief. Thank you.
Chief Congratulations, Ensign.
Starbuck All right, this all very touching, but you were supposed to be in Ready Room Four twenty minutes ago, Ensign, which means that you are falling behind on your first day. So move it! Dont look at him, move it! Move it!
Chief Be nice.
Starbuck Heh.
