Starbuck Previously, on Battlestar Galactica...
Adama Leobens a very clever Cylon. Hes gonna try to get into your head.
Leoben We havent been properly I introduced. Im Leoben.
Roslin I want this Cylon interrogated.
Starbuck_waterboarding_Leoben Do it.
Leoben This is has happened before, and all of it will happen again. Your destinys already been written.
Simon I saw your x-rays. A lot of old fractures from childhood... Children of abusive parents often fear passing along that abuse to their own children.
Starbuck Get out!
Leoben Im trying to help you, Kara. I only want you see the truth of your life. The reason why you suffered, the reason why youve struggled for so long.
Anders Theres something to what Leoben said about you and a special destiny?
Starbuck Kara Thrace and her Special Destiny? That sounds more like a bad cover band, Sam.
Helo Curious about something. Those paintings you did your apartment on Caprica... This? Was on the temple. Whered you get the idea to paint yours?
Starbuck That was just something Ive been doodlin since I was a kid, I liked the pattern.
Helo Well, they built the temple 4,000 years ago.
Helo What is it?
Starbuck_angrily Just something Leoben said once. That I had a destiny, that it had already been written.
Hotdog_grinning Whats up?
Starbuck Nothing, go back to sleep.
Helo Youre up early.
Starbuck You too.
Helo Yeah. Hera gets these nightmares. Wakes up crying and shaking. By the time we calm her down and get her back to sleep Im wide awake. All that crap she went through on New Caprica really left its mark on her.
Starbuck Yeah, I know just how she feels. I wish you never would have shown me that picture of that frakkin mandala. I dream about it and that bastard Leoben every Godsdamned night. I feel like Im losing my mind here.
Helo You know Kara, theres a, um, a psychiatrist aboard
Starbuck Are you kiddin me? Most shrinks are more frakked than their patients are.
Helo You know, you might want to check out that oracle camped at Dogsville.
Helo People say she interprets dreams. Sees things in them. Predicts events.
Helo Hey. You okay?
Starbuck_smiling I dont know.
Starbuck Hello?
Brenna_one_eye_showing The goddess Aurora. Take it, its yours.
Starbuck What the hell am I gonna do with this?
Brenna Youll know when the time comes. Sit.
Starbuck I, u uh...I cant sleep. I have these nightmares.
Brenna About the Cylon? The one who held you captive on New Caprica. Leoben.
Starbuck I know that he was just f...
Brenna -- He knows you better than you know yourself, Kara Thrace. He sees the truth about you. About your destiny...
Starbuck_pulling_back You dont...
Starbuck Enough of that. The only destiny I have is as a world-class frak-up.
Brenna Who hurts everyone she cares about. That was your mothers gift to you, wasnt it? You were born to a woman who believed suffering was good for the soul, so you suffered.
Brenna_and_Leoben Your life is a testament to pain. You want to believe it, because it means that youre bad luck. Youre like a cancer that needs to be removed, because you hear her voice everyday.
Leoben_in_memory And you want her to be right.
Starbuck Somebody told you what Leoben said to me?
Brenna Did you ever tell anyone about that? You learned the wrong lesson from your mother, Kara. You confused the messenger with the message.
Brenna Your mother was trying to teach you something else.
Starbuck You dont know crap about my mother.
Brenna Leoben does. He sees the patterns.
Brenna How it all fits together.
Starbuck Shut up.
Brenna Hes coming for you.
Brenna Soon.
Starbuck Shut the frak up.
Brenna_light_reflecting_on_her_face_from_the_water You cant stop him. And he will show you the way.
Anders Im on a shuttle in a half an hour. Ask for your leave. With me. You could use the down time.
Starbuck_naked_under_the_covers That sounds tempting.
Anders So do it. No strings, okay? We dont even have to talk about our relationship.
Starbuck Ill think about it.
Anders_standing Which means no. You know I hate to say this, but that whackjob Oracle, shes got a point. Your mother frakked up your head long before Leoben ever got to you.
Starbuck She was dealing with a lot, Sam. She told me that I was different from other kids, that I needed to be a warrior like her. Taught me that fear gets you killed, and anger keeps you alive.
Anders Well, she gave you plenty to be angry about, didnt she? Split your head open with a broomstick handle because you didnt make your bed?
Starbuck Did I ever tell you how I got back at her?
Anders No.
Starbuck During the first Cylon war, she was stationed with the first Marines on Medra. Stinkin jungles you wouldnt believe. Had this phobia of insects for the rest of her life, hated the damn things. So I go out and I buy a bunch of rubber bugs, and I slip into her closet, and I put em all over her shoes.
Starbuck She screamed her frakkin head off. I go in, and shes trying to smash them with her shoes, but thats just making them bounce around even more.
Anders You must have caught hell for that.
Starbuck She grabbed my hand, held it in the doorjamb and slammed the door.
Anders Oh, frak me.
Starbuck_grinning It was worth it though.
Man Catbird, Galactica. Weve had a couple of valve failures. Were restarting the unrep.
Starbuck Thats just great. Hotdog, settle in. Were gonna be out here another three hours.
Starbuck Hotdog, what the hell are you doing?
Hotdog Enjoying blue skies again. About the only thing I miss about New Caprica.
Starbuck Galactica, Starbuck. Showtime. Bogey, my right-one. In the soup at 45. Committing.
Hotdog Starbuck, Hotdog. No joy. Press!
Dualla Refueling ships, Galactica. Immediate. Cease all underway replenish ops.
Gaeta Sir, we got both Starbuck and Hotdog on dradis, but no contact on the bogey.
Tigh Were lucky we can see anything. That planets synchrotron radiation has been kicking the crap out of every dradis in the Fleet since we got here.
Tigh Looks like its also a good place for hiding a Cylon Raider.
Apollo Starbuck, Apollo. What do you got?
Starbuck Apollo, we got one turkey playing hide and seek in the clouds, no sparrows, engaging offensive.
Tigh one heavy Raider, no fighter escort.
Gaeta Still no bandits on dradis.
Tigh If that bastard jumps, the Cylons could be all over us in minutes.
Hotdog Starbuck, Hotdog. No visual on your Raider, and Im losing you. Damn it Starbuck, blind! I say again, I lost you in the clouds.
Apollo Starbuck, we have no dradis contact on your bogey. Do you have visual?
Starbuck Affirmative, hes hiding in the clouds. He just ducked into the storm system.
Apollo Do you see him? Do you see him?
Starbuck Galactica, Starbuck. Tally, weapons hot.
Starbuck Damn it. Galactica, Starbuck. Took a hit, still flying.
Apollo Starbuck, are you nominal?
Starbuck Caught me under the chin but everythings...
Gaeta Sir. Starbucks dropping close to the planetary hard deck. If she stays on course, the atmospheric density will keep her from reaching orbit again.
Tigh Then the pressure will crush her like a cheap soda can.
Apollo Starbuck, youre getting too low. Break off and climb. I repeat, Starbuck, youre getting too low, break off and climb. Starbuck? Starbuck, pull out before you dont have ? to regain orbit! Starbuck! Come in!
Apollo Starbuck, get out of there. Starbuck, come in. Can you read? Starbuck, youre getting too low. Break off and climb. Get up.
Apollo Hotdog, do you have a visual on Starbuck? Starbuck, come in. Do you read? Starbuck, pull out! That is an order. Pull out.
Starbuck Son of a bitch. Apollo, Starbuck. Wilco. Come on!
Starbuck Where did I take the hits, Chief?
Chief Im afraid nowhere, Captain.
Starbuck What? I felt the impact. Damn Viper felt like I hit a brick wall.
Chief Well, well keep checking, but so far, not a scratch.
Chief Something wrong, Captain? Captain?
Starbuck What the frak is this, Chief?
Chief Just a little hydraulic fluid, nothing to worry about.
Starbuck No? While youre in the Tool Room sucking back moonshine, Ill be up in this bird. If that gear buckles when I trap, Ill be splattered like fracking roadkill.
Chief All of these ships leak hydraulic fluid. The seals are old, we dont have enough to replace them...
Starbuck Chief, Im not interested in lazy-ass excuses, I want the seals replaced!
Apollo Hey, Kara. Hey! Come on.
Starbuck Godsdamn it, it has to be there.
Athena We watched it twice already...
Starbuck Then this isnt my gun camera film.
Athena No one else pulled trigger all day.
Helo We checked Galacticas dradis records against the ones in our Raptor. There was no paint on your Cylon at all.
Starbuck And we all know that dradis can be wonky near this planet, Karl.
Apollo Maybe the Raider jumped away before you opened fire?
Racetrack Or maybe it never existed to begin with.
Starbuck_standing It was there.
Apollo Cottle says shes physically fit, but an emotional basket case. In peace time, hed ground us all.
Apollo Yeah. Even screwed up, shes still the best Viper driver Ive got.
Apollo I dont know. I think her identity as a steely-eyed Viper jock is the only thing holding her together. So then if I ground her...
Starbuck So where do you want to go when you bite the big one? I wanna go right there, next to Kat.
Apollo A water-walking Viper jock.
Starbuck Royal pain in the ass, but a hell of a stick to have on your wing.
Apollo You can put me right here, next to Duck and Nora. Good card players. Nice way to spend eternity.
Starbuck Okay, so whoever croaks first, the other one makes sure that their picture goes in the right place. Deal?
Apollo Deal.
Starbuck So what did the old man have to say about my combat report? Starbucks finally gone off the deep end? Unfit for duty?
Apollo He said Im the CAG, its my call.
Starbuck Ah. And what do you say?
Apollo Well I say I trust your eyes over dradis any day of the week. Something could have been there, vanished in the cloud cover.
Starbuck So you dont think Im nuts?
Apollo I didnt say that. Youre a raving lunatic, as demented and deranged as the first day I met you.
Starbuck_grinning And youre a bastard.
Apollo Look, um. Stress has made us all twitchy.
Apollo After what that Cylon put you through on New Caprica youve had more than your share. Get some rest. Or you will start seeing things.
Starbuck ...Yeah.
Roslin So we have another ten hours and were done, yeah?
Starbuck Nothing but the rain.
Starbuck Wilco, Admiral. Madame President.
Roslin Captain. How is it out there?
Starbuck Hell of a view.
Starbuck So say we all.
Starbuck Um. actually, sorry. Boss, I have something for you. I thought that it would be a nice figurehead for your model ship.
Starbuck Yeah. Brings the morning star and a fair wind. A fresh start.
Starbuck Thank you.
Chief Harness assembly?
Starbuck Lap and shoulder retaining pins installed. Traction reel correct, disconnect block lock and indicator yellow flag visible.
Chief You all right, Captain?
Starbuck Uh... Give m me a minute here, Chief.
Chief Shes just sitting there.
Apollo Well, did you talk to her?
Chief You talk to her.
Starbuck Feeling sorry for me?
Apollo Kara, everyone gets rattled. Even the best.
Starbuck Im not going back out there. I dont trust myself.
Apollo Hmm. So trust me. Ill fly your wing.
Starbuck The CAG flying my number two?
Apollo_lovingly Whatever it takes.
Starbuck_looking_away How are things with you and Dee?
Apollo Uh, you know, good. No, better than good. Best theyve ever been.
Starbuck Im happy for you. Really. Its funny though, after all weve been through, we are right back where we started. Youre a CAG, and I am your hotshot problem pilot. I guess thats all well ever be now, huh? Hmm.
Apollo Starbuck, Apollo. How we doing?
Starbuck Copacetic.
Apollo Another thirty minutes and we head back to the barn.
Starbuck Damn it. Apollo, one turkey, my right-three level at ten, ducking in and out of the clouds. Engaging.
Apollo Starbuck, Apollo. No joy.
Dualla Starbuck, Galactica. No dradis contact on your Cylon.
Starbuck Apollo, Starbuck. Weapons hot. Committing. This time Im gonna drag him back and dump his sorry ass on the hangar deck.
Apollo Starbuck, Apollo. Ive lost you on dradis. Im blind. Starbuck, Apollo. I repeat, I got no sign of you or the Raider. Starbuck, report! Starbuck, report!
Apollo This is Apollo. Do you read me? Starbuck, report! Starbuck!
Apollo Starbuck, I have zero visibility. Starbuck, are you out there? Kara!
Radio Good morning, Delphi. Got another hot one in store for you today! Time to head for the beach. Weatherman says we can expect...
Leoben_switching_it_off Rise and shine.
Leoben We have a big day ahead of us. Come on.
Starbuck Im not here. Im out cold on a Cylon ship, and you drugged me to play your frakkin mind games...
Leoben No games, Kara. Its about your destiny.
Starbuck I write my own destiny.
Leoben I didnt paint that symbol, Kara. You did.
Leoben In the clouds, didnt you? You didnt tell anyone else. Because youre drawn to it. You feel its pull. You want to fly into it. You want to cross over but youre afraid.
Starbuck Afraid of what, a frakkin cloud?
Leoben Of the unknown. Death. All of your high wire stunts have been an act. Time after time you skip to the edge of the abyss, then dance away again. But you never rely conquered your fear. Youve been afraid ever since that day.
Starbuck What day?
Leoben All of this has happened before, and will happen again.
Socrata Its open.
Starbuck Hello, momma.
Leoben Its hard to believe its only six years ago. You look so much younger.
Starbuck I was.
Socrata So, you really did it. First person in the family to become an officer.
Starbuck What is the world coming to?
Socrata Kara, they tell me that youre the best natural pilot theyve ever seen.
Starbuck The first time I got in that cockpit, I just ... felt like I belonged.
Socrata All that natural ability, and still you only graduated sixteenth in your class.
Starbuck Sixteenth out of 117 cadets, momma.
Socrata Why are you proud of that? You should have been number one. They tell me that you have left a trail of demerits from here to Aerelon. Youre undisciplined, you have no respect for authority.
Starbuck Thats none of your business anymore.
Socrata You have a gift, Kara. Ive always known that, here in my gut, and I am not going to let you piss that away? Youre special, dont you understand that?
Starbuck No, Im not. Would you let go of that stupid dream of yours? Look, I am sorry as hell that you never made officer. And all you have to show for a life of dedication is this crappy apartment and that frakkin medal on the wall. But I will not make up for it all. I cant.
Socrata_lighting_a_cigarette Yeah, because youre a quitter. You always have been.
Starbuck You went to an oncologist?
Socrata Hey, put that down! Dont touch that!
Starbuck What are you gonna do about this?
Socrata Nothing. Theres nothing to do, its metastasized. Game is over.
Starbuck Im sorry, momma.
Starbuck Im sorry, momma...
Socrata -- I dont want your pity!
Starbuck You havent got it.
Socrata You wanna feel sorry for someone? Feel sorry for yourself. Youll have to find another way to motivate your ass, Im not gonna be around to do it any longer. Oh, dont tell me youre gonna cry about it now.
Starbuck_freaking_out You know, I dont need this, Im ... Im gonna walk out that door and you can look at it every frakkin miserable day you have left, and know that I am never gonna come back through it again.
Socrata Kara! Kara!
Leoben You kept running didnt you? For blocks.
Leoben She waited here. Five weeks, hoping youd come back. She died alone.
Starbuck I was afraid, I couldnt watch.
Leoben Its not too late. Shes waiting, still.
Starbuck_sitting Momma.
Socrata_softly You came back.
Starbuck I cant believe you kept all this.
Socrata Everything. Always.
Starbuck Momma. Somethings about to happen. You know that thing that you were trying to prepare me for? I dont know if I can do it.
Socrata Oh, yes you can. You can.
Starbuck How can you be sure?
Socrata Youre my daughter.
Leoben See, theres nothing so terrible about death. When you finally face it, its beautiful. Youre free now. To become who you really are.
Starbuck_realizing Youre not Leoben.
Leoben_smiling Never said I was. Im here to prepare you to pass through the next door. To discover what hovers in the space between life and death.
Apollo Starbuck, Apollo. Lost you on dradis. I say again, Ive lost you. Ill try and fix on you. Kara!
Starbuck_hand_on_the_eject_lever Lee. Im not afraid anymore.
Apollo Say again?
Starbuck_hand_in_her_mothers Im not afraid anymore.
Tigh She should be afraid. Shes damn close to the hard deck.
Helo Apollos not far behind, the pressure will crush em both.
Gaeta 90 seconds to hard deck.
Apollo All right, Kara, listen to me. Forget the damn toaster. Climb now or youre dead.
Apollo Godsdamn it, Kara, pull up now. We can still pull out of this, we havent gone past the point of no return. Pull up!
Gaeta Sixty seconds to hard deck.Dee, vector red section to Apollos last known, set alert Vipers to ready one.
Dualla_nodding Hotdog, Hex, divert to 715...
Apollo Gods damn it, where are you?
Apollo Visual. Visual. Okay. Kara, Im coming to get you.
Starbuck Lee... Ill see you on the other side.
Apollo Kara, please, listen to me! Come back.
Starbuck Just let me go.
Apollo Godsdamn it, Kara! You come back! Come back!
Starbuck Its okay. Just let me go. Theyre waiting for me.
Apollo No! No!
Apollo Negative, she ... went in. She went in.
Apollo No, Dad, its no use. Her ships in pieces. Her ships in pieces. No chute. We lost her.
