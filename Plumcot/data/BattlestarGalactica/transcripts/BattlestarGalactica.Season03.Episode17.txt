captain_kara_thrace Previously, on Battlestar Galactica...
admiral_william_adama Leobens a very clever Cylon. Hes gonna try to get into your head.
leoben_conoy We havent been properly I introduced. Im Leoben.
president_laura_roslin I want this Cylon interrogated.
captain_kara_thrace Do it.
leoben_conoy This is has happened before, and all of it will happen again. Your destinys already been written.
Simon#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode17 I saw your x-rays. A lot of old fractures from childhood... Children of abusive parents often fear passing along that abuse to their own children.
captain_kara_thrace Get out!
leoben_conoy Im trying to help you, Kara. I only want you see the truth of your life. The reason why you suffered, the reason why youve struggled for so long.
samuel_anders Theres something to what Leoben said about you and a special destiny?
captain_kara_thrace Kara Thrace and her Special Destiny? That sounds more like a bad cover band, Sam.
captain_karl_agathon Curious about something. Those paintings you did your apartment on Caprica... This? Was on the temple. Whered you get the idea to paint yours?
captain_kara_thrace That was just something Ive been doodlin since I was a kid, I liked the pattern.
captain_karl_agathon Well, they built the temple 4,000 years ago.
captain_karl_agathon What is it?
captain_kara_thrace Just something Leoben said once. That I had a destiny, that it had already been written.
lt_brendan_constanza Whats up?
captain_kara_thrace Nothing, go back to sleep.
captain_karl_agathon Youre up early.
captain_kara_thrace You too.
captain_karl_agathon Yeah. Hera gets these nightmares. Wakes up crying and shaking. By the time we calm her down and get her back to sleep Im wide awake. All that crap she went through on New Caprica really left its mark on her.
captain_kara_thrace Yeah, I know just how she feels. I wish you never would have shown me that picture of that frakkin mandala. I dream about it and that bastard Leoben every Godsdamned night. I feel like Im losing my mind here.
captain_karl_agathon You know Kara, theres a, um, a psychiatrist aboard
captain_kara_thrace Are you kiddin me? Most shrinks are more frakked than their patients are.
captain_karl_agathon You know, you might want to check out that oracle camped at Dogsville.
captain_karl_agathon People say she interprets dreams. Sees things in them. Predicts events.
captain_karl_agathon Hey. You okay?
captain_kara_thrace I dont know.
captain_kara_thrace Hello?
oracle_yolanda_brenn The goddess Aurora. Take it, its yours.
captain_kara_thrace What the hell am I gonna do with this?
oracle_yolanda_brenn Youll know when the time comes. Sit.
captain_kara_thrace I, u uh...I cant sleep. I have these nightmares.
oracle_yolanda_brenn About the Cylon? The one who held you captive on New Caprica. Leoben.
captain_kara_thrace I know that he was just f...
oracle_yolanda_brenn -- He knows you better than you know yourself, Kara Thrace. He sees the truth about you. About your destiny...
captain_kara_thrace You dont...
captain_kara_thrace Enough of that. The only destiny I have is as a world-class frak-up.
oracle_yolanda_brenn Who hurts everyone she cares about. That was your mothers gift to you, wasnt it? You were born to a woman who believed suffering was good for the soul, so you suffered.
Brenna_and_Leoben#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode17 Your life is a testament to pain. You want to believe it, because it means that youre bad luck. Youre like a cancer that needs to be removed, because you hear her voice everyday.
leoben_conoy And you want her to be right.
captain_kara_thrace Somebody told you what Leoben said to me?
oracle_yolanda_brenn Did you ever tell anyone about that? You learned the wrong lesson from your mother, Kara. You confused the messenger with the message.
oracle_yolanda_brenn Your mother was trying to teach you something else.
captain_kara_thrace You dont know crap about my mother.
oracle_yolanda_brenn Leoben does. He sees the patterns.
oracle_yolanda_brenn How it all fits together.
captain_kara_thrace Shut up.
oracle_yolanda_brenn Hes coming for you.
oracle_yolanda_brenn Soon.
captain_kara_thrace Shut the frak up.
oracle_yolanda_brenn You cant stop him. And he will show you the way.
samuel_anders Im on a shuttle in a half an hour. Ask for your leave. With me. You could use the down time.
captain_kara_thrace That sounds tempting.
samuel_anders So do it. No strings, okay? We dont even have to talk about our relationship.
captain_kara_thrace Ill think about it.
samuel_anders Which means no. You know I hate to say this, but that whackjob Oracle, shes got a point. Your mother frakked up your head long before Leoben ever got to you.
captain_kara_thrace She was dealing with a lot, Sam. She told me that I was different from other kids, that I needed to be a warrior like her. Taught me that fear gets you killed, and anger keeps you alive.
samuel_anders Well, she gave you plenty to be angry about, didnt she? Split your head open with a broomstick handle because you didnt make your bed?
captain_kara_thrace Did I ever tell you how I got back at her?
samuel_anders No.
captain_kara_thrace During the first Cylon war, she was stationed with the first Marines on Medra. Stinkin jungles you wouldnt believe. Had this phobia of insects for the rest of her life, hated the damn things. So I go out and I buy a bunch of rubber bugs, and I slip into her closet, and I put em all over her shoes.
captain_kara_thrace She screamed her frakkin head off. I go in, and shes trying to smash them with her shoes, but thats just making them bounce around even more.
samuel_anders You must have caught hell for that.
captain_kara_thrace She grabbed my hand, held it in the doorjamb and slammed the door.
samuel_anders Oh, frak me.
captain_kara_thrace It was worth it though.
Man#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode17 Catbird, Galactica. Weve had a couple of valve failures. Were restarting the unrep.
captain_kara_thrace Thats just great. Hotdog, settle in. Were gonna be out here another three hours.
captain_kara_thrace Hotdog, what the hell are you doing?
lt_brendan_constanza Enjoying blue skies again. About the only thing I miss about New Caprica.
captain_kara_thrace Galactica, Starbuck. Showtime. Bogey, my right-one. In the soup at 45. Committing.
lt_brendan_constanza Starbuck, Hotdog. No joy. Press!
officer_anastasia_dualla Refueling ships, Galactica. Immediate. Cease all underway replenish ops.
lt_felix_gaeta Sir, we got both Starbuck and Hotdog on dradis, but no contact on the bogey.
colonel_saul_tigh Were lucky we can see anything. That planets synchrotron radiation has been kicking the crap out of every dradis in the Fleet since we got here.
colonel_saul_tigh Looks like its also a good place for hiding a Cylon Raider.
cpt_lee_adama Starbuck, Apollo. What do you got?
captain_kara_thrace Apollo, we got one turkey playing hide and seek in the clouds, no sparrows, engaging offensive.
colonel_saul_tigh one heavy Raider, no fighter escort.
lt_felix_gaeta Still no bandits on dradis.
colonel_saul_tigh If that bastard jumps, the Cylons could be all over us in minutes.
lt_brendan_constanza Starbuck, Hotdog. No visual on your Raider, and Im losing you. Damn it Starbuck, blind! I say again, I lost you in the clouds.
cpt_lee_adama Starbuck, we have no dradis contact on your bogey. Do you have visual?
captain_kara_thrace Affirmative, hes hiding in the clouds. He just ducked into the storm system.
cpt_lee_adama Do you see him? Do you see him?
captain_kara_thrace Galactica, Starbuck. Tally, weapons hot.
captain_kara_thrace Damn it. Galactica, Starbuck. Took a hit, still flying.
cpt_lee_adama Starbuck, are you nominal?
captain_kara_thrace Caught me under the chin but everythings...
lt_felix_gaeta Sir. Starbucks dropping close to the planetary hard deck. If she stays on course, the atmospheric density will keep her from reaching orbit again.
colonel_saul_tigh Then the pressure will crush her like a cheap soda can.
cpt_lee_adama Starbuck, youre getting too low. Break off and climb. I repeat, Starbuck, youre getting too low, break off and climb. Starbuck? Starbuck, pull out before you dont have ? to regain orbit! Starbuck! Come in!
cpt_lee_adama Starbuck, get out of there. Starbuck, come in. Can you read? Starbuck, youre getting too low. Break off and climb. Get up.
cpt_lee_adama Hotdog, do you have a visual on Starbuck? Starbuck, come in. Do you read? Starbuck, pull out! That is an order. Pull out.
captain_kara_thrace Son of a bitch. Apollo, Starbuck. Wilco. Come on!
captain_kara_thrace Where did I take the hits, Chief?
chief_galen_tyrol Im afraid nowhere, Captain.
captain_kara_thrace What? I felt the impact. Damn Viper felt like I hit a brick wall.
chief_galen_tyrol Well, well keep checking, but so far, not a scratch.
chief_galen_tyrol Something wrong, Captain? Captain?
captain_kara_thrace What the frak is this, Chief?
chief_galen_tyrol Just a little hydraulic fluid, nothing to worry about.
captain_kara_thrace No? While youre in the Tool Room sucking back moonshine, Ill be up in this bird. If that gear buckles when I trap, Ill be splattered like fracking roadkill.
chief_galen_tyrol All of these ships leak hydraulic fluid. The seals are old, we dont have enough to replace them...
captain_kara_thrace Chief, Im not interested in lazy-ass excuses, I want the seals replaced!
cpt_lee_adama Hey, Kara. Hey! Come on.
captain_kara_thrace Godsdamn it, it has to be there.
lt_sharon_valerii We watched it twice already...
captain_kara_thrace Then this isnt my gun camera film.
lt_sharon_valerii No one else pulled trigger all day.
captain_karl_agathon We checked Galacticas dradis records against the ones in our Raptor. There was no paint on your Cylon at all.
captain_kara_thrace And we all know that dradis can be wonky near this planet, Karl.
cpt_lee_adama Maybe the Raider jumped away before you opened fire?
racetrack Or maybe it never existed to begin with.
captain_kara_thrace It was there.
cpt_lee_adama Cottle says shes physically fit, but an emotional basket case. In peace time, hed ground us all.
cpt_lee_adama Yeah. Even screwed up, shes still the best Viper driver Ive got.
cpt_lee_adama I dont know. I think her identity as a steely-eyed Viper jock is the only thing holding her together. So then if I ground her...
captain_kara_thrace So where do you want to go when you bite the big one? I wanna go right there, next to Kat.
cpt_lee_adama A water-walking Viper jock.
captain_kara_thrace Royal pain in the ass, but a hell of a stick to have on your wing.
cpt_lee_adama You can put me right here, next to Duck and Nora. Good card players. Nice way to spend eternity.
captain_kara_thrace Okay, so whoever croaks first, the other one makes sure that their picture goes in the right place. Deal?
cpt_lee_adama Deal.
captain_kara_thrace So what did the old man have to say about my combat report? Starbucks finally gone off the deep end? Unfit for duty?
cpt_lee_adama He said Im the CAG, its my call.
captain_kara_thrace Ah. And what do you say?
cpt_lee_adama Well I say I trust your eyes over dradis any day of the week. Something could have been there, vanished in the cloud cover.
captain_kara_thrace So you dont think Im nuts?
cpt_lee_adama I didnt say that. Youre a raving lunatic, as demented and deranged as the first day I met you.
captain_kara_thrace And youre a bastard.
cpt_lee_adama Look, um. Stress has made us all twitchy.
cpt_lee_adama After what that Cylon put you through on New Caprica youve had more than your share. Get some rest. Or you will start seeing things.
captain_kara_thrace ...Yeah.
president_laura_roslin So we have another ten hours and were done, yeah?
captain_kara_thrace Nothing but the rain.
captain_kara_thrace Wilco, Admiral. Madame President.
president_laura_roslin Captain. How is it out there?
captain_kara_thrace Hell of a view.
captain_kara_thrace So say we all.
captain_kara_thrace Um. actually, sorry. Boss, I have something for you. I thought that it would be a nice figurehead for your model ship.
captain_kara_thrace Yeah. Brings the morning star and a fair wind. A fresh start.
captain_kara_thrace Thank you.
chief_galen_tyrol Harness assembly?
captain_kara_thrace Lap and shoulder retaining pins installed. Traction reel correct, disconnect block lock and indicator yellow flag visible.
chief_galen_tyrol You all right, Captain?
captain_kara_thrace Uh... Give m me a minute here, Chief.
chief_galen_tyrol Shes just sitting there.
cpt_lee_adama Well, did you talk to her?
chief_galen_tyrol You talk to her.
captain_kara_thrace Feeling sorry for me?
cpt_lee_adama Kara, everyone gets rattled. Even the best.
captain_kara_thrace Im not going back out there. I dont trust myself.
cpt_lee_adama Hmm. So trust me. Ill fly your wing.
captain_kara_thrace The CAG flying my number two?
cpt_lee_adama Whatever it takes.
captain_kara_thrace How are things with you and Dee?
cpt_lee_adama Uh, you know, good. No, better than good. Best theyve ever been.
captain_kara_thrace Im happy for you. Really. Its funny though, after all weve been through, we are right back where we started. Youre a CAG, and I am your hotshot problem pilot. I guess thats all well ever be now, huh? Hmm.
cpt_lee_adama Starbuck, Apollo. How we doing?
captain_kara_thrace Copacetic.
cpt_lee_adama Another thirty minutes and we head back to the barn.
captain_kara_thrace Damn it. Apollo, one turkey, my right-three level at ten, ducking in and out of the clouds. Engaging.
cpt_lee_adama Starbuck, Apollo. No joy.
officer_anastasia_dualla Starbuck, Galactica. No dradis contact on your Cylon.
captain_kara_thrace Apollo, Starbuck. Weapons hot. Committing. This time Im gonna drag him back and dump his sorry ass on the hangar deck.
cpt_lee_adama Starbuck, Apollo. Ive lost you on dradis. Im blind. Starbuck, Apollo. I repeat, I got no sign of you or the Raider. Starbuck, report! Starbuck, report!
cpt_lee_adama This is Apollo. Do you read me? Starbuck, report! Starbuck!
cpt_lee_adama Starbuck, I have zero visibility. Starbuck, are you out there? Kara!
Radio#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode17 Good morning, Delphi. Got another hot one in store for you today! Time to head for the beach. Weatherman says we can expect...
leoben_conoy Rise and shine.
leoben_conoy We have a big day ahead of us. Come on.
captain_kara_thrace Im not here. Im out cold on a Cylon ship, and you drugged me to play your frakkin mind games...
leoben_conoy No games, Kara. Its about your destiny.
captain_kara_thrace I write my own destiny.
leoben_conoy I didnt paint that symbol, Kara. You did.
leoben_conoy In the clouds, didnt you? You didnt tell anyone else. Because youre drawn to it. You feel its pull. You want to fly into it. You want to cross over but youre afraid.
captain_kara_thrace Afraid of what, a frakkin cloud?
leoben_conoy Of the unknown. Death. All of your high wire stunts have been an act. Time after time you skip to the edge of the abyss, then dance away again. But you never rely conquered your fear. Youve been afraid ever since that day.
captain_kara_thrace What day?
leoben_conoy All of this has happened before, and will happen again.
socrata_thrace Its open.
captain_kara_thrace Hello, momma.
leoben_conoy Its hard to believe its only six years ago. You look so much younger.
captain_kara_thrace I was.
socrata_thrace So, you really did it. First person in the family to become an officer.
captain_kara_thrace What is the world coming to?
socrata_thrace Kara, they tell me that youre the best natural pilot theyve ever seen.
captain_kara_thrace The first time I got in that cockpit, I just ... felt like I belonged.
socrata_thrace All that natural ability, and still you only graduated sixteenth in your class.
captain_kara_thrace Sixteenth out of 117 cadets, momma.
socrata_thrace Why are you proud of that? You should have been number one. They tell me that you have left a trail of demerits from here to Aerelon. Youre undisciplined, you have no respect for authority.
captain_kara_thrace Thats none of your business anymore.
socrata_thrace You have a gift, Kara. Ive always known that, here in my gut, and I am not going to let you piss that away? Youre special, dont you understand that?
captain_kara_thrace No, Im not. Would you let go of that stupid dream of yours? Look, I am sorry as hell that you never made officer. And all you have to show for a life of dedication is this crappy apartment and that frakkin medal on the wall. But I will not make up for it all. I cant.
socrata_thrace Yeah, because youre a quitter. You always have been.
captain_kara_thrace You went to an oncologist?
socrata_thrace Hey, put that down! Dont touch that!
captain_kara_thrace What are you gonna do about this?
socrata_thrace Nothing. Theres nothing to do, its metastasized. Game is over.
captain_kara_thrace Im sorry, momma.
captain_kara_thrace Im sorry, momma...
socrata_thrace -- I dont want your pity!
captain_kara_thrace You havent got it.
socrata_thrace You wanna feel sorry for someone? Feel sorry for yourself. Youll have to find another way to motivate your ass, Im not gonna be around to do it any longer. Oh, dont tell me youre gonna cry about it now.
captain_kara_thrace You know, I dont need this, Im ... Im gonna walk out that door and you can look at it every frakkin miserable day you have left, and know that I am never gonna come back through it again.
socrata_thrace Kara! Kara!
leoben_conoy You kept running didnt you? For blocks.
leoben_conoy She waited here. Five weeks, hoping youd come back. She died alone.
captain_kara_thrace I was afraid, I couldnt watch.
leoben_conoy Its not too late. Shes waiting, still.
captain_kara_thrace Momma.
socrata_thrace You came back.
captain_kara_thrace I cant believe you kept all this.
socrata_thrace Everything. Always.
captain_kara_thrace Momma. Somethings about to happen. You know that thing that you were trying to prepare me for? I dont know if I can do it.
socrata_thrace Oh, yes you can. You can.
captain_kara_thrace How can you be sure?
socrata_thrace Youre my daughter.
leoben_conoy See, theres nothing so terrible about death. When you finally face it, its beautiful. Youre free now. To become who you really are.
captain_kara_thrace Youre not Leoben.
leoben_conoy Never said I was. Im here to prepare you to pass through the next door. To discover what hovers in the space between life and death.
cpt_lee_adama Starbuck, Apollo. Lost you on dradis. I say again, Ive lost you. Ill try and fix on you. Kara!
captain_kara_thrace Lee. Im not afraid anymore.
cpt_lee_adama Say again?
captain_kara_thrace Im not afraid anymore.
colonel_saul_tigh She should be afraid. Shes damn close to the hard deck.
captain_karl_agathon Apollos not far behind, the pressure will crush em both.
lt_felix_gaeta 90 seconds to hard deck.
cpt_lee_adama All right, Kara, listen to me. Forget the damn toaster. Climb now or youre dead.
cpt_lee_adama Godsdamn it, Kara, pull up now. We can still pull out of this, we havent gone past the point of no return. Pull up!
lt_felix_gaeta Sixty seconds to hard deck.Dee, vector red section to Apollos last known, set alert Vipers to ready one.
officer_anastasia_dualla Hotdog, Hex, divert to 715...
cpt_lee_adama Gods damn it, where are you?
cpt_lee_adama Visual. Visual. Okay. Kara, Im coming to get you.
captain_kara_thrace Lee... Ill see you on the other side.
cpt_lee_adama Kara, please, listen to me! Come back.
captain_kara_thrace Just let me go.
cpt_lee_adama Godsdamn it, Kara! You come back! Come back!
captain_kara_thrace Its okay. Just let me go. Theyre waiting for me.
cpt_lee_adama No! No!
cpt_lee_adama Negative, she ... went in. She went in.
cpt_lee_adama No, Dad, its no use. Her ships in pieces. Her ships in pieces. No chute. We lost her.
