Roslin Previously on Battlestar Galactica...
Roslin Why dont you do yourself a favor? Hand over your book. My Triumphs, My Mistakes, by Gaius Baltar.
Baltar So the people are reading it, and now youre sorry.
Zarek Baltar will get his trial. And this is what youll get: a hurricane. You will have sectarian violence, you will have assassination attempts, you will have civil unrest on a scale weve never seen...
Adama President wants to take the fast track on Baltars trial. Shes looking for someone to take charge of the preliminaries, help cobble together the legal framework. She wants me to assign you.
Apollo These were my grandfathers law books.
Dualla Its from your father.
Apollo Starbuck,
Apollo No! No!
Adama Lee, were sending in the search and rescue birds right now. Well find her.
Apollo No, Dad, its no use. Her ships in pieces... We lost her.
Roslin Heres every captain from every ship in the fleet...
Roslin Captain Elias Meeker, Gideon.
Roslin And the last name for the tribunal is...
Adama Yeah. Yeah, I see the resemblance.
Anders one more for heads, watch... Heads! Did you see that? Four in a row. Its a frakkin miracle. Watch this, one more time. Its gonna be -- watch! -- heads! Every time. You see that? Its heads!
Man Hey, why dont you come down from there?
Anders Im just fine right here, man.
Racetrack Major?
Apollo Yeah.
Anders Heads! You see that? My girls too lucky to check out.
Apollo Hey, Sam.
Anders Lee. Apollo.
Apollo Just stay there, buddy. Youre flying. Lets just get down and get some sleep. Come on.
Anders I -- Im fine, Im just gonna sit down. Ow!
Apollo You all right?
Anders She wasnt supposed to...
Apollo Come on, Sam.
Anders No, I gotta go.
Apollo Sam! Frak! Frak. Is he okay?
Anders_groaning Ah... I think I fell.
Apollo Sam. Sam?
Anders_gasping Shes still alive, right?
Apollo No, shes gone, Sam. Shes gone.
Anders I know.
Apollo Yeah.
Hotdog_on_wireless LSO, Viper 6. Request long approach.
Kelly Viper 6, LSO. Approved.
Tigh I never thought Id miss all Starbucks yakking.
Gaeta Yes, sir.
Tigh Your honor. You havent heard? Where have you been? They just announced it, you won the lottery. You now own exactly one-fifth of Baltars skinny ass. Youre one of five captains picked to serve on the judges tribunal.
Adama Hmm.
Racetrack Ugh, here he comes. Frak. What a waste of my time and energy, flying Baltars lawyer back and forth from Zephyr.
Skulls Yeah, tell me about it.
Racetrack Wanna know what the worst part is? He sits back there and tries to whisper in my ear when he talks. Ive got a helmet.
Hughes_whispering Sorry.
Cally_helping_him_aboard Mr. Hughes?
Racetrack He takes his shoes off in my Raptor again, I might have to kill him.
Skulls Client. Everybody knows hes guilty. He gave the Cylons our location. Why even give the son of a bitch a trial?
Cally Because hes entitled. Even him. Its called justice.
Skulls Yeah, right. See, Baltar dead, Starbuck alive. Thatd be justice.
PA Flight systems check...
Racetrack Initiating.
Skulls Theres no justice. And drunk as he was.
Skulls Racetrack!
Athena Racetrack, are you okay? Medic! Yeah, yeah, I got him, I got him. Okay.
Skulls Is he okay?
Reporters Madame President! Madame President!
Man How do you intend to replace Gaius Baltars defense attorney? Will that be done by lottery as well?
Roslin Were confident well replace him shortly. There are a number of candidates, were working our way down the list. Next.
Reporters Madame President! Madame President!
Roslin Karen.
Karen Taken in the context of this explosion, which obviously was no accident, do you really think that its in the best interest of the Fleet to proceed with this trial?
Roslin This administration will never bow to terrorism.
Reporters Madame President! Madame President!
Roslin Wait, you know, let me say something here to all of you. Let me get this clear, all right? As long as I am President, this administration will not allow terrorism to alter the framework of our legal system. We will proceed with the trial, rigorously. Thank you, all of you.
Reporters one more question! Madame President!
Apollo Helo, I need you to set up a dradis picket with blue squadron in sector seven.
Helo Uh, excuse me, sir. You mean sector nine, right?
Apollo Uh... Right. Right, nine. Um, yeah, we scrubbed eight on the last picket. Its been so quiet one picket just flows into the next. Okay, uh... 81 carom, 22 degrees. Keep your ears open. Any Cylon contact, just shut down and bug out. Red Squadron, youll be riding first CAP with me. And uh, from here on, double shifts.
Apollo Athena, Im going to need you exclusively on shuttle runs.
Racetrack Yeah, dont forget to check under your back seat.
Apollo Hey, hey, you got lucky, Starbuck. If I were you, I would seriously consider buying a...
Apollo ...Racetrack, Im sorry.
Apollo Dismissed. dismissed.
Roslin Well, its so comforting to know that youre not afraid. Youre not afraid to represent the most hated man alive. The question is why?
Lampkin For the fame. The glory.
Adama You worked in the public litigation office on Caprica. You think you have the qualifications to handle a case of this magnitude?
Lampkin I was born for this. That, and the fact that I have a pulse.
Lampkin Lance belonged to my wife. Dont worry, he doesnt scratch or bite like she did. If its of any comfort, I despise him as much as you do having to hire me. So... there it is. Shall we get started?
Adama Im gonna ? you to handle the security detail on the new attorney.
Apollo Me. So thats it, youre grounding me.
Adama If whoever set that charge is one of our own, then youre the only one I can trust.
Apollo You know, just say it: youre pulling me.
Adama Keeping Lampkin alive is an important job. I need your help.
Apollo Dad, Im fine.
Adama No, youre not.
Apollo_smiling Why?
Adama Because Im not.
Apollo_whiny Yeah, well then maybe you should take a rest.
Adama Helo will be stepping in as CAG. I want you on this ship. Not up there, not until you can...work this out.
Apollo Right. I understand. Work it out. Okay.
Apollo Ill be handling security for you. Where do you want your bags? Youll have two Marines stationed outside the door. Ms. Cassidy, the prosecuting attorney, shes just down the hall. Theres a head, showers that way. Sorry, co-ed. Now, if theres anything else?
Lampkin Id like to see my client.
Apollo Now?
Lampkin Pilot.
Apollo Yeah.
Lampkin King of the pilots. We could stand around here and discuss why you got stuck with me, if you want.
Apollo Ill take you to his cell.
Lampkin No, no not there. Half the ships probably listening in.
Apollo Fine, whatever, have an interrogation room.
Lampkin Interrogation rooms give me stage fright.
Apollo I cant bring him here.
Lampkin I was thinking your quarters.
Apollo What?
Lampkin Yeah, before it gets wired for sound like this place probably is. Whats the problem? Forgot to make your bed?
Apollo Look, I dont care where you see him, I just cant leave you alone.
Lampkin Major. It is Major, isnt it? I have the right to consult with my client in private, without anybody eavesdropping or looking in. Whoever cares the most, wins. Says so in there.
Apollo So?
Lampkin I wanna see my client, you dont care. I win. You know, you look like him.
Apollo You knew my grandfather?
Lampkin Hated his guts. He taught me everything I know.
Baltar_to_Apollo What are you doing here, anyway?
Lampkin You can speak freely. He signed confidentiality papers.
Baltar Look, this whole charades pathetic. Pathetic! Security? Securitys already toasting my other attorneys, uh, untimely demise. About one thing that bloke ever did, apart from napping, was, you know, manage to... smuggle out my papers. Papers. Do you have any papers?
Baltar_beginning_to_write Thank you. The nature of modern life is... obsession. So tell me, do you honestly think that Im gonna get a fair trial?
Lampkin Doubtful.
Baltar Yes.
Lampkin But you havent exactly been helping yourself, now, have you?
Baltar You object to my writing.
Lampkin on the contrary, keep it coming. This new manifesto of yours shows a great change in you. This little uh ... operating manual of yours, well... Keeps them all guessing.
Baltar Right, okay. Okay. Caprica Six. Im worried about her. Shes the key. They can use her to completely destroy me. We need to get to her. We need to know what shes thinking. We need to... I mean, talk to her. Tell her, uh... tell her that I love her very much. And Im thinking about her a lot.
Lampkin I can sense that, yes.
Baltar_darting_glances_at_Lee You need to, you need to find out where were all ... Where were all standing.
Lampkin To listen requires a voice. For what needs to known, requires us to ask. My Triumphs, My Mistakes, by Gaius Baltar.
Baltar_with_a_giant_smile But you say it very well.
Lampkin Ive done the reading. once those papers arrive, I suggest you do yours.
Lampkin Fly me to Colonial one.
Apollo Me?
Lampkin Yeah, youre a pilot, arent you?
Apollo You dont understand, you cant just jump in a Raptor. These are things have to be coordinated.
Lampkin Where would you rather be, Major? Here, as the parade float for the bereaved?
Apollo What are you talking about?
Lampkin Everybody looking at you like youre bleeding out of your side.
Apollo You wanna see some real blood? Keep going.
Lampkin_looking_over_his_glasses Oh, there is someone home. Look, I need those files you come with me, they might just give them to me. I wait, theyre gonna discover that Baltars pregnant before I get them. What is your job, anyway? Keep me alive, or keep me from doing mine?
Kelly Sorry, sir, you know your status. Youre to remain shipside. Those are the Admirals orders.
Lampkin Father factor.
Apollo Come on, Kelly. Give me a break, Im along for the ride.
Kelly Dont do this to me, all right? Im in enough dung already.
Apollo_in_the_cockpit All right.
Chief All right, lets get the bird a tow!
Chief Ho, hold ... Hold up, open the door, open the door! What the frak was that thing? Did you see that? What? What the... I think it was a cat!
Lampkin Thats my cat!
Chief Theres a frakkin cat in there! Who the hell let a cat in here? Hes t the other side, push him over here. There it is! Its over there! Its over there! There it is! Kitty, kitty, kitty! No, no, come here! Come here, here, come here... Bomb. Bomb! Everybody out!
Adama What the hell were you doing out there? I gave you an order to do a job.
Apollo Excuse me, I was doing my job.
Adama Yeah, being led around by the nose? This bastard yanked your chain, and you jump?
Apollo He wanted files from Colonial one.
Adama It was the middle of the night.
Apollo You assigned me to security.
Adama Yeah, and there was a bomb on that ship, and you missed it. Security. I gave you explicit orders.
Apollo Athena was piloting.
Adama You couldve died. Plain and simple. Youre a soldier. Live like one. Start acting like one. Apollo: Shes been gone two weeks. I didnt realize the clock was running.
Adama Stop.
Apollo No, Im sorry, because maybe were just built differently.
Adama You stop. Dont you dare quantify my loss.
Apollo You have no idea. You have no frakking idea!
Adama What, you think yours is deeper?
Apollo Well.
Adama Yours is greater? In two weeks, theres going to be a trial, and Im going to do what I was chosen to do, and so are you. You build a frakkin nest around that man, and you protect his ass.
Chief Frakker meant business this time. That thing had gone off, wed be picking up Raptor and people parts with tweezers.
Kelly Every day I wave jocks out there. A lot of them are my friends. People I care for and love. Its hard enough watching them die in battle, but rickshawing Baltars frakkin attorney around? Frak that.
Cally I believe that the Cylons want us to destroy ourselves and this is how theyre doing it.
Cally By planting bombs, making suspicious of each other. You know whats funny? By the time the Cylons catch up with us they wont even have to attack. Theyll just clean up the mess we made. I think theyre here.
Athena I think youre wrong.
Cally Okay, all I know is I kissed Nicky this morning and it couldve been the last time.
Chief Cally, thats enough.
Cally What, I kissed you too! Some of us dont get a second chance. Or a third.
Chief Im going to the Admiral.
Apollo All right, take a good look at this room. Every time you leave, check it. If anything changes, dont touch it. Uh, a book moves, shoes in the wrong place, something smells different, you get the frak out. Someone knocks, dont answer the door. Dont open the door! Look, you have to do what I say.
Lampkin If they wanna kill me, theyll find a way. Now, who do I have to bribe to see the Cylon woman?
Baltar_whispering The nature of modern life is obsession...
Roslin Damn, I cant find my glasses. Its like theyve got feet. Um, the Six. Yes, okay. Lampkin can interview Six immediately. As long as its conducted under the same conditions accorded to the chief prosecutor, all right?
Adama Meaning in the interrogation room. Not where you sleep.
Apollo But since youve been selected to serve on the tribunal, Im assuming that you wont be present at those interviews in the interest of fairness.
Roslin Major has a point, Bill.
Adama The Majors mistaken. I monitored the chief prosecutors interview. Therefore, same conditions apply. In the interest of fairness.
Apollo Mr. Lampkin is still entitled to those documents that he requested from Colonial one.
Tory Yes, right, I apologize. Weve had trouble locating the files. Well have them delivered to you on the next run?
Roslin Im sorry, Major, well get them right away. Thank you.
Apollo Thank you.
Lampkin I understand that you had a romantic relationship with my client.
Caprica Gaius Baltar is a brilliant, gifted human being. In the time Ive known him, hes made a sport out of mendacity and deception. He was narcissistic, self-centered, feckless, and vain. Im the one who should have stabbed him.
Roslin Things are looking up.
Lampkin Love. Precocious evolutionary move, fashioning Cylons to be capable of experiencing it. I dont know if it was engineered as a tactical imperative, but... Its not for the faint-hearted, is it?
Caprica No, its not.
Lampkin Maybe you shouldve been nicer to your mechanic. Well. Perhaps Cylon love is not the same as human love. Perhaps its designed to hurt a little less.
Caprica How would you know?
Lampkin I loved a woman. Beautiful, beautiful woman. But so serious. This frowning face, trapped in the middle of a daisy. She had a way of walking, processional. As if she were on her way to her own execution. We had ten years. Then it fell apart under its own weight.
Caprica Is that what you wanted?
Lampkin I thought if I could get over her, I could get over anything. I could endure. Conquer. Be a man, stand up to any and all kinds of punishment. I clung to an empty, spinning bed for months. And that... that was when I finally realized how much I loved her. If I needed all that strength, what was the point? I needed to be with her.
Caprica Did he... Ask about me? Gaius?
Lampkin_removing_his_shades_for_the_first_time He wanted to know if you were well. He wanted you to know that he misses you. Loves you. Because he cant be here to tell you, he gave me this, to give to you. He uses that at the risk of grave reprisal to express his feelings, to put his world into some kind of recognizable order. To be heard. He kept it hidden because he knows he will not get another. He wants you to have it. Because without you it has no meaning. He wants you to have it because he would do anything, anything to be with you again.
Caprica_with_a_sad_smile Well, thats a shame, isnt it? Since theyll never let me keep it.
Lampkin You understand that your days are owned and tallied by these people, the ones out there watching us. I think you realize whats likely to become of you. I couldnt help you if they paid me ten times what they offered me for Baltar. You wont get a trial, not even a bad one. So... I have to ask you. Does your love hurt as much as mine?
Caprica_staring_at_the_pen Yes.
Roslin I feel like part of that world just fell down.
Apollo Hey, guys.
Apollo Why encourage the man to write and then take his pen?
Lampkin Itll curry more sympathy when we get the word out that hes been silenced. Tyranny, gag orders. Very sexy.
Apollo Okay, alright. So you steal his pen, then you lie to him, then you lie to the Six.
Lampkin The horror of the age. The great ugly material. The cloak of deceit.
Apollo The truth. Hmph. Kind of overrated, I guess. You know, when I was nine, maybe ten, my grandfather... he would wave me over. And hed do this all the time. And then hed say, uh, Lee, be a good boy. Just dont be too good.
Lampkin Everybody has demons. Them, Baltar, you, me. Even the machines. The law is just a way of exorcising them. Thats what your fathers father told me. You want to know why I hated him? Because he was right.
Apollo So you hated him because he was right, and I hated the law because it was wrong. Because of what... Of what it put him through. I mean, he defended the worst of the worst. I remember reading about him. The outrage. Helping murderers go free. What I dont understand is why he put himself through all that abuse.
Lampkin You think he gave a flying frak? Joe Adama cared about one thing. Understanding why people do what they do. Why we cheat our friends, why we reward our enemies. Why we go to war, sacrificing our lives for lost causes. Why we build machines in the hope of correcting our flaws and our shortcomings. Why we forgive, defying logic and the laws of nature with one stupid little act of compassion. Were flawed. All of us. I wanted to know why, so I did what he did. I spend my life with the fallen. The corrupt. The damaged. Look at you, you were so ready to get on that Raptor with me today. The bad boy, the prodigal son.
Apollo No, I was just doing my job, protecting you.
Lampkin What are you doing in my business? Suddenly Im handcuffed to a serial contrarian?
Apollo No, I am not... Oh. Okay.
Lampkin My bed is made. I suggest you toil on your own. Now, if this cross-examination is over, Id like to take a crap.
Apollo Romo, that story that you told about the girl, the woman that you loved. Getting over her. Is it true? Hey, was it true?
Lampkin Yes.
Figurski_carrying_a_box For him. Files from Colonial one.
Lampkin Finally. I thought Id get all these after the trial was over.
Marine Hold it. Put them on the floor, now.
Figurski Oh, for fraks sake. I was there when Kelly x-rayed them, its papers.
Lampkin Here you go. Good?
Marine Yes. Looks good.
Marine No!
Med_Staffer You have five minutes, Major.
Lampkin Thank you. Before the hounds got to it... Open it.
Lampkin The Presidents glasses. She looks better without them. Theyre serious. Serious catches on, in the courtroom.
Lampkin_on_the_button Your fathers.
Apollo When?
Lampkin From the deck. Right after you found the bomb underneath the Raptor. Here, kitty, kitty. Heh. Ow. It was hanging by a thread.
Apollo They tarnish so fast.
Lampkin It was like that when I plucked it. Everybody else... Tigh, the others, you... All shiny. The soldier in him has had enough for a while. Hell be glad to sit in that courtroom and fire his missiles there.
Lampkin Miss prosecuting attorney down the hall. Its not what you think. They were appropriated with the noblest of intentions. See the soles, see how the soles are worn.
Apollo She drags her feet.
Lampkin Youre catching on!
Apollo And the rest? Whats all this?
Lampkin My demons. I borrow things. My parents disappeared when I was nine years old. They were kidnapped. Murdered for... for the money they had on them, which wasnt enough. I went to live with an uncle, stole from him until I could run away.
Apollo So what did you take from me?
Lampkin Hmm. I was thinking. The photograph that you carry. The girl, the pilot. The one youre carrying. But youve had enough stolen from you already.
Apollo_holding_up_the_glasses Ill try and get these back to her...?
Lampkin The other pocket. At the back.
Apollo Oh.
Lampkin The guards took it from her, I borrowed it from them.
Lampkin We still have a case pending. If you want to help, if you dare help ... get this to my client.
Apollo A case?
Lampkin I have a calling. Eh, its all the ringing in my ears tells me.
Apollo Okay, you better explain this.
Lampkin I dont even know what it is.
Apollo Well, I do. Whered you get it?
Lampkin The one that scolded you like a schoolboy, frakkin with your head. Whats-his-name, Mr. Serious. Uh, Kelly.
Apollo Kell... Kelly?
Lampkin Yeah.
Kelly I never wouldve let Athena go airborne with you on the Raptor. I wouldve stopped it, you know that.
Apollo Yeah, I know that.
Kelly You better lock me up. And I dont want any trial. I wont stop, I will keep trying. Ill keep at it, I will. I did my job, sir. And I have done my job for two years now. Every day I sent people out to fight. I cleared them all to die. So many people... I just got tired of living with that. You ask that man if you had to choose between giving his life up for a Cylon or a human, what do you think hed say? I had to do something.
Adama_on_phone XO, reinstate Major
Adama_to_Apollo Its good to have you back.
Apollo Thank you.
Adama Im sorry. Because I was wrong, and...I made it worse.
Apollo No, no...
Adama You know, you should be in your...
Apollo I think I should be with Lampkin.
Adama Well, now that we know that it was Kelly, an ease up a little bit on security.
Apollo In his condition, I think Lampkin needs help preparing the trial, presenting his case.
Adama The President has a few possibilities. Shes looking.
Apollo Dad, why not me? Im close to the case, Ive read the documents. I understand Lampkins strategy...
Adama We have things under control. Lampkin will have help.
Apollo I want to do this.
Adama Youre a CAG, youre not a lawyer. Far from it.
Apollo What, and youre a judge?
Adama No, but like the four other men picked, Im capable of listening to the evidence and making an ethical decision.
Apollo And Im capable of helping Lampkin.
Adama Forget it. I need you as CAG.
Apollo Why did you give me those books, huh? I mean, you gave me your fathers law books.
Adama I made a mistake.
Apollo Why? Why is it a mistake? Are you afraid that Ill be like him?
Adama Youre a pilot.
Apollo And with Zak gone, and Kara gone, you needed someone to carry the flag, is that it?
Adama Youre a pilot. Youre a pilot and youre my son. And I will not look across that court and see you sitting on the other side.
Apollo See me? Or see someone else.
Adama Report for duty.
Apollo Is that an order?
Adama Youre in way over your head. Report for duty.
Apollo Is that an order?
Adama Im through giving you orders.
Adama_entering Remove Apollo from the board, inform Helo hes to remain as CAG. My son has more important things to tend to.
Apollo Hey, hows the leg?
Anders You mean my lucky break? It gave me a reason not to come up here. Sooner or later, you run out of excuses.
Apollo Its hard to let her go.
Anders Lee... Ill see you around.
Lampkin_voiceover There is no great ally, no force more powerful, no enemy more resolved than a son who chooses to step from his fathers shadow. Romo
