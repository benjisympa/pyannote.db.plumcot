Zarek#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode18 Baltar will get his trial. And this is what youll get: a hurricane. You will have sectarian violence, you will have assassination attempts, you will have civil unrest on a scale weve never seen...
admiral_william_adama President wants to take the fast track on Baltars trial. Shes looking for someone to take charge of the preliminaries, help cobble together the legal framework. She wants me to assign you.

lt_brendan_constanza LSO, Viper 6. Request long approach.
captain_aaron_kelly, Viper 6, LSO. Approved.
colonel_saul_tigh I never thought Id miss all Starbucks yakking.
lt_felix_gaeta Yes, sir.
colonel_saul_tigh Your honor. You havent heard? Where have you been? They just announced it, you won the lottery. You now own exactly one-fifth of Baltars skinny ass. Youre one of five captains picked to serve on the judges tribunal.
admiral_william_adama Hmm.
racetrack Ugh, here he comes. Frak. What a waste of my time and energy, flying Baltars lawyer back and forth from Zephyr.
lt_hamish_mccall Yeah, tell me about it.
racetrack Wanna know what the worst part is? He sits back there and tries to whisper in my ear when he talks. Ive got a helmet.
alan_hughes Sorry.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Mr. Hughes?
racetrack He takes his shoes off in my Raptor again, I might have to kill him.
lt_hamish_mccall Client. Everybody knows hes guilty. He gave the Cylons our location. Why even give the son of a bitch a trial?
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Because hes entitled. Even him. Its called justice.
lt_hamish_mccall Yeah, right. See, Baltar dead, Starbuck alive. Thatd be justice.
PA#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode18 Flight systems check...
racetrack Initiating.
lt_hamish_mccall Theres no justice. And drunk as he was.
lt_hamish_mccall Racetrack!
lt_sharon_valerii Racetrack, are you okay? Medic! Yeah, yeah, I got him, I got him. Okay.
lt_hamish_mccall Is he okay?
reporter_1 Madame President! Madame President!
Man#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode18 How do you intend to replace Gaius Baltars defense attorney? Will that be done by lottery as well?
president_laura_roslin Were confident well replace him shortly. There are a number of candidates, were working our way down the list. Next.
reporter_1 Madame President! Madame President!
president_laura_roslin Karen.
karen_fallbrook Taken in the context of this explosion, which obviously was no accident, do you really think that its in the best interest of the Fleet to proceed with this trial?
president_laura_roslin This administration will never bow to terrorism.
reporter_1 Madame President! Madame President!
president_laura_roslin Wait, you know, let me say something here to all of you. Let me get this clear, all right? As long as I am President, this administration will not allow terrorism to alter the framework of our legal system. We will proceed with the trial, rigorously. Thank you, all of you.
reporter_1 one more question! Madame President!
cpt_lee_adama Helo, I need you to set up a dradis picket with blue squadron in sector seven.
captain_karl_agathon Uh, excuse me, sir. You mean sector nine, right?
cpt_lee_adama Uh... Right. Right, nine. Um, yeah, we scrubbed eight on the last picket. Its been so quiet one picket just flows into the next. Okay, uh... 81 carom, 22 degrees. Keep your ears open. Any Cylon contact, just shut down and bug out. Red Squadron, youll be riding first CAP with me. And uh, from here on, double shifts.
cpt_lee_adama Athena, Im going to need you exclusively on shuttle runs.
racetrack Yeah, dont forget to check under your back seat.
cpt_lee_adama Hey, hey, you got lucky, Starbuck. If I were you, I would seriously consider buying a...
cpt_lee_adama ...Racetrack, Im sorry.
cpt_lee_adama Dismissed. dismissed.
president_laura_roslin Well, its so comforting to know that youre not afraid. Youre not afraid to represent the most hated man alive. The question is why?
romo_lampkin For the fame. The glory.
admiral_william_adama You worked in the public litigation office on Caprica. You think you have the qualifications to handle a case of this magnitude?
romo_lampkin I was born for this. That, and the fact that I have a pulse.
romo_lampkin Lance belonged to my wife. Dont worry, he doesnt scratch or bite like she did. If its of any comfort, I despise him as much as you do having to hire me. So... there it is. Shall we get started?
admiral_william_adama Im gonna ? you to handle the security detail on the new attorney.
cpt_lee_adama Me. So thats it, youre grounding me.
admiral_william_adama If whoever set that charge is one of our own, then youre the only one I can trust.
cpt_lee_adama You know, just say it: youre pulling me.
admiral_william_adama Keeping Lampkin alive is an important job. I need your help.
cpt_lee_adama Dad, Im fine.
admiral_william_adama No, youre not.
cpt_lee_adama Why?
admiral_william_adama Because Im not.
cpt_lee_adama Yeah, well then maybe you should take a rest.
admiral_william_adama Helo will be stepping in as CAG. I want you on this ship. Not up there, not until you can...work this out.
cpt_lee_adama Right. I understand. Work it out. Okay.
cpt_lee_adama Ill be handling security for you. Where do you want your bags? Youll have two Marines stationed outside the door. Ms. Cassidy, the prosecuting attorney, shes just down the hall. Theres a head, showers that way. Sorry, co-ed. Now, if theres anything else?
romo_lampkin Id like to see my client.
cpt_lee_adama Now?
romo_lampkin Pilot.
cpt_lee_adama Yeah.
romo_lampkin King of the pilots. We could stand around here and discuss why you got stuck with me, if you want.
cpt_lee_adama Ill take you to his cell.
romo_lampkin No, no not there. Half the ships probably listening in.
cpt_lee_adama Fine, whatever, have an interrogation room.
romo_lampkin Interrogation rooms give me stage fright.
cpt_lee_adama I cant bring him here.
romo_lampkin I was thinking your quarters.
cpt_lee_adama What?
romo_lampkin Yeah, before it gets wired for sound like this place probably is. Whats the problem? Forgot to make your bed?
cpt_lee_adama Look, I dont care where you see him, I just cant leave you alone.
romo_lampkin Major. It is Major, isnt it? I have the right to consult with my client in private, without anybody eavesdropping or looking in. Whoever cares the most, wins. Says so in there.
cpt_lee_adama So?
romo_lampkin I wanna see my client, you dont care. I win. You know, you look like him.
cpt_lee_adama You knew my grandfather?
romo_lampkin Hated his guts. He taught me everything I know.
dr_gaius_baltar What are you doing here, anyway?
romo_lampkin You can speak freely. He signed confidentiality papers.
dr_gaius_baltar Look, this whole charades pathetic. Pathetic! Security? Securitys already toasting my other attorneys, uh, untimely demise. About one thing that bloke ever did, apart from napping, was, you know, manage to... smuggle out my papers. Papers. Do you have any papers?
dr_gaius_baltar Thank you. The nature of modern life is... obsession. So tell me, do you honestly think that Im gonna get a fair trial?
romo_lampkin Doubtful.
dr_gaius_baltar Yes.
romo_lampkin But you havent exactly been helping yourself, now, have you?
dr_gaius_baltar You object to my writing.
romo_lampkin on the contrary, keep it coming. This new manifesto of yours shows a great change in you. This little uh ... operating manual of yours, well... Keeps them all guessing.
dr_gaius_baltar Right, okay. Okay. Caprica Six. Im worried about her. Shes the key. They can use her to completely destroy me. We need to get to her. We need to know what shes thinking. We need to... I mean, talk to her. Tell her, uh... tell her that I love her very much. And Im thinking about her a lot.
romo_lampkin I can sense that, yes.
dr_gaius_baltar You need to, you need to find out where were all ... Where were all standing.
romo_lampkin To listen requires a voice. For what needs to known, requires us to ask. My Triumphs, My Mistakes, by Gaius Baltar.
dr_gaius_baltar But you say it very well.
romo_lampkin Ive done the reading. once those papers arrive, I suggest you do yours.
romo_lampkin Fly me to Colonial one.
cpt_lee_adama Me?
romo_lampkin Yeah, youre a pilot, arent you?
cpt_lee_adama You dont understand, you cant just jump in a Raptor. These are things have to be coordinated.
romo_lampkin Where would you rather be, Major? Here, as the parade float for the bereaved?
cpt_lee_adama What are you talking about?
romo_lampkin Everybody looking at you like youre bleeding out of your side.
cpt_lee_adama You wanna see some real blood? Keep going.
romo_lampkin Oh, there is someone home. Look, I need those files you come with me, they might just give them to me. I wait, theyre gonna discover that Baltars pregnant before I get them. What is your job, anyway? Keep me alive, or keep me from doing mine?
captain_aaron_kelly, Sorry, sir, you know your status. Youre to remain shipside. Those are the Admirals orders.
romo_lampkin Father factor.
cpt_lee_adama Come on, Kelly. Give me a break, Im along for the ride.
captain_aaron_kelly, Dont do this to me, all right? Im in enough dung already.
cpt_lee_adama All right.
chief_galen_tyrol All right, lets get the bird a tow!
chief_galen_tyrol Ho, hold ... Hold up, open the door, open the door! What the frak was that thing? Did you see that? What? What the... I think it was a cat!
romo_lampkin Thats my cat!
chief_galen_tyrol Theres a frakkin cat in there! Who the hell let a cat in here? Hes t the other side, push him over here. There it is! Its over there! Its over there! There it is! Kitty, kitty, kitty! No, no, come here! Come here, here, come here... Bomb. Bomb! Everybody out!
admiral_william_adama What the hell were you doing out there? I gave you an order to do a job.
cpt_lee_adama Excuse me, I was doing my job.
admiral_william_adama Yeah, being led around by the nose? This bastard yanked your chain, and you jump?
cpt_lee_adama He wanted files from Colonial one.
admiral_william_adama It was the middle of the night.
cpt_lee_adama You assigned me to security.
admiral_william_adama Yeah, and there was a bomb on that ship, and you missed it. Security. I gave you explicit orders.
cpt_lee_adama Athena was piloting.
admiral_william_adama You couldve died. Plain and simple. Youre a soldier. Live like one. Start acting like one. Apollo: Shes been gone two weeks. I didnt realize the clock was running.
admiral_william_adama Stop.
cpt_lee_adama No, Im sorry, because maybe were just built differently.
admiral_william_adama You stop. Dont you dare quantify my loss.
cpt_lee_adama You have no idea. You have no frakking idea!
admiral_william_adama What, you think yours is deeper?
cpt_lee_adama Well.
admiral_william_adama Yours is greater? In two weeks, theres going to be a trial, and Im going to do what I was chosen to do, and so are you. You build a frakkin nest around that man, and you protect his ass.
chief_galen_tyrol Frakker meant business this time. That thing had gone off, wed be picking up Raptor and people parts with tweezers.
captain_aaron_kelly, Every day I wave jocks out there. A lot of them are my friends. People I care for and love. Its hard enough watching them die in battle, but rickshawing Baltars frakkin attorney around? Frak that.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson I believe that the Cylons want us to destroy ourselves and this is how theyre doing it.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson By planting bombs, making suspicious of each other. You know whats funny? By the time the Cylons catch up with us they wont even have to attack. Theyll just clean up the mess we made. I think theyre here.
lt_sharon_valerii I think youre wrong.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Okay, all I know is I kissed Nicky this morning and it couldve been the last time.
chief_galen_tyrol Cally, thats enough.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson What, I kissed you too! Some of us dont get a second chance. Or a third.
chief_galen_tyrol Im going to the Admiral.
cpt_lee_adama All right, take a good look at this room. Every time you leave, check it. If anything changes, dont touch it. Uh, a book moves, shoes in the wrong place, something smells different, you get the frak out. Someone knocks, dont answer the door. Dont open the door! Look, you have to do what I say.
romo_lampkin If they wanna kill me, theyll find a way. Now, who do I have to bribe to see the Cylon woman?
dr_gaius_baltar The nature of modern life is obsession...
president_laura_roslin Damn, I cant find my glasses. Its like theyve got feet. Um, the Six. Yes, okay. Lampkin can interview Six immediately. As long as its conducted under the same conditions accorded to the chief prosecutor, all right?
admiral_william_adama Meaning in the interrogation room. Not where you sleep.
cpt_lee_adama But since youve been selected to serve on the tribunal, Im assuming that you wont be present at those interviews in the interest of fairness.
president_laura_roslin Major has a point, Bill.
admiral_william_adama The Majors mistaken. I monitored the chief prosecutors interview. Therefore, same conditions apply. In the interest of fairness.
cpt_lee_adama Mr. Lampkin is still entitled to those documents that he requested from Colonial one.
tory_foster Yes, right, I apologize. Weve had trouble locating the files. Well have them delivered to you on the next run?
president_laura_roslin Im sorry, Major, well get them right away. Thank you.
cpt_lee_adama Thank you.
romo_lampkin I understand that you had a romantic relationship with my client.
number_six Gaius Baltar is a brilliant, gifted human being. In the time Ive known him, hes made a sport out of mendacity and deception. He was narcissistic, self-centered, feckless, and vain. Im the one who should have stabbed him.
president_laura_roslin Things are looking up.
romo_lampkin Love. Precocious evolutionary move, fashioning Cylons to be capable of experiencing it. I dont know if it was engineered as a tactical imperative, but... Its not for the faint-hearted, is it?
number_six No, its not.
romo_lampkin Maybe you shouldve been nicer to your mechanic. Well. Perhaps Cylon love is not the same as human love. Perhaps its designed to hurt a little less.
number_six How would you know?
romo_lampkin I loved a woman. Beautiful, beautiful woman. But so serious. This frowning face, trapped in the middle of a daisy. She had a way of walking, processional. As if she were on her way to her own execution. We had ten years. Then it fell apart under its own weight.
number_six Is that what you wanted?
romo_lampkin I thought if I could get over her, I could get over anything. I could endure. Conquer. Be a man, stand up to any and all kinds of punishment. I clung to an empty, spinning bed for months. And that... that was when I finally realized how much I loved her. If I needed all that strength, what was the point? I needed to be with her.
number_six Did he... Ask about me? Gaius?
romo_lampkin He wanted to know if you were well. He wanted you to know that he misses you. Loves you. Because he cant be here to tell you, he gave me this, to give to you. He uses that at the risk of grave reprisal to express his feelings, to put his world into some kind of recognizable order. To be heard. He kept it hidden because he knows he will not get another. He wants you to have it. Because without you it has no meaning. He wants you to have it because he would do anything, anything to be with you again.
number_six Well, thats a shame, isnt it? Since theyll never let me keep it.
romo_lampkin You understand that your days are owned and tallied by these people, the ones out there watching us. I think you realize whats likely to become of you. I couldnt help you if they paid me ten times what they offered me for Baltar. You wont get a trial, not even a bad one. So... I have to ask you. Does your love hurt as much as mine?
number_six Yes.
president_laura_roslin I feel like part of that world just fell down.
cpt_lee_adama Hey, guys.
cpt_lee_adama Why encourage the man to write and then take his pen?
romo_lampkin Itll curry more sympathy when we get the word out that hes been silenced. Tyranny, gag orders. Very sexy.
cpt_lee_adama Okay, alright. So you steal his pen, then you lie to him, then you lie to the Six.
romo_lampkin The horror of the age. The great ugly material. The cloak of deceit.
cpt_lee_adama The truth. Hmph. Kind of overrated, I guess. You know, when I was nine, maybe ten, my grandfather... he would wave me over. And hed do this all the time. And then hed say, uh, Lee, be a good boy. Just dont be too good.
romo_lampkin Everybody has demons. Them, Baltar, you, me. Even the machines. The law is just a way of exorcising them. Thats what your fathers father told me. You want to know why I hated him? Because he was right.
cpt_lee_adama So you hated him because he was right, and I hated the law because it was wrong. Because of what... Of what it put him through. I mean, he defended the worst of the worst. I remember reading about him. The outrage. Helping murderers go free. What I dont understand is why he put himself through all that abuse.
romo_lampkin You think he gave a flying frak? Joe Adama cared about one thing. Understanding why people do what they do. Why we cheat our friends, why we reward our enemies. Why we go to war, sacrificing our lives for lost causes. Why we build machines in the hope of correcting our flaws and our shortcomings. Why we forgive, defying logic and the laws of nature with one stupid little act of compassion. Were flawed. All of us. I wanted to know why, so I did what he did. I spend my life with the fallen. The corrupt. The damaged. Look at you, you were so ready to get on that Raptor with me today. The bad boy, the prodigal son.
cpt_lee_adama No, I was just doing my job, protecting you.
romo_lampkin What are you doing in my business? Suddenly Im handcuffed to a serial contrarian?
cpt_lee_adama No, I am not... Oh. Okay.
romo_lampkin My bed is made. I suggest you toil on your own. Now, if this cross-examination is over, Id like to take a crap.
cpt_lee_adama Romo, that story that you told about the girl, the woman that you loved. Getting over her. Is it true? Hey, was it true?
romo_lampkin Yes.
specialist_3rd_class_anthony_figurski For him. Files from Colonial one.
romo_lampkin Finally. I thought Id get all these after the trial was over.
marine_allan_nowart Hold it. Put them on the floor, now.
specialist_3rd_class_anthony_figurski Oh, for fraks sake. I was there when Kelly x-rayed them, its papers.
romo_lampkin Here you go. Good?
marine_allan_nowart Yes. Looks good.
marine_allan_nowart No!
Med_Staffer#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode18 You have five minutes, Major.
romo_lampkin Thank you. Before the hounds got to it... Open it.
romo_lampkin The Presidents glasses. She looks better without them. Theyre serious. Serious catches on, in the courtroom.
romo_lampkin Your fathers.
cpt_lee_adama When?
romo_lampkin From the deck. Right after you found the bomb underneath the Raptor. Here, kitty, kitty. Heh. Ow. It was hanging by a thread.
cpt_lee_adama They tarnish so fast.
romo_lampkin It was like that when I plucked it. Everybody else... Tigh, the others, you... All shiny. The soldier in him has had enough for a while. Hell be glad to sit in that courtroom and fire his missiles there.
romo_lampkin Miss prosecuting attorney down the hall. Its not what you think. They were appropriated with the noblest of intentions. See the soles, see how the soles are worn.
cpt_lee_adama She drags her feet.
romo_lampkin Youre catching on!
cpt_lee_adama And the rest? Whats all this?
romo_lampkin My demons. I borrow things. My parents disappeared when I was nine years old. They were kidnapped. Murdered for... for the money they had on them, which wasnt enough. I went to live with an uncle, stole from him until I could run away.
cpt_lee_adama So what did you take from me?
romo_lampkin Hmm. I was thinking. The photograph that you carry. The girl, the pilot. The one youre carrying. But youve had enough stolen from you already.
cpt_lee_adama Ill try and get these back to her...?
romo_lampkin The other pocket. At the back.
cpt_lee_adama Oh.
romo_lampkin The guards took it from her, I borrowed it from them.
romo_lampkin We still have a case pending. If you want to help, if you dare help ... get this to my client.
cpt_lee_adama A case?
romo_lampkin I have a calling. Eh, its all the ringing in my ears tells me.
cpt_lee_adama Okay, you better explain this.
romo_lampkin I dont even know what it is.
cpt_lee_adama Well, I do. Whered you get it?
romo_lampkin The one that scolded you like a schoolboy, frakkin with your head. Whats-his-name, Mr. Serious. Uh, Kelly.
cpt_lee_adama Kell... Kelly?
romo_lampkin Yeah.
captain_aaron_kelly, I never wouldve let Athena go airborne with you on the Raptor. I wouldve stopped it, you know that.
cpt_lee_adama Yeah, I know that.
captain_aaron_kelly, You better lock me up. And I dont want any trial. I wont stop, I will keep trying. Ill keep at it, I will. I did my job, sir. And I have done my job for two years now. Every day I sent people out to fight. I cleared them all to die. So many people... I just got tired of living with that. You ask that man if you had to choose between giving his life up for a Cylon or a human, what do you think hed say? I had to do something.
admiral_william_adama XO, reinstate Major
admiral_william_adama Its good to have you back.
cpt_lee_adama Thank you.
admiral_william_adama Im sorry. Because I was wrong, and...I made it worse.
cpt_lee_adama No, no...
admiral_william_adama You know, you should be in your...
cpt_lee_adama I think I should be with Lampkin.
admiral_william_adama Well, now that we know that it was Kelly, an ease up a little bit on security.
cpt_lee_adama In his condition, I think Lampkin needs help preparing the trial, presenting his case.
admiral_william_adama The President has a few possibilities. Shes looking.
cpt_lee_adama Dad, why not me? Im close to the case, Ive read the documents. I understand Lampkins strategy...
admiral_william_adama We have things under control. Lampkin will have help.
cpt_lee_adama I want to do this.
admiral_william_adama Youre a CAG, youre not a lawyer. Far from it.
cpt_lee_adama What, and youre a judge?
admiral_william_adama No, but like the four other men picked, Im capable of listening to the evidence and making an ethical decision.
cpt_lee_adama And Im capable of helping Lampkin.
admiral_william_adama Forget it. I need you as CAG.
cpt_lee_adama Why did you give me those books, huh? I mean, you gave me your fathers law books.
admiral_william_adama I made a mistake.
cpt_lee_adama Why? Why is it a mistake? Are you afraid that Ill be like him?
admiral_william_adama Youre a pilot.
cpt_lee_adama And with Zak gone, and Kara gone, you needed someone to carry the flag, is that it?
admiral_william_adama Youre a pilot. Youre a pilot and youre my son. And I will not look across that court and see you sitting on the other side.
cpt_lee_adama See me? Or see someone else.
admiral_william_adama Report for duty.
cpt_lee_adama Is that an order?
admiral_william_adama Youre in way over your head. Report for duty.
cpt_lee_adama Is that an order?
admiral_william_adama Im through giving you orders.
admiral_william_adama Remove Apollo from the board, inform Helo hes to remain as CAG. My son has more important things to tend to.
cpt_lee_adama Hey, hows the leg?
samuel_anders You mean my lucky break? It gave me a reason not to come up here. Sooner or later, you run out of excuses.
cpt_lee_adama Its hard to let her go.
samuel_anders Lee... Ill see you around.
romo_lampkin There is no great ally, no force more powerful, no enemy more resolved than a son who chooses to step from his fathers shadow. Romo
