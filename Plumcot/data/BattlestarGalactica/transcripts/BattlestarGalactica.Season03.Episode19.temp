Baltar Previously, on Battlestar Galactica...
Roslin The Cylons have established a human police force... Hundreds of us have been rounded up by the Cylons, held in detention. Questioned. Tortured.
Baltar Whats this?
Three This orders the summary executions of all the detainees listed on the next page. It requires your signature.
Doral_cocking_a_gun Sign it! Sign your name!
Anders The Cylons knew exactly where we were gonna be.
Ellen I want to explain.
Anders She sold us out. You know what has to be done here. Now it would be better for her sake if it was you.
Roslin Youre not afraid to represent the most hated man alive?
Lampkin Id like to see my client.
Lampkin If they want to kill me, theyll find a way.
Marine No!
Adama with Baltars lawyer injured, his defense will need help.
Apollo Dad, why not me? Im close to the case. Ive read the documents.
Adama Youre a CAG, youre not a lawyer. I will not allow you to sit across the courtroom on the other side defending Gaius Baltar.
Apollo Is that an order?
Adama Im through giving you orders.
Roslin Hera? Hera!
Gaeta We finally got
Adama So the Fleets ready to jump again. How many more before we find the nebula?
Gaeta Im estimating an even dozen.
Adama Were getting close. Still no sign of the Cylons.
Gaeta No, sir. Weve left a trailing bird at every jump site. No dradis contacts, no sightings, nothing.
Adama Alter the mission orders of the trailing Raptor. Tell them to remain an additional six hours before catching up with the fleet.
Gaeta Yes, sir.
Hotdog yeah! Woo-hoo! Youre up, superstar.
Anders You know this games got frak all to do with the real thing, right?
Skulls I didnt hear you nuggets say that in the beginning.
Anders I dont really care what anybody...
Anders -- There, go back. You almost had it.
Seelix had what?
Anders That song. You dont hear that song?
Seelix_clapping No. Come on, youre up. Lets go.
Anders Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Tory Baltar was instrumental in the Cylon attack on the Colonies. The President wants him charged with genocide.
Cassidy I cant make it stick. Theres no evidence of his involvement in...
Tory -- The President saw him with one of the Sixes on Caprica. Before the attacks.
Cassidy You really want me to put Laura Roslin on the stand to testify about her drug-induced visions?
Tory What we want is for you to do your job and convict him. If you cant do that, well find someone who will.
Cassidy This is a courtesy meeting, not a strategy session. I am charging Baltar with what I can prove. Of course, I do serve at the pleasure of the President. And if she decides to replace me, Im sure there are other lawyers willing to take up the case. If there
Woman Dr. Baltar?
Baltar Who are you? Oh. Look, Im terribly sorry. Im under strict instructions from my attorney not to speak to any members of the press.
Woman Oh! No, Dr. Baltar, I-- I want you to look at this picture. This is my son. Hes sick, and I want you to bless him.
Baltar Bless him? Guard! Im terribly sorry, madam.
Woman Please--
Baltar I cant help you. Im not God the God, or God of any derivation thereof.
Woman Please--
Baltar I cant bless him. Im sorry, I dont have any special powers.
Woman I believe in you.
Baltar Well, thats very flattering.
Woman Just please take it.
Baltar What the hells going on here? This place is becoming like a zoo.
Woman Just, please... Will you just take it?
Baltar Im on trial for my life. I need a bit of privacy, please...
Woman -- Just take it and pray for him, please! Please.
Guard its time to go.
Baltar Ill do my best.
Woman You can save him.
Baltar Yeah, mind how you go now.
Six How many is that now?
Baltar Five.
Six Not including the thirty or forty whove written letters.
Baltar Mm-hmm. Well, I suppose it cant be helped. Celebrity trials invariably bring out the crazies.
Six So you think theyre crazy. See, I saw a woman in pain. I saw a woman who can see you more clearly than you can see yourself. Even if they kill you, your name will live on forever.
Racetrack Galactica, Raptor 289. Were clear and in position for rear guard picket.
Tigh Roger, 289er. Have fun watching our ass, Racetrack.
Racetrack Have fun watching Baltars ass get nailed. All right, get comfortable. Twelve hours and counting.
Skulls Twelve hours hanging out here like bait on a hook waiting to see if the Cylons are still following us.
Racetrack_laughing Just shut up and deal, okay?
Cassidy How do we measure loss? How do we measure loss? We measure it in the faces of the dead. The faces that haunt our memories and our dreams. How do we measure loss? We measure it in our own faces. The ones we see in the mirror every day. Because it has marked each of us. So how do we measure loss? When the scale of it becomes... too hard to absorb any other way, we use numbers. How many killed. How many maimed. How many missing. And when those numbers become too vast to comprehend, as they did two years ago, we had to turn it around. We began to count the living. Those of us who survived to continue the saga of the human race. 44,035. The sum total of survivors from the Twelve Colonies who settled on New Caprica with President Gaius Baltar as their leader and protector. 38,838. Our number the day after we escaped. And the missing number, the one that no one wants to face. 5197. 5197 of us killed, left behind, or simply disappeared. 5,197 of all that remains of the human race. Lost.
Cassidy The citizens of the Twelve Colonies entrusted their fates and the lives to Gaius Baltar. What we received was a reign of terror that staggers our minds and breaks our hearts. Instead of governance, we got tyranny. Instead of justice, we got oppression. Instead of a president, we got a murderer. Today, humanity holds him accountable for his crime. Gaius Baltar is not a victim. Gaius Baltar chose to side with the Cylons and to actively seek the deaths of his fellow citizens. For that... he must pay the ultimate price.
Lampkin Your honors, the defense would like to change our plea to guilty.
Franks What? Counselor, are you sure you want to do that?
Lampkin No. But what choice do I have? I mean, its obvious my client is guilty.
Lampkin Hes a traitor and a killer. Hes no better than the Cylon, and what do we do with them?
Man Throw em out the airlock!
Lampkin Thats right! Throw em out the airlock! This man sold us to our enemy. This man is our enemy. And if theres one thing thats good in war, that is right and just and proper, its slaughtering our enemy! Getting some righteous payback! What are we waiting for? Lets just kill him now! Itd be easier, wouldnt it? Simpler. Justice of the mob. Its what they want.
Lampkin Especially her. Shes been wanting this for over a year now. Ever since he beat her in a free and fair election of the people. Now she gets a chance to exact her revenge upon a man whose only real crime is bowing to the inevitable! Gaius Baltar saved the lives of the people on New Caprica. Where Laura Roslin wouldve seen us all dead, victims of a battle we had no hope in winning! I dont know about you, but Im glad she wasnt the president when the Cylons arrived and said, Surrender, or die. I owe my life to Gaius Baltar and the decision he made that day. And so does Laura Roslin.
Skulls ...Yeah, like you frakkin know.
Racetrack I know you wank it in your rack. Ladies man.
Skulls You see, thats called self-healing.
Racetrack Okay, time check.
Racetrack Oh, we got something. Lots of company!
Skulls Reading three, four... No, five baseships! Crap, theyre right on top of us!
Racetrack Frak. Frak, incoming!
Skulls The FTLs still spinning up.
Racetrack We gotta jump! Now, Godsdamn it! Now!
Adama Begin searching the entire fleet for tracking devices. Its possible they couldve placed one on a ship on New Caprica.
Roslin I think that we should ask the Six. She may be willing to help.
Tigh Baltars girlfriend. And why would she do that?
Roslin Because she does not want to see Hera go back to the Cylons.
Tigh You think that thing would stick her neck out for some half-Cylon whelp?
Roslin I have a feeling shed lay her life down for it.
Tigh A feeling?
Roslin Its more than a feeling,
Adama All right? Why...
Roslin Just do it. It doesnt hurt to ask.
Adama No...
Adama Ask the prisoner if it knows of any tracking devices in the fleet.
Tigh With pleasure.
Tigh The President, Gods bless her sunny optimistic soul, thinks you might want to share how your buddies have been tracking us. So Im here to ask the question and listen to your lies.
Caprica In the last battle, we discovered your fuel ship... had a unique radiation signature. They mustve found a way to track it.
Tigh What else do you know? What other secrets are rattling around inside that mechanical brain?
Chip_Gaius Dont be intimidated by him. Hes just using you to exorcise his own pain. Poor old sod. He lost someone close to him. Oh, you know how that feels, dont you?
Caprica_aloud I know a lot of things.
Caprica You want to know one thing I know? I know about your loss. Hurts, doesnt it? You wonder how you can even survive it.
Tigh I dont know what youre talking about. But its not gonna work.
Chip_Gaius she was his world. Of course, he only realized when she was gone.
Caprica Did she know? Did she know? Did she know how much she meant to you? Or did you wait to tell her till she was gone?
Tigh What?
Caprica Bet you made her think that she was a burden. A millstone around your neck. But then you humans always destroy the ones who love you, dont you...
Tigh Shackle this thing.
Cassidy ...Colonel Tigh?
Tigh Excuse me. What was the question again?
Cassidy As the leader of the insurgency, did you ever hear of an instance in which Baltar stood up to the Cylons or tried to disrupt their plans?
Tigh Oh, no, never. He never lifted a frakkin finger to help us. Ellen did more. At least she was trying to... To help us.
Apollo My Gods, hes drunk.
Cassidy Yes. Yes, Ellen. Your wife. Another victim of Baltars Cylon allies.
Tigh Yeah, thats right. Yep.
Cassidy Thank you, Colonel. Your witness.
Lampkin What happened to the Colonels wife?
Apollo She used to work for one of the Cylon administrators.
Lampkin She worked for them?
Apollo Mm.
Lampkin You know what happened to her?
Apollo No, no idea. I presume she died in the exodus from New Caprica.
Lampkin Ah. Ahem. Colonel.
Tigh Hmm.
Lampkin You dislike Gaius Baltar because you consider him to be a traitor. Is that correct?
Tigh And a coward, and a mass murderer.
Lampkin The suicide bombing of the police graduation. Gaius Baltar was the intended target, was he not?
Tigh And if hed had the guts to show up that day like he was supposed to, you and I wouldnt be having this conversation right now.
Lampkin So you ordered the killing of-- what was it? 33 other men and women, just for the chance to kill Gaius Baltar.
Tigh They were all traitors. Anyone who put on that uniform. But yes, he was the target.
Lampkin What happened to your wife?
Cassidy Exception. Relevance?
Lampkin The door was opened on direct, your honors.
Adama I fail to see the point of pursuing this...
Judge Hes right, Admiral, if it was brought up during direct examination, than it can be pursued in the cross. Overruled. Continue.
Lampkin What happened to your wife, colonel?
Tigh You frakkin son of a bitch--
Lampkin isnt it true that she collaborated openly with the Cylons? That she actually worked for them.
Tigh She was faking it. Making them think that she was working for them.
Lampkin I-I see, yeah. And Baltar, he wasnt faking it, no.
Tigh Thats right.
Lampkin And you blame him for her death. Have you been drinking today, colonel?
Tigh I had a drink. I havent been drinking.
Lampkin You used to like to drink with Ellen, I imagine.
Tigh You hear that? Theyre playing music in here now?
Lampkin Gaius Baltar didnt order the death of your wife. Colonel, that was somebody else. Who was it, colonel? Who killed Ellen? Come on, colonel, were waiting. Tell us. Who was it? Who killed Ellen?
Tigh I did. I did. I did. She was giving information to the Cylons. A lot of good men died. She was my wife. It was my responsibility. She did it for me. Thats what she said. To save me from going back to prison so they could tear more pieces off me. So I killed her. All because of that thing over there. All because Gaius frakkin Baltar didnt have the guts to stand up to the Cylons. Because he handed our fates over to the Cylons, I had to kill my Ellen.
Lampkin so Gaius Baltar made you kill your wife. Thats why you hate him. And thats why youd say anything to see him die.
Tigh Youre Godsdamned right i would. I would do anything... say anything... to see that man die a painful death.
Lampkin No further questions.
Tigh Will someone turn off that music?!
Reporter Earlier today, protestors were arrested on...
Nuggets ...Okay, are you hearing anything Im saying? Shut up! My Gods.
Report A contingency of Colonial Marines were deployed to the ship...
Bartender What can I get you?
Tory I dont know what I want. You figure it out. Youre the bartender.
Bartender Okay. Tell you what. Ill surprise you.
Anders Yes, finally! Thank you! About time. Im not a bad coach, huh?
Roslin ...One more time?
Cassidy Yeah.
Roslin I was grading papers in the schoolhouse at night and they came again. Fortunately, the children were gone. It was after dark. They took close to 200 of our people that night. Under Baltars direct orders. As it turned out, all of our names were on a death list signed by Dr. Baltar.
Cassidy Let us be crystal clear on this fact. You are saying that the defendant, Gaius Baltar, ordered your execution and the execution of 200 other people?
Roslin Yes, indeed. Thats exactly what Im saying.
Lampkin_aside We need to talk.
Baltar We need to find something, anything, that can discredit her testimony. Shes a fanatic, right?
Lampkin I dont know if thats gonna help. Youre awfully quiet.
Lampkin Youre awfully quiet.
Apollo I was just listening.
Lampkin You see, your problem is that Im a really good liar and youre not. So lets have it.
Apollo Have what?
Baltar My Gods, hes right. You do know something. You know something and youre not saying.
Apollo Its probably not even true.
Lampkin I like it already.
Apollo Its a personal matter. I doubt shed ever say anything in front of me.
Baltar She? She? This is about Laura Roslin? And youre not... Tell me, tell me!
Lampkin Shut up. Enjoying yourself so far?
Apollo Huh?
Lampkin Having a good time sticking it to the old man defending the most hated person in the universe?
Apollo Thats not why I agreed to do this.
Lampkin No, you just decided to stand up for truth and justice and all those other lovely things we inscribe upon courtroom doors.
Apollo Yeah. Thats exactly what Im doing. Because I believe in the system. I really believe. I even believe that our lowlife pond scum of a client actually deserves a fair trial.
Lampkin The system requires that you tell what you know, which leaves you with one of two uncomfortable options. First, share the information, and in so doing, uphold the very principles that you claim to hold so dear. Or second, keep em to yourself and prove once and for all your only purpose here is to jab your father in the eye and make a mockery of the entire justice system.
Apollo Thats very nice. Very, very nice, but I know why Im here. I dont need to prove it to you or to anyone else.
Lampkin Youre wrong. You need to prove it to yourself, or you leave that courtroom out there knowing you kept a secret that couldve saved that mans miserable life. Now unless I greatly misjudged your character, thats not something that Lee Adama wishes on his conscience. So whatll it be, Major? Sit on the sidelines mouthing pieties, or are you gonna get in this trial and give us something we can use?
Adama Come on. Come on. There we go.
Tigh_coughing Here we go.
Adama Give me that. Youve had enough of that already.
Adama Attaboy... Got some good news today. We found the radiation signature on the tylium ship. Just like the Cylon prisoner said we would.
Tigh Good. Thats great.
Adama Being repaired as we speak. Mr. Gaeta estimates the fleets nine jumps away from the nebula. Considering how long its gonna take to fix the tylium ship, were out... maybe three days. Three days out from the next clue on the road to Earth.
Tigh Cant smell her. I cant smell her anymore, bill. I kept her clothes... but her smell is gone now.
Adama I gotta go, Saul. Gotta retire.
Tigh Im sorry about all that in court.
Adama Theres nothing to be sorry about.
Tigh I embarrassed you. Made you look bad.
Adama Youre my oldest friend, Saul. You never embarrass me. Get some rest.
Apollo Can a former CAG make a radical suggestion to the admiral? What if we dont fix the tylium ship?
Adama Repairs have already started.
Apollo I realize that, but hear me out. Were too close to the nebula to simply fix the problem and hope the Cylons cant guess where were going. So if we dont fix it, if instead we send the ship off on a new course with a couple of raptors riding shotgun, let them make a few jumps before rejoining the fleet, it might throw the Cylons off.
Adama Its a good idea. Ill take it into consideration. Is there anything else?
Apollo Hows the president?
Adama What?
Apollo Is she okay? She looked a little rattled in court yesterday.
Adama_exhaling We cant talk about the trial outside of court, you know that. Or you should.
Apollo I know. I wasnt asking about...
Adama after what you did to Tigh, youre the last person I would consider to confide in.
Apollo Me? I didnt do anything to Tigh. He was drunk. Its really not my fault.
Adama You told Lampkin about Ellen.
Apollo I didnt know about Ellen.
Adama_scoffing Yeah, right.
Apollo Youre calling me a liar?
Adama Im calling you a liar and a coward. one who doesnt have the guts to go after a man himself. Instead, you hand the shiv to a stranger and let him stab Tigh in the back. And for what? Traitorous piece of garbage Gaius Baltar. Doesnt even deserve a trial.
Apollo Are you done?
Adama Yes.
Apollo_removing_his_wings Then so am I. I will not serve under a man who questions my integrity.
Adama And I wont have an officer under my command who doesnt have any.
Apollo Ill see you in court, Admiral.
Apollo Let me do this.
Lampkin What? Are you sure, major?
Apollo Its... Its mister now. And yeah, Im sure. It should be me.
Baltar Youre not seriously gonna let my security guard...
Franks Were waiting, Mr. Lampkin.
Lampkin If itd please the court, my associate, Mr. Adama, will question the witness.
Adama_muttering His associate.
Franks The defense may proceed.
Lampkin thank you.
Apollo Madam President, arent you alive today because of Gaius Baltar?
Roslin Im alive today because the insurgents managed to stop the execution.
Apollo Well, they saved you from a Cylon firing squad, but...wasnt it Baltar who saved your life when you were dying from cancer?
Cassidy Relevance?
Apollo Uh, your honors...
Lampkin Hostile witness, your honors, if the court would grant us just a little latitude.
Franks Well allow it.
Lampkin Thank you.
Apollo Um... did Gaius Baltar save your life when you were dying from cancer?
Roslin Dr. Baltars scientific knowledge did save my life indeed.
Apollo Can you be more specific? How did he save your life on that occasion?
Roslin He injected me with the blood of a half-Cylon, half-human baby.
Apollo And your cancer vanished.
Roslin Completely.
Apollo During your illness, what sort of medication were you on?
Roslin You know, I was taking a lot of medications at the time, and I dont remember all their names.
Apollo Did you take something called chamalla extract?
Roslin Hmph. Yes.
Apollo Isnt it true that one of the side effects of taking chamalla is a propensity to experience hallucinations?
Roslin Yes, that is one of the possible side effects of chamalla.
Apollo And isnt it also true that the visions that you once described as messages from the Gods were actually the result of a pharmacological reaction from taking chamalla?
Roslin The chamalla did enable me to see certain things that were foretold by the scriptures. Things that will help this fleet find its way to Earth. You of all people should know that, Major.
Cassidy Your Honors.
Franks Mr. Adama, where are you going with this?
Apollo Just one more question, your honor.
Roslin Please dont do this. Please.
Apollo Madam President, are you taking chamalla at this time?
Roslin Captain Apollo. You remember that? I always thought it had such a nice ring to it. I am so, so sorry for you now.
Apollo Chamalla, Madam President. Perhaps dissolved in your tea to mask the bitterness?
Adama Dont answer. Im putting a stop to this right now.
Apollo Your honors, if she is on drugs, it goes to her credibility as a witness.
Adama Witness is dismissed!
Lampkin Your honors, I have to strongly object. Hes obviously trying to cover something up here.
Adama one more word from you, and youll both be held for contempt.
Judge Admiral! Id like to hear the witness answer the question.
Franks As would I.
Apollo Madam President, are you taking chamalla again?
Roslin Yes, I am.
Apollo No further questions.
Roslin Mr. Adama, arent you going to ask me why?
Apollo Im sorry?
Roslin Why am I taking chamalla again?
Apollo Its not strictly relevant.
Roslin Well, perhaps its not relevant to you, but its relevant to me. Go ahead. Ask me why. Finish what you started.
Apollo Why are you taking the chamalla again, Madam President?
Roslin I am taking chamalla again because my cancer has returned.
Apollo You know, the fact that shes having hallucinations is relevant to Baltars defense. Thats the way the system works, Dee. The accused has a right to challenge the credibility of witnesses against him. Thats just the way it is.
Dualla The system is broken, Lee. The system elected that man to be President, and the systems trying to let him walk. That is not a system that deserves to be defended. It deserves to be taken apart and put back together again.
Apollo You know, I wish... I wish I could make you understand.
Dualla I do understand, Lee. And its why Im leaving.
Apollo Well, you dont. You frakkin dont!
Reporter Madam President, how long have you known about the cancer?
Roslin About a week.
Reporter And how advanced is the disease?
Reporter Uh, will you be getting any more transfusions from the half-Cylon donor?
Roslin You know, this is the kind of detail Im not gonna go into now. You know, were looking at a game plan. Ill let you know when we have one.
Reporter Well, how will the treatment for your illness impact your duties as president?
Roslin So far, it hasnt at all.
Reporter Are you currently taking chamalla extract?
Tory Dont answer that.
Reporter How often do you hallucinate?
Tory All right, enough of this crap. Were done here.
Roslin Tory.
Tory You vultures can go pick over another carcass.
Roslin Tory! Come here. Ill see you inside. Thank you.
Roslin Im sorry. Temperatures are running a little high in the fleet these days. Whos next? Karen.
Karen Madam President. How long do you have to live?
Roslin How long do you have to live, Karen?
Tory You handled that well.
Roslin You didnt. Pick over another carcass? As opposed to mine? Thats gonna look good in the press.
Tory I... I dont even know why I said that.
Roslin What is up with you? Youve been off your game for days. Youre distracted. Youre exhausted. Youre just--you know, frankly, youre plain obnoxious.
Tory I just havent been sleeping very well.
Roslin You need to pull it together and focus on your job fast. Or I can find someone who can handle the press. As well a pull a comb through their hair once a week.
Helo Lieutenant.
Gaeta Oh. Morning, XO.
Helo Morning. Its just temporary. The Colonel will... pull it together.
Gaeta Right.
Gaeta Were using the tylium ship as a decoy to lead the Cylons along this course here, almost directly opposite to ours. When they reach this point here, theyll recalibrate their FTL, start jumping back to rendezvous with Galactica and the rest of the Fleet here, at the Ionian Nebula.
Helo Any indication the Cylons are following them?
Gaeta Nothing yet, and it would appear theyve stopped following us as well. Our trailing Raptor has yet to pick up any sign of pursuit since the tylium ship left the fleet.
Helo How many jumps till we reach the nebula?
Gaeta Uh, its hard to believe. Were down to the last three.
Helo Good!
Gaeta Uh, anything else, sir?
Helo No, no, I was just, uh... Just remembering back on Caprica when the weather was about to change, youd -- youd get this smell in the air. I mean, the sun could be out, not a cloud in the sky, but youd pick up this smell and you knew that, um, something was just over the horizon. Weathers changing, Felix. We need to be ready for it. Theres a storm coming.
