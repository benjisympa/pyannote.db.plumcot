dr_gaius_baltar Previously, on Battlestar Galactica...
president_laura_roslin The Cylons have established a human police force... Hundreds of us have been rounded up by the Cylons, held in detention. Questioned. Tortured.
dr_gaius_baltar Whats this?
Three#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode19 This orders the summary executions of all the detainees listed on the next page. It requires your signature.
Doral_cocking_a_gun#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode19 Sign it! Sign your name!
samuel_anders The Cylons knew exactly where we were gonna be.
Ellen#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode19 I want to explain.
samuel_anders She sold us out. You know what has to be done here. Now it would be better for her sake if it was you.
president_laura_roslin Youre not afraid to represent the most hated man alive?
romo_lampkin Id like to see my client.
romo_lampkin If they want to kill me, theyll find a way.
marine_allan_nowart No!
admiral_william_adama with Baltars lawyer injured, his defense will need help.
cpt_lee_adama Dad, why not me? Im close to the case. Ive read the documents.
admiral_william_adama Youre a CAG, youre not a lawyer. I will not allow you to sit across the courtroom on the other side defending Gaius Baltar.
cpt_lee_adama Is that an order?
admiral_william_adama Im through giving you orders.
president_laura_roslin Hera? Hera!
lt_felix_gaeta We finally got
admiral_william_adama So the Fleets ready to jump again. How many more before we find the nebula?
lt_felix_gaeta Im estimating an even dozen.
admiral_william_adama Were getting close. Still no sign of the Cylons.
lt_felix_gaeta No, sir. Weve left a trailing bird at every jump site. No dradis contacts, no sightings, nothing.
admiral_william_adama Alter the mission orders of the trailing Raptor. Tell them to remain an additional six hours before catching up with the fleet.
lt_felix_gaeta Yes, sir.
lt_brendan_constanza yeah! Woo-hoo! Youre up, superstar.
samuel_anders You know this games got frak all to do with the real thing, right?
lt_hamish_mccall I didnt hear you nuggets say that in the beginning.
samuel_anders I dont really care what anybody...
samuel_anders -- There, go back. You almost had it.
ensign_diana_seelix had what?
samuel_anders That song. You dont hear that song?
ensign_diana_seelix No. Come on, youre up. Lets go.
samuel_anders Yeah, yeah, yeah.
tory_foster Baltar was instrumental in the Cylon attack on the Colonies. The President wants him charged with genocide.
didi_cassidy I cant make it stick. Theres no evidence of his involvement in...
tory_foster -- The President saw him with one of the Sixes on Caprica. Before the attacks.
didi_cassidy You really want me to put Laura Roslin on the stand to testify about her drug-induced visions?
tory_foster What we want is for you to do your job and convict him. If you cant do that, well find someone who will.
didi_cassidy This is a courtesy meeting, not a strategy session. I am charging Baltar with what I can prove. Of course, I do serve at the pleasure of the President. And if she decides to replace me, Im sure there are other lawyers willing to take up the case. If there
woman Dr. Baltar?
dr_gaius_baltar Who are you? Oh. Look, Im terribly sorry. Im under strict instructions from my attorney not to speak to any members of the press.
woman Oh! No, Dr. Baltar, I-- I want you to look at this picture. This is my son. Hes sick, and I want you to bless him.
dr_gaius_baltar Bless him? Guard! Im terribly sorry, madam.
woman Please--
dr_gaius_baltar I cant help you. Im not God the God, or God of any derivation thereof.
woman Please--
dr_gaius_baltar I cant bless him. Im sorry, I dont have any special powers.
woman I believe in you.
dr_gaius_baltar Well, thats very flattering.
woman Just please take it.
dr_gaius_baltar What the hells going on here? This place is becoming like a zoo.
woman Just, please... Will you just take it?
dr_gaius_baltar Im on trial for my life. I need a bit of privacy, please...
woman -- Just take it and pray for him, please! Please.
Guard#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode19 its time to go.
dr_gaius_baltar Ill do my best.
woman You can save him.
dr_gaius_baltar Yeah, mind how you go now.
number_six How many is that now?
dr_gaius_baltar Five.
number_six Not including the thirty or forty whove written letters.
dr_gaius_baltar Mm-hmm. Well, I suppose it cant be helped. Celebrity trials invariably bring out the crazies.
number_six So you think theyre crazy. See, I saw a woman in pain. I saw a woman who can see you more clearly than you can see yourself. Even if they kill you, your name will live on forever.
racetrack Galactica, Raptor 289. Were clear and in position for rear guard picket.
colonel_saul_tigh Roger, 289er. Have fun watching our ass, Racetrack.
racetrack Have fun watching Baltars ass get nailed. All right, get comfortable. Twelve hours and counting.
lt_hamish_mccall Twelve hours hanging out here like bait on a hook waiting to see if the Cylons are still following us.
racetrack Just shut up and deal, okay?
didi_cassidy How do we measure loss? How do we measure loss? We measure it in the faces of the dead. The faces that haunt our memories and our dreams. How do we measure loss? We measure it in our own faces. The ones we see in the mirror every day. Because it has marked each of us. So how do we measure loss? When the scale of it becomes... too hard to absorb any other way, we use numbers. How many killed. How many maimed. How many missing. And when those numbers become too vast to comprehend, as they did two years ago, we had to turn it around. We began to count the living. Those of us who survived to continue the saga of the human race. 44,035. The sum total of survivors from the Twelve Colonies who settled on New Caprica with President Gaius Baltar as their leader and protector. 38,838. Our number the day after we escaped. And the missing number, the one that no one wants to face. 5197. 5197 of us killed, left behind, or simply disappeared. 5,197 of all that remains of the human race. Lost.
didi_cassidy The citizens of the Twelve Colonies entrusted their fates and the lives to Gaius Baltar. What we received was a reign of terror that staggers our minds and breaks our hearts. Instead of governance, we got tyranny. Instead of justice, we got oppression. Instead of a president, we got a murderer. Today, humanity holds him accountable for his crime. Gaius Baltar is not a victim. Gaius Baltar chose to side with the Cylons and to actively seek the deaths of his fellow citizens. For that... he must pay the ultimate price.
romo_lampkin Your honors, the defense would like to change our plea to guilty.
captain_doyle_franks What? Counselor, are you sure you want to do that?
romo_lampkin No. But what choice do I have? I mean, its obvious my client is guilty.
romo_lampkin Hes a traitor and a killer. Hes no better than the Cylon, and what do we do with them?
Man#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode19 Throw em out the airlock!
romo_lampkin Thats right! Throw em out the airlock! This man sold us to our enemy. This man is our enemy. And if theres one thing thats good in war, that is right and just and proper, its slaughtering our enemy! Getting some righteous payback! What are we waiting for? Lets just kill him now! Itd be easier, wouldnt it? Simpler. Justice of the mob. Its what they want.
romo_lampkin Especially her. Shes been wanting this for over a year now. Ever since he beat her in a free and fair election of the people. Now she gets a chance to exact her revenge upon a man whose only real crime is bowing to the inevitable! Gaius Baltar saved the lives of the people on New Caprica. Where Laura Roslin wouldve seen us all dead, victims of a battle we had no hope in winning! I dont know about you, but Im glad she wasnt the president when the Cylons arrived and said, Surrender, or die. I owe my life to Gaius Baltar and the decision he made that day. And so does Laura Roslin.
lt_hamish_mccall ...Yeah, like you frakkin know.
racetrack I know you wank it in your rack. Ladies man.
lt_hamish_mccall You see, thats called self-healing.
racetrack Okay, time check.
racetrack Oh, we got something. Lots of company!
lt_hamish_mccall Reading three, four... No, five baseships! Crap, theyre right on top of us!
racetrack Frak. Frak, incoming!
lt_hamish_mccall The FTLs still spinning up.
racetrack We gotta jump! Now, Godsdamn it! Now!
admiral_william_adama Begin searching the entire fleet for tracking devices. Its possible they couldve placed one on a ship on New Caprica.
president_laura_roslin I think that we should ask the Six. She may be willing to help.
colonel_saul_tigh Baltars girlfriend. And why would she do that?
president_laura_roslin Because she does not want to see Hera go back to the Cylons.
colonel_saul_tigh You think that thing would stick her neck out for some half-Cylon whelp?
president_laura_roslin I have a feeling shed lay her life down for it.
colonel_saul_tigh A feeling?
president_laura_roslin Its more than a feeling,
admiral_william_adama All right? Why...
president_laura_roslin Just do it. It doesnt hurt to ask.
admiral_william_adama No...
admiral_william_adama Ask the prisoner if it knows of any tracking devices in the fleet.
colonel_saul_tigh With pleasure.
colonel_saul_tigh The President, Gods bless her sunny optimistic soul, thinks you might want to share how your buddies have been tracking us. So Im here to ask the question and listen to your lies.
number_six In the last battle, we discovered your fuel ship... had a unique radiation signature. They mustve found a way to track it.
colonel_saul_tigh What else do you know? What other secrets are rattling around inside that mechanical brain?
Chip_Gaius#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode19 Dont be intimidated by him. Hes just using you to exorcise his own pain. Poor old sod. He lost someone close to him. Oh, you know how that feels, dont you?
number_six I know a lot of things.
number_six You want to know one thing I know? I know about your loss. Hurts, doesnt it? You wonder how you can even survive it.
colonel_saul_tigh I dont know what youre talking about. But its not gonna work.
Chip_Gaius#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode19 she was his world. Of course, he only realized when she was gone.
number_six Did she know? Did she know? Did she know how much she meant to you? Or did you wait to tell her till she was gone?
colonel_saul_tigh What?
number_six Bet you made her think that she was a burden. A millstone around your neck. But then you humans always destroy the ones who love you, dont you...
colonel_saul_tigh Shackle this thing.
didi_cassidy ...Colonel Tigh?
colonel_saul_tigh Excuse me. What was the question again?
didi_cassidy As the leader of the insurgency, did you ever hear of an instance in which Baltar stood up to the Cylons or tried to disrupt their plans?
colonel_saul_tigh Oh, no, never. He never lifted a frakkin finger to help us. Ellen did more. At least she was trying to... To help us.
cpt_lee_adama My Gods, hes drunk.
didi_cassidy Yes. Yes, Ellen. Your wife. Another victim of Baltars Cylon allies.
colonel_saul_tigh Yeah, thats right. Yep.
didi_cassidy Thank you, Colonel. Your witness.
romo_lampkin What happened to the Colonels wife?
cpt_lee_adama She used to work for one of the Cylon administrators.
romo_lampkin She worked for them?
cpt_lee_adama Mm.
romo_lampkin You know what happened to her?
cpt_lee_adama No, no idea. I presume she died in the exodus from New Caprica.
romo_lampkin Ah. Ahem. Colonel.
colonel_saul_tigh Hmm.
romo_lampkin You dislike Gaius Baltar because you consider him to be a traitor. Is that correct?
colonel_saul_tigh And a coward, and a mass murderer.
romo_lampkin The suicide bombing of the police graduation. Gaius Baltar was the intended target, was he not?
colonel_saul_tigh And if hed had the guts to show up that day like he was supposed to, you and I wouldnt be having this conversation right now.
romo_lampkin So you ordered the killing of-- what was it? 33 other men and women, just for the chance to kill Gaius Baltar.
colonel_saul_tigh They were all traitors. Anyone who put on that uniform. But yes, he was the target.
romo_lampkin What happened to your wife?
didi_cassidy Exception. Relevance?
romo_lampkin The door was opened on direct, your honors.
admiral_william_adama I fail to see the point of pursuing this...
judge_2 Hes right, Admiral, if it was brought up during direct examination, than it can be pursued in the cross. Overruled. Continue.
romo_lampkin What happened to your wife, colonel?
colonel_saul_tigh You frakkin son of a bitch--
romo_lampkin isnt it true that she collaborated openly with the Cylons? That she actually worked for them.
colonel_saul_tigh She was faking it. Making them think that she was working for them.
romo_lampkin I-I see, yeah. And Baltar, he wasnt faking it, no.
colonel_saul_tigh Thats right.
romo_lampkin And you blame him for her death. Have you been drinking today, colonel?
colonel_saul_tigh I had a drink. I havent been drinking.
romo_lampkin You used to like to drink with Ellen, I imagine.
colonel_saul_tigh You hear that? Theyre playing music in here now?
romo_lampkin Gaius Baltar didnt order the death of your wife. Colonel, that was somebody else. Who was it, colonel? Who killed Ellen? Come on, colonel, were waiting. Tell us. Who was it? Who killed Ellen?
colonel_saul_tigh I did. I did. I did. She was giving information to the Cylons. A lot of good men died. She was my wife. It was my responsibility. She did it for me. Thats what she said. To save me from going back to prison so they could tear more pieces off me. So I killed her. All because of that thing over there. All because Gaius frakkin Baltar didnt have the guts to stand up to the Cylons. Because he handed our fates over to the Cylons, I had to kill my Ellen.
romo_lampkin so Gaius Baltar made you kill your wife. Thats why you hate him. And thats why youd say anything to see him die.
colonel_saul_tigh Youre Godsdamned right i would. I would do anything... say anything... to see that man die a painful death.
romo_lampkin No further questions.
colonel_saul_tigh Will someone turn off that music?!
reporter_1 Earlier today, protestors were arrested on...
Nuggets#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode19 ...Okay, are you hearing anything Im saying? Shut up! My Gods.
Report#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode19 A contingency of Colonial Marines were deployed to the ship...
Bartender#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode19 What can I get you?
tory_foster I dont know what I want. You figure it out. Youre the bartender.
Bartender#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode19 Okay. Tell you what. Ill surprise you.
samuel_anders Yes, finally! Thank you! About time. Im not a bad coach, huh?
president_laura_roslin ...One more time?
didi_cassidy Yeah.
president_laura_roslin I was grading papers in the schoolhouse at night and they came again. Fortunately, the children were gone. It was after dark. They took close to 200 of our people that night. Under Baltars direct orders. As it turned out, all of our names were on a death list signed by Dr. Baltar.
didi_cassidy Let us be crystal clear on this fact. You are saying that the defendant, Gaius Baltar, ordered your execution and the execution of 200 other people?
president_laura_roslin Yes, indeed. Thats exactly what Im saying.
romo_lampkin We need to talk.
dr_gaius_baltar We need to find something, anything, that can discredit her testimony. Shes a fanatic, right?
romo_lampkin I dont know if thats gonna help. Youre awfully quiet.
romo_lampkin Youre awfully quiet.
cpt_lee_adama I was just listening.
romo_lampkin You see, your problem is that Im a really good liar and youre not. So lets have it.
cpt_lee_adama Have what?
dr_gaius_baltar My Gods, hes right. You do know something. You know something and youre not saying.
cpt_lee_adama Its probably not even true.
romo_lampkin I like it already.
cpt_lee_adama Its a personal matter. I doubt shed ever say anything in front of me.
dr_gaius_baltar She? She? This is about Laura Roslin? And youre not... Tell me, tell me!
romo_lampkin Shut up. Enjoying yourself so far?
cpt_lee_adama Huh?
romo_lampkin Having a good time sticking it to the old man defending the most hated person in the universe?
cpt_lee_adama Thats not why I agreed to do this.
romo_lampkin No, you just decided to stand up for truth and justice and all those other lovely things we inscribe upon courtroom doors.
cpt_lee_adama Yeah. Thats exactly what Im doing. Because I believe in the system. I really believe. I even believe that our lowlife pond scum of a client actually deserves a fair trial.
romo_lampkin The system requires that you tell what you know, which leaves you with one of two uncomfortable options. First, share the information, and in so doing, uphold the very principles that you claim to hold so dear. Or second, keep em to yourself and prove once and for all your only purpose here is to jab your father in the eye and make a mockery of the entire justice system.
cpt_lee_adama Thats very nice. Very, very nice, but I know why Im here. I dont need to prove it to you or to anyone else.
romo_lampkin Youre wrong. You need to prove it to yourself, or you leave that courtroom out there knowing you kept a secret that couldve saved that mans miserable life. Now unless I greatly misjudged your character, thats not something that Lee Adama wishes on his conscience. So whatll it be, Major? Sit on the sidelines mouthing pieties, or are you gonna get in this trial and give us something we can use?
admiral_william_adama Come on. Come on. There we go.
colonel_saul_tigh Here we go.
admiral_william_adama Give me that. Youve had enough of that already.
admiral_william_adama Attaboy... Got some good news today. We found the radiation signature on the tylium ship. Just like the Cylon prisoner said we would.
colonel_saul_tigh Good. Thats great.
admiral_william_adama Being repaired as we speak. Mr. Gaeta estimates the fleets nine jumps away from the nebula. Considering how long its gonna take to fix the tylium ship, were out... maybe three days. Three days out from the next clue on the road to Earth.
colonel_saul_tigh Cant smell her. I cant smell her anymore, bill. I kept her clothes... but her smell is gone now.
admiral_william_adama I gotta go, Saul. Gotta retire.
colonel_saul_tigh Im sorry about all that in court.
admiral_william_adama Theres nothing to be sorry about.
colonel_saul_tigh I embarrassed you. Made you look bad.
admiral_william_adama Youre my oldest friend, Saul. You never embarrass me. Get some rest.
cpt_lee_adama Can a former CAG make a radical suggestion to the admiral? What if we dont fix the tylium ship?
admiral_william_adama Repairs have already started.
cpt_lee_adama I realize that, but hear me out. Were too close to the nebula to simply fix the problem and hope the Cylons cant guess where were going. So if we dont fix it, if instead we send the ship off on a new course with a couple of raptors riding shotgun, let them make a few jumps before rejoining the fleet, it might throw the Cylons off.
admiral_william_adama Its a good idea. Ill take it into consideration. Is there anything else?
cpt_lee_adama Hows the president?
admiral_william_adama What?
cpt_lee_adama Is she okay? She looked a little rattled in court yesterday.
admiral_william_adama We cant talk about the trial outside of court, you know that. Or you should.
cpt_lee_adama I know. I wasnt asking about...
admiral_william_adama after what you did to Tigh, youre the last person I would consider to confide in.
cpt_lee_adama Me? I didnt do anything to Tigh. He was drunk. Its really not my fault.
admiral_william_adama You told Lampkin about Ellen.
cpt_lee_adama I didnt know about Ellen.
admiral_william_adama Yeah, right.
cpt_lee_adama Youre calling me a liar?
admiral_william_adama Im calling you a liar and a coward. one who doesnt have the guts to go after a man himself. Instead, you hand the shiv to a stranger and let him stab Tigh in the back. And for what? Traitorous piece of garbage Gaius Baltar. Doesnt even deserve a trial.
cpt_lee_adama Are you done?
admiral_william_adama Yes.
cpt_lee_adama Then so am I. I will not serve under a man who questions my integrity.
admiral_william_adama And I wont have an officer under my command who doesnt have any.
cpt_lee_adama Ill see you in court, Admiral.
cpt_lee_adama Let me do this.
romo_lampkin What? Are you sure, major?
cpt_lee_adama Its... Its mister now. And yeah, Im sure. It should be me.
dr_gaius_baltar Youre not seriously gonna let my security guard...
captain_doyle_franks Were waiting, Mr. Lampkin.
romo_lampkin If itd please the court, my associate, Mr. Adama, will question the witness.
admiral_william_adama His associate.
captain_doyle_franks The defense may proceed.
romo_lampkin thank you.
cpt_lee_adama Madam President, arent you alive today because of Gaius Baltar?
president_laura_roslin Im alive today because the insurgents managed to stop the execution.
cpt_lee_adama Well, they saved you from a Cylon firing squad, but...wasnt it Baltar who saved your life when you were dying from cancer?
didi_cassidy Relevance?
cpt_lee_adama Uh, your honors...
romo_lampkin Hostile witness, your honors, if the court would grant us just a little latitude.
captain_doyle_franks Well allow it.
romo_lampkin Thank you.
cpt_lee_adama Um... did Gaius Baltar save your life when you were dying from cancer?
president_laura_roslin Dr. Baltars scientific knowledge did save my life indeed.
cpt_lee_adama Can you be more specific? How did he save your life on that occasion?
president_laura_roslin He injected me with the blood of a half-Cylon, half-human baby.
cpt_lee_adama And your cancer vanished.
president_laura_roslin Completely.
cpt_lee_adama During your illness, what sort of medication were you on?
president_laura_roslin You know, I was taking a lot of medications at the time, and I dont remember all their names.
cpt_lee_adama Did you take something called chamalla extract?
president_laura_roslin Hmph. Yes.
cpt_lee_adama Isnt it true that one of the side effects of taking chamalla is a propensity to experience hallucinations?
president_laura_roslin Yes, that is one of the possible side effects of chamalla.
cpt_lee_adama And isnt it also true that the visions that you once described as messages from the Gods were actually the result of a pharmacological reaction from taking chamalla?
president_laura_roslin The chamalla did enable me to see certain things that were foretold by the scriptures. Things that will help this fleet find its way to Earth. You of all people should know that, Major.
didi_cassidy Your Honors.
captain_doyle_franks Mr. Adama, where are you going with this?
cpt_lee_adama Just one more question, your honor.
president_laura_roslin Please dont do this. Please.
cpt_lee_adama Madam President, are you taking chamalla at this time?
president_laura_roslin Captain Apollo. You remember that? I always thought it had such a nice ring to it. I am so, so sorry for you now.
cpt_lee_adama Chamalla, Madam President. Perhaps dissolved in your tea to mask the bitterness?
admiral_william_adama Dont answer. Im putting a stop to this right now.
cpt_lee_adama Your honors, if she is on drugs, it goes to her credibility as a witness.
admiral_william_adama Witness is dismissed!
romo_lampkin Your honors, I have to strongly object. Hes obviously trying to cover something up here.
admiral_william_adama one more word from you, and youll both be held for contempt.
judge_2 Admiral! Id like to hear the witness answer the question.
captain_doyle_franks As would I.
cpt_lee_adama Madam President, are you taking chamalla again?
president_laura_roslin Yes, I am.
cpt_lee_adama No further questions.
president_laura_roslin Mr. Adama, arent you going to ask me why?
cpt_lee_adama Im sorry?
president_laura_roslin Why am I taking chamalla again?
cpt_lee_adama Its not strictly relevant.
president_laura_roslin Well, perhaps its not relevant to you, but its relevant to me. Go ahead. Ask me why. Finish what you started.
cpt_lee_adama Why are you taking the chamalla again, Madam President?
president_laura_roslin I am taking chamalla again because my cancer has returned.
cpt_lee_adama You know, the fact that shes having hallucinations is relevant to Baltars defense. Thats the way the system works, Dee. The accused has a right to challenge the credibility of witnesses against him. Thats just the way it is.
officer_anastasia_dualla The system is broken, Lee. The system elected that man to be President, and the systems trying to let him walk. That is not a system that deserves to be defended. It deserves to be taken apart and put back together again.
cpt_lee_adama You know, I wish... I wish I could make you understand.
officer_anastasia_dualla I do understand, Lee. And its why Im leaving.
cpt_lee_adama Well, you dont. You frakkin dont!
reporter_1 Madam President, how long have you known about the cancer?
president_laura_roslin About a week.
reporter_1 And how advanced is the disease?
reporter_1 Uh, will you be getting any more transfusions from the half-Cylon donor?
president_laura_roslin You know, this is the kind of detail Im not gonna go into now. You know, were looking at a game plan. Ill let you know when we have one.
reporter_1 Well, how will the treatment for your illness impact your duties as president?
president_laura_roslin So far, it hasnt at all.
reporter_1 Are you currently taking chamalla extract?
tory_foster Dont answer that.
reporter_1 How often do you hallucinate?
tory_foster All right, enough of this crap. Were done here.
president_laura_roslin Tory.
tory_foster You vultures can go pick over another carcass.
president_laura_roslin Tory! Come here. Ill see you inside. Thank you.
president_laura_roslin Im sorry. Temperatures are running a little high in the fleet these days. Whos next? Karen.
karen_fallbrook Madam President. How long do you have to live?
president_laura_roslin How long do you have to live, Karen?
tory_foster You handled that well.
president_laura_roslin You didnt. Pick over another carcass? As opposed to mine? Thats gonna look good in the press.
tory_foster I... I dont even know why I said that.
president_laura_roslin What is up with you? Youve been off your game for days. Youre distracted. Youre exhausted. Youre just--you know, frankly, youre plain obnoxious.
tory_foster I just havent been sleeping very well.
president_laura_roslin You need to pull it together and focus on your job fast. Or I can find someone who can handle the press. As well a pull a comb through their hair once a week.
captain_karl_agathon Lieutenant.
lt_felix_gaeta Oh. Morning, XO.
captain_karl_agathon Morning. Its just temporary. The Colonel will... pull it together.
lt_felix_gaeta Right.
lt_felix_gaeta Were using the tylium ship as a decoy to lead the Cylons along this course here, almost directly opposite to ours. When they reach this point here, theyll recalibrate their FTL, start jumping back to rendezvous with Galactica and the rest of the Fleet here, at the Ionian Nebula.
captain_karl_agathon Any indication the Cylons are following them?
lt_felix_gaeta Nothing yet, and it would appear theyve stopped following us as well. Our trailing Raptor has yet to pick up any sign of pursuit since the tylium ship left the fleet.
captain_karl_agathon How many jumps till we reach the nebula?
lt_felix_gaeta Uh, its hard to believe. Were down to the last three.
captain_karl_agathon Good!
lt_felix_gaeta Uh, anything else, sir?
captain_karl_agathon No, no, I was just, uh... Just remembering back on Caprica when the weather was about to change, youd -- youd get this smell in the air. I mean, the sun could be out, not a cloud in the sky, but youd pick up this smell and you knew that, um, something was just over the horizon. Weathers changing, Felix. We need to be ready for it. Theres a storm coming.
