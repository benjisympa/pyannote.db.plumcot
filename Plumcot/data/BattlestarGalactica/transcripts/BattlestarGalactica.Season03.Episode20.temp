Adama This is it?
Helo Thats it. The Ionian Nebula. So what do you think well find? Beacon? Temple? Sign post to Earth?
Adama How many more jumps before we find the Nebula?
Gaeta Im estimating an even dozen. Were getting close.
Adama Still no sign of the Cylons.
Anders There, go back, you almost had it.
Tigh Had what?
Anders That song. You dont hear that song?
Tigh Its in the frakking ship!
Woman This is my son.
Baltar I am very sorry for your loss, but I am not responsible.
Woman I know. Hes sick, and I want you to bless him.
Baltar Bless him?
Cassidy You are saying that the defendant, Gaius Baltar, ordered your execution and the execution of two hundred other people?
Roslin Thats exactly what Im saying.
Gaeta This a death warrant. Have you seen the names on this list? Do you have any idea what they will do out there?
Cassidy Gaius Baltar chose to side with the Cylons and to actively seek the deaths of his fellow citizens.
Lee Madam President, are you taking chamalla at this time?
Adama Dont answer. Im putting a stop to this right now.
Lee Your Honors, if she is on drugs it goes to her credibility as a witness.
Roslin I am taking chamalla again because my cancer has returned.
Adama Im calling you a liar and a coward. For what? Traitorous piece of garbage Gaius Baltar. He doesnt even deserve a trial.
Lee I will not serve under a man who questions my integrity.
Adama And I wont have an officer under my command who doesnt have any.
Adama_shaves_cutting_himself_as_the_lights_flicker Frak me.
Adama_answers_the_phone Yes.
Roslin_on_the_phone Yell at me. I dont want to get out of bed.
Adama Well, you called the wrong number. I was just thinking about going back to bed.
Roslin You feeling okay?
Adama Says the cancer patient. Yeah, Im fine. I just cut myself. How are you doing?
Roslin I dont want to face them. I dont want to face any of them. I just want to stay in bed all day and sleep.
Adama I think I stopped the bleeding... If you still need to be yelled at, I think I can give you some volume.
Roslin Okay. All right, give it your best shot.
Adama Get out of that bed!
Roslin Thats not your best shot.
Adama Get your fat, lazy ass out of that rack, Roslin!
Roslin Yes, sir. Okay, sir. Anything you say, sir. Thank you.
Adama Dont let em see you sweat, Laura.
Anders Come here.
Tory I cant.
Anders Come here.
Tory I gotta go back to the
Anders You dont have to go anywhere.
Tory_breaking_away What is that music? Gods.
Anders What did you just say?
Anders_stands_up_at_a_knock_on_the_hatch Frak. Yeah, coming.
Seelix_grinning Hey, whys the door locked?
Anders Sorry.
Lee We should go for a mistrial.
Baltar What? Whats he talking about? What are you talking about? Mistrial? Whatever for?
Lee Because were losing.
Baltar Not from where Im standing. Were actually doing quite well. Were about to break the prosecution. Weve blown two of their key witnesses out of the water. What more do we need to do, for Gods sakes?
Lee Everyone in that courtroom hates you. Everyone. Including the judges. You didnt hear what my father just called you: A traitorous piece of garbage, a man who doesnt even deserve a trial.
Romo He said that? He actually said that?
Lee Yes, he did. And I dont think hes the only one up there.
Romo I agree. Our tactical victories are pissing them off.
Baltar Right, so now because were winning were losing, actually.
Romo Perverse, isnt it? one of the reasons why I love what I do.
Lee Forcing a mistrial may seem of little benefit to either side, but in fact, it can be a boon to the defense. The prosecutions shown their hand at retrial, the defense has all the tactical advantages, and the statistical chances of an acquittal rise by twenty-five percent.
Baltar Joseph Adama.
Romo Smart man, your grandfather.
Baltar Yeah, well, I can see why youd want a mistrial.
Lee Whats that supposed to mean?
Baltar Thatd be the quickest way for you to absolve all your responsibility. Wash your hands of the whole affair. You get back to your life. You [
TV Yesterday marked a surprising turn of events in the trial of Dr. Gaius Baltar, when Colonel Tigh admitted...

Anders Chief.
Chief_continues_to_hum Hey, Sam.
Anders That song youre humming. What is that?
Chief Oh... You know what, I dont even know. Its just something I cant get out of my head. Some... Some way out of here...
Anders Ive been hearing that. Everywhere. on a boom box, you know, in the bar?
Chief_ushering_him_away Come here. You hear that song?
Anders Yeah. Its freaking me out. I hear it everywhere, I mean, but I cant... but I cant really hear it, you know what I mean?
Chief Yeah, its like you can grab just a part of the melody and then it goes away. Like its something from ...
Both Childhood.
Anders Exactly.
Racetrack Yo, Anders! Do you need a frakking invitation? Move it!
Anders All right. No reason to get excited.
Cottle Well, congratulations. Youve survived your first doloxan treatment.
Roslin Talk about the cure being worse than the disease.
Cottle Next time bring a book or some paperwork. Itll keep your mind off of it and itll also keep your blood pressure down. Now if you excuse me, I do have some other patients.
Roslin_rolling_onto_her_side_in_pain All right, go. Oh, gods.
Roslin Hera!
Cottle Whats going on? Youre both freaking out at the same time?
Roslin We need a moment. [
Cottle Will somebody please tell me what the hell is going on?
Roslin_to_Marines Go outside. Thank you, well be fine. Shut the door.
Marine Yes, maam.
Roslin Im sorry about the shackles. [
Athena I was there too. And so was Hera.
Caprica That shouldnt be possible.
Athena Add it to the list.
Roslin Were you trying to reach Hera?
Caprica I dont know. I just knew that I had to protect her with my life.
Tigh Im telling you, Bill. They put the music in the ship. I can hear it.
Adama_standing I believe you. Ill look into it.
Tigh Youll look into it? Youll look into it? I am here telling you there is Cylon sabotage aboard our ship!
Adama Sabotage. With music.
Tigh I know, I know. I cant quite understand it myself, but... Theres too much confusion.
Adama I promise Ill look into it. Now I have to get to court.
Tigh Okay. Go to court.
Tigh_alone There must be some kind of way out of here...
Cassidy Do you recognize this document, Lieutenant?
Gaeta Yes, I do. Its a death list issued on New Caprica by the office of the President.
Cassidy Who signed this document?
Gaeta President Gaius Baltar.
Cassidy Hmm. Could it be a forgery?
Gaeta No.
Cassidy And how do you know that it cannot be a forgery?
Gaeta Because I was there. I saw him sign it.
Baltar What? What are you talking about? You werent there! Thats a lie. Thats a total fabrication.
Franks_among_murmuring Order!
Gaeta I saw him sign it.
Cassidy Describe the scene, would you?
Gaeta The Cylons brought the document into the Presidential office. They had already selected the names. one of them -- I believe it was a Three -- gave the list to the President and said: Here are the people that are going to be executed. Please sign this. He looked at the list, he saw all the names, and then he signed it.
Cassidy Did he protest? I mean, did he argue? Did he offer any resistance whatsoever?
Doral Sign it!
Baltar I wont do it. Youre going to have to salve your consciences some other way.
Doral Sign it! Sign your name!
Gaeta No. He never did.
Baltar Oh, Felix. Oh, Felix, what are you doing? [
Lee Gaius, Gaius. Well get him in the cross.
Franks Counselor, please control your client.
Baltar Its not a secret...
Franks -- Quiet! --
Baltar -- The Fleet knows this man tried to stab me through the neck! And you missed! Butterfingers!
Romo Sorry, your Honors. [
Cassidy No further questions.
Franks Your witness, Counselor.
Romo No questions.
Baltar WHAT?
Adama Witness is dismissed.
Baltar Oh, great. What the hell are you doing?
Romo Its your word against his right now. If hes decided to perjure himself, we cant do anything to change that now. Were going to have to adjust our strategy.
Franks Is the defense prepared to present their case?
Romo Your Honors at this time, if it please the court... I would like to offer a motion. The defense would like to move for a mistrial.
Baltar No, we do not want a mistrial! I do not want a mistrial!
Franks Gaius Baltar!
Judge_#2 Behave, Dr. Baltar. on what grounds, Counselor?
Romo on the grounds that one of the panel has already prejudged the outcome of this trial and determined the guilt of the defendant.
Adama Thats a very serious charge, Mr. Lampkin. Which judge?
Romo That would be you, Admiral. And to prove it, I need to take the unusual step of calling Mr. Lee Adama to the stand.
Apollo You gotta be frakkin kidding me.
Romo Gaeta has sunk us. This is the only way were gonna win.
Lee I will not testify against my father.
Romo That is your choice. Either way, Im putting you on the stand.
Cassidy Your Honors, this is completely improper. Counsel cannot testify at trial under any circumstances.
Romo I can cite at least seven precedents off the top of my head.
Franks Call your witness, Counselor.
Romo Thank you. Mr. Adama. [
Lee Yes.
Romo At that meeting, did Admiral Adama express an opinion as to whether the defendant deserved a trial? All Im looking for is the truth here, Mr. Adama. Lets have it. Im waiting. Answer the question. You swore an oath as an officer of the Court. If you dont answer the question, you halt the entire system of justice.
Franks Mr. Adama!
Romo Im sorry, Your Honors. Please excuse my associate. All right, all right. Ill try something else. Do you believe that the defendant deserves a fair trial?
Lee As a matter of fact, I do.
Romo Why?
Lee Aside from the fact that everyone deserves a fair trial, I also believe that he is not guilty of the charges before the Court...
Cassidy Your Honors, I must insist on an exception here. He cannot testify in this manner. It is completely improper.
Lee I agree.
Cassidy He can make his arguments in closing statements, not on the stand.
Franks Im inclined to agree with the prosecution.
Cassidy Thank you.
Adama You can appeal to the President if you feel that this influences the verdict, but I for one would like to hear this witness testify.
Judge_#2 I would second that.
Franks Continue.
Romo Thank you, your Honors. Mr. Adama? Mr. Adama!
Lee Yes.
Romo Why do you believe that the defendant, Gaius Baltar, deserves to be acquitted?
Lee Well, because the evidence does not support the charges.
Romo Come on...
Lee Did the defendant make mistakes? Sure, he did. Serious mistakes. But did he actually commit any crimes? Did he commit treason? No. I mean, it was an impossible situation. When the Cylons arrived, what could he possibly do? What could anyone have done? I mean, ask yourself, what would you have done? What would you have done? If he had refused to surrender, the Cylons wouldve probably nuked the planet right then and there. So did he appear to cooperate with the Cylons? Sure. So did hundreds of others. Whats the difference between him and them? The President issued a blanket pardon. They were all forgiven. No questions asked. Colonel Tigh. Colonel Tigh used suicide bombers, killed dozens of people. Forgiven. Lieutenant Agathon and Chief Tyrol. They murdered an officer on the
Franks Order. Order!
Lee This case... This case is built on emotion. on anger, bitterness, vengeance. But most of all, it is built on shame. Its about the shame of what we did to ourselves back on that planet. And its about the guilt of those of us who ran away. Who ran away. And we are trying to dump all that guilt and all that shame onto one man, and then flush him out the airlock and hope that that just gets rid of it all. So that we can live with ourselves. But that wont work. That wont work. Thats not justice. Not to me. Not to me.
Romo ...No further questions.
Cassidy Your Honors, I wish to reiterate my strong exception to defense counsels testimony.
Franks Exception noted.
Cassidy Thank you.
Franks Did you want to cross-examine the witness?
Cassidy I have no question for defense counsel.
Franks Witness is excused. Do you want to call any other witnesses?
Romo Your Honors, I dont wish to belabor this any longer. The defense rests.
Franks Very well. This court will adjourn to consider a verdict.
Baltar What a glorious moment in jurisprudence.
Roslin_to_Cassidy You did a great job.
Bailiff All rise.
Franks Before I read the verdict, Id like to make one thing clear. Like everything human, justice is imperfect. Its flawed. But its those very imperfections that separates [
Cassidy You won.
Romo Good job.
Baltar_to_the_press I always knew that I was going to be acquitted, but the fact I have been found innocent shouldnt disguise that this trial has been a total pantomime!
Rioter Assassin!
Lee Admiral, you gotta get him out of here!
Lee Get him back. Get him out of here! Get him away!
Baltar I knew right from the very start that if there was a way to demonstrate the sheer -- Whats the word Im looking for? Hypocrisy. Hypocrisy is the word Im looking for --
Romo Well, your boundless confidence provided us with great solace throughout proceedings.
Baltar Look, I want to thank you both. Truly. From the bottom of my heart, I am very, very grateful for all youve done. on a personal note, if I couldve seen the Admiral squirm just a bit more, it wouldnt have hurt.
Lee_grabbing_him Now you listen. Dont push it, Doctor.
Baltar Fine. Romo, perhaps we can have a chat. Ive thought about maybe doing a book tour around the Fleet, and theres the publishing rights, there are issues about my security, where I will live, what I will do. Since weve forged this great relationship during the trial, I thought, you know, who better to think about...
Romo Actually, now that the Fleets legal system is in place, my not-so-inconsiderable talents are required elsewhere. So Im afraid this is the end of our journey.
Baltar Wait a minute, what... What about me? Wait a minute, wait, please. Think about this for a second. Where will I live? What am I gonna do? How am I going to survive?
Romo Much as I hate to use a cat metaphor, Doctor, I think youll land on your feet. Close the door on your way out.
Lee Romo, one thing. When you put me on the stand, did you know what was gonna happen?
Romo I knew you were an honest man, Mr. Adama. Much unlike your grandfather.
Roslin Gaius Baltar is innocent. Just the sound of that makes my skin crawl.
Adama Not guilty is not the same as innocent.
Roslin It mustve been particularly difficult for you. What, you just... couldnt get the other two guys to budge? [
Adama I hate to say it. Defense made their case, the prosecution didnt.
Roslin Gaius Baltar is a traitor. We both know that. Regardless of the outcome of this trial.
Adama No ones asking anyone to forget. Or to forgive. But we have to look to the future. [
Gaeta Yes, Sir.
Adama Commence jump prep. Were going to the Ionian Nebula.
Gaeta Yes, Sir.
Pilot_slamming_him Excuse me.
Gaeta Jump coordinates have been distributed, Sir. All Fleet ships show green for jump formation delta.
Adama Initiate jump.
Gaeta Aye, sir. Jumping in three, two, one... jump. [
Adama Very well, Mr. Gaeta. Commence dradis scan. Lets see whats out there.
Adama Sitrep!
Gaeta Our sensors show major power fluctuations! Checking on Fleet...
Marines Guards! Two feet over!
Racetrack Nuggets on me! Nuggets on me!
Cally Grab a flashlight and turn it on!
Adama Check auxiliary power.
Dualla We have negative auxiliary power. Were on batteries only.
Gaeta Get ready for an engine restart.
CIC_Crewman DC6 needs to get down there and muster right away.
Woman Gaius. Its okay. Come with me.
Baltar Where are you taking me to?
Woman To your new life. Here. Come on.
Cally Come on. Lets get the power back up. Move it around, you know what to do.
Chief There must be some way out of here...
Tighs_head_against_the_wall ...Said the joker to the thief...
Anders_with_a_headache_in_the_pilots_racks ...Theres too much confusion....
Tory_sick_in_a_toilet ...I cant get no relief.
Tory This isnt happening. Please tell me this isnt happening.
Chief So thats it. After all this time. A switch goes off, just like that.
Tigh_entering Whoa. No way.
Anders I dont believe this. Im not buying this. This is a...This is a trick. Come on! Were not...
Tory_humming What is that... song that I...
Tigh_interrupting -- All right, thats enough, Godsdammit! Deadbolt that frakkin door! [
Anders No, no, no. Not after all this. Not after the Resistance, and the Occupation... After watching my friends die one after another? For frakking this?
Tory Sam...
Anders -- You stay the hell away from me. You all just stay the frak away from me.
Chief Sam, its true. Were Cylons. And we have been from the start.
Roslin Admiral, whats going on?
Adama Some kind of power surge. Give me a damage report immediately.
Dualla The power outage was Fleetwide, Admiral. [
Roslin_as_the_dradis_goes_crazy Admiral, Admiral!
Gaeta Dradis contact! Massive Cylon Fleet on intercept course!
Adama Mr. Gaeta, sound action stations immediately. I want an emergency jump of the entire Fleet.
Helo Sir, all Fleet ships were powered down during the outage. Itll take at least twenty minutes to spool up the FTL drives.
Adama We just dont have twenty minutes.
Gaeta Action stations, action stations. Set Condition one throughout the ship. This is not a drill. All Viper pilots report to Vipers immediately. Inbound Cylon Fleet...
Gaeta_on_radio ...I repeat, action stations, action stations. Set Condition one throughout the ship. This is not a drill....
Tory Gods. What are we gonna do?
Tigh The ship is under attack. We do our jobs. Report to your stations!
Chief Report to stations?

Pilot I cant do my job until I have my Raptor.
Deckhand Well, get in!

Chatter Lets go, lets go! Get her in the Viper, hurry!
Adama Arm and load all nuclear weapons.
Gaeta Yes, sir.
Adama Its good to see you, Colonel.
Tigh Good to be here, Admiral. You can count on me.
