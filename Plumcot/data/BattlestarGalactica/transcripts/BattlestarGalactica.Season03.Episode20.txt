admiral_william_adama This is it?
captain_karl_agathon Thats it. The Ionian Nebula. So what do you think well find? Beacon? Temple? Sign post to Earth?
admiral_william_adama How many more jumps before we find the Nebula?
lt_felix_gaeta Im estimating an even dozen. Were getting close.
admiral_william_adama Still no sign of the Cylons.
samuel_anders There, go back, you almost had it.
colonel_saul_tigh Had what?
samuel_anders That song. You dont hear that song?
colonel_saul_tigh Its in the frakking ship!
Woman#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode20 This is my son.
dr_gaius_baltar I am very sorry for your loss, but I am not responsible.
Woman#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode20 I know. Hes sick, and I want you to bless him.
dr_gaius_baltar Bless him?
didi_cassidy You are saying that the defendant, Gaius Baltar, ordered your execution and the execution of two hundred other people?
president_laura_roslin Thats exactly what Im saying.
lt_felix_gaeta This a death warrant. Have you seen the names on this list? Do you have any idea what they will do out there?
didi_cassidy Gaius Baltar chose to side with the Cylons and to actively seek the deaths of his fellow citizens.
cpt_lee_adama Madam President, are you taking chamalla at this time?
admiral_william_adama Dont answer. Im putting a stop to this right now.
cpt_lee_adama Your Honors, if she is on drugs it goes to her credibility as a witness.
president_laura_roslin I am taking chamalla again because my cancer has returned.
admiral_william_adama Im calling you a liar and a coward. For what? Traitorous piece of garbage Gaius Baltar. He doesnt even deserve a trial.
cpt_lee_adama I will not serve under a man who questions my integrity.
admiral_william_adama And I wont have an officer under my command who doesnt have any.
admiral_william_adama Frak me.
admiral_william_adama Yes.
president_laura_roslin Yell at me. I dont want to get out of bed.
admiral_william_adama Well, you called the wrong number. I was just thinking about going back to bed.
president_laura_roslin You feeling okay?
admiral_william_adama Says the cancer patient. Yeah, Im fine. I just cut myself. How are you doing?
president_laura_roslin I dont want to face them. I dont want to face any of them. I just want to stay in bed all day and sleep.
admiral_william_adama I think I stopped the bleeding... If you still need to be yelled at, I think I can give you some volume.
president_laura_roslin Okay. All right, give it your best shot.
admiral_william_adama Get out of that bed!
president_laura_roslin Thats not your best shot.
admiral_william_adama Get your fat, lazy ass out of that rack, Roslin!
president_laura_roslin Yes, sir. Okay, sir. Anything you say, sir. Thank you.
admiral_william_adama Dont let em see you sweat, Laura.

samuel_anders What did you just say?
samuel_anders Frak. Yeah, coming.
ensign_diana_seelix Hey, whys the door locked?
samuel_anders Sorry.
cpt_lee_adama We should go for a mistrial.
dr_gaius_baltar What? Whats he talking about? What are you talking about? Mistrial? Whatever for?
cpt_lee_adama Because were losing.
dr_gaius_baltar Not from where Im standing. Were actually doing quite well. Were about to break the prosecution. Weve blown two of their key witnesses out of the water. What more do we need to do, for Gods sakes?
cpt_lee_adama Everyone in that courtroom hates you. Everyone. Including the judges. You didnt hear what my father just called you: A traitorous piece of garbage, a man who doesnt even deserve a trial.
romo_lampkin He said that? He actually said that?
cpt_lee_adama Yes, he did. And I dont think hes the only one up there.
romo_lampkin I agree. Our tactical victories are pissing them off.
dr_gaius_baltar Right, so now because were winning were losing, actually.
romo_lampkin Perverse, isnt it? one of the reasons why I love what I do.
cpt_lee_adama Forcing a mistrial may seem of little benefit to either side, but in fact, it can be a boon to the defense. The prosecutions shown their hand at retrial, the defense has all the tactical advantages, and the statistical chances of an acquittal rise by twenty-five percent.
dr_gaius_baltar Joseph Adama.
romo_lampkin Smart man, your grandfather.
dr_gaius_baltar Yeah, well, I can see why youd want a mistrial.
cpt_lee_adama Whats that supposed to mean?
dr_gaius_baltar Thatd be the quickest way for you to absolve all your responsibility. Wash your hands of the whole affair. You get back to your life. You [

chief_galen_tyrol Oh... You know what, I dont even know. Its just something I cant get out of my head. Some... Some way out of here...
samuel_anders Ive been hearing that. Everywhere. on a boom box, you know, in the bar?
chief_galen_tyrol Come here. You hear that song?
samuel_anders Yeah. Its freaking me out. I hear it everywhere, I mean, but I cant... but I cant really hear it, you know what I mean?
chief_galen_tyrol Yeah, its like you can grab just a part of the melody and then it goes away. Like its something from ...

admiral_william_adama I promise Ill look into it. Now I have to get to court.
colonel_saul_tigh Okay. Go to court.
colonel_saul_tigh There must be some kind of way out of here...
didi_cassidy Do you recognize this document, Lieutenant?
lt_felix_gaeta Yes, I do. Its a death list issued on New Caprica by the office of the President.
didi_cassidy Who signed this document?
lt_felix_gaeta President Gaius Baltar.
didi_cassidy Hmm. Could it be a forgery?
lt_felix_gaeta No.
didi_cassidy And how do you know that it cannot be a forgery?
lt_felix_gaeta Because I was there. I saw him sign it.
dr_gaius_baltar What? What are you talking about? You werent there! Thats a lie. Thats a total fabrication.
captain_doyle_franks Order!
lt_felix_gaeta I saw him sign it.
didi_cassidy Describe the scene, would you?
lt_felix_gaeta The Cylons brought the document into the Presidential office. They had already selected the names. one of them -- I believe it was a Three -- gave the list to the President and said: Here are the people that are going to be executed. Please sign this. He looked at the list, he saw all the names, and then he signed it.
didi_cassidy Did he protest? I mean, did he argue? Did he offer any resistance whatsoever?
Doral#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode20 Sign it!
dr_gaius_baltar I wont do it. Youre going to have to salve your consciences some other way.
Doral#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode20 Sign it! Sign your name!
lt_felix_gaeta No. He never did.
dr_gaius_baltar Oh, Felix. Oh, Felix, what are you doing? [
cpt_lee_adama Gaius, Gaius. Well get him in the cross.
captain_doyle_franks Counselor, please control your client.
dr_gaius_baltar Its not a secret...
captain_doyle_franks -- Quiet! --
dr_gaius_baltar -- The Fleet knows this man tried to stab me through the neck! And you missed! Butterfingers!
romo_lampkin Sorry, your Honors. [
didi_cassidy No further questions.
captain_doyle_franks Your witness, Counselor.
romo_lampkin No questions.
dr_gaius_baltar WHAT?
admiral_william_adama Witness is dismissed.
dr_gaius_baltar Oh, great. What the hell are you doing?
romo_lampkin Its your word against his right now. If hes decided to perjure himself, we cant do anything to change that now. Were going to have to adjust our strategy.
captain_doyle_franks Is the defense prepared to present their case?
romo_lampkin Your Honors at this time, if it please the court... I would like to offer a motion. The defense would like to move for a mistrial.
dr_gaius_baltar No, we do not want a mistrial! I do not want a mistrial!
captain_doyle_franks Gaius Baltar!
judge_2 Behave, Dr. Baltar. on what grounds, Counselor?
romo_lampkin on the grounds that one of the panel has already prejudged the outcome of this trial and determined the guilt of the defendant.
admiral_william_adama Thats a very serious charge, Mr. Lampkin. Which judge?
romo_lampkin That would be you, Admiral. And to prove it, I need to take the unusual step of calling Mr. Lee Adama to the stand.
cpt_lee_adama You gotta be frakkin kidding me.
romo_lampkin Gaeta has sunk us. This is the only way were gonna win.
cpt_lee_adama I will not testify against my father.
romo_lampkin That is your choice. Either way, Im putting you on the stand.
didi_cassidy Your Honors, this is completely improper. Counsel cannot testify at trial under any circumstances.
romo_lampkin I can cite at least seven precedents off the top of my head.
captain_doyle_franks Call your witness, Counselor.
romo_lampkin Thank you. Mr. Adama. [
cpt_lee_adama Yes.
romo_lampkin At that meeting, did Admiral Adama express an opinion as to whether the defendant deserved a trial? All Im looking for is the truth here, Mr. Adama. Lets have it. Im waiting. Answer the question. You swore an oath as an officer of the Court. If you dont answer the question, you halt the entire system of justice.
captain_doyle_franks Mr. Adama!
romo_lampkin Im sorry, Your Honors. Please excuse my associate. All right, all right. Ill try something else. Do you believe that the defendant deserves a fair trial?
cpt_lee_adama As a matter of fact, I do.
romo_lampkin Why?
cpt_lee_adama Aside from the fact that everyone deserves a fair trial, I also believe that he is not guilty of the charges before the Court...
didi_cassidy Your Honors, I must insist on an exception here. He cannot testify in this manner. It is completely improper.
cpt_lee_adama I agree.
didi_cassidy He can make his arguments in closing statements, not on the stand.
captain_doyle_franks Im inclined to agree with the prosecution.
didi_cassidy Thank you.
admiral_william_adama You can appeal to the President if you feel that this influences the verdict, but I for one would like to hear this witness testify.
judge_2 I would second that.
captain_doyle_franks Continue.
romo_lampkin Thank you, your Honors. Mr. Adama? Mr. Adama!
cpt_lee_adama Yes.
romo_lampkin Why do you believe that the defendant, Gaius Baltar, deserves to be acquitted?
cpt_lee_adama Well, because the evidence does not support the charges.
romo_lampkin Come on...
cpt_lee_adama Did the defendant make mistakes? Sure, he did. Serious mistakes. But did he actually commit any crimes? Did he commit treason? No. I mean, it was an impossible situation. When the Cylons arrived, what could he possibly do? What could anyone have done? I mean, ask yourself, what would you have done? What would you have done? If he had refused to surrender, the Cylons wouldve probably nuked the planet right then and there. So did he appear to cooperate with the Cylons? Sure. So did hundreds of others. Whats the difference between him and them? The President issued a blanket pardon. They were all forgiven. No questions asked. Colonel Tigh. Colonel Tigh used suicide bombers, killed dozens of people. Forgiven. Lieutenant Agathon and Chief Tyrol. They murdered an officer on the
captain_doyle_franks Order. Order!
cpt_lee_adama This case... This case is built on emotion. on anger, bitterness, vengeance. But most of all, it is built on shame. Its about the shame of what we did to ourselves back on that planet. And its about the guilt of those of us who ran away. Who ran away. And we are trying to dump all that guilt and all that shame onto one man, and then flush him out the airlock and hope that that just gets rid of it all. So that we can live with ourselves. But that wont work. That wont work. Thats not justice. Not to me. Not to me.
romo_lampkin ...No further questions.
didi_cassidy Your Honors, I wish to reiterate my strong exception to defense counsels testimony.
captain_doyle_franks Exception noted.
didi_cassidy Thank you.
captain_doyle_franks Did you want to cross-examine the witness?
didi_cassidy I have no question for defense counsel.
captain_doyle_franks Witness is excused. Do you want to call any other witnesses?
romo_lampkin Your Honors, I dont wish to belabor this any longer. The defense rests.
captain_doyle_franks Very well. This court will adjourn to consider a verdict.
dr_gaius_baltar What a glorious moment in jurisprudence.
president_laura_roslin You did a great job.
Bailiff#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode20 All rise.
captain_doyle_franks Before I read the verdict, Id like to make one thing clear. Like everything human, justice is imperfect. Its flawed. But its those very imperfections that separates [
didi_cassidy You won.
romo_lampkin Good job.
dr_gaius_baltar I always knew that I was going to be acquitted, but the fact I have been found innocent shouldnt disguise that this trial has been a total pantomime!
Rioter#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season03.Episode20 Assassin!
cpt_lee_adama Admiral, you gotta get him out of here!
cpt_lee_adama Get him back. Get him out of here! Get him away!
dr_gaius_baltar I knew right from the very start that if there was a way to demonstrate the sheer -- Whats the word Im looking for? Hypocrisy. Hypocrisy is the word Im looking for --
romo_lampkin Well, your boundless confidence provided us with great solace throughout proceedings.
dr_gaius_baltar Look, I want to thank you both. Truly. From the bottom of my heart, I am very, very grateful for all youve done. on a personal note, if I couldve seen the Admiral squirm just a bit more, it wouldnt have hurt.
cpt_lee_adama Now you listen. Dont push it, Doctor.
dr_gaius_baltar Fine. Romo, perhaps we can have a chat. Ive thought about maybe doing a book tour around the Fleet, and theres the publishing rights, there are issues about my security, where I will live, what I will do. Since weve forged this great relationship during the trial, I thought, you know, who better to think about...
romo_lampkin Actually, now that the Fleets legal system is in place, my not-so-inconsiderable talents are required elsewhere. So Im afraid this is the end of our journey.
dr_gaius_baltar Wait a minute, what... What about me? Wait a minute, wait, please. Think about this for a second. Where will I live? What am I gonna do? How am I going to survive?
romo_lampkin Much as I hate to use a cat metaphor, Doctor, I think youll land on your feet. Close the door on your way out.
cpt_lee_adama Romo, one thing. When you put me on the stand, did you know what was gonna happen?
romo_lampkin I knew you were an honest man, Mr. Adama. Much unlike your grandfather.
president_laura_roslin Gaius Baltar is innocent. Just the sound of that makes my skin crawl.
admiral_william_adama Not guilty is not the same as innocent.
president_laura_roslin It mustve been particularly difficult for you. What, you just... couldnt get the other two guys to budge? [
admiral_william_adama I hate to say it. Defense made their case, the prosecution didnt.
president_laura_roslin Gaius Baltar is a traitor. We both know that. Regardless of the outcome of this trial.
admiral_william_adama No ones asking anyone to forget. Or to forgive. But we have to look to the future. [
