Starbuck Previously, on Battlestar Galactica...
Adama I think the nova does look like the mandala inside this temple. Maybe it was a road sign on the path to Earth.
Helo It was on the temple. But whered you get the idea to paint yours?
Starbuck It was just something Ive been doodling since I was a kid. I liked the pattern.
Apollo Starbuck, youre getting too low.
Adama Come on, Lee. Get her out of there.
Apollo You come back!
Starbuck Just let me go. Theyre waiting for me.
Apollo No!
Franks Gaius Baltar, after carefully weighing the evidence, this tribunal finds you not guilty.
Apollo Get him back! Get him out of here! Get him out of here!
Baltar_wandering_and_paranoid Oh!
Jeanne Gaius, its okay. Come with me.
Baltar Where are you taking me to?
Jeanne To your new life. Come.
Adama Were going to the Ionian Nebula.
Adama Sitrep!
Gaeta Uh, sensors show major power fluctuations. Checking on Fleet...
Chief Its true. Were Cylons. And we have been from the start.
Gaeta Dradis contact! Massive Cylon Fleet on intercept course.
Adama I want emergency jump, the entire Fleet.
Helo Sir, all Fleet ships were powered down during the outage. Itll take at least twenty minutes to spool up the FTL drives.
Adama We just dont have twenty minutes.
Gaeta Action stations. Set Condition One throughout the ship. This is not a drill. All Viper pilots report to Vipers immediately.
Apollo I have a bogey at my ten. Im gonna go check it out...
Apollo Whoa! What the frak?!
Starbuck Hi, Lee.
Apollo Kara?
Starbuck Ive been to Earth. I know where it is. And Im gonna take us there.
Apollo No. No, no, this is frakkin crazy. I saw your ship blow up.
Starbuck_confused Fraid not. Did you not hear me? Ive been to Earth.
Apollo Earth.
Starbuck_on_PA ...Big blue oceans, fluffy white clouds. Youre gonna love it. I promise.
Adama Identify that ship immediately.
Gaeta Sir, Im checking for Colonial recognition codes...
Adama Get Lee online!
Dualla Im trying, sir.
Gaeta Im picking up her ships signature.
Helo Thats her voice all right.
Roslin Hold on, hold on. It is not real. It is a trick.
Bill Duplicate verification.
Gaeta Checking...
Gaeta Hostiles inbound! Two hundred plus!
Adama CAG, take em out!
Helo All players, Galactica. Threat BR350, carom 211.
Helo_on_PA Raptors, lean back as missile pickets. Weapons free.
Starbuck Dont lose me this time, Apollo.
Apollo Oh, not a chance.
Starbuck Splash one!
Starbuck_on_PA Take that, you frakkin toasters!
Roslin Admiral, its a Cylon trick.
Gaeta The Vipers have stopped the main Cylon thrust, but the reserves have broken through, sir.
Adama I want everything that can fly up there immediately.
Adama Saul. Saul! What the hell is wrong with you?
Tigh Nothing, Bill. Never felt better in my life.
Adama Colonel Tigh! I gave you a frakkin order. Everybody thats ever held a stick, I want them up there now. Get em out! Put em up there!
Tigh_finally_picks_up_the_phone_shaking_off_his_fugue Sir. Attention, this is the XO...
Tigh_on_PA ...All pilots, man your aircraft.
Chief ...Lets get that bird in the tube. Where the frak are these nuggets? Come on, Mamas not gonna save you today! Lets go! You wanna fly or not?
Seelix_to_Anders Come on, ready or not, lets go.
Anders_approaching_Chief Hey. Hey, this is crazy. What if I get up there and another switch flips in my head and turns me against my own?
Chief What the frak is wrong with you? Shut the frak up. Its like the Colonel said, okay? Just think of that. Be the man you want to be. Til the day you die.
Anders Thats all easier said than done, because I dont know what the frak I am right now.
Chief Youre Samuel T. Anders. Thats all you gotta remember. Samuel T. Anders. Now get the frak in your ship.
Athena_walking_up Who else would he be? Hey, rook, stay cool out there, all right?
Anders Yeah.
Athena Youll lock in and do what youve been trained to do.
Anders Guess its just like suiting up for a championship game, right?
Athena Yeah, thats right. Good hunting.
Anders Well, if she didnt notice anything, maybe the other Cylons wont either.
Chief Yeah, well, dont wait to find out. Shoot first. Get the frak in there, go kill something. Lets go! Lets load these birds! Anders, get the frak in your Viper!
Anders Yeah, yeah, yeah! Yeah!
Baltar Where are you taking me?
Jeanne Its a place we found. An unused compartment.
Gaeta Sir, weve lost Pyxis!
Roslin Oh my Gods, Captain Tarney. Six hundred souls on that ship. How did they find us?
Adama Thats the question, isnt it?
Gaeta Baseships launching missiles, forty -- correction, fifty -- plus inbound. Half targeted on us, half on the Fleet.
Adama Have triple-a target only missiles going towards the Fleet. We can handle the hits, they cant.
Helo Sir. All forces, priority: intercept enemy missiles targeting civilian vessels.
Anders Okay. I am Samuel T. Anders. I was born on Picon. I went to Noyce Elementary School.
Seelix_interrupting_him_on_wireless -- Get your thumb off the transmit button, Sam. Youre blocking the freq.
Anders Copy that. Oh, frak me!
Seelix Longshot, hardball. Turkey right four low at three, committing.
Anders Longshot, I got the... tally? I got your back.
Anders Seelix, theres a Raider on you!
Seelix Shoot, Anders!
Anders Im trying to. Gods, come on!
Gaeta Sir? The Cylon strike force has just turned back to their ships. Baseships are spinning up.
Tigh Theyre pulling out.
Adama Were gonna do the same damn thing before they change their mind. Helo, have our fighters cover our withdrawal.
Helo Yes sir. All fighters assume rear cover formation.
Tigh They had us. Game over. Why the hell did they let us go?
Tory Maybe somethings changed.
Roslin Like what?
Tigh I have no idea, Madame President. No idea.
Jeanne Youll be safe here, Gaius.
Baltar Right.
Starbuck_getting_out_of_her_Viper Chief, Im gonna need you to develop my gun camera footage ASAP. Ive got a hell of a set of vacation pictures.
Starbuck Ill take my post-flight checklist. I want to sign out so I can get in the showers.
Chief ...I dont have one for you.
Starbuck Whats up?
Starbuck Okay. Okay, me too. Its okay, its okay.
Tigh Do you believe in miracles?
Adama No.
Anders I told everyone that you were too frakkin mean to kill!
Starbuck Okay, Im okay, Im okay. Im okay.
Starbuck What the hell are you doing in a jock smock?
Anders I just finished Viper transition a week ago, and I started ACM...
Starbuck_confused How the...
Adama_from_above Starbuck!
Starbuck_grinning_up I did it, Boss. I found Earth!
Adama Everybody move back.
Marines_cocking_their_guns Move in. Step away!
Adama I need you in Sickbay. Cottles gonna give you a complete physical examination.
Starbuck Okay, what the hells going on? Im off the ship for a few hours and everybodys acting...
Anders -- A few hours? Kara, you were gone for over two months.
Kara_getting_angry Thats impossible. My ships clock reads six hours and change.
Apollo_softer Then your clocks wrong, Kara. Sams telling you the truth. We thought you were dead.
Starbuck What?
Jeanne Gaius, I just wanted you to know that well be back soon. Whatever you do, please dont go anywhere by yourself. Its not safe.
Paulla Traceys here for anything you need.
Jeanne Well be back as soon as weve looked in on Derrick. Okay?
Baltar Right... Oh, Derrick. Thats your little boy, isnt it? The one in Sickbay.
Jeanne Right.
Baltar Yes, I -- Im praying for his recovery.
Jeanne Really?
Baltar Yeah.
Jeanne Oh, thank you.
Baltar Its a pleasure.
Jeanne Thank you.
Baltar So whats the game plan, ladies?
Paulla Game plan?
Baltar Well, this place is brilliant, really. You know, its beautiful... Just when am I getting out of here? When I am getting off the ship?
Jeanne Well, securitys too tight.
Paulla Besides...
Baltar Besides what? Youre just trying to keep me here and...
Paulla Gaius, none of the other ships will have you.
Jeanne Uh, well be back.
Six Yesterday, you were facing execution. Today youre free. Why the long face?
Baltar Oh, gee, I dont know. From President of the Colonies to ... this. King of fools. Probably best to be hated by everyone than loved by this lot. Doomed to live out the rest of my life in this loony bin. I dont know, that might have something to do with my rather savage mood swings.
Six_chuckles_kneeling_near_him_as_he_drops_to_his_knees Relax, Gaius. You think Ive brought you this far just to let it end here?
Baltar I need some encouragement. A ray of hope about the future. An inkling...
Six_caressing_his_face Youve got me. Im here for you...
Tracey_watching That is so beautiful.
Baltar Hello. Sorry, what?
Tracey The way you were praying.
Baltar Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, thank you. Yeah.
Tracey Not some hollow ritual.
Baltar No, no.
Tracey Its as if the Gods are right here beside you.
Baltar Well, yeah.
Tracey When I pray to the Gods, I feel ... empty.
Baltar Do you? Thats a shame, isnt it?
Six Her gods are false. Tell her.
Baltar Well, if you feel empty when you pray to Zeus or Poseidon or Aphrodite, its because it is empty. Its a totally empty experience. Theyre...
Baltar Theyre not real. Theyve been promulgated by...
Baltar A ruling elite... uh... to stop you from learning the truth.
Tracey And what truth is that?
Baltar Um, thats a very good question.
Baltar What is the... The ...
Six_exasperated Theres only one God.
Baltar There is only one God. In a nutshell, thats the truth.
Baltar Were alone here, arent we? The others arent coming back soon. And the doors locked.
Baltar All right, good.
Tracey Can you feel Gods presence?
Baltar You know what? I think I do.
Tracey So do I.
Baltar Do you? Do you too? We both... We both feel...
Starbuck So, whats Cottles verdict?
Adama Everything checks out.
Starbuck So Im me? Not a Cylon? That is why you had me tested, right?
Apollo Kara, nobody said you were Cylon.
Starbuck But you were thinking it.
Adama We had to be sure, Kara.
Starbuck Fair enough.
Roslin Lets go through it again.
Starbuck How many times do you want to hear it?
Roslin As many times as it takes to make sense.
Kara_angry I followed a heavy Raider into the storm. Took some hits, passed out. When I came to, I was orbiting this planet. Its yellow moon and star matches the description in Pythia. I took these pictures in orbit. The star patterns match what we saw in the Tomb of Athena.
Roslin How did you get here?
Starbuck I told you, I dont know exactly.
Roslin Well, thats just not good enough, Captain. Tell us everything you remember.
Starbuck I remember taking the photos. Turning my ship in a reciprocal heading. And then Im not sure. I mustve blacked out again. I remember a giant gas planet with rings. I remember a flashing triple star. And a comet. And then I was back with the Fleet.
Roslin And for you, all of this took six hours.
Starbuck I do not understand the time discrepancy either, okay? All I know is I was there. I took the pictures. I didnt imagine it!
Chief_to_Adama I had my crew clean it up. Theres not a ding or a scratch on it. Its got the same tail number as the one she flew out on. But Ive been fixing up that old bird since day one, and this thing looks like its been rolled off the showroom floor.
Roslin So its not the same ship.
Chief Unless she found a hell of a body shop out there, no, maam, its not.
Chief Admiral, its just not the outside either. This is the data from the nav computer... There isnt any. Its blank. Theres no record of where this ship has been.
Roslin Okay. Put her in the brig.
Apollo What? So some things dont add up, and were back to thinking shes a Cylon? What about Cottles test?
Tigh Cottles test doesnt prove anything.
Tory Even if her DNAs the same, she could still be a Cylon.
Roslin She couldve been one from the beginning.
Tigh Baltars Cylon detector was a crock. It failed to ID Boomer.
Roslin I know how you feel about her, Bill, but that is exactly what the Cylons could be counting on here.
Adama Then were back where we started from. There could be Cylons right here, and we wouldnt know it till they put a bullet in our heads.
Roslin Or lead us into an ambush. The Cylon Fleet had enough firepower to blow us out of the sky, but instead they ran and jumped. And theres Kara Thrace, suddenly back from the dead, having found Earth. If Kara Thrace can lead us off our course...
Apollo Course? What course? The nebula was supposed to be another clue on the way to Earth, but it...
Roslin The Nebula is only a road sign along the way to Earth. And we need to continue to follow its path.
Apollo Well, what if Kara is the clue that we were supposed to find?
Roslin And what if shes playing you?
Roslin And what if shes playing you? And all of us?
Jeanne Gaius, please! Gaius, please, can you help me?
Baltar Uh, whats going on?
Jeanne Okay. Oh, god, um -- watch his head -- its Derrick.
Baltar Derrick, is it? Uh, Derrick, I see.
Baltar Where are my clothes?
Tracey Its okay.
Baltar Did they give you a diagnosis?
Jeanne They said hes got, um, viral encephalitis.
Baltar Viral?
Jeanne I dont know, its some inflammation of the brain.
Tracey Cant the doctors do something?
Baltar Well, not if its viral, no. Im afraid its up to Derricks immune system. Uh, and he has to be strong. And we have to be strong for him.
Jeanne I didnt want him to die in that Sickbay, so...so I brought him here. So he can be with us. All of us.
Baltar Yeah, all of us.
Jeanne Give me your hand, please.
Baltar I wish there was... You know I prayed for him, dont you?
Jeanne I know.
Baltar I prayed for him.
Jeanne I know. I guess... I guess that the one true God just doesnt want him to live, right?
Tigh Anybody still hearing that frakkin song?
Tory Nope.
Chief Maybe it stopped when we figured out who... What we are.
Tory Could have been some kind of trigger? To switch us on?
Anders You know, after that Raider scanned me with that red light, damn thing just cut and ran.
Tigh They all did.
Chief You think it recognized you as a Cylon?
Anders I dont know. Maybe thats why it didnt shoot me. More important, why didnt I shoot him?
Tigh Racetrack was right. You just made a dumb nugget mistake.
Anders Did I? Maybe I was programmed to leave my gun safeties on.
Tigh No, those bastards cant program me to help them. No way.
Chief Boomer thought the same thing. And then she shot the old man.
Tigh Boomer didnt know what she was. We do. That is not gonna happen.
Tigh Agreed?
Roslin I dont know why Im here... Yes I do. Im here because of the things that weve shared and the things that weve seen
Caprica The visions in the Opera House.
Roslin You went inside, you saw more than I did. I thought that maybe you could help me.
Caprica Help you how?
Roslin I need to know about the other five. The types weve never seen. The ones that Baltar calls the Final Five.
Caprica And you want to know if Kara Thrace is one of them.
Roslin Yes.
Caprica Ive been programmed never to think about them.
Roslin Well, your programming isnt working, because youre thinking about them right now.
Caprica I try not to.
Roslin Trying not to is thinking about them. How do you rationalize that?
Roslin All right, no. Back off. Dont leave, back off.
Caprica The Five are close.
Roslin What?
Caprica I can feel them.
Starbuck_looking_at_star_charts What about this one?
Gaeta Its a protoplanetary system.
Starbuck So?
Gaeta Nothing but rocks. No ringed gas giants like you ... claimed you saw.
Starbuck I did see it, Lieutenant.
Gaeta If you say so, sir.
Starbuck And what are you saying, Mr. Gaeta?
Gaeta Im not saying anything, sir. Im just following orders.
Starbuck Well, Im ordering you to help me.
Gaeta Youre ordering me...
Helo_arriving -- Mr. Gaeta, take a break.
Gaeta With pleasure, sir.
Tigh Jump clock is running, Dee, take us out of here.
Dualla Yes, sir.
Helo Whats going on?
Starbuck I see it on his face. On all of their faces. Nobody believes me.
Helo You want people to believe you? Find that star system.
Starbuck Its a big waste of time.
Helo Hey, weve only been at it a few hours. Found maybe a dozen trinaries. Baltars calculations took months.
Starbuck It doesnt work like that.
Adama_arriving How does it work, Kara?
Starbuck Its a feeling. An intuition. I didnt use nav fixes to get there and back. When we were at that nebula, it was so clear to me. But every jump we take farther away, the clarity fades. If we keep jumping like this, I wont be able to find our way back.
Adama_dismissing_Helo Thatll be all.
Dualla All hands, prepare for jump in ten...
Adama_quietly The presidents adamant. Were gonna continue on the course laid out by the Eye of Jupiter.
Dualla Five, four, three, two... Jump.
Starbuck Were going the wrong way. If we keep jumping like this, Im gonna lose the feeling completely, never be able to take us back.
Adama What do you want me to do? You want me to go to Laura Roslin? Tell her, Forget Pythia and the Eye of Jupiter, because Kara has some feeling about where Earth is?
Starbuck Yes.
Adama I cant. I just left your ship. Theres not a scratch on it. Its brand new. How do you explain that, Kara?
Starbuck Look at me. Look at me! I swear to Gods... Its me. Kara. I can do this. You once said you loved me like a daughter. If you still do, youve got to trust me on this one.
Adama I cant afford to.
Starbuck Theyre waiting for me.
Apollo No! No!
Starbuck Theyre waiting for me.
Apollo No! No!
Adama_interrupting What should I believe? Should I believe my heart? Or my eyes?
Apollo_on_video Come back here. Come back!
Apollo Well, you know where I stand.
Adama I want to believe her. But the Presidents right. Its exactly what the Cylons would be counting on.
Apollo So I guess youre not changing course.
Adama For the time being, we follow the Presidents lead.
Apollo_sitting_down_near_his_father She still staying in your quarters?
Adama Just until we find a place to put her up to finish the rest of her doloxan treatment.
Adama I want to thank you for suiting up during the fight.
Apollo_smiling_tiredly We needed everyone up there.
Adama_placing_Lees_wings_between_them We still do.
Apollo I took those off for the wrong reasons.
Adama Put them back on.
Apollo Baltars trial may have been the trigger, but, um... This is a feeling Ive been having for a while. Its time for a change. I need to move on. Ive had some feelers from the government. Theres a ... position ... opening up. And I think I can make a valuable contribution there. Maybe even more than in the cockpit.
Apollo ... Dad, what if Zak had come back to us in that Viper? If my brother had climbed out of that cockpit would it matter if he were a Cylon? If he always had been? When alls said and done, would that change how we really feel about him?
Baltar Please, God. Im only asking you this one last time. Dont let this child die. Has he sinned against you? He cant have sinned against you. Hes not even had a life yet.
Baltar How can you take him and let me live? After all Ive done. Really, if you want someone to suffer, take me. We both know I deserve it.
Baltar_weeping I have been selfish and weak. I have failed so many people. And I have killed. Im not asking for your forgiveness. Im just asking that you spare the life of this innocent child. Dont take him. Take me.
Baltar Take me, take me please.
Paulla_leading_Gaius_to_a_bathroom We were all very moved by the way you prayed for Derrick.
Baltar Fat lot of good it did him. Unfortunately, hes worse, if you hadnt realized.
Paulla Doesnt mean God didnt hear you. Im sure hes looking after Derricks immortal soul.
Baltar Yes, I wish I shared your confidence on that one. I really do.
Paulla But you have to keep the faith. We all look to you for guidance...
Baltar -- Well, you shouldnt, should you? I mean, youre just... Well, youre very young.
Paulla_hurt Huh.
Baltar What are we doing here exactly?
Baltar Uh...
Baltar Thank you.
Connor Mr. President.
Paulla Gaius, lets go. We should get back, okay...
Connor Good to see you again.
Baltar Im sorry. I cant...
Connor_washing_his_face We met at the groundbreaking ceremony on New Caprica. Introduced you to my son, Kevin. He told you he wanted to be President when he grew up. You told him that he could be, if he stuck to his schoolwork.
Baltar Hes a redheaded little boy, isnt he? About eight or nine years old...
Connor -- Seven.
Baltar Seven years old. How is, um...
Connor Kevin.
Baltar Kevin. How is he?
Connor Hes dead. Your police shot him.
Paulla Come on, Gaius, lets get out of here.
Baltar Leave her alone!
Connor Look at me!
Baltar Leave her alone!
Connor Look at me!
Baltar Leave her a --
Connor Go on, scream. Come on, scream! I want to see if anyone comes to help you.
Connor Scream! Beg! I bet you begged the Cylons. Why dont you beg for me? Come on, beg!
Connor Get up! Get on your knees! Get up!
Six You asked God to take your life instead of the boys. Did you mean it?
Baltar_voice_rough Yes. Do it. Take my life. Please.
Baltar Please. Unh! Please take my life!
Baltar No.
Paulla_wired You see? Gaius, I knew God wouldnt desert you. I mean, I felt his love course through me, giving me the strength to smite them.
Baltar A little less smiting next time, unless you want to be held up on murder charges.
Jeanne_shocked_at_his_injury Gaius!
Paulla You two, watch the door.
Jeanne Gaius! Are you all right?
Baltar Cut myself shaving.
Jeanne Okay. Well, you have to come. You have to come and see Derrick.
Baltar Derrick?
Jeanne_embracing_Gaius_and_dragging_him_over Derrick! Oh, yes. God answered your prayers. You have to see. Look. Look at him.
Baltar_touching_the_boy And no trace of a fever.
Jeanne_relieved Nuh-uh. Its a miracle.
Starbuck_staring_at_her_photo_on_the_wall_as_Sam_approaches No one took it down. Not the old man, not Lee. Not even you, Sam.
Anders You just got back, Kara. Were all still trying to get a handle on this. You know, you gotta cut people some slack. Cut yourself some too.
Starbuck When I woke up orbiting Earth, I just figured it was some crazy dream, but... I went in following a heavy Raider. I mean, maybe the Cylons pulled me out of the soup, captured me, brainwashed me. On Caprica, in the experiment on me. I mean, did they take pieces of me? I mean, is it possible that they grew me -- another me -- in a Petri dish, and they embedded me with the memories, or it with the memories, or...
Anders_kneeling_at_her_side No, no, no, no, no, no, no, hey, no. Kara, no. Listen to me. If you were a Cylon, then youve been one from the beginning.
Kara_disgusted Like Boomer. Spend my entire life thinking Im one thing...
Anders Yeah, and then you wake up one day and discover youre another. Still doesnt change who you really are. Still doesnt change the fact that I love you no matter what.
Kara_joking You are a better person than I am, Sam, because if I found out that you were a Cylon, I would put a bullet between your eyes.
Dualla_on_PA All hands, prepare for jump in four, three, two... Jump.
Kara_bending Damn it, theyre still going in the wrong direction. Oh... One more jump and Im gonna lose my way altogether.
Anders_rushing_to_her_side All right, we gotta find you a rack. Okay, take it easy.
Starbuck Its Roslin. The old mans not gonna listen to me as along as shes... I gotta get to her.
Anders You cant do that.
Starbuck Is that a fact?
Anders Yeah.
Anders No, no, wait! What the hell are you doing, Kara?
Starbuck_staring_down_at_him_with_the_gun Wheres the president, Sam?
Anders Kara, come on.
