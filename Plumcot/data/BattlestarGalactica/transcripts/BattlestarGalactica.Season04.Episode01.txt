captain_kara_thrace Previously, on Battlestar Galactica...
admiral_william_adama I think the nova does look like the mandala inside this temple. Maybe it was a road sign on the path to Earth.
captain_karl_agathon It was on the temple. But whered you get the idea to paint yours?
captain_kara_thrace It was just something Ive been doodling since I was a kid. I liked the pattern.
cpt_lee_adama Starbuck, youre getting too low.
admiral_william_adama Come on, Lee. Get her out of there.
cpt_lee_adama You come back!
captain_kara_thrace Just let me go. Theyre waiting for me.
cpt_lee_adama No!
Franks#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode01 Gaius Baltar, after carefully weighing the evidence, this tribunal finds you not guilty.
cpt_lee_adama Get him back! Get him out of here! Get him out of here!
Baltar Oh!
jeanne Gaius, its okay. Come with me.
dr_gaius_baltar Where are you taking me to?
jeanne To your new life. Come.
admiral_william_adama Were going to the Ionian Nebula.
admiral_william_adama Sitrep!
lt_felix_gaeta Uh, sensors show major power fluctuations. Checking on Fleet...
chief_galen_tyrol Its true. Were Cylons. And we have been from the start.
lt_felix_gaeta Dradis contact! Massive Cylon Fleet on intercept course.
admiral_william_adama I want emergency jump, the entire Fleet.
captain_karl_agathon Sir, all Fleet ships were powered down during the outage. Itll take at least twenty minutes to spool up the FTL drives.
admiral_william_adama We just dont have twenty minutes.
lt_felix_gaeta Action stations. Set Condition One throughout the ship. This is not a drill. All Viper pilots report to Vipers immediately.
cpt_lee_adama I have a bogey at my ten. Im gonna go check it out...
cpt_lee_adama Whoa! What the frak?!
captain_kara_thrace Hi, Lee.
cpt_lee_adama Kara?
captain_kara_thrace Ive been to Earth. I know where it is. And Im gonna take us there.
cpt_lee_adama No. No, no, this is frakkin crazy. I saw your ship blow up.
captain_kara_thrace Fraid not. Did you not hear me? Ive been to Earth.
cpt_lee_adama Earth.
captain_kara_thrace ...Big blue oceans, fluffy white clouds. Youre gonna love it. I promise.
admiral_william_adama Identify that ship immediately.
lt_felix_gaeta Sir, Im checking for Colonial recognition codes...
admiral_william_adama Get Lee online!
officer_anastasia_dualla Im trying, sir.
lt_felix_gaeta Im picking up her ships signature.
captain_karl_agathon Thats her voice all right.
president_laura_roslin Hold on, hold on. It is not real. It is a trick.
Bill#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode01 Duplicate verification.
lt_felix_gaeta Checking...
lt_felix_gaeta Hostiles inbound! Two hundred plus!
admiral_william_adama CAG, take em out!
captain_karl_agathon All players, Galactica. Threat BR350, carom 211.
captain_karl_agathon Raptors, lean back as missile pickets. Weapons free.
captain_kara_thrace Dont lose me this time, Apollo.
cpt_lee_adama Oh, not a chance.
captain_kara_thrace Splash one!
captain_kara_thrace Take that, you frakkin toasters!
president_laura_roslin Admiral, its a Cylon trick.
lt_felix_gaeta The Vipers have stopped the main Cylon thrust, but the reserves have broken through, sir.
admiral_william_adama I want everything that can fly up there immediately.
admiral_william_adama Saul. Saul! What the hell is wrong with you?
colonel_saul_tigh Nothing, Bill. Never felt better in my life.
admiral_william_adama Colonel Tigh! I gave you a frakkin order. Everybody thats ever held a stick, I want them up there now. Get em out! Put em up there!
colonel_saul_tigh Sir. Attention, this is the XO...
colonel_saul_tigh ...All pilots, man your aircraft.
chief_galen_tyrol ...Lets get that bird in the tube. Where the frak are these nuggets? Come on, Mamas not gonna save you today! Lets go! You wanna fly or not?
ensign_diana_seelix Come on, ready or not, lets go.
samuel_anders Hey. Hey, this is crazy. What if I get up there and another switch flips in my head and turns me against my own?
chief_galen_tyrol What the frak is wrong with you? Shut the frak up. Its like the Colonel said, okay? Just think of that. Be the man you want to be. Til the day you die.
samuel_anders Thats all easier said than done, because I dont know what the frak I am right now.
chief_galen_tyrol Youre Samuel T. Anders. Thats all you gotta remember. Samuel T. Anders. Now get the frak in your ship.
lt_sharon_valerii Who else would he be? Hey, rook, stay cool out there, all right?
samuel_anders Yeah.
lt_sharon_valerii Youll lock in and do what youve been trained to do.
samuel_anders Guess its just like suiting up for a championship game, right?
lt_sharon_valerii Yeah, thats right. Good hunting.
samuel_anders Well, if she didnt notice anything, maybe the other Cylons wont either.
chief_galen_tyrol Yeah, well, dont wait to find out. Shoot first. Get the frak in there, go kill something. Lets go! Lets load these birds! Anders, get the frak in your Viper!
samuel_anders Yeah, yeah, yeah! Yeah!
dr_gaius_baltar Where are you taking me?
jeanne Its a place we found. An unused compartment.
lt_felix_gaeta Sir, weve lost Pyxis!
president_laura_roslin Oh my Gods, Captain Tarney. Six hundred souls on that ship. How did they find us?
admiral_william_adama Thats the question, isnt it?
lt_felix_gaeta Baseships launching missiles, forty -- correction, fifty -- plus inbound. Half targeted on us, half on the Fleet.
admiral_william_adama Have triple-a target only missiles going towards the Fleet. We can handle the hits, they cant.
captain_karl_agathon Sir. All forces, priority: intercept enemy missiles targeting civilian vessels.
samuel_anders Okay. I am Samuel T. Anders. I was born on Picon. I went to Noyce Elementary School.
ensign_diana_seelix -- Get your thumb off the transmit button, Sam. Youre blocking the freq.
samuel_anders Copy that. Oh, frak me!
ensign_diana_seelix Longshot, hardball. Turkey right four low at three, committing.
samuel_anders Longshot, I got the... tally? I got your back.
samuel_anders Seelix, theres a Raider on you!
ensign_diana_seelix Shoot, Anders!
samuel_anders Im trying to. Gods, come on!
lt_felix_gaeta Sir? The Cylon strike force has just turned back to their ships. Baseships are spinning up.
colonel_saul_tigh Theyre pulling out.
admiral_william_adama Were gonna do the same damn thing before they change their mind. Helo, have our fighters cover our withdrawal.
captain_karl_agathon Yes sir. All fighters assume rear cover formation.
colonel_saul_tigh They had us. Game over. Why the hell did they let us go?
tory_foster Maybe somethings changed.
president_laura_roslin Like what?
colonel_saul_tigh I have no idea, Madame President. No idea.
jeanne Youll be safe here, Gaius.
dr_gaius_baltar Right.
captain_kara_thrace Chief, Im gonna need you to develop my gun camera footage ASAP. Ive got a hell of a set of vacation pictures.
captain_kara_thrace Ill take my post-flight checklist. I want to sign out so I can get in the showers.
chief_galen_tyrol ...I dont have one for you.
captain_kara_thrace Whats up?
captain_kara_thrace Okay. Okay, me too. Its okay, its okay.
colonel_saul_tigh Do you believe in miracles?
admiral_william_adama No.
samuel_anders I told everyone that you were too frakkin mean to kill!
captain_kara_thrace Okay, Im okay, Im okay. Im okay.
captain_kara_thrace What the hell are you doing in a jock smock?
samuel_anders I just finished Viper transition a week ago, and I started ACM...
captain_kara_thrace How the...
admiral_william_adama Starbuck!
captain_kara_thrace I did it, Boss. I found Earth!
admiral_william_adama Everybody move back.
Marines_cocking_their_guns#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode01 Move in. Step away!
admiral_william_adama I need you in Sickbay. Cottles gonna give you a complete physical examination.
captain_kara_thrace Okay, what the hells going on? Im off the ship for a few hours and everybodys acting...
samuel_anders -- A few hours? Kara, you were gone for over two months.
captain_kara_thrace Thats impossible. My ships clock reads six hours and change.
cpt_lee_adama Then your clocks wrong, Kara. Sams telling you the truth. We thought you were dead.
captain_kara_thrace What?
jeanne Gaius, I just wanted you to know that well be back soon. Whatever you do, please dont go anywhere by yourself. Its not safe.
paulla_schaffer Traceys here for anything you need.
jeanne Well be back as soon as weve looked in on Derrick. Okay?
dr_gaius_baltar Right... Oh, Derrick. Thats your little boy, isnt it? The one in Sickbay.
jeanne Right.
dr_gaius_baltar Yes, I -- Im praying for his recovery.
jeanne Really?
dr_gaius_baltar Yeah.
jeanne Oh, thank you.
dr_gaius_baltar Its a pleasure.
jeanne Thank you.
dr_gaius_baltar So whats the game plan, ladies?
paulla_schaffer Game plan?
dr_gaius_baltar Well, this place is brilliant, really. You know, its beautiful... Just when am I getting out of here? When I am getting off the ship?
jeanne Well, securitys too tight.
paulla_schaffer Besides...
dr_gaius_baltar Besides what? Youre just trying to keep me here and...
paulla_schaffer Gaius, none of the other ships will have you.
jeanne Uh, well be back.
number_six Yesterday, you were facing execution. Today youre free. Why the long face?
dr_gaius_baltar Oh, gee, I dont know. From President of the Colonies to ... this. King of fools. Probably best to be hated by everyone than loved by this lot. Doomed to live out the rest of my life in this loony bin. I dont know, that might have something to do with my rather savage mood swings.
number_six Relax, Gaius. You think Ive brought you this far just to let it end here?
dr_gaius_baltar I need some encouragement. A ray of hope about the future. An inkling...
number_six Youve got me. Im here for you...
tracey_anne That is so beautiful.
dr_gaius_baltar Hello. Sorry, what?
tracey_anne The way you were praying.
dr_gaius_baltar Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, thank you. Yeah.
tracey_anne Not some hollow ritual.
dr_gaius_baltar No, no.
tracey_anne Its as if the Gods are right here beside you.
dr_gaius_baltar Well, yeah.
tracey_anne When I pray to the Gods, I feel ... empty.
dr_gaius_baltar Do you? Thats a shame, isnt it?
number_six Her gods are false. Tell her.
dr_gaius_baltar Well, if you feel empty when you pray to Zeus or Poseidon or Aphrodite, its because it is empty. Its a totally empty experience. Theyre...
dr_gaius_baltar Theyre not real. Theyve been promulgated by...
dr_gaius_baltar A ruling elite... uh... to stop you from learning the truth.
tracey_anne And what truth is that?
dr_gaius_baltar Um, thats a very good question.
dr_gaius_baltar What is the... The ...
number_six Theres only one God.
dr_gaius_baltar There is only one God. In a nutshell, thats the truth.
dr_gaius_baltar Were alone here, arent we? The others arent coming back soon. And the doors locked.
dr_gaius_baltar All right, good.
tracey_anne Can you feel Gods presence?
dr_gaius_baltar You know what? I think I do.
tracey_anne So do I.
dr_gaius_baltar Do you? Do you too? We both... We both feel...
captain_kara_thrace So, whats Cottles verdict?
admiral_william_adama Everything checks out.
captain_kara_thrace So Im me? Not a Cylon? That is why you had me tested, right?
cpt_lee_adama Kara, nobody said you were Cylon.
captain_kara_thrace But you were thinking it.
admiral_william_adama We had to be sure, Kara.
captain_kara_thrace Fair enough.
president_laura_roslin Lets go through it again.
captain_kara_thrace How many times do you want to hear it?
president_laura_roslin As many times as it takes to make sense.
captain_kara_thrace I followed a heavy Raider into the storm. Took some hits, passed out. When I came to, I was orbiting this planet. Its yellow moon and star matches the description in Pythia. I took these pictures in orbit. The star patterns match what we saw in the Tomb of Athena.
president_laura_roslin How did you get here?
captain_kara_thrace I told you, I dont know exactly.
president_laura_roslin Well, thats just not good enough, Captain. Tell us everything you remember.
captain_kara_thrace I remember taking the photos. Turning my ship in a reciprocal heading. And then Im not sure. I mustve blacked out again. I remember a giant gas planet with rings. I remember a flashing triple star. And a comet. And then I was back with the Fleet.
president_laura_roslin And for you, all of this took six hours.
captain_kara_thrace I do not understand the time discrepancy either, okay? All I know is I was there. I took the pictures. I didnt imagine it!
chief_galen_tyrol I had my crew clean it up. Theres not a ding or a scratch on it. Its got the same tail number as the one she flew out on. But Ive been fixing up that old bird since day one, and this thing looks like its been rolled off the showroom floor.
president_laura_roslin So its not the same ship.
chief_galen_tyrol Unless she found a hell of a body shop out there, no, maam, its not.
chief_galen_tyrol Admiral, its just not the outside either. This is the data from the nav computer... There isnt any. Its blank. Theres no record of where this ship has been.
president_laura_roslin Okay. Put her in the brig.
cpt_lee_adama What? So some things dont add up, and were back to thinking shes a Cylon? What about Cottles test?
colonel_saul_tigh Cottles test doesnt prove anything.
tory_foster Even if her DNAs the same, she could still be a Cylon.
president_laura_roslin She couldve been one from the beginning.
colonel_saul_tigh Baltars Cylon detector was a crock. It failed to ID Boomer.
president_laura_roslin I know how you feel about her, Bill, but that is exactly what the Cylons could be counting on here.
admiral_william_adama Then were back where we started from. There could be Cylons right here, and we wouldnt know it till they put a bullet in our heads.
president_laura_roslin Or lead us into an ambush. The Cylon Fleet had enough firepower to blow us out of the sky, but instead they ran and jumped. And theres Kara Thrace, suddenly back from the dead, having found Earth. If Kara Thrace can lead us off our course...
cpt_lee_adama Course? What course? The nebula was supposed to be another clue on the way to Earth, but it...
president_laura_roslin The Nebula is only a road sign along the way to Earth. And we need to continue to follow its path.
cpt_lee_adama Well, what if Kara is the clue that we were supposed to find?
president_laura_roslin And what if shes playing you?
president_laura_roslin And what if shes playing you? And all of us?
jeanne Gaius, please! Gaius, please, can you help me?
dr_gaius_baltar Uh, whats going on?
jeanne Okay. Oh, god, um -- watch his head -- its Derrick.
dr_gaius_baltar Derrick, is it? Uh, Derrick, I see.
dr_gaius_baltar Where are my clothes?
tracey_anne Its okay.
dr_gaius_baltar Did they give you a diagnosis?
jeanne They said hes got, um, viral encephalitis.
dr_gaius_baltar Viral?
jeanne I dont know, its some inflammation of the brain.
tracey_anne Cant the doctors do something?
dr_gaius_baltar Well, not if its viral, no. Im afraid its up to Derricks immune system. Uh, and he has to be strong. And we have to be strong for him.
jeanne I didnt want him to die in that Sickbay, so...so I brought him here. So he can be with us. All of us.
dr_gaius_baltar Yeah, all of us.
jeanne Give me your hand, please.
dr_gaius_baltar I wish there was... You know I prayed for him, dont you?
jeanne I know.
dr_gaius_baltar I prayed for him.
jeanne I know. I guess... I guess that the one true God just doesnt want him to live, right?
colonel_saul_tigh Anybody still hearing that frakkin song?
tory_foster Nope.
chief_galen_tyrol Maybe it stopped when we figured out who... What we are.
tory_foster Could have been some kind of trigger? To switch us on?
samuel_anders You know, after that Raider scanned me with that red light, damn thing just cut and ran.
colonel_saul_tigh They all did.
chief_galen_tyrol You think it recognized you as a Cylon?
samuel_anders I dont know. Maybe thats why it didnt shoot me. More important, why didnt I shoot him?
colonel_saul_tigh Racetrack was right. You just made a dumb nugget mistake.
samuel_anders Did I? Maybe I was programmed to leave my gun safeties on.
colonel_saul_tigh No, those bastards cant program me to help them. No way.
chief_galen_tyrol Boomer thought the same thing. And then she shot the old man.
colonel_saul_tigh Boomer didnt know what she was. We do. That is not gonna happen.
colonel_saul_tigh Agreed?
president_laura_roslin I dont know why Im here... Yes I do. Im here because of the things that weve shared and the things that weve seen
number_six The visions in the Opera House.
president_laura_roslin You went inside, you saw more than I did. I thought that maybe you could help me.
number_six Help you how?
president_laura_roslin I need to know about the other five. The types weve never seen. The ones that Baltar calls the Final Five.
number_six And you want to know if Kara Thrace is one of them.
president_laura_roslin Yes.
number_six Ive been programmed never to think about them.
president_laura_roslin Well, your programming isnt working, because youre thinking about them right now.
number_six I try not to.
president_laura_roslin Trying not to is thinking about them. How do you rationalize that?
president_laura_roslin All right, no. Back off. Dont leave, back off.
number_six The Five are close.
president_laura_roslin What?
number_six I can feel them.
captain_kara_thrace What about this one?
lt_felix_gaeta Its a protoplanetary system.
captain_kara_thrace So?
lt_felix_gaeta Nothing but rocks. No ringed gas giants like you ... claimed you saw.
captain_kara_thrace I did see it, Lieutenant.
lt_felix_gaeta If you say so, sir.
captain_kara_thrace And what are you saying, Mr. Gaeta?
lt_felix_gaeta Im not saying anything, sir. Im just following orders.
captain_kara_thrace Well, Im ordering you to help me.
lt_felix_gaeta Youre ordering me...
captain_karl_agathon -- Mr. Gaeta, take a break.
lt_felix_gaeta With pleasure, sir.
colonel_saul_tigh Jump clock is running, Dee, take us out of here.
officer_anastasia_dualla Yes, sir.
captain_karl_agathon Whats going on?
captain_kara_thrace I see it on his face. On all of their faces. Nobody believes me.
captain_karl_agathon You want people to believe you? Find that star system.
captain_kara_thrace Its a big waste of time.
captain_karl_agathon Hey, weve only been at it a few hours. Found maybe a dozen trinaries. Baltars calculations took months.
captain_kara_thrace It doesnt work like that.
admiral_william_adama How does it work, Kara?
captain_kara_thrace Its a feeling. An intuition. I didnt use nav fixes to get there and back. When we were at that nebula, it was so clear to me. But every jump we take farther away, the clarity fades. If we keep jumping like this, I wont be able to find our way back.
admiral_william_adama Thatll be all.
officer_anastasia_dualla All hands, prepare for jump in ten...
admiral_william_adama The presidents adamant. Were gonna continue on the course laid out by the Eye of Jupiter.
officer_anastasia_dualla Five, four, three, two... Jump.
captain_kara_thrace Were going the wrong way. If we keep jumping like this, Im gonna lose the feeling completely, never be able to take us back.
admiral_william_adama What do you want me to do? You want me to go to Laura Roslin? Tell her, Forget Pythia and the Eye of Jupiter, because Kara has some feeling about where Earth is?
captain_kara_thrace Yes.
admiral_william_adama I cant. I just left your ship. Theres not a scratch on it. Its brand new. How do you explain that, Kara?
captain_kara_thrace Look at me. Look at me! I swear to Gods... Its me. Kara. I can do this. You once said you loved me like a daughter. If you still do, youve got to trust me on this one.
admiral_william_adama I cant afford to.
captain_kara_thrace Theyre waiting for me.
cpt_lee_adama No! No!
captain_kara_thrace Theyre waiting for me.
cpt_lee_adama No! No!
admiral_william_adama What should I believe? Should I believe my heart? Or my eyes?
cpt_lee_adama Come back here. Come back!
cpt_lee_adama Well, you know where I stand.
admiral_william_adama I want to believe her. But the Presidents right. Its exactly what the Cylons would be counting on.
cpt_lee_adama So I guess youre not changing course.
admiral_william_adama For the time being, we follow the Presidents lead.
cpt_lee_adama She still staying in your quarters?
admiral_william_adama Just until we find a place to put her up to finish the rest of her doloxan treatment.
admiral_william_adama I want to thank you for suiting up during the fight.
cpt_lee_adama We needed everyone up there.
admiral_william_adama We still do.
cpt_lee_adama I took those off for the wrong reasons.
admiral_william_adama Put them back on.
cpt_lee_adama Baltars trial may have been the trigger, but, um... This is a feeling Ive been having for a while. Its time for a change. I need to move on. Ive had some feelers from the government. Theres a ... position ... opening up. And I think I can make a valuable contribution there. Maybe even more than in the cockpit.
cpt_lee_adama ... Dad, what if Zak had come back to us in that Viper? If my brother had climbed out of that cockpit would it matter if he were a Cylon? If he always had been? When alls said and done, would that change how we really feel about him?
dr_gaius_baltar Please, God. Im only asking you this one last time. Dont let this child die. Has he sinned against you? He cant have sinned against you. Hes not even had a life yet.
dr_gaius_baltar How can you take him and let me live? After all Ive done. Really, if you want someone to suffer, take me. We both know I deserve it.
dr_gaius_baltar I have been selfish and weak. I have failed so many people. And I have killed. Im not asking for your forgiveness. Im just asking that you spare the life of this innocent child. Dont take him. Take me.
dr_gaius_baltar Take me, take me please.
paulla_schaffer We were all very moved by the way you prayed for Derrick.
dr_gaius_baltar Fat lot of good it did him. Unfortunately, hes worse, if you hadnt realized.
paulla_schaffer Doesnt mean God didnt hear you. Im sure hes looking after Derricks immortal soul.
dr_gaius_baltar Yes, I wish I shared your confidence on that one. I really do.
paulla_schaffer But you have to keep the faith. We all look to you for guidance...
dr_gaius_baltar -- Well, you shouldnt, should you? I mean, youre just... Well, youre very young.
paulla_schaffer Huh.
dr_gaius_baltar What are we doing here exactly?
dr_gaius_baltar Uh...
dr_gaius_baltar Thank you.
charlie_connor Mr. President.
paulla_schaffer Gaius, lets go. We should get back, okay...
charlie_connor Good to see you again.
dr_gaius_baltar Im sorry. I cant...
charlie_connor We met at the groundbreaking ceremony on New Caprica. Introduced you to my son, Kevin. He told you he wanted to be President when he grew up. You told him that he could be, if he stuck to his schoolwork.
dr_gaius_baltar Hes a redheaded little boy, isnt he? About eight or nine years old...
charlie_connor -- Seven.
dr_gaius_baltar Seven years old. How is, um...
charlie_connor Kevin.
dr_gaius_baltar Kevin. How is he?
charlie_connor Hes dead. Your police shot him.
paulla_schaffer Come on, Gaius, lets get out of here.
dr_gaius_baltar Leave her alone!
charlie_connor Look at me!
dr_gaius_baltar Leave her alone!
charlie_connor Look at me!
dr_gaius_baltar Leave her a --
charlie_connor Go on, scream. Come on, scream! I want to see if anyone comes to help you.
charlie_connor Scream! Beg! I bet you begged the Cylons. Why dont you beg for me? Come on, beg!
charlie_connor Get up! Get on your knees! Get up!
number_six You asked God to take your life instead of the boys. Did you mean it?
dr_gaius_baltar Yes. Do it. Take my life. Please.
dr_gaius_baltar Please. Unh! Please take my life!
dr_gaius_baltar No.
paulla_schaffer You see? Gaius, I knew God wouldnt desert you. I mean, I felt his love course through me, giving me the strength to smite them.
dr_gaius_baltar A little less smiting next time, unless you want to be held up on murder charges.
jeanne Gaius!
paulla_schaffer You two, watch the door.
jeanne Gaius! Are you all right?
dr_gaius_baltar Cut myself shaving.
jeanne Okay. Well, you have to come. You have to come and see Derrick.
dr_gaius_baltar Derrick?
jeanne Derrick! Oh, yes. God answered your prayers. You have to see. Look. Look at him.
dr_gaius_baltar And no trace of a fever.
jeanne Nuh-uh. Its a miracle.
captain_kara_thrace No one took it down. Not the old man, not Lee. Not even you, Sam.
samuel_anders You just got back, Kara. Were all still trying to get a handle on this. You know, you gotta cut people some slack. Cut yourself some too.
captain_kara_thrace When I woke up orbiting Earth, I just figured it was some crazy dream, but... I went in following a heavy Raider. I mean, maybe the Cylons pulled me out of the soup, captured me, brainwashed me. On Caprica, in the experiment on me. I mean, did they take pieces of me? I mean, is it possible that they grew me -- another me -- in a Petri dish, and they embedded me with the memories, or it with the memories, or...
samuel_anders No, no, no, no, no, no, no, hey, no. Kara, no. Listen to me. If you were a Cylon, then youve been one from the beginning.
captain_kara_thrace Like Boomer. Spend my entire life thinking Im one thing...
samuel_anders Yeah, and then you wake up one day and discover youre another. Still doesnt change who you really are. Still doesnt change the fact that I love you no matter what.
captain_kara_thrace You are a better person than I am, Sam, because if I found out that you were a Cylon, I would put a bullet between your eyes.
officer_anastasia_dualla All hands, prepare for jump in four, three, two... Jump.
captain_kara_thrace Damn it, theyre still going in the wrong direction. Oh... One more jump and Im gonna lose my way altogether.
samuel_anders All right, we gotta find you a rack. Okay, take it easy.
captain_kara_thrace Its Roslin. The old mans not gonna listen to me as along as shes... I gotta get to her.
samuel_anders You cant do that.
captain_kara_thrace Is that a fact?
samuel_anders Yeah.
samuel_anders No, no, wait! What the hell are you doing, Kara?
captain_kara_thrace Wheres the president, Sam?
samuel_anders Kara, come on.
