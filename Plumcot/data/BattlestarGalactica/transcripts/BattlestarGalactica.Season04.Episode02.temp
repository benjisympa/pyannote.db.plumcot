Baltar Previously, on Battlestar Galactica.
Adama The Goddess Aurora.
Starbuck I thought that it would be a nice figurehead for your model ship. A fresh start.
Adama Thank you.
Apollo Starbuck, youre heading too low!
Adama Come on, Lee, get her out of there.
Apollo You come back!
Starbuck Just let me go.
Apollo No!
Apollo Baltars trial may have been the trigger, but this is a feeling Ive been having for a while. Its time for a change.
Baltar Please, God, dont let this child die. How can you take him and let me live?
Jeanne God answered your prayers. You have to see. Look at him.
Baltar And no trace of a fever.
Jeanne Its a miracle.
Roslin I need to know about the other five. The types weve never seen.
Chief Its true. Were Cylons. And we have been from the start.
Anders Even after that Raider scanned me with that red light, damn thing just cut and ran.
Chief You think it recognized you as a Cylon?
Anders Maybe thats why it didnt shoot me. More important, why didnt I shoot him?
Starbuck Okay, what the hells going on? Im off the ship for a few hours, and everybodys acting...
Anders -- A few hours? Kara, you were gone for over two months.
Starbuck Thats impossible.
Roslin How did you get here?
Starbuck I told you, I dont know exactly.
Starbuck Damn it, theyre still going in the wrong direction. Another jump and Im gonna lose my way all together. Its Roslin. The old mans not gonna listen to me. I gotta get to her.
Anders No, no, wait!
Tigh Look alive! And for fraks sake, dont shoot the Godsdamned President!
Helo Just let me talk to her.
Tigh Talk all you want, but it ends with the first bang.
Tigh_on_PA Were rollin down here. Starbucks got the President!
Adama_leaving_the_bridge Gaeta, take the comm.
Starbuck_gesturing_with_her_head_toward_the_sitting_area Move. Move! Come on. Move, come on! Over by the couch. Now!
Starbuck I want to hate you so much. So much.
Starbuck_coming_closer You had a vision. Remember? The Arrow, the Temple. I went down to that planet with you, and it was a frakkin toaster party. A lot of good people died. Remember?
Roslin Yes I do.
Starbuck I trusted you. On a vision. Thats it. A vision. I saw Earth. I saw it with my own eyes. And its calling me back. Were going the wrong way. Why cant you trust me?
Starbuck Shoot me. If you think Im a Cylon then Im your enemy. Shoot your enemy.
Starbuck Take it!
Starbuck Im no more a Cylon than you are. And you know it.
Roslin I wish I did.
Starbuck Ive put my life on the line for this frakkin ship. I have ate, slept, and fought next to the people that I love. I have pissed off my friends, I have broken more rules than Ive followed! I fracked up, okay, I messed up. But its all that I have. Those people are my family. And none of us belong here.
Tigh_spotting_the_Marines Two down. Weve got two down!
Starbuck Shoot me. if Im a Cylon, shoot me!
Roslin They made you perfect, didnt they?
Matthias Down on the floor. Down on the floor now! Now!
Starbuck_as_the_marines_take_her_down What are you doing? Let go of me! What are -- get off me! Get off me! What are you doing? I am not a Cylon, Matthias!
Tigh_taking_the_gun Madam President.
Starbuck Mathias! Gods!
Adama_arriving What the fraks going on here? I thought you were on the move.
Tigh We were! Shes out of her frakkin mind!
Starbuck Gods!
Adama_to_Roslin You all right?
Starbuck Get off me! Get off!
Starbuck Listen to me, please. Im losing it. The ringing... the way to Earth... its getting weaker. Dont you understand? Dont any of you understand? It was so... it was so clear. Like it was coming from the next room. Stop looking at me like that. I can feel it slipping away. Even without jumping! As we move... its half of what it was when I got here. Half. If we keep jumping itll be gone, and well never find it again. I thought thats what we wanted. A way to earth. Do you hear me?
Tigh_shaking Get her out of here.
Starbuck_being_dragged_away You better work on your aim, because Im not gonna stop! Youre gonna have to kill me! One more jump and itll be gone! Admiral! Admiral!
Hybrid ...the excited state decays by vibrational relaxation into the first excited singlet state yes yes and merrily we go reduce atmospheric nitrogen by 0.03% it is not much consolation that society will pick up the bits leaving us at eight modern where punishment rather than interdiction is paramount please cut the fuse they will not harm their own end of line. Limiting diffusions to two dimensions increases the number of evolutionary jumps within the species rise and measure the temple of the Five transformation is the goal they will not harm their own data/font synchronization complete...
Natalie The Hybrid is clearly telling us something.
Cavil The Hybrid is always telling us something. Theyre supposed to maintain operations on each ship, not vomit metaphysics.
Cavil All right, I give up. What. What is she trying to tell us?
Eight Theyre in the Colonial Fleet. With the humans.
Cavil They? They who?
Leoben The ... Final Five.
Natalie The Raiders refuse to fight because they sense the Final Five might be in the Colonial Fleet...
Leoben -- They couldve ... couldve been caught, they could be in hiding...
Cavil No, stop. Stop right now. Turn around, go and take a cleansing walk, and I am gonna try and forget what I just heard.
Natalie The Final Five, Cavil, theyre near. This is far too important....
Leoben -- What their eyes must have seen, witnessed over time...
Eight_grinning_hugely -- Think they look anything like us?
Cavil -- Thats enough! Dont you realize what youre doing? Youre openly discussing the Final Five! Thats forbidden! Youre toying with our survival. Look at yourselves. Look, theres millions of Twos have that nose. Millions of Sixes possess that mouth. Eights share those breasts, and Ones have this brain. Were mechanized copies. Theres a reason the original programmers clearly felt that its a mistake for us to contact the Final Five!
Natalie No!
Cavil Violating that programming threatens our survival.
Natalie Something has changed.
Cavil Thoughts have changed. Yes, they change. The Raiders changed. Thats where all this started, with them. Somehow they exceeded their programming, and unlike us, they cant correct themselves. So were gonna have to do it for them.
Natalie Do what?
Cavil Well reconfigure their neural architecture, and shave down their heuristic responses.
Leoben Dumb them down? Lobotomize them?
Cavil Theyre tools, not pets. But in any case, it has to be done.
Natalie Says who?
Cavil Says God Almighty the voice of reason, thats who. When are you gonna hear it?
Natalie_getting_close_to_him You dont have the authority to make any change without a majority vote.
Cavil Well, well vote. The Fours and Fives will be on my side.
Natalie There will be a vote. The Raiders hear what we hear.
Cavil The Raiders are simple machines.
Natalie No. Something extraordinary has happened. Something is calling to us. Pushing us to discover our origins, to understand our place in the universe. The Raiders are part of that, and the Final Five...
Cavil -- Are anywhere but with the humans.
Tigh Youre late.
Chief I had to wait for Cally to nod off, okay? Shes having trouble sleeping.
Anders Did you see Kara?
Tigh I saw her. Shes crazy as a latrine rat. If anything, shes more like Starbuck than ever.
Anders Shes my wife.
Tigh And the President nearly put a bullet in her skull because she suspected her of being a Cylon. You are one! We bring attention to ourselves, were fracked! If Starbuck is one of us, shes playing it big the other way.
Tory_sadly The four of us heard the music and sought each other out. She hasnt. Were still missing one.
Chief Baltar. Not Baltar, but when I found him in the temple on the algae planet, he was with one of those skin jobs, the one they call DAnna. She saw something in there. I dont know what it is. But they talked. He might know something. Hes got those one-God nut cases believing hes some kind of healer, he brought some boy out from a coma.
Tigh Maybe he knows who the fifth is.
Tory Yeah, maybe he knows who we are.
Tigh Then we gotta get in close and find out.
Chief_chuckling How do you propose we do that? Take him out for drinks?
Tigh Well, he is accomplished at two things. Lying in his cell, and lying in a woman. Hed poke a skin job. He racked up a Six, thats a given...
Tory -- There is no way.
Tigh You dont have to get on your back for him, but...
Tory Oh gee. Thanks.
Adama_pissed What were you doing? What were you thinking? What happened to you?!
Starbuck_sobbing I saw Earth. The shape of it, the smell of it. The feel of it on my skin in my pores. And I swear to you, it was like Id been there before. Like I never left.
Adama Youre too stupid to figure out you just screwed over the one ally you had. You didnt have the guts to hold on. Tell me. Whos gonna help you?
Starbuck_nodding Yeah, frak me, huh? It sure as hell isnt gonna be you. Youve gotta remind yourself that youre somebody else. Youre the presidents wet nurse. Youre the one who doesnt have the guts.
Starbuck Nice to know you still care, Admiral.
Starbuck_screaming Were going the wrong way!
Cavil We have all conferred with our models, and the results are in. The Fours and the Fives have joined us Ones, and they voted to reconfigure the Raiders.
Natalie Gee, what a surprise. Well, the Twos, Sixes and Eights voted against it, so were deadlocked.
Cavil Hopelessly. But you were right. And Im machine enough to admit that I was wrong.
Natalie What are you talking about?
Cavil Well, something extraordinary has happened. ...Eight!
Natalie Whats going on?
Natalie Boomer.
Cavil Im not going to sugarcoat this. Ill just say that this Eight has voted to reconfigure.
Natalie What?
Cavil Shocked? I was shocked too.
Natalie But no one has ever voted against their model. No one. Is this true?
Boomer We have to be able to defend ourselves.
Natalie No, this is unconscionable. This is wrong. She cant. You had something to do with this.
Cavil No, it was her decision totally.
Natalie_to_Leoben You cannot allow this.
Leoben There is no law. Theres no edict. Theres nothing that forbids it. Its just-- its never happened before.
Natalie_quietly Yeah, try and remember you said that when he boxes your line.
Cavil Now, dont be a sore loser.
Natalie If you do this, we all lose.
Simon We think its for the best.
Natalie The best. Have you lost your mind? Our identities are determined by our models. Each model is unique. We belong together. You know this better than anyone. Mechanized copies,  those are your very words.
Cavil Something has changed. Those are your very words. And I wholeheartedly agree.
Natalie The Raiders are sentient, just as we are. There was a plan, a divine plan in our design. Youre butchering them.
Cavil Were reconfiguring them.
Natalie You are not God.
Cavil No, Im a mechanic. The Raiders were designed to do a specific job. They stopped doing it, Im fixing that. And when the cuttings all done, theyll go back to being happy warriors. So lets move on, all right?
Natalie_breathing_loudly_and_coming_in_close_before_taking_off Ill pray for you. Ill pray hard.
Narcho All right, you hooch hounds! Lock it up! Its time! Shut the frak up! Pay attention. Pay attention. Hey! Were saying good-bye... to the best damn jock you pink-ass cones will ever hope to see.
Apollo_as_Athena_laughs Oh, shut up.
Narcho Major?
Officer Come on!
Apollo I have a drink.
Narcho Lets do this, come on now.
Apollo Im not thirsty.
Apollo_finally_accepting_the_first_shot To Galactica!
All To Galactica!
Apollo To the men and women of Galactica! To the Admiral.
All_As_Bill_nods_and_smiles_at_his_son To the Admiral!
Apollo_taking_the_third_and_fourth_shot ...Who commands the men and women of Galactica. And to our sweethearts, husbands, and wives.
All Sweethearts. To our sweethearts!
Apollo_more_quietly_taking_a_final_shot To absent friends.
All To absent friends!
Baltar Thank you. Oh--oh, thats very sweet. Thank you. Thank you.
Baltar Please... I dont know what to say. Um... excuse me, will you? Excuse me.
Baltar Youre spying on me, Tory. Ive seen you here.
Tory No, no. I heard about the miracle.
Baltar The child?
Tory Yes.
Baltar You mean Laura Roslin has heard about it.
Tory All right, I have been spying on you.
Baltar Well, its lucky I was sitting down, isnt it?
Tory Mm. Ive been watching these people. The way they look at you.
Baltar Of course, if you go screaming to the president that my newfound popularity borders on the phenomenal, then she should be very worried.
Tory I came here on my own.
Baltar And I slept with your boss last night.
Chip_Gaius_appearing_next_to_Tory_at_the_table Oh, come on, be nice. Whats it gonna cost you?
Baltar Oh, my God. Oh, my giddy aunt!
Chip_Gaius Get a grip, Gaius. If shes not lying she really could be a wonderful source of information. Why dont you feel her out?
Baltar Feel her what?
Tory What?
Baltar Im not talking to you.
Chip_Gaius Actually ... Try and forget me for a moment. Ask her what shes doing here.
Baltar_changing_course_cutely I am talking to you. Why did you come here?
Tory Maybe it was a mistake. Well, I cant stop thinking about whats happened. You were found innocent when everyone hated you. I hated you. And this healed boy, the return of Kara Thrace? I mean, everyone thought she was dead. So perhaps there are miracles.
Baltar Perhaps.
Tory Thing is, somehow you seem to be at the center of them.
Baltar Yes, I do, dont I? I dont understand myself, to be honest. Just, uh... well, it seems that God has chosen me to sing his song.
Tory A song?
Baltar Music. Did you say music?
Tory No.
Baltar Yeah, you know, its funny. Its a lot like that. Its like the distant chaos of an orchestra tuning up. And then somebody waves a magic wand, and all of those notes start to slide into place. A grotesque, screeching cacophony becomes a single melody.
Tory_leaving_suddenly I really shouldnt be seen here.
Baltar_to_Chip_Gaius Who the frak are you?! What, am I supposed to be impressed? I mean, youre me. Obviously youre me, so... Unless youre not me.
Chip_Gaius Huh?
Baltar Six? Is it you, Six? ...In disguise?
Chip_Gaius Now, why would she need to disguise herself from you?
Baltar Well, youve got a very good point.
Chip_Gaius Lets talk about Tory.
Baltar Where is she?
Chip_Gaius Lets talk about Tory. Cause we both know where this is heading. You like her, dont you?
Baltar Yeah, well, you know, shes, uh-- shes a sexy lady.
Chip_Gaius Yeah, yeah.
Baltar You know... Hot?
Chip_Gaius You slay me. You really do, Gaius.
Baltar Why?
Chip_Gaius Shes more than all these things. Shes special. And you feel it.
Both Fragile.
Baltar Yeah, I sense that too. Youre very observant. Fragile.
Chip_Gaius Handle with care.
Baltar Oh, Id love to...
Roslin Youre enjoying that more than usual.
Adama Hair of the dog. Lees party.
Roslin_snorting What do we do now? Put her on trial? Find Romo Lampkin? Take a show of hands?
Adama I dont know.
Roslin Follow her into an ambush?
Adama She is driven.
Roslin Yeah. You gonna keep waltzing, or are you gonna sit down and talk? Whats going on? Sit.
Adama_taking_a_drink What if shes telling the truth? She was supposed to die out there. She didnt, I cant explain it. What if she was meant to help us? And this was a...
Roslin A what? A miracle? Is that what you want to call this? Go ahead, say it. Grab your piece of the Golden Arrow, I want to hear Admiral Atheist say that a miracle happened.
Adama You shot at her and missed at close range.
Roslin Huh. Doloxan fraks with your aim.
Adama_taking_a_drink So does doubt.
Roslin_scary_and_unblinking I pulled the trigger and Id do it again. She put her life in front of a bullet as if it had no meaning. You drop an egg, you reach for another.
Adama Maybe convincing you meant more to her than her own life.
Roslin Is that your miracle? You want to talk about miracles? The very same day that a very pale doctor informed me that I had terminal cancer , most of humanity was annihilated, and I survived. And by some mathematical absurdity, I became President. And then my cancer disappeared. Long enough for us to find a way to Earth. You can call it whatever you want. And now Im dying.
Adama_sighing Dont talk that way.
Roslin Bill. Youve gotta face this. My life is coming to an end soon enough, and I am not going to apologize to you for not trusting her. And I am not... I am not going to trust her with the fate of this Fleet. You are so buckled up inside. You cant take any more loss. Your sons leaving. This -- me... I know it.
Adama_drinking No ones going anywhere.
Roslin Okay. Heres the truth. This is whats going on. You want to believe Kara. You would rather be wrong about her and face your own demise, than risk losing her again.
Adama_stares_and_then_quietly You can stay in the room, but get out of my head.
Roslin Youre so afraid to live alone.
Adama_pouring_yet_another_drink And youre afraid to die that way.
Roslin_grinning_bitterly Hmm.
Adama Youre afraid that you may not be the Dying Leader you thought you were. Or that your death may be as meaningless as everyone elses.
Apollo_entering_cell Um... Zarek nominated me for the vacant Quorum spot, so I...
Starbuck Youre Zareks wingman.
Apollo_so_easy_and_natural All right, all right, you know, stow it, okay. Ive heard it all before. The guys a piece of work, I know. His heads as big as the house I grew up in. But Im pretty new to all this, I could use the help. Besides, I never really could say no to anything.
Starbuck Except me.
Apollo Especially you. You know, I think I finally understand what you meant about having a destiny. Ive got to do this. And the fact that I dont have an explanation why doesnt... Doesnt really seem to matter anymore.
Starbuck_smiling_with_sadness_in_her_eyes So say we all.
Apollo So say we all.
Starbuck_standing_at_a_loss_and_holds_out_a_hand Good luck on your journey, Lee Adama.
Apollo_shaking_with_jaw_tight You too, Kara Thrace.
Starbuck_without_letting_go Okay.
Apollo_clasping_her_hand All right.
Starbuck_as_he_turns_to_go Lee?
Apollo_turning_to_kiss_her_again_first_with_passion_and_then_in_comfort_and_whispering I believe you.
Apollo Red and blue sections will go first, yellow and green will follow. Skids up in ten minutes... Starbuck, if youve got a problem, I dont want to hear about it...
Starbuck My only problem is that you didnt preach that sermon a week ago...
Apollo ...Keep your ears open... Any Cylon contact has shut down and bugged out... Questions?
Man Yeah, uh, when are you coming back to the card game?
Apollo Were on tomorrow night! Hey, all right, all right. Good luck. And be careful out there.
Helo_out_of_sight Attention to order!
Tigh In recognition of honorable, loyal, and faithful service, Madam President, Admiral of the Colonial Rleet, ladies and gentlemen: Major Lee Adama. Salute!
Helo Good luck.
Apollo Thank you. Well, it looks like you got the house. Ill miss you.
Dualla_finally_smiling Goodbye, Lee.
Apollo Look after yourself.
Natalie We want you to stop lobotomizing the Raiders, Cavil.
Cavil Raiders with free will? Not going to happen... Do you know what just really rankles my ass? Youve been pointing fingers, falsely accusing me of manipulation just short of tyranny, when youre the one thats been leading the charge here.
Natalie_arms_crossed We want you to stop.
Cavil Youre not in charge. We had a vote.
Natalie For the last time: Will you stop lobotomizing the Raiders?
Cavil_to_Simon Its unbelievable, isnt it? Unbelievable. For the last time, no.
Natalie I was afraid youd say that. Come in.
Cavil_as_Centurions_enter_the_room This is cute. Centurions cant vote, Six.
Natalie Oh, theyre not here to vote, Cavil.
Baltar Am I hurting you?
Tory No.
Baltar Whats wrong?
Tory Nothing.
Baltar_pulling_back What do you mean nothing? Youre crying.
Tory Its just something I do during sex.
Baltar All... All the time?
Tory Yeah. Im really sorry.
Baltar Dont be sorry. Why should you apologize? You should be thankful. You have an abundance of feeling.
Tory Ive never really thought of it like that.
Baltar Well I mean, youre blessed, arent you?
Tory I dont know, I guess... I suppose I could be a Cylon...
Baltar_sweetly_stroking_her_arm Well, I dont know about that. Human beings dont exclusively hold the patent on suffering. Cylons can feel.
Tory You believe that?
Baltar Yeah, I do, actually. Yeah. Ive spent time amongst them. Man may have made them, but Gods at the beginning of the string, isnt he? Its God who made the soul -- the One True God.
Tory One God?
Baltar Yeah, the One True God. You know, Im becoming increasingly tired of holding that in. Of denying that essential truth.
Cavil Now, this, uh... this isnt funny. Leave. ...I said, leave! ...Why dont they leave?
Natalie_producing_an_inhibitor The telencephalic inhibitor that restricts higher functions in the Centurions... we had them removed.
Cavil Say what?
Natalie You dumbed down the Raiders. We, the Leobens, the Sharons, gave the Centurions the gift of reason.
Cavil You have no authority to do this. None. You cant do anything without a vote!
Natalie No, we cant do anything with one. So were finished voting.
Cavil What have you done?
Natalie First thing they learned is what you were doing to the Raiders. You can imagine how they felt.
Doral Oh, no.
Gaeta Sir, the fleet is prepped and ready for jump.
Adama Execute jump.
Starbuck_alone_in_her_cell_unaware_that_Adamas_watching_crying_and_screaming_until_she_chokes Go back! Go back.
Helo Cuff her.
Starbuck So... you quietly cut me loose in deep space. Im not afraid to die.
Adama Little easier after youve been through it once.
Starbuck Harder. Especially now that Im seeing things so clearly. Youre making a mistake.
Adama Maybe I am. But I cant take the chance that youre right and not do something about it.
Adama Helo hand-picked a crew for you. Im giving you a ship. I hope you can stand the smell.
Helo Liberated the Demetrius. Its a sewage recycling ship. The party line will be that were going for a scouting mission. Looking for food.
Starbuck_looking_from_helo_to_adama So you think Im right.
Adama Maybe. Maybe not. But I know she is. The President. Shes been right all along. Im tired of losing. Im tired of turning away from the things that I want to believe in. And I believe you when you say that youll die before you stop trying. And I wont lose you again. Now go. Find a way to Earth.
