dr_gaius_baltar Previously, on Battlestar Galactica.
admiral_william_adama The Goddess Aurora.
captain_kara_thrace I thought that it would be a nice figurehead for your model ship. A fresh start.
admiral_william_adama Thank you.
cpt_lee_adama Starbuck, youre heading too low!
admiral_william_adama Come on, Lee, get her out of there.
cpt_lee_adama You come back!
captain_kara_thrace Just let me go.
cpt_lee_adama No!
cpt_lee_adama Baltars trial may have been the trigger, but this is a feeling Ive been having for a while. Its time for a change.
dr_gaius_baltar Please, God, dont let this child die. How can you take him and let me live?
Jeanne#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode02 God answered your prayers. You have to see. Look at him.
dr_gaius_baltar And no trace of a fever.
Jeanne#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode02 Its a miracle.
president_laura_roslin I need to know about the other five. The types weve never seen.
chief_galen_tyrol Its true. Were Cylons. And we have been from the start.
samuel_anders Even after that Raider scanned me with that red light, damn thing just cut and ran.
chief_galen_tyrol You think it recognized you as a Cylon?
samuel_anders Maybe thats why it didnt shoot me. More important, why didnt I shoot him?
captain_kara_thrace Okay, what the hells going on? Im off the ship for a few hours, and everybodys acting...
samuel_anders -- A few hours? Kara, you were gone for over two months.
captain_kara_thrace Thats impossible.
president_laura_roslin How did you get here?
captain_kara_thrace I told you, I dont know exactly.
captain_kara_thrace Damn it, theyre still going in the wrong direction. Another jump and Im gonna lose my way all together. Its Roslin. The old mans not gonna listen to me. I gotta get to her.
samuel_anders No, no, wait!
colonel_saul_tigh Look alive! And for fraks sake, dont shoot the Godsdamned President!
captain_karl_agathon Just let me talk to her.
colonel_saul_tigh Talk all you want, but it ends with the first bang.
colonel_saul_tigh Were rollin down here. Starbucks got the President!
admiral_william_adama Gaeta, take the comm.
captain_kara_thrace Move. Move! Come on. Move, come on! Over by the couch. Now!
captain_kara_thrace I want to hate you so much. So much.
captain_kara_thrace You had a vision. Remember? The Arrow, the Temple. I went down to that planet with you, and it was a frakkin toaster party. A lot of good people died. Remember?
president_laura_roslin Yes I do.
captain_kara_thrace I trusted you. On a vision. Thats it. A vision. I saw Earth. I saw it with my own eyes. And its calling me back. Were going the wrong way. Why cant you trust me?
captain_kara_thrace Shoot me. If you think Im a Cylon then Im your enemy. Shoot your enemy.
captain_kara_thrace Take it!
captain_kara_thrace Im no more a Cylon than you are. And you know it.
president_laura_roslin I wish I did.
captain_kara_thrace Ive put my life on the line for this frakkin ship. I have ate, slept, and fought next to the people that I love. I have pissed off my friends, I have broken more rules than Ive followed! I fracked up, okay, I messed up. But its all that I have. Those people are my family. And none of us belong here.
colonel_saul_tigh Two down. Weve got two down!
captain_kara_thrace Shoot me. if Im a Cylon, shoot me!
president_laura_roslin They made you perfect, didnt they?
sgt_erin_mathias Down on the floor. Down on the floor now! Now!
captain_kara_thrace What are you doing? Let go of me! What are -- get off me! Get off me! What are you doing? I am not a Cylon, Matthias!
colonel_saul_tigh Madam President.
captain_kara_thrace Mathias! Gods!
admiral_william_adama What the fraks going on here? I thought you were on the move.
colonel_saul_tigh We were! Shes out of her frakkin mind!
captain_kara_thrace Gods!
admiral_william_adama You all right?
captain_kara_thrace Get off me! Get off!
captain_kara_thrace Listen to me, please. Im losing it. The ringing... the way to Earth... its getting weaker. Dont you understand? Dont any of you understand? It was so... it was so clear. Like it was coming from the next room. Stop looking at me like that. I can feel it slipping away. Even without jumping! As we move... its half of what it was when I got here. Half. If we keep jumping itll be gone, and well never find it again. I thought thats what we wanted. A way to earth. Do you hear me?
colonel_saul_tigh Get her out of here.
captain_kara_thrace You better work on your aim, because Im not gonna stop! Youre gonna have to kill me! One more jump and itll be gone! Admiral! Admiral!
the_hybrid ...the excited state decays by vibrational relaxation into the first excited singlet state yes yes and merrily we go reduce atmospheric nitrogen by 0.03% it is not much consolation that society will pick up the bits leaving us at eight modern where punishment rather than interdiction is paramount please cut the fuse they will not harm their own end of line. Limiting diffusions to two dimensions increases the number of evolutionary jumps within the species rise and measure the temple of the Five transformation is the goal they will not harm their own data/font synchronization complete...
number_six The Hybrid is clearly telling us something.
john_cavil The Hybrid is always telling us something. Theyre supposed to maintain operations on each ship, not vomit metaphysics.
john_cavil All right, I give up. What. What is she trying to tell us?
Eight#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode02 Theyre in the Colonial Fleet. With the humans.
john_cavil They? They who?
leoben_conoy The ... Final Five.
number_six The Raiders refuse to fight because they sense the Final Five might be in the Colonial Fleet...
leoben_conoy -- They couldve ... couldve been caught, they could be in hiding...
john_cavil No, stop. Stop right now. Turn around, go and take a cleansing walk, and I am gonna try and forget what I just heard.
number_six The Final Five, Cavil, theyre near. This is far too important....
leoben_conoy -- What their eyes must have seen, witnessed over time...
Eight_grinning_hugely#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode02 -- Think they look anything like us?
john_cavil -- Thats enough! Dont you realize what youre doing? Youre openly discussing the Final Five! Thats forbidden! Youre toying with our survival. Look at yourselves. Look, theres millions of Twos have that nose. Millions of Sixes possess that mouth. Eights share those breasts, and Ones have this brain. Were mechanized copies. Theres a reason the original programmers clearly felt that its a mistake for us to contact the Final Five!
number_six No!
john_cavil Violating that programming threatens our survival.
number_six Something has changed.
john_cavil Thoughts have changed. Yes, they change. The Raiders changed. Thats where all this started, with them. Somehow they exceeded their programming, and unlike us, they cant correct themselves. So were gonna have to do it for them.
number_six Do what?
john_cavil Well reconfigure their neural architecture, and shave down their heuristic responses.
leoben_conoy Dumb them down? Lobotomize them?
john_cavil Theyre tools, not pets. But in any case, it has to be done.
number_six Says who?
john_cavil Says God Almighty the voice of reason, thats who. When are you gonna hear it?
number_six You dont have the authority to make any change without a majority vote.
john_cavil Well, well vote. The Fours and Fives will be on my side.
number_six There will be a vote. The Raiders hear what we hear.
john_cavil The Raiders are simple machines.
number_six No. Something extraordinary has happened. Something is calling to us. Pushing us to discover our origins, to understand our place in the universe. The Raiders are part of that, and the Final Five...
john_cavil -- Are anywhere but with the humans.
colonel_saul_tigh Youre late.
chief_galen_tyrol I had to wait for Cally to nod off, okay? Shes having trouble sleeping.
samuel_anders Did you see Kara?
colonel_saul_tigh I saw her. Shes crazy as a latrine rat. If anything, shes more like Starbuck than ever.
samuel_anders Shes my wife.
colonel_saul_tigh And the President nearly put a bullet in her skull because she suspected her of being a Cylon. You are one! We bring attention to ourselves, were fracked! If Starbuck is one of us, shes playing it big the other way.
tory_foster The four of us heard the music and sought each other out. She hasnt. Were still missing one.
chief_galen_tyrol Baltar. Not Baltar, but when I found him in the temple on the algae planet, he was with one of those skin jobs, the one they call DAnna. She saw something in there. I dont know what it is. But they talked. He might know something. Hes got those one-God nut cases believing hes some kind of healer, he brought some boy out from a coma.
colonel_saul_tigh Maybe he knows who the fifth is.
tory_foster Yeah, maybe he knows who we are.
colonel_saul_tigh Then we gotta get in close and find out.
chief_galen_tyrol How do you propose we do that? Take him out for drinks?
colonel_saul_tigh Well, he is accomplished at two things. Lying in his cell, and lying in a woman. Hed poke a skin job. He racked up a Six, thats a given...
tory_foster -- There is no way.
colonel_saul_tigh You dont have to get on your back for him, but...
tory_foster Oh gee. Thanks.
admiral_william_adama What were you doing? What were you thinking? What happened to you?!
captain_kara_thrace I saw Earth. The shape of it, the smell of it. The feel of it on my skin in my pores. And I swear to you, it was like Id been there before. Like I never left.
admiral_william_adama Youre too stupid to figure out you just screwed over the one ally you had. You didnt have the guts to hold on. Tell me. Whos gonna help you?
captain_kara_thrace Yeah, frak me, huh? It sure as hell isnt gonna be you. Youve gotta remind yourself that youre somebody else. Youre the presidents wet nurse. Youre the one who doesnt have the guts.
captain_kara_thrace Nice to know you still care, Admiral.
captain_kara_thrace Were going the wrong way!
john_cavil We have all conferred with our models, and the results are in. The Fours and the Fives have joined us Ones, and they voted to reconfigure the Raiders.
number_six Gee, what a surprise. Well, the Twos, Sixes and Eights voted against it, so were deadlocked.
john_cavil Hopelessly. But you were right. And Im machine enough to admit that I was wrong.
number_six What are you talking about?
john_cavil Well, something extraordinary has happened. ...Eight!
number_six Whats going on?
number_six Boomer.
john_cavil Im not going to sugarcoat this. Ill just say that this Eight has voted to reconfigure.
number_six What?
john_cavil Shocked? I was shocked too.
number_six But no one has ever voted against their model. No one. Is this true?
lt_sharon_valerii We have to be able to defend ourselves.
number_six No, this is unconscionable. This is wrong. She cant. You had something to do with this.
john_cavil No, it was her decision totally.
number_six You cannot allow this.
leoben_conoy There is no law. Theres no edict. Theres nothing that forbids it. Its just-- its never happened before.
number_six Yeah, try and remember you said that when he boxes your line.
john_cavil Now, dont be a sore loser.
number_six If you do this, we all lose.
simon We think its for the best.
number_six The best. Have you lost your mind? Our identities are determined by our models. Each model is unique. We belong together. You know this better than anyone. Mechanized copies, those are your very words.
john_cavil Something has changed. Those are your very words. And I wholeheartedly agree.
number_six The Raiders are sentient, just as we are. There was a plan, a divine plan in our design. Youre butchering them.
john_cavil Were reconfiguring them.
number_six You are not God.
john_cavil No, Im a mechanic. The Raiders were designed to do a specific job. They stopped doing it, Im fixing that. And when the cuttings all done, theyll go back to being happy warriors. So lets move on, all right?
number_six Ill pray for you. Ill pray hard.
Narcho#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode02 All right, you hooch hounds! Lock it up! Its time! Shut the frak up! Pay attention. Pay attention. Hey! Were saying good-bye... to the best damn jock you pink-ass cones will ever hope to see.
cpt_lee_adama Oh, shut up.
Narcho#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode02 Major?
officer_anastasia_dualla Come on!
cpt_lee_adama I have a drink.
Narcho#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode02 Lets do this, come on now.
cpt_lee_adama Im not thirsty.
cpt_lee_adama To Galactica!
All#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode02 To Galactica!
cpt_lee_adama To the men and women of Galactica! To the Admiral.
All_As_Bill_nods_and_smiles_at_his_son#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode02 To the Admiral!
cpt_lee_adama ...Who commands the men and women of Galactica. And to our sweethearts, husbands, and wives.
All#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode02 Sweethearts. To our sweethearts!
cpt_lee_adama To absent friends.
All#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode02 To absent friends!
dr_gaius_baltar Thank you. Oh--oh, thats very sweet. Thank you. Thank you.
dr_gaius_baltar Please... I dont know what to say. Um... excuse me, will you? Excuse me.
dr_gaius_baltar Youre spying on me, Tory. Ive seen you here.
tory_foster No, no. I heard about the miracle.
dr_gaius_baltar The child?
tory_foster Yes.
dr_gaius_baltar You mean Laura Roslin has heard about it.
tory_foster All right, I have been spying on you.
dr_gaius_baltar Well, its lucky I was sitting down, isnt it?
tory_foster Mm. Ive been watching these people. The way they look at you.
dr_gaius_baltar Of course, if you go screaming to the president that my newfound popularity borders on the phenomenal, then she should be very worried.
tory_foster I came here on my own.
dr_gaius_baltar And I slept with your boss last night.
dr_gaius_baltar Oh, come on, be nice. Whats it gonna cost you?
dr_gaius_baltar Oh, my God. Oh, my giddy aunt!
dr_gaius_baltar Get a grip, Gaius. If shes not lying she really could be a wonderful source of information. Why dont you feel her out?
dr_gaius_baltar Feel her what?
tory_foster What?
dr_gaius_baltar Im not talking to you.
dr_gaius_baltar Actually ... Try and forget me for a moment. Ask her what shes doing here.
dr_gaius_baltar I am talking to you. Why did you come here?
tory_foster Maybe it was a mistake. Well, I cant stop thinking about whats happened. You were found innocent when everyone hated you. I hated you. And this healed boy, the return of Kara Thrace? I mean, everyone thought she was dead. So perhaps there are miracles.
dr_gaius_baltar Perhaps.
tory_foster Thing is, somehow you seem to be at the center of them.
dr_gaius_baltar Yes, I do, dont I? I dont understand myself, to be honest. Just, uh... well, it seems that God has chosen me to sing his song.
tory_foster A song?
dr_gaius_baltar Music. Did you say music?
tory_foster No.
dr_gaius_baltar Yeah, you know, its funny. Its a lot like that. Its like the distant chaos of an orchestra tuning up. And then somebody waves a magic wand, and all of those notes start to slide into place. A grotesque, screeching cacophony becomes a single melody.
tory_foster I really shouldnt be seen here.
dr_gaius_baltar Who the frak are you?! What, am I supposed to be impressed? I mean, youre me. Obviously youre me, so... Unless youre not me.
dr_gaius_baltar Huh?
dr_gaius_baltar Six? Is it you, Six? ...In disguise?
dr_gaius_baltar Now, why would she need to disguise herself from you?
dr_gaius_baltar Well, youve got a very good point.
dr_gaius_baltar Lets talk about Tory.
dr_gaius_baltar Where is she?
dr_gaius_baltar Lets talk about Tory. Cause we both know where this is heading. You like her, dont you?
dr_gaius_baltar Yeah, well, you know, shes, uh-- shes a sexy lady.
dr_gaius_baltar Yeah, yeah.
dr_gaius_baltar You know... Hot?
dr_gaius_baltar You slay me. You really do, Gaius.
dr_gaius_baltar Why?
dr_gaius_baltar Shes more than all these things. Shes special. And you feel it.
Both#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode02 Fragile.
dr_gaius_baltar Yeah, I sense that too. Youre very observant. Fragile.
dr_gaius_baltar Handle with care.
dr_gaius_baltar Oh, Id love to...
president_laura_roslin Youre enjoying that more than usual.
admiral_william_adama Hair of the dog. Lees party.
president_laura_roslin What do we do now? Put her on trial? Find Romo Lampkin? Take a show of hands?
admiral_william_adama I dont know.
president_laura_roslin Follow her into an ambush?
admiral_william_adama She is driven.
president_laura_roslin Yeah. You gonna keep waltzing, or are you gonna sit down and talk? Whats going on? Sit.
admiral_william_adama What if shes telling the truth? She was supposed to die out there. She didnt, I cant explain it. What if she was meant to help us? And this was a...
president_laura_roslin A what? A miracle? Is that what you want to call this? Go ahead, say it. Grab your piece of the Golden Arrow, I want to hear Admiral Atheist say that a miracle happened.
admiral_william_adama You shot at her and missed at close range.
president_laura_roslin Huh. Doloxan fraks with your aim.
admiral_william_adama So does doubt.
president_laura_roslin I pulled the trigger and Id do it again. She put her life in front of a bullet as if it had no meaning. You drop an egg, you reach for another.
admiral_william_adama Maybe convincing you meant more to her than her own life.
president_laura_roslin Is that your miracle? You want to talk about miracles? The very same day that a very pale doctor informed me that I had terminal cancer , most of humanity was annihilated, and I survived. And by some mathematical absurdity, I became President. And then my cancer disappeared. Long enough for us to find a way to Earth. You can call it whatever you want. And now Im dying.
admiral_william_adama Dont talk that way.
president_laura_roslin Bill. Youve gotta face this. My life is coming to an end soon enough, and I am not going to apologize to you for not trusting her. And I am not... I am not going to trust her with the fate of this Fleet. You are so buckled up inside. You cant take any more loss. Your sons leaving. This -- me... I know it.
admiral_william_adama No ones going anywhere.
president_laura_roslin Okay. Heres the truth. This is whats going on. You want to believe Kara. You would rather be wrong about her and face your own demise, than risk losing her again.
admiral_william_adama You can stay in the room, but get out of my head.
president_laura_roslin Youre so afraid to live alone.
admiral_william_adama And youre afraid to die that way.
president_laura_roslin Hmm.
admiral_william_adama Youre afraid that you may not be the Dying Leader you thought you were. Or that your death may be as meaningless as everyone elses.
cpt_lee_adama Um... Zarek nominated me for the vacant Quorum spot, so I...
captain_kara_thrace Youre Zareks wingman.
cpt_lee_adama All right, all right, you know, stow it, okay. Ive heard it all before. The guys a piece of work, I know. His heads as big as the house I grew up in. But Im pretty new to all this, I could use the help. Besides, I never really could say no to anything.
captain_kara_thrace Except me.
cpt_lee_adama Especially you. You know, I think I finally understand what you meant about having a destiny. Ive got to do this. And the fact that I dont have an explanation why doesnt... Doesnt really seem to matter anymore.
captain_kara_thrace So say we all.
cpt_lee_adama So say we all.
captain_kara_thrace Good luck on your journey, Lee Adama.
cpt_lee_adama You too, Kara Thrace.
captain_kara_thrace Okay.
cpt_lee_adama All right.
captain_kara_thrace Lee?
cpt_lee_adama I believe you.
cpt_lee_adama Red and blue sections will go first, yellow and green will follow. Skids up in ten minutes... Starbuck, if youve got a problem, I dont want to hear about it...
captain_kara_thrace My only problem is that you didnt preach that sermon a week ago...
cpt_lee_adama ...Keep your ears open... Any Cylon contact has shut down and bugged out... Questions?
Man#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode02 Yeah, uh, when are you coming back to the card game?
cpt_lee_adama Were on tomorrow night! Hey, all right, all right. Good luck. And be careful out there.
captain_karl_agathon Attention to order!
colonel_saul_tigh In recognition of honorable, loyal, and faithful service, Madam President, Admiral of the Colonial Rleet, ladies and gentlemen: Major Lee Adama. Salute!
captain_karl_agathon Good luck.
cpt_lee_adama Thank you. Well, it looks like you got the house. Ill miss you.
officer_anastasia_dualla Goodbye, Lee.
cpt_lee_adama Look after yourself.
number_six We want you to stop lobotomizing the Raiders, Cavil.
john_cavil Raiders with free will? Not going to happen... Do you know what just really rankles my ass? Youve been pointing fingers, falsely accusing me of manipulation just short of tyranny, when youre the one thats been leading the charge here.
number_six We want you to stop.
john_cavil Youre not in charge. We had a vote.
number_six For the last time: Will you stop lobotomizing the Raiders?
john_cavil Its unbelievable, isnt it? Unbelievable. For the last time, no.
number_six I was afraid youd say that. Come in.
john_cavil This is cute. Centurions cant vote, Six.
number_six Oh, theyre not here to vote, Cavil.
dr_gaius_baltar Am I hurting you?
tory_foster No.
dr_gaius_baltar Whats wrong?
tory_foster Nothing.
dr_gaius_baltar What do you mean nothing? Youre crying.
tory_foster Its just something I do during sex.
dr_gaius_baltar All... All the time?
tory_foster Yeah. Im really sorry.
dr_gaius_baltar Dont be sorry. Why should you apologize? You should be thankful. You have an abundance of feeling.
tory_foster Ive never really thought of it like that.
dr_gaius_baltar Well I mean, youre blessed, arent you?
tory_foster I dont know, I guess... I suppose I could be a Cylon...
dr_gaius_baltar Well, I dont know about that. Human beings dont exclusively hold the patent on suffering. Cylons can feel.
tory_foster You believe that?
dr_gaius_baltar Yeah, I do, actually. Yeah. Ive spent time amongst them. Man may have made them, but Gods at the beginning of the string, isnt he? Its God who made the soul -- the One True God.
tory_foster One God?
dr_gaius_baltar Yeah, the One True God. You know, Im becoming increasingly tired of holding that in. Of denying that essential truth.
john_cavil Now, this, uh... this isnt funny. Leave. ...I said, leave! ...Why dont they leave?
number_six The telencephalic inhibitor that restricts higher functions in the Centurions... we had them removed.
john_cavil Say what?
number_six You dumbed down the Raiders. We, the Leobens, the Sharons, gave the Centurions the gift of reason.
john_cavil You have no authority to do this. None. You cant do anything without a vote!
number_six No, we cant do anything with one. So were finished voting.
john_cavil What have you done?
number_six First thing they learned is what you were doing to the Raiders. You can imagine how they felt.
aaron_doral Oh, no.
lt_felix_gaeta Sir, the fleet is prepped and ready for jump.
admiral_william_adama Execute jump.
captain_kara_thrace Go back! Go back.
captain_karl_agathon Cuff her.
captain_kara_thrace So... you quietly cut me loose in deep space. Im not afraid to die.
admiral_william_adama Little easier after youve been through it once.
captain_kara_thrace Harder. Especially now that Im seeing things so clearly. Youre making a mistake.
admiral_william_adama Maybe I am. But I cant take the chance that youre right and not do something about it.
admiral_william_adama Helo hand-picked a crew for you. Im giving you a ship. I hope you can stand the smell.
captain_karl_agathon Liberated the Demetrius. Its a sewage recycling ship. The party line will be that were going for a scouting mission. Looking for food.
captain_kara_thrace So you think Im right.
admiral_william_adama Maybe. Maybe not. But I know she is. The President. Shes been right all along. Im tired of losing. Im tired of turning away from the things that I want to believe in. And I believe you when you say that youll die before you stop trying. And I wont lose you again. Now go. Find a way to Earth.
