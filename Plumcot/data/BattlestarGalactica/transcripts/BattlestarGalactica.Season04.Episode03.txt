chief_galen_tyrol Were Cylons. And we have been from the start.
cpt_lee_adama Its time for a change. Ive had some feelers from the government. I think I could make a valuable contribution there.
admiral_william_adama Im giving you a ship. Now go find a way to Earth.
DAnna_VO#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode03 There are five other Cylons, brother. I saw them.
john_cavil Yes, we know. Thats why weve decided to box your entire line.
number_six The telencephalic inhibitor that restricts higher functions in the Centurions? We had them removed.
john_cavil Say what?
speaking_delegate_1 Welcome back, Brother.
john_cavil What happened?
lt_sharon_valerii You were shot, but youre with us now.
john_cavil Shot by who?
speaking_delegate_1 By our own Centurions.
john_cavil Thats pure insanity. The Sixes have lost their minds. They have no idea of the threat that theyve unleashed. I need to get to my ship.
speaking_delegate_1 Its not your ship anymore. The Sixes and their acolytes used their new pets to engage in a little ethnic cleansing.
lt_sharon_valerii The whole Fleets split right down the middle. So much for my swing vote.
john_cavil Thatll teach me not to trust in democracy.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson They cant possibly need you every single hour of every single day. Cant you just tell someone to fill in for you?
chief_galen_tyrol Who? Who, Cally? Whos gonna fill in for me?
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson I dont know! Anyone can frakkin turn a wrench down there. Theres not ...
chief_galen_tyrol Im the chief of the frak....Ive had enough of this. Enough of this!
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Yes! Yes!
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Its me again. No, I know, Im sorry. No, can you please just check?
chief_galen_tyrol I used to know who I was. Galen Tyrol. Crew chief, husband, father. I look in the mirror nowadays, I dont even know what I am.
tory_foster Are you and Cally getting along?
tory_foster You know, I never really liked ambrosia before. But now. Its like Im being flooded with new sensations and new feelings. Maybe you are too.
tory_foster In some ways, I dont hate this. Feeling new. Feeling open to things. To change...
chief_galen_tyrol I dont do well with change.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Galen, you son of a...
chief_galen_tyrol Oh, Cally! Cally, come here, come here. Just give her some room.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Let go of me! Let go!
chief_galen_tyrol Just listen to me for a second. Where are you going? Cally. Cally, listen to me.
dr_cottle The nausea should go away in about an hour.
admiral_william_adama Love & Bullets, by Nick Taylo, Chapter One. It started like it always did. With a body. This one was in the river. I could tell she had once been beautiful, but this a bullet and fast current had taken away from her. All we are, all that we think we are. All that we are certain about is taken away from us. When youve worked the streets and seen what Ive seen, you become more and more convinced of it every day. Caprica City had been my teacher, my mistress. From the moment I open my eyes, shes in my blood, like cheap wine.
admiral_william_adama Bitter and sweet, tinged with regret. Ill never be free of her, nor do I want to be.
admiral_william_adama For she is what I am. All that is, should always be.
cpt_lee_adama I am grateful and consistently inspired by the compassionate and forthright leadership of President Roslin. By the wisdom of my father, whom some of you may know. And by the support and advice of my valued friends. Some of whom, you may be shocked to hear, are not Capricans. And so I am honored to accept this appointment to the quorum in the hope that I can continue Delegate Cowans courageous work on behalf of the people of Caprica and the Fleet. Thank you.
cpt_lee_adama Yes.
Reporter#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode03 Madam President, by confirming Mr. Adamas nomination, does this mean you dont have any hard feelings about his role in the Baltar Trial?
president_laura_roslin Mr. Adama took on a cause he felt was important. And I fully trust he will continue to bring the same passion and clear-mindedness in representing his constituents. Yes?
playa_palacios What about the Demetrius, the sewage recycling freighter that jumped away three weeks ago.
president_laura_roslin I will ask Admiral Adama to answer that question.
admiral_william_adama The Demetrius is on a military mission.
First_Reporter#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode03 What about the rumor that Kara Thrace was put in charge of that mission?
admiral_william_adama I dont comment on rumors.
president_laura_roslin Im gonna have to cut this short. I will see you all very soon at the Quorum Q&A. Thank you very much. Scattered applause and more scrum.
president_laura_roslin Frankly, Im surprised it took them this long to come after us about the Demetrius.
admiral_william_adama Any luck and itll blow over.
president_laura_roslin Its not going to blow over. Im gonna be covering for you for a long time on this.
admiral_william_adama I wanted to give Kara a chance. I wanted to give myself a chance to believe in her.
president_laura_roslin Apparently.
lt_felix_gaeta You wanted to see me, sir?
captain_kara_thrace Ive made a decision.
ensign_diana_seelix CAPs and recon runs... Okay, anyone want to remind me what were supposed to be looking for?
lt_eammon_pike Didnt you get the Commanders memo? Its a unique astronomic cluster. A system with a ringed gas giant, trinary star, and a comet.
ensign_diana_seelix Astronomic cluster. Sounds more like a cluster frak.
captain_karl_agathon Hey, thats enough of that crap.
ensign_diana_seelix Sorry, sir, but you gotta admit its starting to feel like were flying around in circles.
lt_sharon_valerii Whats the latest, Felix?
lt_felix_gaeta Shes reversing course, returning to sector seven.
lt_sharon_valerii Oh, that is the tenth course correction. She give a reason this time?
lt_felix_gaeta A reason? Lets just say I think shes steering with her gut.
ensign_diana_seelix Frak me.
lt_eammon_pike Im telling you guys this thing is a setup anyway. I mean, you think that the old man just gave her the ship and then cut her loose? I guarantee you Galacticas dogging our every move, and theyre just waiting to jump in as soon as she shows her true colors...
samuel_anders -- You know what? You dont know what the hell youre talking about.
lt_eammon_pike You gonna tell me what I know, rook?
samuel_anders Yeah!
captain_karl_agathon I said to can it! All of you!
captain_kara_thrace Helo, I need to talk to you. Now!
lt_eammon_pike Who wants odds on a course correction then?
samuel_anders Kara, hey, listen. Some of us have been wondering about this trinary star formation were supposed to be looking for. Is there anything else you can tell us about it? Any new data? Anything at all?
captain_kara_thrace You know everything you need to know, ensign. So stow the questions and do your job.
captain_karl_agathon Yes, sir. Whats up, Captain?
captain_kara_thrace Helo, I have new jump coordinates. Double check the data file and the FTL drive. Got it?
chief_galen_tyrol Cally, I told you last night and Im telling you again right now. I am not having an affair. I went out for a drink. I ran into Tory. We started talking. Look, I know how it looks, but its completely innocent. Theres nothing to it.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Youre gonna have to drop Nicky off. I have a doctors appointment. Can you tell them not to feed him any of that algae mash? I think hes allergic.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Just remember about the algae.
chief_galen_tyrol No, Im sorry. Daddys sorry, Daddys sorry.
john_cavil I see youre still cleaning up your mess.
number_six Oh, I hardly think this qualifies as our mess.
john_cavil Well, I guess that explains why none of you are lending a helping hand. Really, Six, if you had wanted some room to spread out, you couldve just asked.
number_six Is there anything that isnt fodder for a joke with you? Or is that really how you see our very existence, as some sort of nihilistic punch line?
john_cavil Nihilistic punch line? I like that. But quite honestly, Im feeling very serious. Getting riddled with bullets affects me that way. But I want you all to know that I place the blame for all of this squarely on myself.
number_six Go on.
john_cavil Well, you had legitimate concerns, but I refused to hear them. But now Im listening. So tell me, whats to be done to stop all this and let us get back together?
lt_sharon_valerii Well, for starters, you can stop lobotomizing the Raiders.
john_cavil Done.
number_six And you can agree to unbox the DAnnas.
john_cavil Resurrect her entire line? Dont forget, Six, it was DAnnas messianic quest for secrets better left alone that started us down this divisive path in the first place.
number_six You talk about restoring our unity. Well, we think its time to restore our greater unity. To unite the twelve models once and for all.
john_cavil Well, I dont think the others will accept this, but Ill make your case.
number_six Escort him off the ship.
number_six Please?
john_cavil Its a good thing you remembered the magic word. Youre going to find you opened a bigger can of worms than you realize.
tom_zarek Inspiring, isnt it? A government of the people, for the people, and answerable to the people. At least thats the idea. I heard you tried to see her.
cpt_lee_adama I had some bills I wanted to discuss. Projects Delegate Cowan was pushing before she died. But they told me she wasnt in.
tom_zarek She was, just not for you. By standing up for Baltar, you crossed the line with her. And Laura Roslin is not the type to forgive and forget.
cpt_lee_adama She forgave you. She made you Vice President.
tom_zarek To keep me on the sidelines. Same way shell try to sideline you.
cpt_lee_adama Well, then. Im intrigued. Why did you nominate me in the first place?
tom_zarek Because you did stand up for Baltar. And you put Roslin on the stand to do it. You werent afraid to ask some hard questions and to demand some honest answers.
cpt_lee_adama Well, if youre looking for a repeat performance, youre out of luck. I didnt take this job to help you undermine the President.
tom_zarek Im not asking you to. Believe it or not, Im on Lauras side.
cpt_lee_adama Okay, then whats the problem?
tom_zarek Its amazing the things you start to notice when youre on the sidelines. How every decision that Laura and your father make gets stamped CLASSIFIED. Or how her directives are starting to read like decrees, yet still get enacted without so much as a debate. You know, she wont even allow records to be kept of any of her meetings. Secrecy and control are becoming obsessions for her. I think this Demetrius business is just the tip of the iceberg.
cpt_lee_adama Well, sometimes a benevolent tyrants exactly what you need.
tom_zarek No. A tyrant craves power for its own sake. And all Laura wants is to save us all. Trust me. Better yet, trust yourself. Because thats what Im really counting on, that youre not the kind of man who can ignore the truth when it stares you in the face.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson What if you gave me a sedative and I just slept here?
dr_cottle Oh, sure. Well just turn my sickbay in an opium den so you can have a little snooze.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Feels like I havent had a nights sleep since we reached that frakkin Nebula.
dr_cottle How are things on the home front?
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson You mean other than catching my husband with another woman and having him tell me Im imagining things?
dr_cottle Well, the man doesnt know what hes got at home. Should have his head examined. As a matter of fact, why dont you bring him in? Ill take a look.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson See, thats what I like about you, Doc. You just pretend to be a bastard.
dr_cottle Well, while youre in the mood for tough love, maybe you are imagining things. You know, fatigue and antidepressants can make a hell of a paranoia cocktail.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson I felt like I needed to take something to keep from going completely crazy.
dr_cottle Youre not crazy.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson What would you call someone who all but proposes to a man after he breaks her jaw?
dr_cottle That the last time he laid hands on you?
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson You want to hear something really sick? Sometimes I wish he would. Lay hands on me. At least then Id... Id know he had some feelings about me.
dr_cottle Listen, just get some sleep and clear your head.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Will do, Doc. Thank you.
samuel_anders Kara, what the hells the matter with you? Cause the way youre holing up in here, youre making people wonder.
captain_kara_thrace Let em. Frankly, theyre starting to bug me as much as I bug them. Frak em.
samuel_anders You know, some of us actually volunteered for this mission.
captain_kara_thrace Some, meaning you? Is that what this is about, Sam? You want to know what the deal is with us? With our marriage? Well, it didnt make much sense to begin with, makes even less now.
samuel_anders Give me that. I dont buy that. I dont think you believe a single frakkin word youre saying. Youre just scared.
samuel_anders You see that, hmm? You see this? You remember those? Do you remember when we got em? Thats whats real. Okay, that is part of who we are. That is a part of who you are, whether you want to admit it or not.
captain_kara_thrace You dumb motherfrakker. I only married you because it was safe and it was easy, Sam. And you were just pathetic enough to go along with it. So get the frak out. I said get out. Get out!
samuel_anders What are you gonna do, huh?
captain_kara_thrace Get out!
captain_kara_thrace I dont want to fight, Sam. I want to frak. You dont get it, do you? Im not the same girl you married. All I want to do right now is frak. Really frak, like its the end of the world and nothing else matters. So come on, Sam. Make me feel something. I dare you.
captain_kara_thrace We were married, werent we? I mean, that wasnt just like a fantasy.
samuel_anders Hell no. And I got the scars to prove it.
captain_kara_thrace Does that seem different to you somehow?
samuel_anders Different how?
captain_kara_thrace Not sure. Its like everything seems so far away. The way things feel, the way they taste. Like Im watching myself, but Im not really experiencing it, not living it. Like my bodys just this alien thing that Im still attached to. Does that seem crazy to you?
speaking_delegate_1 Frankly, we were as surprised as you are. We presented your case. There was some debate. And we were outvoted.
john_cavil Our compatriots now seem to agree that it was wrong to box the DAnnas.
number_six Sounds like your own opinion hasnt changed.
john_cavil I promised that wed do some hard thinking. But in the end, we decided that our choices were correct.
speaking_delegate_1 Unfortunately, restoring unity was all the others seemed to care about.
lt_sharon_valerii Its hard to have unity when youre still so opposed to everything the rest of us believe in.
john_cavil Look, he kept his word. You won the day. Do you think you have the right to win our hearts and minds too?
speaking_delegate_1 No, youre being presumptuous...
lt_sharon_valerii Dont even try to compare us to...
number_six Theyre right. If theyve agreed to our terms, then theres no point in courting any more discord.
speaking_delegate_1 Any more discord and we may run out of spare bodies.
john_cavil The Threes core consciousness is being downloaded at our central resurrection hub. The nearest accessible server is a half dozen jumps from here. We can go together and hear what your newfound heroine has to say.
number_six If you dont mind, wed prefer to stay on our own ships.
john_cavil By all means. I doubt that the rest of us would feel comfortable here anyway.
tom_zarek The chair recognizes the delegate from Sagittaron.
jacob_cantrell Would the President care to comment on the news stories crediting so-called military sources that claim the Demetrius is searching for new food sources? Or, Madam President, would you rather that we just simply accept this obvious attempt at disinformation?
tom_zarek Order, please.
president_laura_roslin Im afraid I dont control the media, Jacob, as much as you know Id love to. Regarding the reports, the Demetrius mission is a matter of Fleet security, and as such I cant and wont discuss it, period.
jacob_cantrell Madam President, I have to say that my constituency is not satisfied with an executive...
Female_Representative#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode03 Do you realize this casts doubt on something as fundamental as our route to Earth?
president_laura_roslin Yes, but dont take my yes to imply that the rumors are true.
jacob_cantrell Madam President!
president_laura_roslin Jacob, everyone, please. I cannot believe that the Demetrius is the only matter that is important to your constituents. Can we please move on? You know my answer to this.
tom_zarek Order, please. Order!
cpt_lee_adama Madam President, Im sure we can all understand the importance for the need for security. Coming from the military, its my experience that we sometimes err too strongly on the side of caution. So for the sake of reassuring my colleagues and hopefully putting this matter to rest, would it not be fair to say that you and Admiral Adama are naturally exploring all possible routes to Earth?
Female_Representative#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode03 Hear, hear. Now were getting focus.
Laura_standing#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode03 Mr. Adama, we are all anxious to receive the benefit of your experience. But, um, I personally dont feel the need to have a junior delegate appoint himself my spokesman. Lets move on. Jacob, you had a matter on the table. Would you please continue?
jacob_cantrell Thank you, Madam President. My constituents are once again having problems obtaining medical supplies now I have...
cpt_lee_adama Point of order. Excuse me.
tom_zarek Hello? Order, please! Order, please! Thank you very, very much. Mr. Cantrell, will you yield the floor?
jacob_cantrell I will yield.
cpt_lee_adama Thank you. This relates to your Executive Order 112...
president_laura_roslin 112
cpt_lee_adama ...Which establishes a system of tribunals, the judges chosen by you, answerable only to a special court of appeals, the judges of which would also be chosen by you. Effectively it creates a justice system that further and dangerously concentrates power into the hands of the Executive. Namely, into your hands, Madam President. Far from being independent or impartial, it would actually damage the very idea of justice. Even the illusion of the idea of justice.
president_laura_roslin Thank you, Mr. Adama. The order youre referring to, Executive Order 112, is actually a work in progress, and the changes it proposes are provisional. It is a first step, a tiny step, but the first step in a, uh, in a larger plan, actually, to create a fair and comprehensive legal system, which you of all people can admit we sorely need. Now naturally I was going to bring it to the Quorum to open it up for debate once it was finished, which it isnt. But since youve brought it into the public today, I propose that we put it on the docket for the next full session. Is that satisfactory to you, Mr. Adama?
lt_sharon_valerii The Resurrection Ship didnt make the jump.
number_six Problem with their FTL?
lt_sharon_valerii No report.
lt_sharon_valerii Now Cavils baseships are breaking formation, taking positions around our periphery.
number_six Theyre going to attack. Alert the others! We need to jump now.
lt_sharon_valerii Theyve taken out our FTL!
number_six No Resurrection Ship... Theyre really trying to kill us!
john_cavil Just remember. They started it.
lt_sharon_valerii But were killing them. Were truly killing them. My own sisters...
john_cavil They can trust their God to watch over their immortal souls.
lt_sharon_valerii What about ours?
john_cavil Were machines, dear, remember? We dont have souls.
colonel_saul_tigh Now Ive heard everything. Anders and Gaius Frakkin Baltar. Thats just what we need, another Cylon nymphomaniac.
tory_foster Dont worry, Colonel. Youre not my type.
colonel_saul_tigh And one more thing, from now on we only meet in private. After that scene you two pulled in Joes Bar the other night we cant risk any more attention.
chief_galen_tyrol Fine, great. We done, can we go?
colonel_saul_tigh Why are you so antsy?
chief_galen_tyrol I told Cally Id check on her.
colonel_saul_tigh Well, didnt you do that when you got my note?
chief_galen_tyrol I didnt get a note. What note?
colonel_saul_tigh The note I left in the drop in your quarters about this meeting.
chief_galen_tyrol Tory found me. Did you...Oh, frak me. If Cally finds the note then...
colonel_saul_tigh Well, you better hope she doesnt. And you better put an end to this affair business. whatever it takes to stop her from nosing around. Last thing we need is for your Cylon-hating wife to find out theres a bunch of skinjobs running around this ship and that her husband is one of them.
colonel_saul_tigh Im tired of looking at your sorry faces.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson No, no, no, no. Frak! Frak!
chief_galen_tyrol Hey. How you doing?
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Fine.
chief_galen_tyrol You feeling okay?
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Yeah, Im fine.
chief_galen_tyrol You sure?
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Yeah, actually, I am. Thought I was coming down with something, so I slept in.
chief_galen_tyrol Did you go see Cottle?
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson No, Im feeling better.
chief_galen_tyrol Good. Look, I know its been a rough couple of weeks. I know what youre thinking. Its not true.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson It isnt?
chief_galen_tyrol No. Im not having an affair. I figured it out. I know whats important. Youre important. Nickys important. Were important. Us. Thats really what its all about, isnt it? Family, a future. Building that future together. I promise you from now on I will be here for us. The three of us. Maybe the four of us. You know, maybe someday we, well have another baby. What do you think? Another baby? A brother, a sister for little Nick? What do you think, buddy? Hey? Would you like a little brother or sister?
tory_foster Cally.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Stay the frak away from me! I know what you are. I know what all of you are. How could you?
tory_foster We dont even know what we are.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson I heard you. Youre Cylons! A bunch of frakkin skinjobs.
tory_foster I wish it were that simple.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson I told you to stay away from me. Guess you better hope theres a spare body waiting for you.
tory_foster You want to kill me? Go ahead. Dont do this to yourself or to your child. To Nicky.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Get the frak away! Youre not getting your hands on my son! Not you, not Galen! He frakkin used me!
tory_foster He didnt know. None of us did. We didnt find out until we entered that Nebula.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Oh, shut the frak up, traitor! Frak!
tory_foster All we know is that were Cylons. But in every other way, were still the same people.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Youre frakkin machines!
tory_foster I dont know. But I do know that were not evil. Were not inhuman. And were just as scared and confused as you are.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson I cant live like this! Its a frakkin nightmare.
tory_foster You dont want to do this, Cally. Hes your son.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson What have I done? Im so sorry. Oh, Gods.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Its okay. Its okay, Nicky. Its gonna be okay. Its gonna be okay.
tory_foster Lets just get out of here. Its okay. Well work this out together. Its okay.
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Okay.
