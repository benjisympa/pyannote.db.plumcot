Chief Previously, on Battlestar Galactica...
Paulla Youll be safe here, Gaius.
Baltar Please, God, dont let this child die.
Paulla God answered your prayers, you have to see.
Baltar What?
Paulla Look at him.
Baltar No trace of a fever.
Paulla Its a miracle!
Baltar Tory, Tory, Tory. Fancy finding you in the cafeteria.
Baltar You have an abundance of feeling.
Tory I suppose I could be a Cylon.
Baltar Cylons can feel.
Tory You believe that?
Baltar Yeah, I do actually.
Ellen I want to explain.
Anders She sought us out. You know what has to be done here.
Anders Now, it would be better for her sake if it was you.
Tigh Lets say Cally does find out. What do we do then? The last thing we need is for your Cylon-hating wife to find out theres a bunch of skinjobs running around this ship. And that her husband is one of them.
Tory Cally!
Cally Stay the frak away from me! I heard you. Youre Cylons. A bunch of frakking skinjobs.
Chief I couldnt keep you safe from harm, my love, but I kept you in my heart. You were the breath in my lungs, the blood in my veins, the light in my eye, and now that breath is gone. That blood and the light are gone. Now I am left, a voice. And the Lords of Kobol, as many and as varied as mortal men, must bend down and lean low to hear that voice and hear my lament.
Priestess With all our thoughts and love, Callandra Henderson Tyrol, we send your spirit into the universe. So say we all.
All So say we all.
Roslin_leaning_on_Adamas_shoulder I liked that service.
Adama Its not for me, Ill tell you that.
Roslin I know, but I want you to know what I like.
Adama It was lovely.
Chief Thank you.
Tory_to_Laura Why do they have to do these things at dawn?
Roslin Its all right. They do because they have to. Im sorry. Let me know if you need anything.
Chief Thank you.
Tigh Oh. Sorry about your loss.
Tory Sorry, Chief.
Tigh_leaving What the frak was that?
Tory Get us all killed...
Apollo Chief. Im... Im so sorry.
Tigh Whats it up to today?
Woman_Marine Same as. Sleeping, pacing.
Tigh Dont know how it doesnt go nuts.
Woman_Marine Probably turns its brain off. Frakkin toaster.
Tigh Yeah.
Caprica_back_against_the_wall Colonel.
Tigh Your request to see the child Hera Agathon has been denied.
Caprica And you felt the need to come all the way down here in person to tell me that again?
Tigh_sarcastic You think I want to come down here? Were done.
Ellen I think were not. You come every day.
Caprica But you never ask questions anymore.
Ellen Is there something that you want from me? Is there something that you need?
Tigh Stay back...
Caprica_confused_and_offended See you tomorrow, Colonel...
Tigh Door!
Tory What was that at the service this morning?
Tigh Why dont you get on the wireless and tell the Fleet about us?
Chief It just came out.
Tigh You gonna deal with that kid?
Chief Probably needs to be changed.
Tigh_heading_off_to_change_him All right.
Tory You think Cally killed herself because of you, dont you?
Chief She thought we were having an affair.
Tory But we werent.
Chief I dont even know what I am anymore. I dont know which of my memories are real. I dont know that Ive had one action in my life that isnt programmed.
Tory_kneeling Galen, youre perfect. You dont need guilt. We were made to be perfect.
Tigh What is that? More of Baltars crap?
Chief So... You just live without guilt?
Tory Just ... shut it down.
Chief No, that wasnt the deal. Colonel, you said it yourself. Be the man you want to be till the day you die. Were still the same people, arent we?
Tigh Of course we are. You shut up.
Tory That is not the same as human. Like, were stronger. Right?
Tigh Chief, what youre feeling is what a man feels when this happens. Its normal, and its human. And its not gonna end anytime soon. Itll be there every day. Youll see her every day. Youll see her...
Tigh Be a man, Chief. Feel what you gotta feel. But dont risk us. Come on, Tory.
Tory Just think about it. Think about what we are. What we can do.
CREDITS 39,675 survivors.
Baltar Uh! Dear Gods, what...?
Tory Gods? Thought there was only one.
Baltar What are you doing?
Tory Pulling one hair from your head at a time.
Tory Its intense, isnt it?
Baltar Yeah.
Tory It happens at the same time as a pleasurable touch...
Baltar Frak!
Tory ... Signals get crossed, dont they?
Baltar Yeah.
Tory Its hard to tell the pleasure from the pain.
Baltar_struggling_up Yeah. Okay, listen, I think that...
Baltar Youre very strong, arent you? You really...
Baltar I think I preferred it when you cried.
Tory If you assume that God forgives you, then its gone, right? Erased? Forgiveness. You must consecrate the sin. Make it benign.
Baltar Oh, yeah.
Tory Bad becomes good.
Baltar Oh, yes, it does.
Tory Pain becomes pleasure.
Tory And doesnt that mean, if you really become one with God, you can never do wrong?
Baltar Well, no, um, not really because that would, uh... that would more than imply that were all perfect.
Tory Perfect?
Baltar Yeah.
Tory Perfect just as we are.
Baltar No, no, no!
Baltar No!
Cultists Youre all heretics! This is a desecration! Heretics!
Son_of_Ares_holding_two_women_by_their_hair Where is Gaius Baltar?
Cultist He isnt here.
Son_of_Ares You, on your feet. Find him.
Another_Son Where is he?
Cultist I dont know.
Galactica_CIC_over_PA Security alert. Deck 8, section 14.
Son_of_Ares Time! Two minutes! Everybody move, time time time!
Son_of_Ares Were coming back for Gaius Baltar.
Chief_working_on_a_Raptor Frak!
Figurski Finishing up, Chief?
Chief Yeah, just give me one more relay.
Chief_his_head_on_Callys_stomach I think its a boy.
Cally Here you go, Chief.
Chief Nice to be small, huh?
Chief_screaming_and_beating_Cally_in_his_nightmare Die!
Racetrack Chief, we ready to go? I gotta get out of here.
Chief_spaced_out_and_trading_in_the_wrong_capacitor Yeah. Go ahead.
Racetrack Raptor away. Readings nominal.
Redwing Racetrack, Redwing. We been waiting for that school bus of yours all day.
Racetrack School bus, huh? Whats that make those things? Bicycles?
Redwing Haha! Racing cars, sweetheart. Top fuel racers.
Racetrack Its not gonna look very good when they get beat by a school bus.
Redwing Okay, lets ride.
Skulls frak! Gods damn it!
Racetrack Galactica, Racetrack, I have no control in my port rear lower RCS thruster. Skulls, get your ass up here. Galactica, Racetrack, coming about. Clear port landing deck for emergency landing.
Galactica Racetrack, Galactica, emergency landing cleared.
Racetrack One, two, three four... One, two, three... Coming in hot. Too hot!
Baltar Wheres the Admiral? Where is he? And what are you doing? Taking notes, standing here, Mr. Officious? You should be out there, right now, trying to find the people, whoever they are!
Mr_Officious Whatever you say, sir.
Six You can read the old text, cant you, Gaius?
Baltar Sons... arris? Ares. Sons of Ares. Theyre the people who committed this attack. Obviously a fundamentalist splinter group. Although, all theyre doing is trying to protect the old Gods...
Six_indicating_one_older_woman Old gods die hard. Even among your people.
Baltar_kneeling Ive seen you here before. Your name is... dont tell me, um, begins with M.
Lilly Lilly.
Baltar Lilly. Whats in your hand, Lilly? Asclepius. The God of Healing.
Lilly I know youll heal our people. But I thought...
Six The old Gods are fighting back.
Figurski Those capacitors are still hot. Watch yourself, Chief. Take my glove.
Chief_realizing_he_switched_the_capacitors Frak me. My fault, didnt get swapped out.
Skulls Yeah, we could have died. ...Was that in your pocket?
Racetrack We dont have to do this.
Skulls_comforting Youre right, were okay. Its okay.
Chief Is it? Skulls, is it?
Racetrack Galen.
Chief I dont need to be patted on the head. You can tell me I frakked up.
Racetrack Nobody got hurt, okay? Forget it. Youre only human.
Chief No! Dont say that! Tell me I frakked up! Say it! Tell me I frakked up! Any one of you. Cowards!
Figurski Chief, I can handle this. Why dont you take a little down time?
Chief Get out of the Raptor, Figurski.
Six People have room in their hearts for one great belief. You or the old Gods. Which one will it be?
Baltar Why cant I just be a man? Do I really need to take on the Gods single-handed?
Six Oh, but imagine the kind of man youll be when you do. Surely such a man must be magnificent. Larger-than-life, Godlike himself...
Baltar What are you talking about? Its not about that at all. Its about this.
Baltar Stop! Stop. This is unacceptable. We have been targeted because of what we believe by those who answer to faceless Gods that bear no relevance in our world. Six is moved. They want us to be afraid. But Im tired of being afraid. The time has come to make a stand. And that time is now.
Paulla Gaius, what... What are you doing? Where are you going? Gaius?
Baltar_kicking_open_the_hatch We want justice, not these stupid old Gods!
Priestess Sir, were having a service.
Baltar Are you? But whom are you serving?
Priestess I have to ask you to leave.
Baltar_standing_at_the_altar Do you? Would you be serving Zeus? Apparently, King of the Gods, who also happened to be -- let me tell you -- a serial rapist.
Baltar Prone to giving birth out of his own forehead. Thats very likely, isnt it? Well, Gods strike me down. Oh, what are you going to do? Damn you. You ignorant witch, telling the people lies and stories. Maybe you want me to pray to Asclepius, who healed wounds with the blood of Gorgons! Or Aphrodite, or Artemis, or any other of this rubbish!
Baltar How awful! Out of the way, you hideous old witch. Thats the kind of rubbish that you made! I will not be destroyed at this level! God! Havent enough of us died already?
Adama Am I that late?
Roslin No, this wasnt a treatment. It was just a blood test. You brought a new book?
Adama Uh, yes. Something different this time. Its a classic. My favorite.
Roslin Sea Rider Falcon! I havent read it in years. I dont remember how it ends.
Adama I dont either. I never read the ending.
Roslin Youre kidding. Its your favorite.
Adama_smiling_sweetly I like it so much, I dont want it to be over. So Im saving it.
Roslin_brightly Well maybe I should do that.
Roslin ...Thats a bad idea. Maybe not.
Adama_taking_her_bag Let me do that for you.
Roslin Okay, thanks.
Adama Baltars back at home, in the brig again.
Roslin Desecration of a temple. Its his revenge for what happened to him this morning.
Adama It was brutal. I have my personnel trying to track down anything on the Sons of Ares. But nobodys talking.
Roslin The thing is that Baltar knows that there are religious hardliners in Dogsville, but he continues to provoke.
Adama I just cant have a religious war in this Fleet.
Roslin Oh please, no. Then the whole damn thing will become our frakkin responsibility, yours and mine. Seriously, Bill, we have thirty thousand people left and theyre not happy unless theyre kicking each others teeth in. This is what weve become?
Adama No, its him. Baltar has an uncanny way of stirring up all the crap.
Adama I wonder if hed be willing to stay in lockdown indefinitely, for his own safety.
Roslin And make a martyr out of him? No way. Those girly, groupie, sex whatever-they-are, they already think hes a God.
Adama So we kick him off of the Galactica.
Roslin No, I want him close. ...Im going to the brig.
Adama You want to see him?
Roslin_cutely I want him to see me.
Caprica_facing_away_as_Tigh_enters Oh, we didnt even make it to tomorrow, did we?
Tigh You asked what I want. I want to know how it feels to have killed billions of human beings, to have all that blood on your hands. Think it through. Because thats what I want.
Caprica_offended I feel it, do you really think that I couldnt?
Tigh Do you? Or do you turn it off? Is there a switch in your head that you turn off?
Caprica You talk like were different, but you know were not.
Tigh_freaked_out Weapons!
Figurski Working late or up early, Chief?
Caprica You act like you think Im made of switches and relays. Look. Veins, not wires. Were the same.
Ellen_again Do you see were the same?
Tigh Then tell me.
Ellen Tell you what?
Tigh How you live with what youve done.
Ellen_stepping_closer Saul, are you asking for absolution? Forgiveness? I can give you that.
Tigh_confused Stand down. Step outside.
Caprica_now Just tell me what the trouble is.
Tigh_disappointed You have nothing to offer me. Were not the same.
Roslin_entering_loudly ...Were you asleep?
Baltar What is it this time? Here to strip-search me? Or could it possibly be that your presence here means that the President has been made aware of my situation.
Roslin Its being looked into.
Baltar Is it really?
Roslin Aggressively. Now heres the thing.
Roslin I want you to look at me, Gaius. Just look. This is a wig. Im dying. Now, if you look in my eyes ... Go ahead, look. You can probably see it.
Baltar Im very sorry.
Roslin No no no no, I dont want your pity, Im still doing my job. In fact, Im gonna aggressively pursue the men that attacked you, and Im going to limit the size of public assemblies to protect your people, but... Im going to be slipping away from this life very soon, and Ive gotten kind of curious as to what thats going to be like, and so I did some research. And there are some people who say that when people are getting closer to their death, they just dont care as much about rules and laws and conventional morality.
Baltar Are you threatening me?
Roslin No no, Im just saying have a quiet life, and Ill die a quiet little death. And everyone will be happy. Its just that Im not in the mood any longer to indulge you. And thats... All.
Roslin And you are being released, so... Stay safe.
Adama_nodding_to_the_bartender Hey, Chief. We all miss her, Chief. I understand if you need some time off. Or even if you might need more shifts to keep yourself busy. No one knows how theyre going to react to loss like this, or what theyre gonna need.
Chief_without_looking I dont need special treatment.
Adama_in_Chiefs_projection I guess she just couldnt take it, huh? Being married to a Cylon? Being the mother of a half-breed abomination?
Bartender_putting_down_a_drink_for_Adama here you go sir.
Adama Thank you. She was a good woman.
Chief If you really believed that, you wouldnt have threatened to stick her up against a bulkhead and shoot her. Adama surprised by that. Its okay, though. I thought about doing it many times myself. Believe me.
Adama Chief, its...
Chief How many of us ended up with the people we really wanted to be with? Got stuck with the best of limited options? And why? Because the ones we really wanted, really loved, were dead and dying, or turned out to be Cylons and they didnt know it. If Boomer had... If I had known...
Adama Listen. Listen, lets...
Chief No.
Adama Lets go. Come on.
Chief No, no. I didnt know.
Adama Lets go.
Chief_beginning_to_shout I didnt know. So I buried my head in the sand and I took it and I settled! I settled for that shriek, those dull vacant eyes, the boiled cabbage stench of her. And why? Because this is my life! This is the life I picked! And its fine, but you know what? Its not! I didnt pick this life! This is not my frakkin life!
Adama What the hells gotten into you? Dont do this. Dont do this to her memory.
Chief Know what? Im sorry if Im not gonna do this the way you want me to, or the way you might. But I will not make an angel out of someone who wasnt an angel. But I can see you have. Adama breaking down. And now youve come down here to be in my club, but youre not in my club. You dont know what frakkin club Im in cause you never asked the right questions.
Adama Chief, lets get out of here.
Chief No. Why dont you go? Take care of your precious ship.
Adama Stop it. Stop all of this. Cause if you dont, Im going to have to act on it. Now shut up.
Chief_even_louder Great! Do it! Please! For the love of Gods, please demote me. Get me off your frakkin ship!
Adama_shaking Specialist Tyrol, I want you off my hangar deck before you endanger another Pilot. Youre to report to Petty Officer Bassom tomorrow morning at 0600 for reassignment. Do you understand?
Apollo Of course you have authority over emergency measures, but you bulldozed this through after the session was closed.
Quorum_Members_muttering_in_agreement Yes, exactly.
Roslin Its a crowd control measure. I also authorized the repair of a cargo elevator. Do you want to talk about that too?
Apollo Crowd control? Looks to me like it was pretty well designed purely to stop Gaius Baltars organization.
Roslin_earning_a_look_from_Tory You mean his cult?
Apollo Well his cult was attacked. And from what Im hearing around the fleet, it was pretty brutal.
Roslin It was brutal. Exactly. And this measure is designed explicitly to protect those people. If they arent gathering en masse, they arent provoking resentment.
Apollo It limits his group, while permitting more mainstream worship.
Roslin_with_Tory_still_staring_at_her Wherever Gaius Baltar is, violence happens. And if he doesnt cause it, he draws it. My job, Mr. Adama, is and always will be, to keep the people safe.
Delegate_Reza Madame President, I have to wonder if this resolution couldnt be used against other offshoot religious groups.
Roslin Absolutely not. Gaius Baltar is a special case, you know that.
Apollo And were making him a special case.
Roslin And how are we doing that?
Apollo Were fueling his argument. I mean, after all, is he preaching violence? Immoral acts?
Roslin I dont know. I havent been to one of his, uh, what are they called? Services?
Reza Its not that far from what some of our own Mithras followers believe.
Geminon_Delegate We have Mithrassaries among the Geminese. Can this order be applied to them?
Roslin_enraged Clear your heads. We are talking about Gaius Baltar. Everyone in this room experienced tragedy at New Caprica. Have we forgotten?
Reza Will you open this order to a full Quorum vote?
Roslin -- No!
Apollo We can override, Madam President. I cannot let this stand.
Roslin_standing You can override, and you cannot let this stand, Mr. Adama? Then you open it up to a vote. And if you strike this down, you can all go back to your constituents and you can tell them what youve done, and we, the people, will have triumphed. But think about what its gonna cost you. Because every single one of you remember what it was like when Gaius Baltar had political power. And you should be terrified to think about what this man will do with blind religious devotion. So go ahead. Vote.
Caprica_waking Should I get used to waking up to this face? Youre traveling light.
Tigh An informal chat. Just you and me.
Caprica_from_outside And the man watching through the cameras.
Tigh You havent answered my question.
Caprica You want to know how I work? If I can turn off pain?
Tigh Can you?
Caprica_shaking_her_head I want the pain, its how I learn. I was instrumental in the destruction of humanity, but at the same time, I learned because... Because I fell in love. With a human man.
Ellen_lovingly And he was mortal, and ... fallible. And he had this incredible pride in himself. He thought he knew everything there was to know. And I loved him with my whole heart. And then one day, I realized I wouldnt have him forever. I understood what Id done. How I betrayed him, and humanity. And that pain taught me to understand death. Baltar could die. And I loved him...
Tigh_disappointed No.
Ellen_with_Capricas_voice Baltars heart was ephemeral.
Tigh No.
Caprica Baltars body was fragile in my hands.
Tigh No, we are not gonna talk about the fragile body of Gaius frakkin Baltar! Door! Door!
Tigh Dismissed. Clear out, out!
Marine Frak, whats he gonna do to her?
Caprica_desperately I can tell you how to turn it off.
Tigh How?
Caprica Pain is how I learn from the guilt. Theres wisdom there. Clarity. You know yourself there.
Tigh_sitting_near_her Pain?
Caprica Our minds were designed based on your minds. We learned things about how you work that youve never known. When youre in pain, thats ...
Ellen_caressing_his_face ... When you learn who you really are. Thats when you focus, sharp as the point of a knife. I can give you that clarity again.
Guard Im sorry, sir, Im not supposed to let you enter.
Baltar Whats going on? What are you doing?
Guard There are twelve people inside already.
Baltar You can count, can you?
Guard Yes, sir, you cant enter without breaking emergency provision 170...
Cultist -- People, let me out. If I leave, then he can come in.
Baltar -- Yes, if she leaves, then I can come in.
Guard Were asking everyone to stay inside for safety reasons.
Baltar Oh, this is absurd. Youre just counting heads.
Guard I have my orders.
Baltar Yeah, but I live here, okay? I live here, and so do some of these women. Where are we supposed to go?
Six This is your moment, Gaius. Step forward. Make a stand.
Baltar Uh, I dont want to be a hero. I just want to go to bed. Go to sleep.
Six Look at me. I promise you. Step forward, and you will not be hurt.
Baltar Promise me?
Six Yes, you can lie down inside. Go in.
Guard Stop, sir.
Paulla Gaius!
Tigh Get your frakkin hands off me, you frakkin freak machine!
Caprica Can you feel it, Saul? Can you feel the clarity of it?
Guard Stay down or clear this area, sir!
Six You have to do this. The gain will outweigh the cost.
Gaius I want to stay down. I really want to stay down.
Six No, you dont.
Guard Stay down. Please, sir!
Apollo_rushing_in Wait, wait, stop! Lieutenant!
Marine_to_the_young_guard Stand down.
Apollo The Quorum has just met in an emergency session. Full right of assembly has been restored. You can, uh, you can go back into your home. No one will stop you.
Paulla Oh, Gaius....
Baltar_to_Lee Thank you.
Apollo I dont do these things for you.
Baltar You do them because your God compels you.
Cultist Okay, okay.
Roslin ...Lee has no idea. He really has no idea.
Adama Have you heard anything I said?
Roslin There are pragmatic realities he refuses to face.
Adama Well, thats a problem, of course. Hes doing what he thinks is right.
Roslin Well yeah, hes Lee. Thing is it probably is the right thing, but... Sometimes the right thing is a luxury. And it can have profoundly dangerous consequences. And yet its almost as if he doesnt want that to be true... Okay, I gotta stop this, Im not supposed to get upset during treatment. Will you read the next chapter?
Adama I must warn you that Im getting into the part that I havent read yet.
Roslin_sexy Oh dear. Are you going to be able to continue?
Adama Chapter Seven: The raft was not as seaworthy as I had hoped. The waves repeatedly threatened to swamp it. I wasnt afraid to die. He pauses, sadly. I was afraid of the emptiness that I felt inside.
Adama I couldnt feel anything, and thats what scared me. It came into my thoughts. It filled them. It felt good.
Tigh_bleeding More.
Caprica_weeping_for_him No.
Tigh Keep going.
Caprica No, I made a mistake. This isnt what you need.
Baltar_addressing_his_followers Im not a priest. Ive never even been a particularly good man. I have, in fact, been a profoundly selfish man. But that doesnt matter, you see. Something in the universe loves me. Something in the universe loves the entity that is me. I will choose to call this something God. A singular spark that dwells in the soul of every living being. If you look inside yourself, you will find this spark too. You will. But you have to look. Deep.
Baltar Love your faults. Embrace them. If God embraces them, then how can they be faults?
Baltar Love yourself. You have to love yourself. If we dont love ourselves, how can we love others?
Baltar And when we know what we are, then we can find the truth out about others. See what they are. The truth about them.
Baltar And you know what the truth is, the truth about them...
Baltar ...About you. About me. Do you? The truth is we are all perfect, just as we are. God only loves that which is perfect, and he loves you.
Baltar He loves you because you are perfect. You are perfect just as you are. We are all perfect just as we are.
