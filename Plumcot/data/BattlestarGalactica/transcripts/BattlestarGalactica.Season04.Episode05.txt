chief_galen_tyrol Previously, on Battlestar Galactica...
paulla_schaffer Youll be safe here, Gaius.
dr_gaius_baltar Please, God, dont let this child die.
paulla_schaffer God answered your prayers, you have to see.
dr_gaius_baltar What?
paulla_schaffer Look at him.
dr_gaius_baltar No trace of a fever.
paulla_schaffer Its a miracle!
dr_gaius_baltar Tory, Tory, Tory. Fancy finding you in the cafeteria.
dr_gaius_baltar You have an abundance of feeling.
tory_foster I suppose I could be a Cylon.
dr_gaius_baltar Cylons can feel.
tory_foster You believe that?
dr_gaius_baltar Yeah, I do actually.
Ellen#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 I want to explain.
samuel_anders She sought us out. You know what has to be done here.
samuel_anders Now, it would be better for her sake if it was you.
colonel_saul_tigh Lets say Cally does find out. What do we do then? The last thing we need is for your Cylon-hating wife to find out theres a bunch of skinjobs running around this ship. And that her husband is one of them.
tory_foster Cally!
Cally#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 Stay the frak away from me! I heard you. Youre Cylons. A bunch of frakking skinjobs.
chief_galen_tyrol I couldnt keep you safe from harm, my love, but I kept you in my heart. You were the breath in my lungs, the blood in my veins, the light in my eye, and now that breath is gone. That blood and the light are gone. Now I am left, a voice. And the Lords of Kobol, as many and as varied as mortal men, must bend down and lean low to hear that voice and hear my lament.
Priestess#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 With all our thoughts and love, Callandra Henderson Tyrol, we send your spirit into the universe. So say we all.
All#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 So say we all.
president_laura_roslin I liked that service.
admiral_william_adama Its not for me, Ill tell you that.
president_laura_roslin I know, but I want you to know what I like.
admiral_william_adama It was lovely.
chief_galen_tyrol Thank you.
tory_foster Why do they have to do these things at dawn?
president_laura_roslin Its all right. They do because they have to. Im sorry. Let me know if you need anything.
chief_galen_tyrol Thank you.
colonel_saul_tigh Oh. Sorry about your loss.
tory_foster Sorry, Chief.
colonel_saul_tigh What the frak was that?
tory_foster Get us all killed...
cpt_lee_adama Chief. Im... Im so sorry.
colonel_saul_tigh Whats it up to today?
Woman_Marine#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 Same as. Sleeping, pacing.
colonel_saul_tigh Dont know how it doesnt go nuts.
Woman_Marine#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 Probably turns its brain off. Frakkin toaster.
colonel_saul_tigh Yeah.
number_six Colonel.
colonel_saul_tigh Your request to see the child Hera Agathon has been denied.
number_six And you felt the need to come all the way down here in person to tell me that again?
colonel_saul_tigh You think I want to come down here? Were done.
Ellen#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 I think were not. You come every day.
number_six But you never ask questions anymore.
Ellen#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 Is there something that you want from me? Is there something that you need?
colonel_saul_tigh Stay back...
number_six See you tomorrow, Colonel...
colonel_saul_tigh Door!
tory_foster What was that at the service this morning?
colonel_saul_tigh Why dont you get on the wireless and tell the Fleet about us?
chief_galen_tyrol It just came out.
colonel_saul_tigh You gonna deal with that kid?
chief_galen_tyrol Probably needs to be changed.
colonel_saul_tigh All right.
tory_foster You think Cally killed herself because of you, dont you?
chief_galen_tyrol She thought we were having an affair.
tory_foster But we werent.
chief_galen_tyrol I dont even know what I am anymore. I dont know which of my memories are real. I dont know that Ive had one action in my life that isnt programmed.
tory_foster Galen, youre perfect. You dont need guilt. We were made to be perfect.
colonel_saul_tigh What is that? More of Baltars crap?
chief_galen_tyrol So... You just live without guilt?
tory_foster Just ... shut it down.
chief_galen_tyrol No, that wasnt the deal. Colonel, you said it yourself. Be the man you want to be till the day you die. Were still the same people, arent we?
colonel_saul_tigh Of course we are. You shut up.
tory_foster That is not the same as human. Like, were stronger. Right?
colonel_saul_tigh Chief, what youre feeling is what a man feels when this happens. Its normal, and its human. And its not gonna end anytime soon. Itll be there every day. Youll see her every day. Youll see her...
colonel_saul_tigh Be a man, Chief. Feel what you gotta feel. But dont risk us. Come on, Tory.
tory_foster Just think about it. Think about what we are. What we can do.
CREDITS#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 39,675 survivors.
dr_gaius_baltar Uh! Dear Gods, what...?
tory_foster Gods? Thought there was only one.
dr_gaius_baltar What are you doing?
tory_foster Pulling one hair from your head at a time.
tory_foster Its intense, isnt it?
dr_gaius_baltar Yeah.
tory_foster It happens at the same time as a pleasurable touch...
dr_gaius_baltar Frak!
tory_foster ... Signals get crossed, dont they?
dr_gaius_baltar Yeah.
tory_foster Its hard to tell the pleasure from the pain.
dr_gaius_baltar Yeah. Okay, listen, I think that...
dr_gaius_baltar Youre very strong, arent you? You really...
dr_gaius_baltar I think I preferred it when you cried.
tory_foster If you assume that God forgives you, then its gone, right? Erased? Forgiveness. You must consecrate the sin. Make it benign.
dr_gaius_baltar Oh, yeah.
tory_foster Bad becomes good.
dr_gaius_baltar Oh, yes, it does.
tory_foster Pain becomes pleasure.
tory_foster And doesnt that mean, if you really become one with God, you can never do wrong?
dr_gaius_baltar Well, no, um, not really because that would, uh... that would more than imply that were all perfect.
tory_foster Perfect?
dr_gaius_baltar Yeah.
tory_foster Perfect just as we are.
dr_gaius_baltar No, no, no!
dr_gaius_baltar No!
Cultists#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 Youre all heretics! This is a desecration! Heretics!
Son_of_Ares_holding_two_women_by_their_hair#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 Where is Gaius Baltar?
Cultist#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 He isnt here.
Son_of_Ares#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 You, on your feet. Find him.
Another_Son#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 Where is he?
Cultist#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 I dont know.

Son_of_Ares#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 Were coming back for Gaius Baltar.
chief_galen_tyrol Frak!
Figurski#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 Finishing up, Chief?
chief_galen_tyrol Yeah, just give me one more relay.
chief_galen_tyrol I think its a boy.
Cally#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 Here you go, Chief.
chief_galen_tyrol Nice to be small, huh?
chief_galen_tyrol Die!
Racetrack#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 Chief, we ready to go? I gotta get out of here.
chief_galen_tyrol Yeah. Go ahead.
Racetrack#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 Raptor away. Readings nominal.
Redwing#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 Racetrack, Redwing. We been waiting for that school bus of yours all day.
Racetrack#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 School bus, huh? Whats that make those things? Bicycles?
Redwing#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 Haha! Racing cars, sweetheart. Top fuel racers.
Racetrack#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 Its not gonna look very good when they get beat by a school bus.
Redwing#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 Okay, lets ride.
Skulls#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 frak! Gods damn it!
Racetrack#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 Galactica, Racetrack, I have no control in my port rear lower RCS thruster. Skulls, get your ass up here. Galactica, Racetrack, coming about. Clear port landing deck for emergency landing.
Galactica#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 Racetrack, Galactica, emergency landing cleared.
Racetrack#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 One, two, three four... One, two, three... Coming in hot. Too hot!
dr_gaius_baltar Wheres the Admiral? Where is he? And what are you doing? Taking notes, standing here, Mr. Officious? You should be out there, right now, trying to find the people, whoever they are!
Mr_Officious#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 Whatever you say, sir.
number_six You can read the old text, cant you, Gaius?
dr_gaius_baltar Sons... arris? Ares. Sons of Ares. Theyre the people who committed this attack. Obviously a fundamentalist splinter group. Although, all theyre doing is trying to protect the old Gods...
number_six Old gods die hard. Even among your people.
dr_gaius_baltar Ive seen you here before. Your name is... dont tell me, um, begins with M.
Lilly#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 Lilly.
dr_gaius_baltar Lilly. Whats in your hand, Lilly? Asclepius. The God of Healing.
Lilly#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 I know youll heal our people. But I thought...
number_six The old Gods are fighting back.
Figurski#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 Those capacitors are still hot. Watch yourself, Chief. Take my glove.
chief_galen_tyrol Frak me. My fault, didnt get swapped out.
Skulls#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 Yeah, we could have died. ...Was that in your pocket?
Racetrack#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 We dont have to do this.
Skulls_comforting#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 Youre right, were okay. Its okay.
chief_galen_tyrol Is it? Skulls, is it?
Racetrack#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 Galen.
chief_galen_tyrol I dont need to be patted on the head. You can tell me I frakked up.
Racetrack#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 Nobody got hurt, okay? Forget it. Youre only human.
chief_galen_tyrol No! Dont say that! Tell me I frakked up! Say it! Tell me I frakked up! Any one of you. Cowards!
Figurski#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 Chief, I can handle this. Why dont you take a little down time?
chief_galen_tyrol Get out of the Raptor, Figurski.
number_six People have room in their hearts for one great belief. You or the old Gods. Which one will it be?
dr_gaius_baltar Why cant I just be a man? Do I really need to take on the Gods single-handed?
number_six Oh, but imagine the kind of man youll be when you do. Surely such a man must be magnificent. Larger-than-life, Godlike himself...
dr_gaius_baltar What are you talking about? Its not about that at all. Its about this.
dr_gaius_baltar Stop! Stop. This is unacceptable. We have been targeted because of what we believe by those who answer to faceless Gods that bear no relevance in our world. Six is moved. They want us to be afraid. But Im tired of being afraid. The time has come to make a stand. And that time is now.
paulla_schaffer Gaius, what... What are you doing? Where are you going? Gaius?
dr_gaius_baltar We want justice, not these stupid old Gods!
Priestess#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 Sir, were having a service.
dr_gaius_baltar Are you? But whom are you serving?
Priestess#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 I have to ask you to leave.
dr_gaius_baltar Do you? Would you be serving Zeus? Apparently, King of the Gods, who also happened to be -- let me tell you -- a serial rapist.
dr_gaius_baltar Prone to giving birth out of his own forehead. Thats very likely, isnt it? Well, Gods strike me down. Oh, what are you going to do? Damn you. You ignorant witch, telling the people lies and stories. Maybe you want me to pray to Asclepius, who healed wounds with the blood of Gorgons! Or Aphrodite, or Artemis, or any other of this rubbish!
dr_gaius_baltar How awful! Out of the way, you hideous old witch. Thats the kind of rubbish that you made! I will not be destroyed at this level! God! Havent enough of us died already?
admiral_william_adama Am I that late?
president_laura_roslin No, this wasnt a treatment. It was just a blood test. You brought a new book?
admiral_william_adama Uh, yes. Something different this time. Its a classic. My favorite.
president_laura_roslin Sea Rider Falcon! I havent read it in years. I dont remember how it ends.
admiral_william_adama I dont either. I never read the ending.
president_laura_roslin Youre kidding. Its your favorite.
admiral_william_adama I like it so much, I dont want it to be over. So Im saving it.
president_laura_roslin Well maybe I should do that.
president_laura_roslin ...Thats a bad idea. Maybe not.
admiral_william_adama Let me do that for you.
president_laura_roslin Okay, thanks.
admiral_william_adama Baltars back at home, in the brig again.
president_laura_roslin Desecration of a temple. Its his revenge for what happened to him this morning.
admiral_william_adama It was brutal. I have my personnel trying to track down anything on the Sons of Ares. But nobodys talking.
president_laura_roslin The thing is that Baltar knows that there are religious hardliners in Dogsville, but he continues to provoke.
admiral_william_adama I just cant have a religious war in this Fleet.
president_laura_roslin Oh please, no. Then the whole damn thing will become our frakkin responsibility, yours and mine. Seriously, Bill, we have thirty thousand people left and theyre not happy unless theyre kicking each others teeth in. This is what weve become?
admiral_william_adama No, its him. Baltar has an uncanny way of stirring up all the crap.
admiral_william_adama I wonder if hed be willing to stay in lockdown indefinitely, for his own safety.
president_laura_roslin And make a martyr out of him? No way. Those girly, groupie, sex whatever-they-are, they already think hes a God.
admiral_william_adama So we kick him off of the Galactica.
president_laura_roslin No, I want him close. ...Im going to the brig.
admiral_william_adama You want to see him?
president_laura_roslin I want him to see me.
number_six Oh, we didnt even make it to tomorrow, did we?
colonel_saul_tigh You asked what I want. I want to know how it feels to have killed billions of human beings, to have all that blood on your hands. Think it through. Because thats what I want.
number_six I feel it, do you really think that I couldnt?
colonel_saul_tigh Do you? Or do you turn it off? Is there a switch in your head that you turn off?
number_six You talk like were different, but you know were not.
colonel_saul_tigh Weapons!
Figurski#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 Working late or up early, Chief?
number_six You act like you think Im made of switches and relays. Look. Veins, not wires. Were the same.
Ellen_again#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 Do you see were the same?
colonel_saul_tigh Then tell me.
Ellen#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 Tell you what?
colonel_saul_tigh How you live with what youve done.
Ellen_stepping_closer#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 Saul, are you asking for absolution? Forgiveness? I can give you that.
colonel_saul_tigh Stand down. Step outside.
number_six Just tell me what the trouble is.
colonel_saul_tigh You have nothing to offer me. Were not the same.
president_laura_roslin ...Were you asleep?
dr_gaius_baltar What is it this time? Here to strip-search me? Or could it possibly be that your presence here means that the President has been made aware of my situation.
president_laura_roslin Its being looked into.
dr_gaius_baltar Is it really?
president_laura_roslin Aggressively. Now heres the thing.
president_laura_roslin I want you to look at me, Gaius. Just look. This is a wig. Im dying. Now, if you look in my eyes ... Go ahead, look. You can probably see it.
dr_gaius_baltar Im very sorry.
president_laura_roslin No no no no, I dont want your pity, Im still doing my job. In fact, Im gonna aggressively pursue the men that attacked you, and Im going to limit the size of public assemblies to protect your people, but... Im going to be slipping away from this life very soon, and Ive gotten kind of curious as to what thats going to be like, and so I did some research. And there are some people who say that when people are getting closer to their death, they just dont care as much about rules and laws and conventional morality.
dr_gaius_baltar Are you threatening me?
president_laura_roslin No no, Im just saying have a quiet life, and Ill die a quiet little death. And everyone will be happy. Its just that Im not in the mood any longer to indulge you. And thats... All.
president_laura_roslin And you are being released, so... Stay safe.
admiral_william_adama Hey, Chief. We all miss her, Chief. I understand if you need some time off. Or even if you might need more shifts to keep yourself busy. No one knows how theyre going to react to loss like this, or what theyre gonna need.
chief_galen_tyrol I dont need special treatment.
admiral_william_adama I guess she just couldnt take it, huh? Being married to a Cylon? Being the mother of a half-breed abomination?
Bartender_putting_down_a_drink_for_Adama#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 here you go sir.
admiral_william_adama Thank you. She was a good woman.
chief_galen_tyrol If you really believed that, you wouldnt have threatened to stick her up against a bulkhead and shoot her. Adama surprised by that. Its okay, though. I thought about doing it many times myself. Believe me.
admiral_william_adama Chief, its...
chief_galen_tyrol How many of us ended up with the people we really wanted to be with? Got stuck with the best of limited options? And why? Because the ones we really wanted, really loved, were dead and dying, or turned out to be Cylons and they didnt know it. If Boomer had... If I had known...
admiral_william_adama Listen. Listen, lets...
chief_galen_tyrol No.
admiral_william_adama Lets go. Come on.
chief_galen_tyrol No, no. I didnt know.
admiral_william_adama Lets go.
chief_galen_tyrol I didnt know. So I buried my head in the sand and I took it and I settled! I settled for that shriek, those dull vacant eyes, the boiled cabbage stench of her. And why? Because this is my life! This is the life I picked! And its fine, but you know what? Its not! I didnt pick this life! This is not my frakkin life!
admiral_william_adama What the hells gotten into you? Dont do this. Dont do this to her memory.
chief_galen_tyrol Know what? Im sorry if Im not gonna do this the way you want me to, or the way you might. But I will not make an angel out of someone who wasnt an angel. But I can see you have. Adama breaking down. And now youve come down here to be in my club, but youre not in my club. You dont know what frakkin club Im in cause you never asked the right questions.
admiral_william_adama Chief, lets get out of here.
chief_galen_tyrol No. Why dont you go? Take care of your precious ship.
admiral_william_adama Stop it. Stop all of this. Cause if you dont, Im going to have to act on it. Now shut up.
chief_galen_tyrol Great! Do it! Please! For the love of Gods, please demote me. Get me off your frakkin ship!
admiral_william_adama Specialist Tyrol, I want you off my hangar deck before you endanger another Pilot. Youre to report to Petty Officer Bassom tomorrow morning at 0600 for reassignment. Do you understand?
cpt_lee_adama Of course you have authority over emergency measures, but you bulldozed this through after the session was closed.
Quorum_Members_muttering_in_agreement#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 Yes, exactly.
president_laura_roslin Its a crowd control measure. I also authorized the repair of a cargo elevator. Do you want to talk about that too?
cpt_lee_adama Crowd control? Looks to me like it was pretty well designed purely to stop Gaius Baltars organization.
president_laura_roslin You mean his cult?
cpt_lee_adama Well his cult was attacked. And from what Im hearing around the fleet, it was pretty brutal.
president_laura_roslin It was brutal. Exactly. And this measure is designed explicitly to protect those people. If they arent gathering en masse, they arent provoking resentment.
cpt_lee_adama It limits his group, while permitting more mainstream worship.
president_laura_roslin Wherever Gaius Baltar is, violence happens. And if he doesnt cause it, he draws it. My job, Mr. Adama, is and always will be, to keep the people safe.
Delegate_Reza#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 Madame President, I have to wonder if this resolution couldnt be used against other offshoot religious groups.
president_laura_roslin Absolutely not. Gaius Baltar is a special case, you know that.
cpt_lee_adama And were making him a special case.
president_laura_roslin And how are we doing that?
cpt_lee_adama Were fueling his argument. I mean, after all, is he preaching violence? Immoral acts?
president_laura_roslin I dont know. I havent been to one of his, uh, what are they called? Services?
Reza#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 Its not that far from what some of our own Mithras followers believe.
Geminon_Delegate#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 We have Mithrassaries among the Geminese. Can this order be applied to them?
president_laura_roslin Clear your heads. We are talking about Gaius Baltar. Everyone in this room experienced tragedy at New Caprica. Have we forgotten?
Reza#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 Will you open this order to a full Quorum vote?
president_laura_roslin -- No!
cpt_lee_adama We can override, Madam President. I cannot let this stand.
president_laura_roslin You can override, and you cannot let this stand, Mr. Adama? Then you open it up to a vote. And if you strike this down, you can all go back to your constituents and you can tell them what youve done, and we, the people, will have triumphed. But think about what its gonna cost you. Because every single one of you remember what it was like when Gaius Baltar had political power. And you should be terrified to think about what this man will do with blind religious devotion. So go ahead. Vote.
number_six Should I get used to waking up to this face? Youre traveling light.
colonel_saul_tigh An informal chat. Just you and me.
number_six And the man watching through the cameras.
colonel_saul_tigh You havent answered my question.
number_six You want to know how I work? If I can turn off pain?
colonel_saul_tigh Can you?
number_six I want the pain, its how I learn. I was instrumental in the destruction of humanity, but at the same time, I learned because... Because I fell in love. With a human man.
Ellen_lovingly#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 And he was mortal, and ... fallible. And he had this incredible pride in himself. He thought he knew everything there was to know. And I loved him with my whole heart. And then one day, I realized I wouldnt have him forever. I understood what Id done. How I betrayed him, and humanity. And that pain taught me to understand death. Baltar could die. And I loved him...
colonel_saul_tigh No.
Ellen_with_Capricas_voice#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 Baltars heart was ephemeral.
colonel_saul_tigh No.
number_six Baltars body was fragile in my hands.
colonel_saul_tigh No, we are not gonna talk about the fragile body of Gaius frakkin Baltar! Door! Door!
colonel_saul_tigh Dismissed. Clear out, out!
Marine#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 Frak, whats he gonna do to her?
number_six I can tell you how to turn it off.
colonel_saul_tigh How?
number_six Pain is how I learn from the guilt. Theres wisdom there. Clarity. You know yourself there.
colonel_saul_tigh Pain?
number_six Our minds were designed based on your minds. We learned things about how you work that youve never known. When youre in pain, thats ...
Ellen_caressing_his_face#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 ... When you learn who you really are. Thats when you focus, sharp as the point of a knife. I can give you that clarity again.
Guard#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 Im sorry, sir, Im not supposed to let you enter.
dr_gaius_baltar Whats going on? What are you doing?
Guard#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 There are twelve people inside already.
dr_gaius_baltar You can count, can you?
Guard#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 Yes, sir, you cant enter without breaking emergency provision 170...
Cultist#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 -- People, let me out. If I leave, then he can come in.
dr_gaius_baltar -- Yes, if she leaves, then I can come in.
Guard#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 Were asking everyone to stay inside for safety reasons.
dr_gaius_baltar Oh, this is absurd. Youre just counting heads.
Guard#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 I have my orders.
dr_gaius_baltar Yeah, but I live here, okay? I live here, and so do some of these women. Where are we supposed to go?
number_six This is your moment, Gaius. Step forward. Make a stand.
dr_gaius_baltar Uh, I dont want to be a hero. I just want to go to bed. Go to sleep.
number_six Look at me. I promise you. Step forward, and you will not be hurt.
dr_gaius_baltar Promise me?
number_six Yes, you can lie down inside. Go in.
Guard#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 Stop, sir.
paulla_schaffer Gaius!
colonel_saul_tigh Get your frakkin hands off me, you frakkin freak machine!
number_six Can you feel it, Saul? Can you feel the clarity of it?
Guard#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 Stay down or clear this area, sir!
number_six You have to do this. The gain will outweigh the cost.
dr_gaius_baltar I want to stay down. I really want to stay down.
number_six No, you dont.
Guard#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 Stay down. Please, sir!
cpt_lee_adama Wait, wait, stop! Lieutenant!
Marine_to_the_young_guard#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 Stand down.
cpt_lee_adama The Quorum has just met in an emergency session. Full right of assembly has been restored. You can, uh, you can go back into your home. No one will stop you.
paulla_schaffer Oh, Gaius....
dr_gaius_baltar Thank you.
cpt_lee_adama I dont do these things for you.
dr_gaius_baltar You do them because your God compels you.
Cultist#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode05 Okay, okay.
president_laura_roslin ...Lee has no idea. He really has no idea.
admiral_william_adama Have you heard anything I said?
president_laura_roslin There are pragmatic realities he refuses to face.
admiral_william_adama Well, thats a problem, of course. Hes doing what he thinks is right.
president_laura_roslin Well yeah, hes Lee. Thing is it probably is the right thing, but... Sometimes the right thing is a luxury. And it can have profoundly dangerous consequences. And yet its almost as if he doesnt want that to be true... Okay, I gotta stop this, Im not supposed to get upset during treatment. Will you read the next chapter?
admiral_william_adama I must warn you that Im getting into the part that I havent read yet.
president_laura_roslin Oh dear. Are you going to be able to continue?
admiral_william_adama Chapter Seven: The raft was not as seaworthy as I had hoped. The waves repeatedly threatened to swamp it. I wasnt afraid to die. He pauses, sadly. I was afraid of the emptiness that I felt inside.
admiral_william_adama I couldnt feel anything, and thats what scared me. It came into my thoughts. It filled them. It felt good.
colonel_saul_tigh More.
number_six No.
colonel_saul_tigh Keep going.
number_six No, I made a mistake. This isnt what you need.
dr_gaius_baltar Im not a priest. Ive never even been a particularly good man. I have, in fact, been a profoundly selfish man. But that doesnt matter, you see. Something in the universe loves me. Something in the universe loves the entity that is me. I will choose to call this something God. A singular spark that dwells in the soul of every living being. If you look inside yourself, you will find this spark too. You will. But you have to look. Deep.
dr_gaius_baltar Love your faults. Embrace them. If God embraces them, then how can they be faults?
dr_gaius_baltar Love yourself. You have to love yourself. If we dont love ourselves, how can we love others?
dr_gaius_baltar And when we know what we are, then we can find the truth out about others. See what they are. The truth about them.
dr_gaius_baltar And you know what the truth is, the truth about them...
dr_gaius_baltar ...About you. About me. Do you? The truth is we are all perfect, just as we are. God only loves that which is perfect, and he loves you.
dr_gaius_baltar He loves you because you are perfect. You are perfect just as you are. We are all perfect just as we are.
