Roslin Previously, on Battlestar Galactica.
Captain_Franks Madam President, are you taking chamalla again?
Roslin I am taking chamalla again. ...Because my cancer has returned.
Starbuck_over_her_paintings_and_visions I remember a flashing triple star, a giant gas planet with rings, and a comet.
Athena Whats the latest, Felix?
Felix Shes reversing course. Returning to sector seven.
Athena Ugh, that is the tenth course correction.
Seelix Frak me!
Natalie Theyre going to attack. Alert the others. We need to jump now.
Cavil Just remember, they started it.
Boomer But were killing them, I mean were truly killing them.
Hotdog Dradis contact. Ive got visual. Cylon Heavy Raider.
Leoben_on_wireless Kara, Im alone. This is not an attack. I knew Id find you.
Starbuck ...Leoben?
Leoben Im here for you. To offer a truce between human and Cylon and a chance for you to complete your journey.
Leoben The Hybrid. You need to go to her, Kara. Shell tell you the way to get to Earth.
Helo Were done here. Get him out of here.
Pike This Baseship was never part of the mission. If we dont leave right now, we are all going to die.
Gaeta Were ready to jump back to the Fleet on your order.
Starbuck Were not going back to the Fleet.
Pike What the hell are you talking about?
Starbuck We came out here to complete a mission, and that Baseship has something to do with it. I know it.
Helo Captain Thrace, as XO of the Demetrius, Im hereby relieving you of command.
Starbuck_facing_off_against_Helo You son of a bitch. Ill do it myself.
Helo Hey!
Anders_stepping_forward What the hell are you doing, Karl?
Helo Stand down!
Helo Order the Marine guards to the control room. Tell them Im placing Captain Thrace under arrest.
Starbuck Youre wrong, Helo. Youre so Godsdamn wrong.
Helo Either way, were taking Leoben and his proposal back to the Fleet. Well let the Admiral sort it out.
Starbuck You are throwing away our last chance to find Earth.
Anders And youll be going back to Galactica as mutineers. How do you think the Admirals gonna sort through that?
Helo Thats up to him. Mr. Gaeta, reset the FTL for the first jump back to the Fleet.
Gaeta Right away, sir.
Seelix We should just airlock your Cylon ass.
Starbuck_struggling I am not a Cylon.
Anders_pulling_a_gun Gaeta, stop! Gaeta, abort the jump! I said, abort the jump!
Gaeta_screaming Oh, frak.
Anders_waving_gun_around You want to know whos in charge? You want to know whos in command? You frakkin want to know?
Starbuck Sam!
Anders Its Captain Thrace, Gods damn it! Now you let her go!
Helo Sergeant, stand down. Stand down, Sergeant! Stand down, Sergeant! Seelix, stand down. Sam! Stand down, stand down! Medic!
Gaeta Ahhh! What the frak?
Starbuck I need a med kit!
Gaeta Frak! What the frak?
Starbuck_setting_his_bone All right, bloodstopper. This is gonna hurt. Ready, go.
Gaeta Get off me, you frakkin bitch...Ahhhh!
Starbuck Morpha.
Starbuck We need to move him to a bunk.
Helo Marines, get over here!
Starbuck Careful!
Anders Wait, listen. Kara, that was...
Helo So now what? Gonna give orders at gunpoint?
Starbuck Youre right, Helo. I never shouldve ordered Demetrius to jump to the Baseship. Too many lives to risk on a gut instinct.
Helo So Demetrius goes back to the Fleet.
Starbuck Missing a Raptor. Im gonna take Leoben back to the Baseship. See if his story checks out.
Helo Are you insane? The two of you alone?
Anders Shes not going alone. Im going with her.
Starbuck_looking_to_Sharon This is crazy, but I need you.
Athena ...What?
Starbuck I need someone that speaks their language. If this is a trap, I want to know about it.
Seelix Hell yeah, let the Cylon go.
Athena Its okay. Ill do it.
Helo No, listen to me. Your Raptor doesnt have enough fuel to get back to Galactica.
Starbuck But the Baseship does. We were sent out here by the Admiral to complete a mission. Not for me, but for the people of the Fleet. And if Im right, the payoff is Earth.
Helo Lt. Costanza, whats the latest we can leave here and still make the rendezvous with the Fleet?
Hotdog Window closes ... fifteen hours and seven minutes. And thats cutting it really damn close.
Helo Set the clock to fifteen hours and seven minutes, and start it. Well be waiting here till the clock runs out.
Roslin_completely_bald So I guess just pack up everything thats here. Pack up all of these drafts. Im gonna have plenty of time on my hands over the next couple of days, so pack it up.
Tory Hey, at least the worst is over. Two more doloxan treatments and you will be over the hump.
Roslin And Im gonna need you to really keep an eye on things until then.
Tory_smiling Dont worry. Ill make sure our friend from Picon sees the error of his ways.
Roslin Im not just talking about the Quorum, Tory. There was a time a few months ago when you seemed overwhelmed by the stresses and the pressures of this job. But lately youve really stepped up. And Im gonna be demanding even more of that from you in the days to come, because Im not quite sure of what Im doing right... Im sort of... Im just gonna need you to keep a keen eye on every single thing that comes across this desk.
Tory I appreciate your confidence, Madam President.
Roslin Thank you. Lets go.
Starbuck_marching_cuffed_Leoben_into_the_Raptor Just remember, if this is a trap, you die first.
Athena Preflight is complete.
Starbuck I need to know. Do I need to watch my back with you on this?
Athena No, I said Id go. You have my word.
Leoben Be like a homecoming for you. The other Eights talk about you all the time.
Athena_to_Barolay Keep him the frak away from me.
Starbuck Barolay, I didnt ask for volunteers.
Barolay Yeah you did, back on Galactica. Look, I dont give a frak what the others say, youve been kicking ass since day one. You say you can find Earth, I want to be there when you do.
Helo_on_wireless You have fourteen hours and 40 minutes. Godspeed.
Athena Copy that.
Leoben_to_Sam Can you feel it? The anticipation. Gods plan is about to be revealed.
Anders You better hope so, for your sake.
Athena 3... 2... 1... Jump.
Anders Multiple contacts, all quadrants.
Athena Huh. Looks like we found whats left of them.
Helo How you doing, Felix?
Gaeta Never better. Those frakkers wont give me any more morpha. Afraid Ill OD or something.
Helo Yeah, I know.
Gaeta ...Will you promise me something?
Helo Anything.
Gaeta Dont let Cottle take my leg.
Helo Hey, youre gonna be all right.
Gaeta Dont frak with me. Karl, I know every minute that we stay here means its more likely that hes gonna have to. Please, okay? Promise me.
Helo_taking_his_hand Felix, you know damn well I wont leave until the clock runs out.
Starbuck All right, wheres the Baseship?
Anders I dont know. If its still in one piece, dradis is too cluttered to see it... Hey, watch yourselves. Weve got ordinance popping off all over the place out there.
Athena Looks like he wasnt lying about a civil war.
Starbuck This is it. This is the place. I can hear it.
Leoben_to_Sam The unstruck music vibrates in all of us. Few can hear it. Karas one of the few.
Athena Got a course for us?
Starbuck Give me the ship.
Athena_giving_her_flight_control Starbuck, you have any idea where youre going?
Starbuck The comet! The... Its the ship! This is what I was meant to see.
Anders Incoming, right, two high! Break, break, break!
Anders Shes back.
Starbuck Oh, frak.
Anders_tending_to_her_wounds Kara...hey, no, shh! Take it easy, Kara. Everybody made it okay. Youre gonna be fine.
Anders No, dont touch it. We need to get her out of here. Get her some air.
Athena Get the frak away from me!
Eight They call you Athena now. You even wear their uniform like youre one of them. You were the first to say no.
Athena No to what?
Eight The entire plan. You joined the humans. You had a child. You showed us that we dont have to be slaves to our programming.
Eight We wanted the same thing, but it turned out to be a disaster. The Sixes have made one mistake after another. They have to be stopped before they get the rest of us killed.
Another_Eight Ask.
Eight You could help us.
Athena You want me to lead a mutiny against the Sixes.
Eight Its the only way.
Athena You guys make me sick.
Eight Why?
Athena Because you pick your side and you stick. You dont cut and run when things get ugly. Otherwise youll never have anything. No love, no family. No life to call your own. Now you guys can either help me or get the hell out of my way.
Baltar_on_wireless ...Because He will take your hand...
Nurse Ill just come back later. When youre feeling a little better.
Emily Cant you read a chart? Im not gonna feel better. So take your needles and your thermometers and your catheters and stick em where the sun doesnt shine.
Baltar ... The undiscovered country...
Roslin_entering_her_bedsit Hello.
Emily Oh, great. Now the President.
Roslin_friendly She stuck me three times today.
Baltar ...Its a better place...
Emily_smiling Be thankful she hasnt put a catheter in you.
Baltar ...Where we will bask in the radiance of Gods love. How do we get there?
Emily All this just to keep me alive for a few more days. Its so pointless.
Roslin_reaching_for_the_wireless No, its not pointless. And Im sure it isnt helping listening to Gaius Baltar...
Emily No no no! Dont touch that! The frak do you think you are?
Baltar ... Accept him into your hearts...
Emily_sick_and_upset Leave me alone!
Baltar ...God doesnt really care how many good deeds weve done. This is the mistake that I find that so many of the pious...
Leoben The... Hybrid will want to see you, I know it.
Starbuck Lets go then.
Natalie What are you doing? You want to give her access to the central nervous system of this ship?
Anders I thought we had a deal.
Leoben We discussed this. Karas the key to our salvation.
Natalie We agreed on an alliance.
Starbuck You want an alliance, I see the Hybrid. Leoben claims it can help me find Earth.
Leoben Theres no way around it.
Natalie Weve tried to be patient about your models obsession with this woman. Playing house with her on New Caprica was one thing. But this puts us all in jeopardy. We have their Raptor and their jump drive. We dont need them.
Barolay Frakkin toaster!
Starbuck Barolay, dont. You dont have time to figure out our jump systems without our help. Not before the other Cylons get back.
Leoben And if we do figure it out in time, do we just keep running? How long before we run out of fuel, food, ammunition? How long before Cavils forces hunt us down? Like it or not, we have to work with the Colonials. That means Kara sees the Hybrid.
Starbuck Or you can kiss your asses good-bye.
Natalie_stalking_off Looks as if we have no choice. But first we do this.
Athena_reading_the_datastream Okay, we can do this. We can give their ship jump capability again by slaving its drives to our Raptors spin sync generator.
Starbuck So just do it.
Athena Their Hybrid was damaged in the attack, so were gonna have to pull her offline and execute jumps from the Raptor.
Natalie -- Pull the Hybrid offline? Absolutely not. Its never been done on an operational ship. It would be like blinding her. It might even kill her.
Starbuck You know, if we dont get this done before the other Cylons come back, were all dead anyway.
Starbuck Make it happen, Lieutenant.
Athena Barolay, yank the connectors from the bus I showed you and strip the cables out of them.
Barolay You got it, LT.
Athena And Six, Im gonna need some data cabling right away. Single mode 1310, otherwise youll blow our system to shreds.
Starbuck We started the interface. Take me to this Hybrid. Anders, youre on me.
Anders Might be better if I stay here. I know more about the Raptors system than they do.
Starbuck Fine.
Barolay What the hell are you looking at?
Six I know you. You were on New Caprica. You were part of the Resistance. You killed me. Watched me drown, kicking and thrashing like I was some kind of an insect.
Barolay Well, be happy to put you down again.
Barolay Im okay....
Athena Barolay?
Anders Hey, hey, Jean. Hey. Jean! You killed her. You frakkin killed her!
Anders You want to know what it feels like to die, huh? Youre nothing! Youre a frakkin machine!
Starbuck_arriving_with_Natalie Sam, put the gun down now! Sam, stop!
Anders What do you want me to do, Kara? You want me to forget about Barolay? You want me to forget about New Caprica? No frakkin way! She just killed Barolay!
Starbuck Sam! Put the gun down. Put it down.
Anders_weeping Im not gonna do it.
Starbuck Sam. Sam, you have no idea whats at stake here. Look at me. Put it down.
Athena They killed one of us and youre just ready to let it slide?
Anders Shes right. You cant let this go, Kara. If you dont want to do this, I will.
Starbuck Put the gun down, soldier. I need to see the Hybrid.
Natalie_to_the_Six Why, sister?
Six I just couldnt let it go. On New Caprica...
Natalie_kneeling She was the one?
Six I never did anything to her. We were working at the water treatment plant and she just...
Natalie I know, I remember. After you downloaded, we tried to work through this...
Six_crying How do you work through something like that? Never forget her expression as I tried to scream. Just... just slapped tape over my mouth and threw me in that septic tank...
Anders You shut your frakkin mouth.
Six I still see her face when I try and sleep. We were trying to help these people.
Natalie I know. I know. I wish there was something I could do.
Six_without_looking_up ...Then Im glad its you.
Anders_pointing_the_gun_at_Natalie Godsdamn it!
Natalie No Resurrection Ship. You understand? Shes just as dead as your friend.
Natalie Is that enough human justice for you? Blood for blood?
Emily Madam President. I wanted to apologize for before. I... I have good moments and bad.
Roslin And that was ... which?
Emily_laughing Come in here. I have something for you.
Roslin For me?
Emily Yes, yes, come in. Come in. Would you get it? Its in the first drawer. Right here. Thats it. Yes.
Roslin This is for me?
Emily I hope its not too gaudy.
Roslin No. This is beautiful. Thank you. Thats beautiful.
Emily A woman on Aurora makes em, Leslie Stars. She makes all kinds if you want to check it out.
Roslin No, I think this one will be just fine.
Emily What color are you hoping for? When it grows back in?
Roslin Um, well. I was thinking maybe blue. Nice royal blue. Change of pace.
Emily Oh, my hair used to be... now look at it. Feel it, feel it.
Emily_sweetly Its gonna get a lot worse. Be prepared for that.
Baltar ... Because He will take our hands and guide us to the other side of the river...

All these things at once and many more not because it wishes harm but because it likes violent vibrations to change constantly then shall the maidens rejoice at the dance structural integrity of node seven restored repressurizing the children of the one reborn shall find their own country the intruders swarmed like flame like the whirlwind hopes soaring to slaughter all their best against our hulls ...

Emily For what its worth, I voted for you in the last election. And I dont like how Baltar keeps ragging on you. That is not why I listen to him.
Roslin Why do you listen to him?
Emily I had an experience that made me rethink all my preconceptions.
Roslin What kind of experience?
Emily It happened the night after Cottle told me that my cancer had spread to my liver and Id never be leaving this place. I was on a ferry crossing a river, and as we were approaching the other side I saw all these people standing on the bank. And we got closer, and I recognized them. My parents. My sister Kathy, who died when I was twelve. My husband, my girls. I... I was scared for a moment. You know, how is this happening? But then I... I felt it. This ... presence. Hovering all around me. Warm. Loving, and... It said, Dont be scared, Emily. Im with you. Hold my hand and well cross over together.
Roslin But a lot of people in our predicament have dreams like that, Emily.
Emily_over_snippets_of_her_vision No. I was there. I felt the cool breeze coming from the water. The spray from the bow. Maybe hes stumbled onto something. You know, he talks about the river that separates our world from the next. That... That theres more to this existence than we can see with our naked eye. Theres a power that we cant begin to understand.

Starbuck Not a frakkin thing.

Hybrid End of line.
Roslin But this God that Baltar refers to, it is the Cylon God. You know that, dont you?
Emily If Hes the one and true God, He belongs to all of us. Otherwise, Hes not much of a God, is He?
Roslin Exactly. He isnt much of a God. Hes a fantasy.
Emily_making_Laura_laugh Oh, Laura. And the Lords of Kobol are real? Reigning from a metaphysical mountaintop in those silly outfits? Zeus handing out fates out of an urn like...like they were lottery tickets. Youre gonna work on a tylium ship, youre gonna be an Admiral, your familys gonna be evaporated in an attack on the Colonies, but youll survive for three more years in a moldy compartment on a freighter till your body starts to eat itself up alive. Those are the Gods that you worship? Capricious, vindictive?
Roslin But theyre not meant to be taken literally. Theyre metaphors, Emily.
Emily I dont need metaphors. I need answers.
Roslin Youre like my mother. She wasnt satisfied with metaphors either. She was convinced that Aphrodite herself was gonna swoop her away when she died. And she believed it. Even after the doloxan and the radiation failed to stop her cancer. She was a teacher, she was ... Oh, she was something to behold. ... In the head of a classroom, and ... And her students.
Roslin Her students loved her. They... Theyd walk through fire for her. And then you see this woman who seemed so eternal, she ... withered away, and I find myself having to change her diaper because she couldnt even... And at the moment she died, there was no gleaming fields of Elysium stretched out before her, there was this... Dark, black abyss. And she was just terrified. She was so scared... Im sorry...
Emily_reaching_out_to_her Laura.
Emily Laura, you were terrified. You saw only darkness. You cant possibly know what your mother experienced. Youre, youre still searching. Youre...
Roslin Doc Cottle! Doc! Do something!
Cottle Nurse, get me some morpha quickly.
Roslin_holding_her_as_he_injects_her Shh, its okay. Its all right.
Cottle_as_they_lay_her_back All we can do for her now is try to make her comfortable.
Roslin_crying Thats all?
Cottle Im sorry, thats it.
Roslin All right.
Natalie Its as if she doesnt even see us anymore.
Anders Shes looking past us. Ive seen that look many times, but never in the eyes of a Cylon.
Eight_holding_out_her_hand Athena, you were right. Forgive me.
Anders Its okay. Im with you.
Leoben ...She will lead us to the end. We will now know the truth of the Opera House.
Natalie The home of the Thirteenth.
Starbuck What?
Natalie The Hybrid said, The missing Three will get you the Five, who have come from the home of the Thirteenth. The home of the Thirteenth Tribe of humans...
Starbuck_staring And the Five is your Final Five Cylon models.
Natalie If theyve come from the home of the Thirteenth Tribe, then they must know the way back.
Starbuck They know how to get to Earth.
Athena And the missing Three is the model you boxed for looking at the faces of the Five...
Leoben DAnna.
Starbuck She can recognize em. Lets go. Demetrius is waiting for us.
Emily Were here.
Laura Mother. Youre okay.
Laura Im not ready.
Baltar ...You no longer need to fear the unknown. Because he will take your hand and guide you to the other side of the river. What river am I talking about? Im talking about the river that separates this world from the next. There is more to reality than the things that we can touch, taste, or even see with our naked eyes. There is another realm...

Helo Then lets go home.
Roslin I need to talk to you.
Adama Certainly. Come in.
Roslin Thank you.
Adama Can I get you some water?
Roslin Yes.
Adama You really believe that theres something in this horse manure that Baltars peddling?
Roslin I dont know. Something is happening here, and I dont really understand it, Bill.
Adama You both had the same dream, means...
Roslin What? Talk to me. Whats going on?
Adama Kara comes back from the dead, I let her go off chasing her vision of Earth. Well, shes overdue. Lee turns in his wings. Helo, Athena, Gaeta. Will I ever see those kids again?
Roslin_rubbing_his_shoulder Bill. Look at me. Im right here. Right here. Were going to find it.
Adama Earth?
Roslin Together.
Adama I used to think it was such a pipe dream. I used to use it as a carrot for the Fleet.
Roslin What made you change?
Adama_grinning_wonderfully You. You made me believe.
