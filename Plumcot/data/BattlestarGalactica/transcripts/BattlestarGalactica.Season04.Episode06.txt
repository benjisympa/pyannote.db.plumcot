president_laura_roslin Previously, on Battlestar Galactica.
Captain_Franks#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode06 Madam President, are you taking chamalla again?
president_laura_roslin I am taking chamalla again. ...Because my cancer has returned.
captain_kara_thrace I remember a flashing triple star, a giant gas planet with rings, and a comet.
lt_sharon_valerii Whats the latest, Felix?
Felix#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode06 Shes reversing course. Returning to sector seven.
lt_sharon_valerii Ugh, that is the tenth course correction.
ensign_diana_seelix Frak me!
number_six Theyre going to attack. Alert the others. We need to jump now.
Cavil#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode06 Just remember, they started it.
Boomer#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode06 But were killing them, I mean were truly killing them.
lt_brendan_constanza Dradis contact. Ive got visual. Cylon Heavy Raider.
leoben_conoy Kara, Im alone. This is not an attack. I knew Id find you.
captain_kara_thrace ...Leoben?
leoben_conoy Im here for you. To offer a truce between human and Cylon and a chance for you to complete your journey.
leoben_conoy The Hybrid. You need to go to her, Kara. Shell tell you the way to get to Earth.
captain_karl_agathon Were done here. Get him out of here.
Pike#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode06 This Baseship was never part of the mission. If we dont leave right now, we are all going to die.
lt_felix_gaeta Were ready to jump back to the Fleet on your order.
captain_kara_thrace Were not going back to the Fleet.
Pike#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode06 What the hell are you talking about?
captain_kara_thrace We came out here to complete a mission, and that Baseship has something to do with it. I know it.
captain_karl_agathon Captain Thrace, as XO of the Demetrius, Im hereby relieving you of command.
captain_kara_thrace You son of a bitch. Ill do it myself.
captain_karl_agathon Hey!
samuel_anders What the hell are you doing, Karl?
captain_karl_agathon Stand down!
captain_karl_agathon Order the Marine guards to the control room. Tell them Im placing Captain Thrace under arrest.
captain_kara_thrace Youre wrong, Helo. Youre so Godsdamn wrong.
captain_karl_agathon Either way, were taking Leoben and his proposal back to the Fleet. Well let the Admiral sort it out.
captain_kara_thrace You are throwing away our last chance to find Earth.
samuel_anders And youll be going back to Galactica as mutineers. How do you think the Admirals gonna sort through that?
captain_karl_agathon Thats up to him. Mr. Gaeta, reset the FTL for the first jump back to the Fleet.
lt_felix_gaeta Right away, sir.
ensign_diana_seelix We should just airlock your Cylon ass.
captain_kara_thrace I am not a Cylon.
samuel_anders Gaeta, stop! Gaeta, abort the jump! I said, abort the jump!
lt_felix_gaeta Oh, frak.
samuel_anders You want to know whos in charge? You want to know whos in command? You frakkin want to know?
captain_kara_thrace Sam!
samuel_anders Its Captain Thrace, Gods damn it! Now you let her go!
captain_karl_agathon Sergeant, stand down. Stand down, Sergeant! Stand down, Sergeant! Seelix, stand down. Sam! Stand down, stand down! Medic!
lt_felix_gaeta Ahhh! What the frak?
captain_kara_thrace I need a med kit!
lt_felix_gaeta Frak! What the frak?
captain_kara_thrace All right, bloodstopper. This is gonna hurt. Ready, go.
lt_felix_gaeta Get off me, you frakkin bitch...Ahhhh!
captain_kara_thrace Morpha.
captain_kara_thrace We need to move him to a bunk.
captain_karl_agathon Marines, get over here!
captain_kara_thrace Careful!
samuel_anders Wait, listen. Kara, that was...
captain_karl_agathon So now what? Gonna give orders at gunpoint?
captain_kara_thrace Youre right, Helo. I never shouldve ordered Demetrius to jump to the Baseship. Too many lives to risk on a gut instinct.
captain_karl_agathon So Demetrius goes back to the Fleet.
captain_kara_thrace Missing a Raptor. Im gonna take Leoben back to the Baseship. See if his story checks out.
captain_karl_agathon Are you insane? The two of you alone?
samuel_anders Shes not going alone. Im going with her.
captain_kara_thrace This is crazy, but I need you.
lt_sharon_valerii ...What?
captain_kara_thrace I need someone that speaks their language. If this is a trap, I want to know about it.
ensign_diana_seelix Hell yeah, let the Cylon go.
lt_sharon_valerii Its okay. Ill do it.
captain_karl_agathon No, listen to me. Your Raptor doesnt have enough fuel to get back to Galactica.
captain_kara_thrace But the Baseship does. We were sent out here by the Admiral to complete a mission. Not for me, but for the people of the Fleet. And if Im right, the payoff is Earth.
captain_karl_agathon Lt. Costanza, whats the latest we can leave here and still make the rendezvous with the Fleet?
lt_brendan_constanza Window closes ... fifteen hours and seven minutes. And thats cutting it really damn close.
captain_karl_agathon Set the clock to fifteen hours and seven minutes, and start it. Well be waiting here till the clock runs out.
president_laura_roslin So I guess just pack up everything thats here. Pack up all of these drafts. Im gonna have plenty of time on my hands over the next couple of days, so pack it up.
tory_foster Hey, at least the worst is over. Two more doloxan treatments and you will be over the hump.
president_laura_roslin And Im gonna need you to really keep an eye on things until then.
tory_foster Dont worry. Ill make sure our friend from Picon sees the error of his ways.
president_laura_roslin Im not just talking about the Quorum, Tory. There was a time a few months ago when you seemed overwhelmed by the stresses and the pressures of this job. But lately youve really stepped up. And Im gonna be demanding even more of that from you in the days to come, because Im not quite sure of what Im doing right... Im sort of... Im just gonna need you to keep a keen eye on every single thing that comes across this desk.
tory_foster I appreciate your confidence, Madam President.
president_laura_roslin Thank you. Lets go.
captain_kara_thrace Just remember, if this is a trap, you die first.
lt_sharon_valerii Preflight is complete.
captain_kara_thrace I need to know. Do I need to watch my back with you on this?
lt_sharon_valerii No, I said Id go. You have my word.
leoben_conoy Be like a homecoming for you. The other Eights talk about you all the time.
lt_sharon_valerii Keep him the frak away from me.
captain_kara_thrace Barolay, I didnt ask for volunteers.
jean_barolay Yeah you did, back on Galactica. Look, I dont give a frak what the others say, youve been kicking ass since day one. You say you can find Earth, I want to be there when you do.
captain_karl_agathon You have fourteen hours and 40 minutes. Godspeed.
lt_sharon_valerii Copy that.
leoben_conoy Can you feel it? The anticipation. Gods plan is about to be revealed.
samuel_anders You better hope so, for your sake.
lt_sharon_valerii 3... 2... 1... Jump.
samuel_anders Multiple contacts, all quadrants.
lt_sharon_valerii Huh. Looks like we found whats left of them.
captain_karl_agathon How you doing, Felix?
lt_felix_gaeta Never better. Those frakkers wont give me any more morpha. Afraid Ill OD or something.
captain_karl_agathon Yeah, I know.
lt_felix_gaeta ...Will you promise me something?
captain_karl_agathon Anything.
lt_felix_gaeta Dont let Cottle take my leg.
captain_karl_agathon Hey, youre gonna be all right.
lt_felix_gaeta Dont frak with me. Karl, I know every minute that we stay here means its more likely that hes gonna have to. Please, okay? Promise me.
captain_karl_agathon Felix, you know damn well I wont leave until the clock runs out.
captain_kara_thrace All right, wheres the Baseship?
samuel_anders I dont know. If its still in one piece, dradis is too cluttered to see it... Hey, watch yourselves. Weve got ordinance popping off all over the place out there.
lt_sharon_valerii Looks like he wasnt lying about a civil war.
captain_kara_thrace This is it. This is the place. I can hear it.
leoben_conoy The unstruck music vibrates in all of us. Few can hear it. Karas one of the few.
lt_sharon_valerii Got a course for us?
captain_kara_thrace Give me the ship.
lt_sharon_valerii Starbuck, you have any idea where youre going?
captain_kara_thrace The comet! The... Its the ship! This is what I was meant to see.
samuel_anders Incoming, right, two high! Break, break, break!
samuel_anders Shes back.
captain_kara_thrace Oh, frak.
samuel_anders Kara...hey, no, shh! Take it easy, Kara. Everybody made it okay. Youre gonna be fine.
samuel_anders No, dont touch it. We need to get her out of here. Get her some air.
lt_sharon_valerii Get the frak away from me!
Eight#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode06 They call you Athena now. You even wear their uniform like youre one of them. You were the first to say no.
lt_sharon_valerii No to what?
Eight#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode06 The entire plan. You joined the humans. You had a child. You showed us that we dont have to be slaves to our programming.
Eight#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode06 We wanted the same thing, but it turned out to be a disaster. The Sixes have made one mistake after another. They have to be stopped before they get the rest of us killed.
Another_Eight#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode06 Ask.
Eight#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode06 You could help us.
lt_sharon_valerii You want me to lead a mutiny against the Sixes.
Eight#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode06 Its the only way.
lt_sharon_valerii You guys make me sick.
Eight#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode06 Why?
lt_sharon_valerii Because you pick your side and you stick. You dont cut and run when things get ugly. Otherwise youll never have anything. No love, no family. No life to call your own. Now you guys can either help me or get the hell out of my way.
dr_gaius_baltar ...Because He will take your hand...
nurse_sashon Ill just come back later. When youre feeling a little better.
emily_kowalski Cant you read a chart? Im not gonna feel better. So take your needles and your thermometers and your catheters and stick em where the sun doesnt shine.
dr_gaius_baltar ... The undiscovered country...
president_laura_roslin Hello.
emily_kowalski Oh, great. Now the President.
president_laura_roslin She stuck me three times today.
dr_gaius_baltar ...Its a better place...
emily_kowalski Be thankful she hasnt put a catheter in you.
dr_gaius_baltar ...Where we will bask in the radiance of Gods love. How do we get there?
emily_kowalski All this just to keep me alive for a few more days. Its so pointless.
president_laura_roslin No, its not pointless. And Im sure it isnt helping listening to Gaius Baltar...
emily_kowalski No no no! Dont touch that! The frak do you think you are?
dr_gaius_baltar ... Accept him into your hearts...
emily_kowalski Leave me alone!
dr_gaius_baltar ...God doesnt really care how many good deeds weve done. This is the mistake that I find that so many of the pious...
leoben_conoy The... Hybrid will want to see you, I know it.
captain_kara_thrace Lets go then.
number_six What are you doing? You want to give her access to the central nervous system of this ship?
samuel_anders I thought we had a deal.
leoben_conoy We discussed this. Karas the key to our salvation.
number_six We agreed on an alliance.
captain_kara_thrace You want an alliance, I see the Hybrid. Leoben claims it can help me find Earth.
leoben_conoy Theres no way around it.
number_six Weve tried to be patient about your models obsession with this woman. Playing house with her on New Caprica was one thing. But this puts us all in jeopardy. We have their Raptor and their jump drive. We dont need them.
jean_barolay Frakkin toaster!
captain_kara_thrace Barolay, dont. You dont have time to figure out our jump systems without our help. Not before the other Cylons get back.
leoben_conoy And if we do figure it out in time, do we just keep running? How long before we run out of fuel, food, ammunition? How long before Cavils forces hunt us down? Like it or not, we have to work with the Colonials. That means Kara sees the Hybrid.
captain_kara_thrace Or you can kiss your asses good-bye.
number_six Looks as if we have no choice. But first we do this.
lt_sharon_valerii Okay, we can do this. We can give their ship jump capability again by slaving its drives to our Raptors spin sync generator.
captain_kara_thrace So just do it.
lt_sharon_valerii Their Hybrid was damaged in the attack, so were gonna have to pull her offline and execute jumps from the Raptor.
number_six -- Pull the Hybrid offline? Absolutely not. Its never been done on an operational ship. It would be like blinding her. It might even kill her.
captain_kara_thrace You know, if we dont get this done before the other Cylons come back, were all dead anyway.
captain_kara_thrace Make it happen, Lieutenant.
lt_sharon_valerii Barolay, yank the connectors from the bus I showed you and strip the cables out of them.
jean_barolay You got it, LT.
lt_sharon_valerii And Six, Im gonna need some data cabling right away. Single mode 1310, otherwise youll blow our system to shreds.
captain_kara_thrace We started the interface. Take me to this Hybrid. Anders, youre on me.
samuel_anders Might be better if I stay here. I know more about the Raptors system than they do.
captain_kara_thrace Fine.
jean_barolay What the hell are you looking at?
number_six I know you. You were on New Caprica. You were part of the Resistance. You killed me. Watched me drown, kicking and thrashing like I was some kind of an insect.
jean_barolay Well, be happy to put you down again.
jean_barolay Im okay....
lt_sharon_valerii Barolay?
samuel_anders Hey, hey, Jean. Hey. Jean! You killed her. You frakkin killed her!
samuel_anders You want to know what it feels like to die, huh? Youre nothing! Youre a frakkin machine!
captain_kara_thrace Sam, put the gun down now! Sam, stop!
samuel_anders What do you want me to do, Kara? You want me to forget about Barolay? You want me to forget about New Caprica? No frakkin way! She just killed Barolay!
captain_kara_thrace Sam! Put the gun down. Put it down.
samuel_anders Im not gonna do it.
captain_kara_thrace Sam. Sam, you have no idea whats at stake here. Look at me. Put it down.
lt_sharon_valerii They killed one of us and youre just ready to let it slide?
samuel_anders Shes right. You cant let this go, Kara. If you dont want to do this, I will.
captain_kara_thrace Put the gun down, soldier. I need to see the Hybrid.
number_six Why, sister?
number_six I just couldnt let it go. On New Caprica...
number_six She was the one?
number_six I never did anything to her. We were working at the water treatment plant and she just...
number_six I know, I remember. After you downloaded, we tried to work through this...
number_six How do you work through something like that? Never forget her expression as I tried to scream. Just... just slapped tape over my mouth and threw me in that septic tank...
samuel_anders You shut your frakkin mouth.
number_six I still see her face when I try and sleep. We were trying to help these people.
number_six I know. I know. I wish there was something I could do.
number_six ...Then Im glad its you.
samuel_anders Godsdamn it!
number_six No Resurrection Ship. You understand? Shes just as dead as your friend.
number_six Is that enough human justice for you? Blood for blood?
emily_kowalski Madam President. I wanted to apologize for before. I... I have good moments and bad.
president_laura_roslin And that was ... which?
emily_kowalski Come in here. I have something for you.
president_laura_roslin For me?
emily_kowalski Yes, yes, come in. Come in. Would you get it? Its in the first drawer. Right here. Thats it. Yes.
president_laura_roslin This is for me?
emily_kowalski I hope its not too gaudy.
president_laura_roslin No. This is beautiful. Thank you. Thats beautiful.
emily_kowalski A woman on Aurora makes em, Leslie Stars. She makes all kinds if you want to check it out.
president_laura_roslin No, I think this one will be just fine.
emily_kowalski What color are you hoping for? When it grows back in?
president_laura_roslin Um, well. I was thinking maybe blue. Nice royal blue. Change of pace.
emily_kowalski Oh, my hair used to be... now look at it. Feel it, feel it.
emily_kowalski Its gonna get a lot worse. Be prepared for that.

emily_kowalski For what its worth, I voted for you in the last election. And I dont like how Baltar keeps ragging on you. That is not why I listen to him.
president_laura_roslin Why do you listen to him?
emily_kowalski I had an experience that made me rethink all my preconceptions.
president_laura_roslin What kind of experience?
emily_kowalski It happened the night after Cottle told me that my cancer had spread to my liver and Id never be leaving this place. I was on a ferry crossing a river, and as we were approaching the other side I saw all these people standing on the bank. And we got closer, and I recognized them. My parents. My sister Kathy, who died when I was twelve. My husband, my girls. I... I was scared for a moment. You know, how is this happening? But then I... I felt it. This ... presence. Hovering all around me. Warm. Loving, and... It said, Dont be scared, Emily. Im with you. Hold my hand and well cross over together.
president_laura_roslin But a lot of people in our predicament have dreams like that, Emily.
emily_kowalski No. I was there. I felt the cool breeze coming from the water. The spray from the bow. Maybe hes stumbled onto something. You know, he talks about the river that separates our world from the next. That... That theres more to this existence than we can see with our naked eye. Theres a power that we cant begin to understand.

the_hybrid End of line.
president_laura_roslin But this God that Baltar refers to, it is the Cylon God. You know that, dont you?
emily_kowalski If Hes the one and true God, He belongs to all of us. Otherwise, Hes not much of a God, is He?
president_laura_roslin Exactly. He isnt much of a God. Hes a fantasy.
emily_kowalski Oh, Laura. And the Lords of Kobol are real? Reigning from a metaphysical mountaintop in those silly outfits? Zeus handing out fates out of an urn like...like they were lottery tickets. Youre gonna work on a tylium ship, youre gonna be an Admiral, your familys gonna be evaporated in an attack on the Colonies, but youll survive for three more years in a moldy compartment on a freighter till your body starts to eat itself up alive. Those are the Gods that you worship? Capricious, vindictive?
president_laura_roslin But theyre not meant to be taken literally. Theyre metaphors, Emily.
emily_kowalski I dont need metaphors. I need answers.
president_laura_roslin Youre like my mother. She wasnt satisfied with metaphors either. She was convinced that Aphrodite herself was gonna swoop her away when she died. And she believed it. Even after the doloxan and the radiation failed to stop her cancer. She was a teacher, she was ... Oh, she was something to behold. ... In the head of a classroom, and ... And her students.
president_laura_roslin Her students loved her. They... Theyd walk through fire for her. And then you see this woman who seemed so eternal, she ... withered away, and I find myself having to change her diaper because she couldnt even... And at the moment she died, there was no gleaming fields of Elysium stretched out before her, there was this... Dark, black abyss. And she was just terrified. She was so scared... Im sorry...
emily_kowalski Laura.
emily_kowalski Laura, you were terrified. You saw only darkness. You cant possibly know what your mother experienced. Youre, youre still searching. Youre...
president_laura_roslin Doc Cottle! Doc! Do something!
dr_cottle Nurse, get me some morpha quickly.
president_laura_roslin Shh, its okay. Its all right.
dr_cottle All we can do for her now is try to make her comfortable.
president_laura_roslin Thats all?
dr_cottle Im sorry, thats it.
president_laura_roslin All right.
number_six Its as if she doesnt even see us anymore.
samuel_anders Shes looking past us. Ive seen that look many times, but never in the eyes of a Cylon.
Eight_holding_out_her_hand#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode06 Athena, you were right. Forgive me.
samuel_anders Its okay. Im with you.
leoben_conoy ...She will lead us to the end. We will now know the truth of the Opera House.
number_six The home of the Thirteenth.
captain_kara_thrace What?
number_six The Hybrid said, The missing Three will get you the Five, who have come from the home of the Thirteenth. The home of the Thirteenth Tribe of humans...
captain_kara_thrace And the Five is your Final Five Cylon models.
number_six If theyve come from the home of the Thirteenth Tribe, then they must know the way back.
captain_kara_thrace They know how to get to Earth.
lt_sharon_valerii And the missing Three is the model you boxed for looking at the faces of the Five...
leoben_conoy DAnna.
captain_kara_thrace She can recognize em. Lets go. Demetrius is waiting for us.
emily_kowalski Were here.
Laura#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode06 Mother. Youre okay.
Laura#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode06 Im not ready.
dr_gaius_baltar ...You no longer need to fear the unknown. Because he will take your hand and guide you to the other side of the river. What river am I talking about? Im talking about the river that separates this world from the next. There is more to reality than the things that we can touch, taste, or even see with our naked eyes. There is another realm...
