Roslin Previously, on Battlestar Galactica.
Adama Im giving you a ship. Now go. Find a way to Earth.
Leoben_over_wireless Kara, Im alone. This is not an attack. I knew Id find you...
Starbuck Leoben?
Leoben Im here to offer a truce between human and Cylon and a chance for you to complete your journey.
Leoben The Hybrid. You need to go to her, Kara. Shell tell you the way to get to Earth.
Helo Were done here. Get him out of here.
Gaeta Were ready to jump back to the Fleet on your order.
Starbuck Were not going back to the Fleet.
Helo Captain Thrace, as XO of the Demetrius, Im hereby relieving you of command.
Starbuck You son of a bitch.
Anders_shooting_Felix Gaeta, abort the jump!
Starbuck Im gonna take Leoben back to the Baseship, see if his story checks out.
Helo Well be waiting here till the clock runs out.
Athena Looks like he wasnt lying about a civil war.
Starbuck This is it. The comet. Its the ship!
Hybrid Thus will it come to pass. You are the harbinger of death, Kara Thrace. You will lead them all to their end.
Hotdog Cylon Baseship.
Athena Demetrius, Athena. The Baseship is ours.
Helo Then lets go home.
Baltar_on_tape Now I have learned from unimpeachable sources that President Laura Roslin has for some time now been sharing hallucinogenic visions with two Cylons within our Fleet. One Sharon Agathon, sent on the classified Demetrius mission, and the other a Cylon prisoner being held aboard the Galac...
Apollo Uh-uh. Its not that easy, Madam President.
Roslin No? You should try it sometime.
Apollo Most of the population has heard that broadcast.
Roslin I would assume thats the point.
Apollo Look, I take no pleasure in putting this before you. In fact, they practically had to push me through that door....
Roslin Well, Im sure youre quite happy to stay.
Apollo I cant put one foot in front of another without someone blocking my path asking me what the hell is going on! For the welfare of the Fleet...
Roslin -- Excuse me. As long as I am in this office, the welfare of this Fleet is not something you need to worry about.
Apollo You owe the people a response.
Roslin_scoffing I owe the people?
Apollo Thats what I believe.
Roslin What if suddenly all your beliefs were called into question?
Apollo Madam President...
Roslin -- Up is down. Black is white. Scripture is fiction. Home is thin air, instead of solid ground. Et cetera.
Apollo You know, Im really sorry for everything youve had to endure.
Apollo I really am. But the people, they deserve a response.
Roslin Do they?
Apollo Is there any truth to this broadcast?
Roslin And what would you do if I told you the truth? What if it were you instead of me, and all thats left of humanity has just been told that you are sharing visions with the enemy? What would you do, Mr. Adama? Would you think that the Gods were testing you?
Apollo So Baltar is telling the truth?
Apollo_leaning_forward Is it true?
Roslin ...Yes.
Athena Demetrius reports their sys ops will be synced with ours in five minutes.
Starbuck_to_Leoben When you came knocking with that Raider and asked for our help, you gave away the future of all the Cylons aboard this ship. You know that, right?
Leoben I gave it to the right person.
Starbuck Save it. No guarantees. When we meet up with the Colonial Fleet, I dont know if theyll feed you or frak you, all right?
Starbuck Since youve been calling the plays up till now, Im assuming youre doing the talking?
Starbuck Good. Gods help us.
Athena_from_the_Raptor Sys ops of both vessels are synced. Were as ready as were ever gonna be.
Starbuck Good. Tell the Demetrius to set the board to green. Unless both ships jump in together, Galactica will blow us out of the sky.
Athena_on_wireless Demetrius, Athena. Set your board to green.
Helo Athena, Demetrius. Starting to green. Lets round the horn, guys. Sublight.
Seelix Go.
Helo Helm.
Pike Go.
Helo Tactical.
Ensign Go.
Helo Nav.
Ensign Go.
Helo FTL.
Seelix Spun up. Go.
Helo Athena, Demetrius. Board is green.
Natalie_to_Athena I was just thinking how beautiful she must be. Your daughter, Hera.
Athena How do you know her name?
Natalie We all know her name. You were blessed.
Starbuck All right, everyone. Lets go home.
Athena Demetrius, Athena. Execute jump. Clock is running. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2. Jump.
Seelix Sir, we had a problem with the sync points and the jump coordinates. Itll take a few minutes to spool up the FTL drive again.
Helo Godsdamn it!
Adama All hands. Battle stations! Set Condition One throughout the fleet!
Tigh Launch alert five. Get me some more frakkin birds in the air! Gun batteries stand by for target bearing!
Athena Demetrius, Athena. Report. Demetrius, Athena. Report.
Dualla Baseship bearing 333 carom 498 at 15msu.
Tigh Frakkin thing is sitting right on top of us.
Adama Mr. Hoshi, order the Fleet to make an emergency jump!
Hoshi all Colonial vessels jump immediately to emergency rendezvous coordinates... Sir, the Presidents shuttle is en route.
Adama Tell them to land on landing bay one, checkers green.
Athena_checking_Raptor_wiring Galactica, Athena. Galactica, Athena... Last jump mustve cooked the wireless. Weve got no comm., they cant hear us.
Starbuck Frak.
Athena Galacticas scrambling Vipers. Theyre going to shoot us down.
Tigh_noting_something_on_dradis What the frak?
Athena Eight Vipers inbound. Entering firing range.
Starbuck Where the hell is the Demetrius?
Ensign Baseship targeted. Weapons free.
Tigh Something isnt right...
Hoshi Gunnery reporting. Firing solution correct. Main battery standing by to fire on your command.
Adama On my command. 3, 2, 1...
Tigh Weapons hold!
Dualla Dradis contact!
Helo Galactica, Demetrius. Do not fire. Baseship is disarmed and under Colonial command. Officers aboard.
Dualla Demetrius, Galactica. Authenticate.
Helo_on_wireless Galactica, Demetrius. I authenticate, bravo tango 8. Do not fire. Starbuck and Athena have control of the Baseship.
Tigh_leading_a_Marine_squad Move, move, move!
Starbuck Colonel, theyre with me.
Tigh Theyre with you?
Tigh So which one of them shot Gaeta?
Cottle Lieutenant Gaeta, stay with us. Elevate the leg. Prep an IV. All right, everybody. Stand back. And get a cut down tray in here right now.
Natalie we became divided according to models. The Twos, Eights, and Sixes have come to believe that our destiny lies in seeking out the Final Five. The Ones, Fours, and Fives violently opposed such action.
Adama We know that there are seven different models of Cylons. You only mentioned six.
Athena The Threes. The DAnnas? They were boxed after the battle on the Algae Planet.
Tigh Boxed?
Natalie Her entire line was punitively deactivated. Her consciousness placed in a boxing facility.
Adama Why?
Natalie DAnna saw the faces of the Final Five, which was forbidden. But if we unbox her, she can reveal their identities to us.
Starbuck The Final Five have been to Earth. If we help find them, they can help us get there.
Natalie Our ship can heal itself. But most of our Raiders were destroyed in the ambush. Were asking for your help here. We cant do it alone.
Roslin What could possibly motivate us to trust you now? What have you got?
Natalie The boxing facility resides within the Cylon Resurrection Hub. This Hub controls the functions of every Resurrection Ship in existence.
Athena It protects itself by periodically jumping to a new set of coordinates and then relaying them back to the Baseship.
Natalie_standing_as_the_Marines_take_aim_on_her Madam President, you asked for a reason to help us? Vengeance. You destroy the Hub, Cylons lose their ability to download. All of us.
Roslin Why would you be willing to lose your ability to resurrect?
Natalie_sadly Were rebels. We cant go back. What matters most to us is being with the Five. DAnna will be able to identify them. Well take you to the Hub if you help us unbox DAnna.
Adama Give us the coordinates of the Hub first.
Natalie No, I wont do that. I said we would take you there.
Adama Take her out. Were finished.
Natalie_at_the_door Wait. Is your word good, Admiral? Ill give you the coordinates. But I want your word.
Adama Stand down. You have my word.
Natalie Once their identities are revealed and we come back here, well be free to leave your Fleet with the Five?
Natalie Yes, theyre here with you. The Final Five are in your Fleet. Thats why our Raiders turned back the attack in the Nebula.
Adama The weapons hold. How the frak did you see that?
Tigh To be absolutely honest with you, Bill... I didnt. What can I say? We got lucky.
Adama Well, lets get a Raptor up to those coordinates that that Cylon gave us. Maybe we can get lucky again.
Tigh_leaving Sir.
Adama Tigh? Thank you.
Racetrack Lords of Kobol, shield your eyes. Get it with the gun camera. Hit override.
Skulls Kinda pretty, isnt it?
Racetrack Tell it to the Fleet.
Gaeta No. No. Dont put me under. Please. Just... Just numb everything.
Cottle Felix.
Gaeta Just do it, I... I dont want to wake up... I dont want to wake up with my leg gone.
Cottle Okay, son.
Helo If we go in on our own horse, we wont last five minutes. But we go in with that Baseship parked out there, nobodys gonna notice us for awhile.
Tigh What do we fight with? Their Raiders are frakked.
Helo We dont use theirs. We use ours. Take half the Viper wing.
Adama Half the wing?
Helo Yeah. Well sneak them in on the rebel Baseship. Hoshi did some calculations from Racetracks photos. We take out the FTL and the Hubs stranded.
Tigh We blow the Hub and, uh, billions of skin jobs lose their bath privileges.
Roslin Imagine. Once theyre gone, they cant come back. Mortal enemies.
Helo Before we blow the Hub, we need to get a team in to unbox DAnna.
Tigh Well, now, maybe we just dont. Maybe we just forget the Godsdamn boxing facility.
Adama Lie to the rebels?
Tigh Well, theyre lying to us. The skin jobs said their Raiders wont fight because the Final Five is here? We tangled with those slit-eyed black bastards for three years now, and they havent turned back before. Why now?
Helo What if theyre telling the truth? What if the Final Five are here?
Adama The Five could know the way to Earth.
Roslin If they do, theyre not gonna lead us there after weve just destroyed their resurrection capacity.
Adama Maybe theyre different, like the rebels.
Roslin What if theyre not? What if their sole purpose is to destroy us?
Tigh I say we blow the whole Godsdamn thing to dust, lock, stock, and barrel, and trust the Presidents vision. Her scriptures, her way to Earth.
Roslin Why dont we split the difference? Unbox DAnna and find the Five. Keep the Five till we get to Earth, turn them over to the rebels. Theyve waited this long. Itll be on our terms. ...Its all pie in the sky, gentlemen, until we know whats true and whats not.
Adama And we put a lid on it. The real plan stays in this room. If the plan gets leaked to the Cylons, all bets are off. Have someone escort the rebel leader back to her Baseship so she can inform her people they have a deal.
Zarek_reading In thirty-six hours, the Colonies will unite forces with insurgent rebel Cylons and their leader in an unprecedented joint military operation to destroy the Cylons ability to download into...  Blah blah blah. Why werent we consulted?
Apollo Im sorry. Im in the dark as much as all of you...
Chief You know, if they unbox the DAnnas, at least well find out who the fifth one is.
Tigh All thats gonna do is crowd the airlock a little more. Do you think theyre gonna give you a medal when they find out who you are?
Tory what about you?
Anders He sings, you know.
Chief ...What?
Anders Gaeta. Whenever he feels the tingling, whenever he feels his phantom leg. Cottle says it helps him get through it. He sings.
Tory_entering Good morning.
Roslin Morning. What is it about the Galactica that gives you such a glow? I come over here, its like Im going from one dungeon to the next.
Tory Oh, I hadnt noticed. But thank you.
Roslin You ready?
Tory Yes.
Roslin I want you to find out whos behind the shared vision rumors. Whos talking to him?
Tory With Baltar?
Roslin Youre sleeping with him, right?
Roslin Dont.
Roslin Ive just been informed that youve been spotted down there enough times to be a charter member of his nymph squad.
Tory_beginning_to_cry All right. I have come to believe in Baltars spiritual message. I dont know how or why. It just happened. I wish you knew how many times I wanted to tell you. Your friendship and your trust means...
Roslin -- Frak. Clearly my friendship and trust mean frak. And I dont really care if you have to spend the night on your knees praying, or just on your knees. I want a name. I want to know whos responsible for these lies.
Tory Madam President. Laura. I am so sorry.
Roslin_without_turning You have a job to do.
Natalie The humans are never going to allow us to have the Final Five and go our own way.
Eight Are you sure of this?
Natalie Not entirely. Id rather be wrong. But we need insurance.
Leoben Trust has to begin somewhere.
Natalie Not with us. Its our ship. When we jump, we take control of it with the Centurions. We carry out the mission as promised. But when we return, we take hostages. The humans on this ship stay on this ship until we have the Five.
Natalie Look at me. Weve changed, but the humans havent. Weve come too far to risk everything on their trust.
Gaeta Alone she sleeps, in the shirt of man / With my three wishes clutched in her hand / The first that she be spared the pain / That comes from a dark and laughing rain / When she finds love, may it always stay true ...
Roslin What a way to discover such a beautiful voice, huh? Howd you find me?
Apollo Your Chief of Staff.
Roslin ...Needs to be horsewhipped. If you came down here to kiss my ass to get information, save your breath.
Apollo The Quorums considering a vote of no confidence against you.
Roslin I wont compromise the success of this operation or the safety of this Fleet to indulge the neediness of twelve perpetually unhappy representatives. I cant.
Apollo I was with them on the, uh, emergency jump. And I saw something in the faces of the Delegates. It wasnt anxiety from waiting, it went beyond that. I was anxious, it was my first time, but they... They were empty. The Quorum had given up. And then it struck me that after going through the same routine so many times, it was the only way that they could cope with the uncertainty. To presume the worst.
Roslin_softly You felt their suffering. Now try holding their lives in balance every day.
Apollo Talk to them. You dont have to tell them everything, I know how it works. Just talk to the Quorum. Let them put a face to this joint mission, let them hear from the Cylon leader, anything. Anything to put their fears to rest.
Baltar Whats the matter?
Tory Nothing.
Baltar No, nothing. Nothing at all. Weve been lying here doing nothing. What?
Tory Youve been lying about the President sharing visions with Cylons.
Baltar_sitting_up That happens to be the Gods honest truth.
Tory_nearly_weeping Sorry. I cant accept what youve done.
Baltar What... What Ive done? What have I...? What are... Wheres this coming from?
Tory These rumors youve started. Ive seen what theyve done to her.
Baltar You seriously believe that Im making all this up? I am not saying Im not capable, but why would I? Six revealed... Caprica Six revealed them to me, through my attorney in the last days of my trial, when a guilty verdict was a certainty. I suppose I couldve gone public. Caused a stir...
Tory And all this time you kept quiet?
Baltar Im not saying Im a saint, Tory. Im many things, but I try not to be spiteful. Got no bloodlust to go get her. But shes a hypocrite. The lies, the secret missions. Co-opting the rhetoric of patriotism to keep everyone in the dark, including you. Thats rather worrying, isnt it? So I had to speak. The truth is, no good ever comes from concealing it.
Baltar Ive got a broadcast.
Gaeta_quietly The first that she be spared the pain / That comes from a dark and laughing rain ...
Gaeta When she finds love may it always stay true / This I beg for the second wish I made too ...
Roslin_weakly I didnt come here to beg, or plead, or apologize, or to keep my job. You know me better than that. And I didnt come here to create sympathy by parading my illness in front of you. On the contrary, there are some that probably believe that along with my cancer drugs, I have inoculated myself against compassion.
Roslin That is a joke.
Roslin ...I am here because I want to tell you face to face that I believe in this mission and what it means for our future. Im here to profess my trust in our new allies. Im here to ask you to listen, Im here to ask for your support. Bring her in.
Natalie In our civil war, weve seen death. Weve watched our people die. Gone forever. As terrible as it was, beyond the reach of the Resurrection Ships, something began to change. We could feel a sense of time, as if each moment held its own significance. We began to realize that for our existence to hold any value, it must end. To live meaningful lives, we must die and not return. The one human flaw that you spend your lifetimes distressing over, mortality, is the one thing... Well, its the one thing that makes you whole. I believe it was no accident that we were found by Kara Thrace. It was destiny...
Natalie She asked me to lead my people, and I accepted. No matter what the sacrifice, even if it should mean my death...
Hybrid_in_Karas_memory Thus shall it come to pass. The dying leader shall know the truth of the Opera House. You are the harbinger of death, Kara Thrace.
Natalie ...Our destiny, our future, begins here. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak.
Adama Take her out.
Gaeta But wish no more / My life you can take / To have her please just one day wake / To have her please ...
Gaeta Alone she sleeps, in the shirt of man / With my three wishes clutched in her hand ...
Roslin Hera!
Athena Hera! Hera.
Hera Bye-bye!
Roslin I gotta hand it to you. If you are a Cylon, that was a great plan. Dangle yet another way to Earth, throw in the Hub, the Final Five, and the real kicker, put the Final Five on the Fleet. Even I couldnt pass that one up.
Starbuck You are having those visions, arent you?
Starbuck Thus shall it come to pass. The dying leader shall know the truth of the Opera House...
Roslin -- What did you say?
Starbuck Thus shall it come to pass...
Roslin The Opera House.
Starbuck The dying leader shall know the truth of the Opera House.
Roslin_whispering Where did... Where did you hear that? Who told you that?
Starbuck The Hybrid on the Baseship, before they unplugged it.
Roslin The Hybrid... How does the Hybrid know whats in my dream?
Starbuck I wish I knew.
Roslin This has got to stop. These visions, Ive got to find out about these visions. Ive got to know. Will you help me?
Starbuck Yes.
Roslin Find Captain Agathon.
Natalie When I spoke to the Quorum, I could feel it. The contempt.
Leoben You were right. Theyre not ready to trust us.
Natalie No, I was wrong. Were not ready. Were deceiving them.
Eight For protection. For necessity.
Natalie Out of suspicion and fear. Why havent the Final Five come forward? What if theyre watching, judging us on our actions? Were about to resort to violence and coercion. What if they refuse to come with us? We cant do this.
Leoben Its too late.
Natalie We have to order the Centurions to stand down.
Leoben_standing Its too late. Theyre committed.
Natalie Then we have to tell the humans the truth.
Eight_horrified No, you cant do that. Theyll never trust us again. They already know the coordinates. Theyll just go destroy everything.
Leoben Go. Stall for time. Talk to Adama. Tell him anything. Anything but the truth. Ill deal with the Centurions.
Baltar Of course.
Roslin_with_her_copy_of_Searider_Falcon_in_her_lap Have a seat. Were going to settle this now.
Baltar Whats to settle? Your Chief of Staff is ... incomparably talented.
Roslin Ive been sharing visions with Sharon Agathon and the Six.
Baltar So I was only speaking the truth.
Roslin Yes. The Hybrid on the Baseship spoke of an Opera House and a dying leader. Were going to talk to the Hybrid.
Baltar And why would you require my presence?
Roslin Because youre in my visions.
Athena What are you doing, baby? Are you drawing? Can I see what you drew?
Athena Oh, no. No! No! No! Why? Why? Why?
Athena Hera? Hera? Hera!
Ensign Raptor 124, you are cleared for landing...
Athena Hera!
Athena Hera. Hera! Have you seen my daughter?
Dualla No, I havent.
Athena Hera! Hera!
Athena Hera! Hera! Hera!
Athena I cant find Hera...
Athena_pulling_a_gun Hera! Get away from my child. Get your hands off of my child.
Tigh Athena...
Athena Stay back! Stay away.
Tigh Stand down!
Roslin_to_the_Eight Plug it in. I need to talk to it.
Baltar Let Gods will be done.
Roslin Shut up. Its time to get some answers.
Athena Tyrol, will you come in here and take Hera, please?
Tigh Just do it, Tyrol.
Athena_without_looking Is she gone?
Chief Yeah.
Athena_still_aiming_at_Natalie You are never gonna take my child.
Natalie We didnt come here to.
Hybrid Jump!
Gaeta_in_pain To have her please / Just one day wake / To have her please / Just one day wake...
