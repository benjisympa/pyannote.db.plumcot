president_laura_roslin Previously, on Battlestar Galactica.
admiral_william_adama Im giving you a ship. Now go. Find a way to Earth.
leoben_conoy Kara, Im alone. This is not an attack. I knew Id find you...
captain_kara_thrace Leoben?
leoben_conoy Im here to offer a truce between human and Cylon and a chance for you to complete your journey.
leoben_conoy The Hybrid. You need to go to her, Kara. Shell tell you the way to get to Earth.
captain_karl_agathon Were done here. Get him out of here.
lt_felix_gaeta Were ready to jump back to the Fleet on your order.
captain_kara_thrace Were not going back to the Fleet.
captain_karl_agathon Captain Thrace, as XO of the Demetrius, Im hereby relieving you of command.
captain_kara_thrace You son of a bitch.
samuel_anders Gaeta, abort the jump!
captain_kara_thrace Im gonna take Leoben back to the Baseship, see if his story checks out.
captain_karl_agathon Well be waiting here till the clock runs out.
lt_sharon_valerii Looks like he wasnt lying about a civil war.
captain_kara_thrace This is it. The comet. Its the ship!
the_hybrid Thus will it come to pass. You are the harbinger of death, Kara Thrace. You will lead them all to their end.
lt_brendan_constanza Cylon Baseship.
lt_sharon_valerii Demetrius, Athena. The Baseship is ours.
captain_karl_agathon Then lets go home.
dr_gaius_baltar Now I have learned from unimpeachable sources that President Laura Roslin has for some time now been sharing hallucinogenic visions with two Cylons within our Fleet. One Sharon Agathon, sent on the classified Demetrius mission, and the other a Cylon prisoner being held aboard the Galac...
cpt_lee_adama Uh-uh. Its not that easy, Madam President.
president_laura_roslin No? You should try it sometime.
cpt_lee_adama Most of the population has heard that broadcast.
president_laura_roslin I would assume thats the point.
cpt_lee_adama Look, I take no pleasure in putting this before you. In fact, they practically had to push me through that door....
president_laura_roslin Well, Im sure youre quite happy to stay.
cpt_lee_adama I cant put one foot in front of another without someone blocking my path asking me what the hell is going on! For the welfare of the Fleet...
president_laura_roslin -- Excuse me. As long as I am in this office, the welfare of this Fleet is not something you need to worry about.
cpt_lee_adama You owe the people a response.
president_laura_roslin I owe the people?
cpt_lee_adama Thats what I believe.
president_laura_roslin What if suddenly all your beliefs were called into question?
cpt_lee_adama Madam President...
president_laura_roslin -- Up is down. Black is white. Scripture is fiction. Home is thin air, instead of solid ground. Et cetera.
cpt_lee_adama You know, Im really sorry for everything youve had to endure.
cpt_lee_adama I really am. But the people, they deserve a response.
president_laura_roslin Do they?
cpt_lee_adama Is there any truth to this broadcast?
president_laura_roslin And what would you do if I told you the truth? What if it were you instead of me, and all thats left of humanity has just been told that you are sharing visions with the enemy? What would you do, Mr. Adama? Would you think that the Gods were testing you?
cpt_lee_adama So Baltar is telling the truth?
cpt_lee_adama Is it true?
president_laura_roslin ...Yes.
lt_sharon_valerii Demetrius reports their sys ops will be synced with ours in five minutes.
captain_kara_thrace When you came knocking with that Raider and asked for our help, you gave away the future of all the Cylons aboard this ship. You know that, right?
leoben_conoy I gave it to the right person.
captain_kara_thrace Save it. No guarantees. When we meet up with the Colonial Fleet, I dont know if theyll feed you or frak you, all right?
captain_kara_thrace Since youve been calling the plays up till now, Im assuming youre doing the talking?
captain_kara_thrace Good. Gods help us.
lt_sharon_valerii Sys ops of both vessels are synced. Were as ready as were ever gonna be.
captain_kara_thrace Good. Tell the Demetrius to set the board to green. Unless both ships jump in together, Galactica will blow us out of the sky.
lt_sharon_valerii Demetrius, Athena. Set your board to green.
captain_karl_agathon Athena, Demetrius. Starting to green. Lets round the horn, guys. Sublight.
ensign_diana_seelix Go.
captain_karl_agathon Helm.
Pike#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode07 Go.
captain_karl_agathon Tactical.
ensign_diana_seelix Go.
captain_karl_agathon Nav.
ensign_diana_seelix Go.
captain_karl_agathon FTL.
ensign_diana_seelix Spun up. Go.
captain_karl_agathon Athena, Demetrius. Board is green.
number_six I was just thinking how beautiful she must be. Your daughter, Hera.
lt_sharon_valerii How do you know her name?
number_six We all know her name. You were blessed.
captain_kara_thrace All right, everyone. Lets go home.
lt_sharon_valerii Demetrius, Athena. Execute jump. Clock is running. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2. Jump.
ensign_diana_seelix Sir, we had a problem with the sync points and the jump coordinates. Itll take a few minutes to spool up the FTL drive again.
captain_karl_agathon Godsdamn it!
admiral_william_adama All hands. Battle stations! Set Condition One throughout the fleet!
colonel_saul_tigh Launch alert five. Get me some more frakkin birds in the air! Gun batteries stand by for target bearing!
lt_sharon_valerii Demetrius, Athena. Report. Demetrius, Athena. Report.
officer_anastasia_dualla Baseship bearing 333 carom 498 at 15msu.
colonel_saul_tigh Frakkin thing is sitting right on top of us.
admiral_william_adama Mr. Hoshi, order the Fleet to make an emergency jump!
lt_louis_hoshi all Colonial vessels jump immediately to emergency rendezvous coordinates... Sir, the Presidents shuttle is en route.
admiral_william_adama Tell them to land on landing bay one, checkers green.
lt_sharon_valerii Galactica, Athena. Galactica, Athena... Last jump mustve cooked the wireless. Weve got no comm., they cant hear us.
captain_kara_thrace Frak.
lt_sharon_valerii Galacticas scrambling Vipers. Theyre going to shoot us down.
colonel_saul_tigh What the frak?
lt_sharon_valerii Eight Vipers inbound. Entering firing range.
captain_kara_thrace Where the hell is the Demetrius?
ensign_diana_seelix Baseship targeted. Weapons free.
colonel_saul_tigh Something isnt right...
lt_louis_hoshi Gunnery reporting. Firing solution correct. Main battery standing by to fire on your command.
admiral_william_adama On my command. 3, 2, 1...
colonel_saul_tigh Weapons hold!
officer_anastasia_dualla Dradis contact!
captain_karl_agathon Galactica, Demetrius. Do not fire. Baseship is disarmed and under Colonial command. Officers aboard.
officer_anastasia_dualla Demetrius, Galactica. Authenticate.
captain_karl_agathon Galactica, Demetrius. I authenticate, bravo tango 8. Do not fire. Starbuck and Athena have control of the Baseship.
colonel_saul_tigh Move, move, move!
captain_kara_thrace Colonel, theyre with me.
colonel_saul_tigh Theyre with you?
colonel_saul_tigh So which one of them shot Gaeta?
dr_cottle Lieutenant Gaeta, stay with us. Elevate the leg. Prep an IV. All right, everybody. Stand back. And get a cut down tray in here right now.
number_six we became divided according to models. The Twos, Eights, and Sixes have come to believe that our destiny lies in seeking out the Final Five. The Ones, Fours, and Fives violently opposed such action.
admiral_william_adama We know that there are seven different models of Cylons. You only mentioned six.
lt_sharon_valerii The Threes. The DAnnas? They were boxed after the battle on the Algae Planet.
colonel_saul_tigh Boxed?
number_six Her entire line was punitively deactivated. Her consciousness placed in a boxing facility.
admiral_william_adama Why?
number_six DAnna saw the faces of the Final Five, which was forbidden. But if we unbox her, she can reveal their identities to us.
captain_kara_thrace The Final Five have been to Earth. If we help find them, they can help us get there.
number_six Our ship can heal itself. But most of our Raiders were destroyed in the ambush. Were asking for your help here. We cant do it alone.
president_laura_roslin What could possibly motivate us to trust you now? What have you got?
number_six The boxing facility resides within the Cylon Resurrection Hub. This Hub controls the functions of every Resurrection Ship in existence.
lt_sharon_valerii It protects itself by periodically jumping to a new set of coordinates and then relaying them back to the Baseship.
number_six Madam President, you asked for a reason to help us? Vengeance. You destroy the Hub, Cylons lose their ability to download. All of us.
president_laura_roslin Why would you be willing to lose your ability to resurrect?
number_six Were rebels. We cant go back. What matters most to us is being with the Five. DAnna will be able to identify them. Well take you to the Hub if you help us unbox DAnna.
admiral_william_adama Give us the coordinates of the Hub first.
number_six No, I wont do that. I said we would take you there.
admiral_william_adama Take her out. Were finished.
number_six Wait. Is your word good, Admiral? Ill give you the coordinates. But I want your word.
admiral_william_adama Stand down. You have my word.
number_six Once their identities are revealed and we come back here, well be free to leave your Fleet with the Five?
number_six Yes, theyre here with you. The Final Five are in your Fleet. Thats why our Raiders turned back the attack in the Nebula.
admiral_william_adama The weapons hold. How the frak did you see that?
colonel_saul_tigh To be absolutely honest with you, Bill... I didnt. What can I say? We got lucky.
admiral_william_adama Well, lets get a Raptor up to those coordinates that that Cylon gave us. Maybe we can get lucky again.
colonel_saul_tigh Sir.
admiral_william_adama Tigh? Thank you.
racetrack Lords of Kobol, shield your eyes. Get it with the gun camera. Hit override.
lt_hamish_mccall Kinda pretty, isnt it?
racetrack Tell it to the Fleet.
lt_felix_gaeta No. No. Dont put me under. Please. Just... Just numb everything.
dr_cottle Felix.
lt_felix_gaeta Just do it, I... I dont want to wake up... I dont want to wake up with my leg gone.
dr_cottle Okay, son.
captain_karl_agathon If we go in on our own horse, we wont last five minutes. But we go in with that Baseship parked out there, nobodys gonna notice us for awhile.
colonel_saul_tigh What do we fight with? Their Raiders are frakked.
captain_karl_agathon We dont use theirs. We use ours. Take half the Viper wing.
admiral_william_adama Half the wing?
captain_karl_agathon Yeah. Well sneak them in on the rebel Baseship. Hoshi did some calculations from Racetracks photos. We take out the FTL and the Hubs stranded.
colonel_saul_tigh We blow the Hub and, uh, billions of skin jobs lose their bath privileges.
president_laura_roslin Imagine. Once theyre gone, they cant come back. Mortal enemies.
captain_karl_agathon Before we blow the Hub, we need to get a team in to unbox DAnna.
colonel_saul_tigh Well, now, maybe we just dont. Maybe we just forget the Godsdamn boxing facility.
admiral_william_adama Lie to the rebels?
colonel_saul_tigh Well, theyre lying to us. The skin jobs said their Raiders wont fight because the Final Five is here? We tangled with those slit-eyed black bastards for three years now, and they havent turned back before. Why now?
captain_karl_agathon What if theyre telling the truth? What if the Final Five are here?
admiral_william_adama The Five could know the way to Earth.
president_laura_roslin If they do, theyre not gonna lead us there after weve just destroyed their resurrection capacity.
admiral_william_adama Maybe theyre different, like the rebels.
president_laura_roslin What if theyre not? What if their sole purpose is to destroy us?
colonel_saul_tigh I say we blow the whole Godsdamn thing to dust, lock, stock, and barrel, and trust the Presidents vision. Her scriptures, her way to Earth.
president_laura_roslin Why dont we split the difference? Unbox DAnna and find the Five. Keep the Five till we get to Earth, turn them over to the rebels. Theyve waited this long. Itll be on our terms. ...Its all pie in the sky, gentlemen, until we know whats true and whats not.
admiral_william_adama And we put a lid on it. The real plan stays in this room. If the plan gets leaked to the Cylons, all bets are off. Have someone escort the rebel leader back to her Baseship so she can inform her people they have a deal.
tom_zarek In thirty-six hours, the Colonies will unite forces with insurgent rebel Cylons and their leader in an unprecedented joint military operation to destroy the Cylons ability to download into... Blah blah blah. Why werent we consulted?
cpt_lee_adama Im sorry. Im in the dark as much as all of you...
chief_galen_tyrol You know, if they unbox the DAnnas, at least well find out who the fifth one is.
colonel_saul_tigh All thats gonna do is crowd the airlock a little more. Do you think theyre gonna give you a medal when they find out who you are?
tory_foster what about you?
samuel_anders He sings, you know.
chief_galen_tyrol ...What?
samuel_anders Gaeta. Whenever he feels the tingling, whenever he feels his phantom leg. Cottle says it helps him get through it. He sings.
tory_foster Good morning.
president_laura_roslin Morning. What is it about the Galactica that gives you such a glow? I come over here, its like Im going from one dungeon to the next.
tory_foster Oh, I hadnt noticed. But thank you.
president_laura_roslin You ready?
tory_foster Yes.
president_laura_roslin I want you to find out whos behind the shared vision rumors. Whos talking to him?
tory_foster With Baltar?
president_laura_roslin Youre sleeping with him, right?
president_laura_roslin Dont.
president_laura_roslin Ive just been informed that youve been spotted down there enough times to be a charter member of his nymph squad.
tory_foster All right. I have come to believe in Baltars spiritual message. I dont know how or why. It just happened. I wish you knew how many times I wanted to tell you. Your friendship and your trust means...
president_laura_roslin -- Frak. Clearly my friendship and trust mean frak. And I dont really care if you have to spend the night on your knees praying, or just on your knees. I want a name. I want to know whos responsible for these lies.
tory_foster Madam President. Laura. I am so sorry.
president_laura_roslin You have a job to do.
number_six The humans are never going to allow us to have the Final Five and go our own way.
Eight#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode07 Are you sure of this?
number_six Not entirely. Id rather be wrong. But we need insurance.
leoben_conoy Trust has to begin somewhere.
number_six Not with us. Its our ship. When we jump, we take control of it with the Centurions. We carry out the mission as promised. But when we return, we take hostages. The humans on this ship stay on this ship until we have the Five.
number_six Look at me. Weve changed, but the humans havent. Weve come too far to risk everything on their trust.
lt_felix_gaeta Alone she sleeps, in the shirt of man / With my three wishes clutched in her hand / The first that she be spared the pain / That comes from a dark and laughing rain / When she finds love, may it always stay true ...
president_laura_roslin What a way to discover such a beautiful voice, huh? Howd you find me?
cpt_lee_adama Your Chief of Staff.
president_laura_roslin ...Needs to be horsewhipped. If you came down here to kiss my ass to get information, save your breath.
cpt_lee_adama The Quorums considering a vote of no confidence against you.
president_laura_roslin I wont compromise the success of this operation or the safety of this Fleet to indulge the neediness of twelve perpetually unhappy representatives. I cant.
cpt_lee_adama I was with them on the, uh, emergency jump. And I saw something in the faces of the Delegates. It wasnt anxiety from waiting, it went beyond that. I was anxious, it was my first time, but they... They were empty. The Quorum had given up. And then it struck me that after going through the same routine so many times, it was the only way that they could cope with the uncertainty. To presume the worst.
president_laura_roslin You felt their suffering. Now try holding their lives in balance every day.
cpt_lee_adama Talk to them. You dont have to tell them everything, I know how it works. Just talk to the Quorum. Let them put a face to this joint mission, let them hear from the Cylon leader, anything. Anything to put their fears to rest.
dr_gaius_baltar Whats the matter?
tory_foster Nothing.
dr_gaius_baltar No, nothing. Nothing at all. Weve been lying here doing nothing. What?
tory_foster Youve been lying about the President sharing visions with Cylons.
dr_gaius_baltar That happens to be the Gods honest truth.
tory_foster Sorry. I cant accept what youve done.
dr_gaius_baltar What... What Ive done? What have I...? What are... Wheres this coming from?
tory_foster These rumors youve started. Ive seen what theyve done to her.
dr_gaius_baltar You seriously believe that Im making all this up? I am not saying Im not capable, but why would I? Six revealed... Caprica Six revealed them to me, through my attorney in the last days of my trial, when a guilty verdict was a certainty. I suppose I couldve gone public. Caused a stir...
tory_foster And all this time you kept quiet?
dr_gaius_baltar Im not saying Im a saint, Tory. Im many things, but I try not to be spiteful. Got no bloodlust to go get her. But shes a hypocrite. The lies, the secret missions. Co-opting the rhetoric of patriotism to keep everyone in the dark, including you. Thats rather worrying, isnt it? So I had to speak. The truth is, no good ever comes from concealing it.
dr_gaius_baltar Ive got a broadcast.
lt_felix_gaeta The first that she be spared the pain / That comes from a dark and laughing rain ...
lt_felix_gaeta When she finds love may it always stay true / This I beg for the second wish I made too ...
president_laura_roslin I didnt come here to beg, or plead, or apologize, or to keep my job. You know me better than that. And I didnt come here to create sympathy by parading my illness in front of you. On the contrary, there are some that probably believe that along with my cancer drugs, I have inoculated myself against compassion.
president_laura_roslin That is a joke.
president_laura_roslin ...I am here because I want to tell you face to face that I believe in this mission and what it means for our future. Im here to profess my trust in our new allies. Im here to ask you to listen, Im here to ask for your support. Bring her in.
number_six In our civil war, weve seen death. Weve watched our people die. Gone forever. As terrible as it was, beyond the reach of the Resurrection Ships, something began to change. We could feel a sense of time, as if each moment held its own significance. We began to realize that for our existence to hold any value, it must end. To live meaningful lives, we must die and not return. The one human flaw that you spend your lifetimes distressing over, mortality, is the one thing... Well, its the one thing that makes you whole. I believe it was no accident that we were found by Kara Thrace. It was destiny...
number_six She asked me to lead my people, and I accepted. No matter what the sacrifice, even if it should mean my death...
Hybrid_in_Karas_memory#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode07 Thus shall it come to pass. The dying leader shall know the truth of the Opera House. You are the harbinger of death, Kara Thrace.
number_six ...Our destiny, our future, begins here. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak.
admiral_william_adama Take her out.
lt_felix_gaeta But wish no more / My life you can take / To have her please just one day wake / To have her please ...
lt_felix_gaeta Alone she sleeps, in the shirt of man / With my three wishes clutched in her hand ...
president_laura_roslin Hera!
lt_sharon_valerii Hera! Hera.
hera_agathon Bye-bye!
president_laura_roslin I gotta hand it to you. If you are a Cylon, that was a great plan. Dangle yet another way to Earth, throw in the Hub, the Final Five, and the real kicker, put the Final Five on the Fleet. Even I couldnt pass that one up.
captain_kara_thrace You are having those visions, arent you?
captain_kara_thrace Thus shall it come to pass. The dying leader shall know the truth of the Opera House...
president_laura_roslin -- What did you say?
captain_kara_thrace Thus shall it come to pass...
president_laura_roslin The Opera House.
captain_kara_thrace The dying leader shall know the truth of the Opera House.
president_laura_roslin Where did... Where did you hear that? Who told you that?
captain_kara_thrace The Hybrid on the Baseship, before they unplugged it.
president_laura_roslin The Hybrid... How does the Hybrid know whats in my dream?
captain_kara_thrace I wish I knew.
president_laura_roslin This has got to stop. These visions, Ive got to find out about these visions. Ive got to know. Will you help me?
captain_kara_thrace Yes.
president_laura_roslin Find Captain Agathon.
number_six When I spoke to the Quorum, I could feel it. The contempt.
leoben_conoy You were right. Theyre not ready to trust us.
number_six No, I was wrong. Were not ready. Were deceiving them.
Eight#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode07 For protection. For necessity.
number_six Out of suspicion and fear. Why havent the Final Five come forward? What if theyre watching, judging us on our actions? Were about to resort to violence and coercion. What if they refuse to come with us? We cant do this.
leoben_conoy Its too late.
number_six We have to order the Centurions to stand down.
leoben_conoy Its too late. Theyre committed.
number_six Then we have to tell the humans the truth.
Eight_horrified#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode07 No, you cant do that. Theyll never trust us again. They already know the coordinates. Theyll just go destroy everything.
leoben_conoy Go. Stall for time. Talk to Adama. Tell him anything. Anything but the truth. Ill deal with the Centurions.
dr_gaius_baltar Of course.
president_laura_roslin Have a seat. Were going to settle this now.
dr_gaius_baltar Whats to settle? Your Chief of Staff is ... incomparably talented.
president_laura_roslin Ive been sharing visions with Sharon Agathon and the Six.
dr_gaius_baltar So I was only speaking the truth.
president_laura_roslin Yes. The Hybrid on the Baseship spoke of an Opera House and a dying leader. Were going to talk to the Hybrid.
dr_gaius_baltar And why would you require my presence?
president_laura_roslin Because youre in my visions.
lt_sharon_valerii What are you doing, baby? Are you drawing? Can I see what you drew?
lt_sharon_valerii Oh, no. No! No! No! Why? Why? Why?
lt_sharon_valerii Hera? Hera? Hera!
ensign_diana_seelix Raptor 124, you are cleared for landing...
lt_sharon_valerii Hera!
lt_sharon_valerii Hera. Hera! Have you seen my daughter?
officer_anastasia_dualla No, I havent.
lt_sharon_valerii Hera! Hera!
lt_sharon_valerii Hera! Hera! Hera!
lt_sharon_valerii I cant find Hera...
lt_sharon_valerii Hera! Get away from my child. Get your hands off of my child.
colonel_saul_tigh Athena...
lt_sharon_valerii Stay back! Stay away.
colonel_saul_tigh Stand down!
president_laura_roslin Plug it in. I need to talk to it.
dr_gaius_baltar Let Gods will be done.
president_laura_roslin Shut up. Its time to get some answers.
lt_sharon_valerii Tyrol, will you come in here and take Hera, please?
colonel_saul_tigh Just do it, Tyrol.
lt_sharon_valerii Is she gone?
chief_galen_tyrol Yeah.
lt_sharon_valerii You are never gonna take my child.
number_six We didnt come here to.
the_hybrid Jump!
lt_felix_gaeta To have her please / Just one day wake / To have her please / Just one day wake...
