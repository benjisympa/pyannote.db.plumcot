captain_kara_thrace Thus shall it come to pass. The dying leader shall know the truth of the Opera House...
president_laura_roslin Where did you hear that, who told you that?
captain_kara_thrace The Hybrid. On the baseship, before they unplugged it.
president_laura_roslin Ive got to find out about these visions.
president_laura_roslin Plug it in. Its time to get some answers.
lt_sharon_valerii Can I see what you drew?
lt_sharon_valerii Hera?
Hybrid#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode08 Jump!
dr_cottle Quickly. All right, on three. One, two three, lift. Keep some pressure on that wound until I can get to the artery. Mask on.
Geminon#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode08 Baltar? I heard Baltar was with her!
speaking_delegate_1 Are you saying hes responsible?
speaking_delegate_2 I heard it was the Cylons.
Sagittaron#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode08 No. My people say she was shot.
speaking_delegate_2 What are you talking about? Roslin?
Sagittaron#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode08 No, one of Adamas Marines shot a Cylon, and that is how this entire thing has begun.
speaking_delegate_1 So then where is Zarek?
Sagittaron#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode08 I dont know!
speaking_delegate_1 Where is Zarek?
officer_anastasia_dualla Sir, Vice President Zarek is still waiting to talk to you. What should I tell him? ...Sir?
colonel_saul_tigh Decker said theyve just shipped over the last of the Vipers, means were down forty birds, almost as many jocks. Were gonna have to reconfigure the CAP, rethink our defense posture.
admiral_william_adama Where is she?
colonel_saul_tigh Marines are holding her.
admiral_william_adama My quarters.
speaking_delegate_1 Nobody has told us anything... (
tom_zarek Thank you. Just calm down, please. Everybody! Everybody just calm down, please.
speaking_delegate_2 Mr. Vice President, its really important that we know. Is the President dead?
tom_zarek We... We have no information...
Geminon#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode08 I heard she was assassinated by the Cylons...
tom_zarek No, there is no truth to that, at least as far as we know.
speaking_delegate_2 Then what the hell do we know?
tom_zarek Clearly, our first priority is to get out as much verifiable information as we can to avoid exaggeration... (
speaking_delegate_1 At this time, when...
tom_zarek However... However... Please. Please, just a moment.
tom_zarek President Roslin was apparently aboard the Cylon baseship, along with Gaius Baltar and many of Galacticas pilots when it jumped away, after one of their own leaders was shot aboard Galactica. We have no idea when or if theyll return, or if the President or the other captives will be subject to reprisals.
tom_zarek For now, by the powers granted me by law, I have taken over as President.
admiral_william_adama Their suspicions dont concern me.
cpt_lee_adama Look, maybe hes not the man we hoped for, but he is next in line, and the Fleet needs reassurance and stability. Exactly the kind that only its military commander can offer.
admiral_william_adama If this Fleet needs reassurance, then you reassure them. Thats your job now. You can tell Zarek he can go to hell. (
lt_sharon_valerii Sir?
admiral_william_adama Do you hate your people so much that you look for any excuse to kill one? Or did you deliberately try to sabotage this truce.
lt_sharon_valerii No sir, of course not.
admiral_william_adama Then you tell me why. You make me understand why you did this.
admiral_william_adama There were too many witnesses. They all said the same thing. Your daughter was lost. The Cylon merely kneeled down, was talking to her.
lt_sharon_valerii Maybe thats what it looked like to the others, sir. But I know.
admiral_william_adama Oh, you knew better.
lt_sharon_valerii I had a vision, a vision where the Six and Baltar were taking Hera away from me.
lt_sharon_valerii It was more than just a vision, sir. When I saw them together, I knew that they would take her, that they would take away my child!
admiral_william_adama You murdered an unarmed woman. And by doing so you put the lives of every single person in this Fleet at risk. And quite possibly cost the lives of the President and your husband. You disobeyed the direct orders of a superior officer, but more importantly, you betrayed a promise to me. I trusted you.
admiral_william_adama Im afraid the brig is no place for a little girl. Guards! Get her out of my sight.
Marine#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode08 Yes, sir.
speaking_delegate_1 At one time, Admiral Adama supported Gaius Baltars administration. Isnt there a chance hed support yours?
tom_zarek Im afraid only Admiral Adama can answer that.
Sagittaron#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode08 Then I will address this question to Delegate Adama. Do you honestly think that your father will hand over power to this administration?
cpt_lee_adama ...No.
admiral_william_adama They were determined to resurrect the Three. What we used to call DAnna. To do that, they gotta go to the Hub. We find it, well find them.
colonel_saul_tigh Ah, easier said than done.
admiral_william_adama Maybe.
colonel_saul_tigh We got another problem, sir. Starbucks having trouble fielding enough planes to fly a standard CAP. Wants us to consider having the Fleet bunch up tighter, so its easier to defend.
admiral_william_adama Means counting on a bunch of civvies flying close formation.
colonel_saul_tigh Yeah.
admiral_william_adama Organize it.
tom_zarek I got you appointed to this job. Pulled strings, called in favors, all because I thought you might do some good. Now youre advising me to step aside from a position that by law is mine. A position I was elected to.
cpt_lee_adama But you were never elected President.
tom_zarek But I was. Elected. to office! Which is more. than Roslin. can claim. Why do you think she kept me on in the first place? To thank me for rolling over? No. No, to help legitimize her coup.
cpt_lee_adama In the military, we used to talk about facts on the ground. Well, the facts on the ground are these. Right or wrong, Adama will never recognize you as President, and we need someone he will. Now the Quorum has a legal authority to appoint an interim President in a time of crisis.
tom_zarek And I suppose .you have someone .in mind?
cpt_lee_adama No. No, not yet. Which is why we need to form a search committee and start looking for a candidate as soon as possible.
tom_zarek Well. Good luck with that.
tom_zarek Lets face facts here. What we had these past five years isnt a true government, but a tacit agreement between a military strongman and a political strongwoman to rule together by fiat.
McManus#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode08 Ive heard you asked the Quorum to authorize the creation of a civil defense force?
tom_zarek After what happened during the last military coup, we dont wanna depend on Galacticas Marines to guarantee our safety...
romo_lampkin Lampkins first rule of legal dynamics. When an irresistible force meets a movable object, stand aside and wait for the class action suit.
cpt_lee_adama Except Im not sure if its to anyones benefit if we just sit around, waiting to pick up the pieces. This things heading for a showdown. Theres gonna be bloodshed, unless...
romo_lampkin -- Unless you can find someone else. Someone your father wont reject, someone the Quorum would approve of, someone to take Tom Zareks place as interim President until the next round of elections. Dont take the case, Counselor. Its a loser.
cpt_lee_adama I have to. We have to. No one on the Quorum is going to lift a finger. Zareks got them inhaling fear and exhaling anger. But you have taken the pulse of the Fleet and you know character. And frankly, you need a reason to get out of this room. Unless you want to start discussing whats been keeping you here.
romo_lampkin So you wont be dissuaded, will you? Not even when you hear my fee?
romo_lampkin Appearance is to the contrary, Im actually in this for the money. I have a reputation to maintain after all.
cpt_lee_adama Okay, so what did Roslin offer you to defend Baltar?
cpt_lee_adama Im not sure I can improve on that.
romo_lampkin Then pro bono it is, counselor. Word to the wise? Sometimes its better to settle for what youve already got.
admiral_william_adama Colonel Tigh. I understand youve developed a relationship with the Cylon prisoner.
colonel_saul_tigh Thats not the word Id use, but she has been more cooperative.
admiral_william_adama See if shell tell you anything about the Hub.
number_six Im sure the others have told you.
colonel_saul_tigh You tell me.
number_six Only our Hybrids can locate it. And then only after it completes a jump. Even they cant anticipate where its going.
colonel_saul_tigh Youre holding back something, I know it. Youre lying.
number_six I have never lied to you, Saul. Why dont you trust me now?
colonel_saul_tigh Because there are too many lives at stake, lady. Your buddies took off with half an air wing, not to mention the President of the frakking Colonies herself.
number_six Shes the real reason youre so angry, so worried. I can hear it in your voice. Why is a dying woman so important to you?
colonel_saul_tigh Not to me, Godsdammit, to the old man.
number_six Saul. (
colonel_saul_tigh What?
ellen_tigh Be honest with me. Ive been honest with you.
colonel_saul_tigh I dont believe this. Youre asking me if...
admiral_william_adama One of our missing Raptors jumped into dradis range.
colonel_saul_tigh We sure its ours?
admiral_william_adama Transponder checks out, its one of the Raptors that boarded the rebel Baseship. No radiological signature. Racetrack and Skulls are on their way to intercept.
racetrack Actual, Racetrack. Im eyeballing our bird now. Looks shot to hell, venting fuel and O2. Still no response to hails.
racetrack I cant see a fracking thing from here. Skulls, take the wheel, Im going for a walk.
racetrack Decompression check okay. Opening hatch. Safety line secure. Moving toward the Raptor. I see major damage to the canopy. Looks empty inside. I have the hatch open but its stuck. Grav fields off. Its Pike. Hes dead.
admiral_william_adama This is the shuttle she took over to the Baseship.
colonel_saul_tigh Laird was able to salvage the flight data recorder, puts the originating jump point deep. Sector delta 9... President Zarek called again. He heard about the Raptor, and hes waiting to be briefed.
admiral_william_adama Recall the CAP. Spin up the FTLs.
colonel_saul_tigh What about the Fleet?
admiral_william_adama Lets go.
romo_lampkin We are essentially looking for an understudy. Quandary is, one doesnt generally get the chance to wield political power without the ambition to actively seek it. (
cpt_lee_adama Roslin never sought power.
romo_lampkin Exception that proves the rule. One could argue that Laura Roslin is a study in repressed ambition. Just like you, Mr. Adama. Never seeking out a job until its handed to you? Flight leader, Battlestar Commander, Quorum Delegate... A man doesnt carve out a path like that through life without...
cpt_lee_adama -- All right, enough of this psychoanalysis. Lets get back to the job in hand.
cpt_lee_adama What? (
racetrack Galactica, Racetrack. Weve located the source of the transponder.
lt_hamish_mccall Its Sandmans Viper all right, but theres no Sandman.
Tigh_on_CIC#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode08 Affirmative. Keep searching. (
colonel_saul_tigh Oh, Bill. You are way too close to this. The Presidents Baseship was destroyed.
Bill#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode08 Its a different Baseship. Well search every square inch of this debris field until we come up with a clue.
colonel_saul_tigh What, and leave the rest of the Fleet back there with their asses hanging in the wind?
admiral_william_adama Detail four Raptors to stay behind. They keep searching until they find something concrete. Give my order.
speaking_delegate_1 People, listen up. What are we gonna do here? Theyve left 39,000 lives completely undefended...
tom_zarek All right, everybody. Gather round please. Gather round.
picon_delegate Uh, Mr. President...
tom_zarek -- Please, Please, please. Im sorry, Admiral Adama will not be coming to answer your questions. I did learn however, that hes contacted the Fleets Captains, to inform them that several of their ships will be requisitioned to expand the search for Laura Roslin and the missing Baseship, while all tylium shipments will be diverted to support that mission.
picon_delegate Hes bypassing us completely!
tom_zarek I understand, I understand, were doing the best... I understand. Were trying to get through communications...
picon_delegate That is unconscionable! Completely!
picon_delegate That is nothing short of...
cpt_lee_adama Captain Franks?
romo_lampkin I was impressed by her gravitas during her attorneys judge in the Baltar trial. That and her vote, naturally.
cpt_lee_adama Yeah. Shes already been approached to run for office. No interest in politics.
romo_lampkin Sadly, now she really impresses me.
cpt_lee_adama Come on, Romo. Lets put our heads together. Who would Adama respect as President?
romo_lampkin This ones a loser. An exercise in futility.
admiral_william_adama Hows this gonna affect the President? The break in her treatment.
dr_cottle Assuming no other changes in her circumstances?
dr_cottle Well, diloxin really kicks your ass, so she actually might feel better at first. But any break gives the cancer a chance to regroup, makes it that much harder to beat it back. Plus shes taken a hit to her immune system so shell be vulnerable to infections.
dr_cottle Well, lets just say that the sooner you get her back here, the better her chances are. And while youre digesting that, I have some other news. I ran some tests on your Cylon prisoner. Guess what I found.
colonel_saul_tigh Raptors are due back in a few hours. Granted, if theyd found anything, we would have heard from them by now. Still, once we correlate their reports...
colonel_saul_tigh Youre not?
admiral_william_adama I know that youve been spending a lot of time interrogating the Six. But now the brig guards tell me that every time, you order them out, and you turn off the cameras.
colonel_saul_tigh Im not torturing her, if thats what youre worried about.
admiral_william_adama Im not. That I could almost understand. This I cant. Cottle tells me shes pregnant. ...What the frak have you been thinking, Colonel? Do you deny it? You dont. You cant! What the hell have you been thinking? Who was interrogating whom? How many of our secrets have you told this thing?
admiral_william_adama Your loyalty? I need more than your loyalty. Youre my first officer, I need judgment. I need your competence. Im through jeopardizing this ship, putting it at risk because of your weaknesses.
colonel_saul_tigh My weaknesses?
admiral_william_adama Yeah, your weaknesses!
colonel_saul_tigh Youre risking all our lives, for what? Our missing pilots? No, for a woman! For a frakkin woman!
admiral_william_adama You watch what you frakking say about that woman! Shes the President, not some frakking skinjob that Ive been banging. What do you think Ellen would say about this?
colonel_saul_tigh Leave Ellen out of this.
admiral_william_adama What do you think Ellen would say about her husband impregnating a frakking Cylon prisoner?
colonel_saul_tigh You motherfrakker!
admiral_william_adama You know how many times Ive had to repair this thing? ...What are you gonna do with that woman?
colonel_saul_tigh What are you gonna do about Laura? If you ever find her?
admiral_william_adama I dont know.
admiral_william_adama Have the Raptors and the civilian ships begin the search from Phantoms last known position. (
captain_kara_thrace Sir, respectfully... Ive already got two missing pilots and hardly enough birds left to protect this Fleet. Now youre asking me to send the remainder of the Raptors out on a blind search, looking for a ship that very well may have been destroyed. My people are gonna feel like theyre being asked to go on suicide missions.
admiral_william_adama Im not asking. Youre dismissed, Captain.
romo_lampkin Admiral Adama?
admiral_william_adama Mr. Lampkin, what are you doing here?
romo_lampkin Writs of forfeiture for the ships youre borrowing. The captains want to be absolved of any blame should anything untoward happen. One of the less ennobling consequences of a legal culture, no one wants responsibility. Lee said you once gave him something before a mission. A lighter, was it?
romo_lampkin And yet thats what we do, isnt it? Hang on to hope, in every hopelessly irrational way that we can. But not like those poor bastards, giving away their luck, just when they need it most. Its like theyve given up.
admiral_william_adama If youve never been in combat, you have no idea what theyre thinking.
romo_lampkin I always imagined you a realist, Admiral. Not one to indulge a vain hope at the cost of lives. But then, everyone has his limits. Sine qua non, as they say.
admiral_william_adama Without which not.
romo_lampkin Yes. Those things we deem essential, without which we cannot bear living, without which life in general loses its specific value. Becomes abstract.
admiral_william_adama You may have a point, counselor.
romo_lampkin And while Im on a roll... Tom Zarek may not be an ideal President, but we could do worse.
admiral_william_adama Youre right. There are limits to my realism. Goodbye, counselor.
cpt_lee_adama Tell me what?
romo_lampkin We found our candidate. Someone the Quorum wont hesitate to approve, even over Zareks objections. Someone the Admiral cant help but accept.
cpt_lee_adama Yeah? Who?
romo_lampkin Congratulations, Mr. President.
cpt_lee_adama My name was never on that list.
romo_lampkin Of course not! That would be too blatant. But it is everything you always wanted, isnt it? Why you had me cross forty-seven names off that list? Come on, admit it. Savor your victory, Mr. Adama. (
cpt_lee_adama What are you doing?
romo_lampkin Why? Because youre perfect for the job, of course. Because after the vicious aberration that was Baltars presidency, and the bitter disappointment that was Roslins, you are a shining beacon of hope. Only hope is the last thing we need. Were a doomed race, and its time that we made our peace with that essential truth.
romo_lampkin Why? You wanna know why? (
cpt_lee_adama They?
romo_lampkin They! Those debased dregs of humanity out there! That lost tribe in search of a new home, so they can roost and rot again.
romo_lampkin How long?! Its irrelevant, its immaterial! Since it wasnt even my cat!
cpt_lee_adama Romo. Its been dead for weeks.
romo_lampkin It belonged to my wife. Id just retrieved it from a vet on Geminon when the bombs started to fall, and fate presented me with a choice. I could get back on that shuttle or, I could run home and try to save my family. How do you think I chose?
cpt_lee_adama Romo. Weve all had to make difficult choices, you dont think I know? Your wifes name was Faye. You had two daughters, Jennifer and Katie. There were over two hundred passengers on that shuttle, only a handful chose to stay behind. Yeah, thats right. It was in your file when you were handed the job as Baltars counsel. But no one blamed you, Romo. Because at a certain point, we all made decisions that saved our lives at the cost of others. You think youre unique, Romo? Think your sins are so special?
romo_lampkin Is that it, counselor? Youre gonna rest your entire case on that pathetic little bit of insight?
cpt_lee_adama No, on this. The clean slate, the fresh start. Maybe they are illusions, like you said. But at a certain point, faith -- in ourselves, in our right to survive as a species, as a people -- thats not a given, thats a choice. Well, Ive made mine. And if you cant stomach that, then you had damn well better squeeze that trigger right now. Go on. What are you waiting for? Or you can make a choice. Put your past behind you, put the gun down and help me, because Im telling you Im gonna make a difference in this Fleet.
romo_lampkin Is that your final word?
cpt_lee_adama Thats up to you.
romo_lampkin Then swear it.
priestess ...That I take the office of President of the Twelve Colonies of Kobol without any moral reservation or mental evasion.
colonel_saul_tigh This is a frakking joke.
admiral_william_adama Youre the only man I can trust to command this ship.
colonel_saul_tigh Well, maybe youre crazy enough to pull a stunt like this, but you cant be crazy enough to leave me in charge. In case you forgot, my last term at the helm was a complete disaster.
admiral_william_adama That was a long time ago. Youre not the same man you were. Youre not even the same man that came back from New Caprica. Youve found out a lot about yourself, been tested in ways I can barely begin to imagine. Youre ready. Besides, dont count on this being permanent.
colonel_saul_tigh What if it is?
admiral_william_adama Just one. Give Athena back her daughter. She needs her family. We all need our family. Take care of this one.
tory_foster All right, thank you. (
cpt_lee_adama Romo.
cpt_lee_adama Jake here is a genuine hero of the Resistance. Arent you, Jake? Unfortunately, his previous owners had to let him go. Jake, meet Romo. Romo, meet Jake. (
romo_lampkin If theres one thing I hate more than cats, its dogs.
cpt_lee_adama I can use the advice. And as long as he knows hes heard, I think I can trust him.
admiral_william_adama Dont know if I agree with your thinking, but...
cpt_lee_adama Well, I could say the same thing about yours.
admiral_william_adama The only difference is, you are gonna be President. Im just getting in a plane.
cpt_lee_adama Waiting alone in a Raptor, while the rest of the Fleet jumps away, thats not just getting in a plane. That... That sounds a lot like... Well, that sounds a lot like suicide, Dad.
admiral_william_adama At least this time Im only risking my own neck.
admiral_william_adama I dont know if I ever told you this, but one of my first missions was a solo recon. Being alone in a Raptor in enemy space... Im not going to lie to you, I was scared. I told myself that I was doing my duty, and ultimately I faced my fear. Thats a good memory.
cpt_lee_adama Why are you doing this?
admiral_william_adama Because I cant live without her. And Laura is gonna get to the rendezvous point. I have to believe that.
captain_kara_thrace Admiral.
cpt_lee_adama Admiral.
admiral_william_adama What do you hear, Starbuck?
captain_kara_thrace Nothing but the rain, sir.
admiral_william_adama Grab your gun and bring the cat in.
captain_kara_thrace Yes, sir.
admiral_william_adama Keep a light on. Ill be back.
captain_kara_thrace You can count on it.
admiral_william_adama Galactica, this is Husker. Im in position.
colonel_saul_tigh Affirmative, Husker. (
