Roslin Previously on Battlestar Galactica...
Athena_in_VO_at_debrief The Threes, the DAnnas? They were boxed after the battle on the Algae Planet.
Adama_VO Why?
Natalie_VO DAnna saw the faces of the Final Five... But if we unbox her, she can reveal their identities to us.
Starbuck The Final Five have been to Earth. If we help find them, they can help us get there.
Roslin So what could possibly motivate us to trust you now?
Natalie The boxing facility resides within the Cylon Resurrection Hub. This Hub controls the functions of every Resurrection Ship. You destroy the Hub, Cylons lose their ability to download.
Roslin The Hybrid on the Baseship spoke of an Opera House and a dying leader. Were going to talk to the Hybrid.
Baltar And why would you require my presence?
Roslin Because youre in my visions.
Zarek_VO President Roslin was apparently aboard the Cylon Baseship, along with Gaius Baltar and many of Galacticas pilots when it jumped away.
Tigh Hubs gone. Were getting radiation signatures from multiple nukes. Baseship fragments. The Presidents Baseship was destroyed.
Adama Its a different Baseship.
Lee_VO Waiting alone in a Raptor as the rest of the Fleet jump away, well... That sounds a lot like suicide, Dad. Why are you doing this?
Adama_VO Because I cant live without her.
Roslin Plug it in. I need to talk to it.
Baltar Let Gods will be done.
Roslin Shut up. Its time to get some answers.
Hybrid Jump!
Roslin Elosha! Oh, my Gods.
Hybrid ...Filters ... Filters ... the sublime elevation of the...
Roslin Why did it jump? Where are we?
Eight Im more concerned about why were here.
Hybrid Control... Filters...
Gaius why dont I talk to the Hybrid? Find out why.
Helo She can just do that? She can just...
Hybrid Jump!
Elosha Will you walk with me?
Roslin Galactica, it... Whats going on? Its empty.
Elosha It is. Feels bigger this way, doesnt it?
Roslin Its so quiet. Its strange.
Elosha A lot of things are strange.
Hybrid Wingbeats of a dove drown out the heartbeats of those who follow. The Six is back in the stream...
Eight Thats unusual, to jump again so quickly.
Roslin What do you think it means?
Baltar Look, it knows me. It trusts me. I think... I think it even likes me, because I...
Roslin_fascinated Youre getting information from this liquid?
Baltar I spent some time at the foot of this... Tub.
Eight The Hybrid is disorganized, its panicking. I dont know why.
Baltar Um, tell me. Why are you jumping the ship?
Hybrid The Six, the Six who went among the makers is no longer. End of line. Back in the stream that feeds the ocean that feeds the stream...
Eight The Six. She means Natalie, the Six who was our leader. Shes either been hurt or killed back on Galactica. Thats why the Hybrids panicking.
Roslin So shes upset. Okay, fine. Can you... Calm her down? Can you tell her to jump back?
Eight It doesnt work like that. She makes her own decisions. And we cant unplug her because now shes wired herself into life support.
Baltar_kneeling_and_shushing_her All right, then why dont we give this a go? Shh! Hey. Hey, stop jumping the ship, all right? Calm your mind.
Hybrid Cease countdown, cease countdown. Circulation, ventilation, control... Filters...filters... the sublime elevation ...
Baltar Did you see that? I just opened myself up to it on a spiritual level...
Hybrid -- Jump!
Elosha_to_the_body Dont you just hate these people?
Dying_Roslin No.
Elosha Oh, but you dont love them either. The people in this room are the closest thing youve got to family, and you... Youve been their President. Watch them try to comfort each other. At least you havent taken that away from them... Yet. You didnt rob them of their empathy. Yet. You just dont make room for people anymore. You dont love people. Is that clear enough? Practical enough for you, Madam President?
Eight_smiling I think were going towards the Resurrection Hub. I think the mission is still on.
Helo You sure theres no ETA at the Hub?
Eight No, the Hub is jumping and our Hybrids jumping after it. Sometimes were showing up six hours after its moved on, sometimes like six minutes.
Helo And one time itll be within one jump-length and well catch it.
Eight Yeah, but we dont know when. So well have to assume that any jump could be the one that just drops us in next to it.
Helo Theyre gonna read our heat signatures the second we fire up the first Viper. Hell, theyll read our electronics.
Eight Yeah, if we could only mask that.
Helo ...Go in cold. No electronics at all.
Eight Send the Vipers out dead? towed by Cylon birds.
Helo Take out the Hubs jump drive, then settle in for the long fight. Yeah, good, okay, okay. But you and me, weve got to get onto the Hub in the middle of that mess and try to find DAnna.
Eight We can do this.
Helo No, I... I dont know. Its crazy, isnt it? Were putting ourselves right where the action is. Its not a great plan. Theres no time...
Eight_massaging_his_shoulders Hey, let me help you.
Helo_standing Athena, my wife, she learned to do that. She never did that when I met her. ...What?
Eight_embarrassed I got curious about Athena. About her and Hera, and you. So I accessed her... Her memories from her last download.
Helo You have her memories...
Eight Theyre mine now too. Theyre as real as my own. I know this must feel like a violation of trust or something, but I... I dont want it to be strange, okay?
Helo_not_taking_her_hand Right. Right, sure.
Helo Madam President? Sir? Hope I didnt wake you.
Roslin_setting_the_book_aside Uh, come in. Thank you for the use of your Raptor, I needed some familiar surroundings. Dont worry. Ill give it back to Lt. Pike the second you need it.
Helo About that. This mission, its very risky...
Roslin_knowing_his_stuff If theres even a chance that we can go in and blow up that Hub and end Cylon resurrection for all Cylons forever, we must take it. I cannot back away from that.
Helo Yes, sir.
Roslin If and when DAnna comes back from the dead, bring her to me.
Helo I think the Cylons think that shell be interrogated by both groups together.
Roslin Im sure they do. Bring her to me. She knows the identities of the five Cylons in our Fleet. It is a matter now of human security, and I will not let the Cylons have audience to that discussion. I want to talk to her alone.
Helo Yes, sir.
Roslin Good.
Cavil_as_Three_wakes Welcome home, DAnna.
DAnna You told me Id never have to go through this again.
Cavil I lied.
DAnna You thought you were putting me away forever. So what changed?
Cavil War. A genuine Cylon civil war. Ones and Fours and Fives, against Twos and Sixes and Eights that objected to your retirement. Now your supporters are working with humans against all the rest of us. All in your name.
DAnna Boomers an Eight. Shouldnt she be on the other side?
Cavil Boomers my pet Eight. Shes seen the light of reason. And an Eight can make a passionate ally.
DAnna Oh, until she sees something shiny. Whyd you bring me back anyway?
Cavil I brought you to heal us, sister, and end this shameful war.
Eight Since Cylon pilots dont use call signs, were gonna be painting unique identifiers on all their birds.
Seelix Thats a relief.
Helo You address them, use that number, okay?
Hotdog Shouldve scrubbed this frakkin mission.
Pike Yeah, tell me about it.
Helo Hey, everyone listen up. Now these Heavy Raiders arent like the other Raiders. They arent gonna make any hinky moves on their own. Theyre under the control of their pilots. The Cylon pilots are in charge of their birds.
Seelix Oh, and are there tiny pilots inside of them?
Six We do our jobs. Our training is just as good as yours.
Redwing_fronting Yeah? Twenty-some of you Ive taken out werent that good.
Helo Redwing. Redwing! Now lets talk about the surprise element. First wave of Vipers are gonna ride in engines cold, dradis and comm off, okay? Youre gonna come in towed by cables from the Heavy Raiders. Were rigging em up now.
Pike Captain, dont... Now I mean, if theyre all tied together here, kissing their gasholes so to speak, and they tap on the brakes, were gonna smash right in the back of them.
Helo They wont. Itll work, you guys. Really. When youre close enough, the cables gonna disconnect. Were mounting small explosive charges to cut it.
Redwing Hold it, hold it. We cut the cable, right?
Helo Cylon pilots cut the cable. Then you sling out of their birds and you turn your power on. Youre gonna be gunning directly at the Hubs FTL. Then its an all-out fight until we can get in there with the nukes.
Pike Yeah, so if the Cylons dont lift up, then were toast, right? No, look, Im serious.
Eight Hey, hey! Pilots! Youve flown with Cylons. Youve flown with Athena, you put your life in her hands, and she hasnt betrayed you. Well, I am the same as her. Now all of these Cylons here, all of these people? Theyre pilots like you, and theyre gonna be out in the soup with you, taking out other Cylons, just like Athena does every time shes asked to. And when that Hub is taken out, all of their lives will be at risk. Just like yours. So you might want to think about how youre gonna work together, because were all dead if you dont.
Helo Moving on...
Baltar Just go and ask it already.
Roslin_to_the_Hybrid Ive been told that you said something about an Opera House, and I... Because it seems pointless!
Baltar Look, there was an Opera House. An Opera House. Are you listening to me? Apparently I was in the Opera House.
Roslin I had a vision! I was chasing after a little girl, I came to a door, I saw Dr. Baltar and the Six take the child.
Hybrid ...Close the doors...
Roslin Shes not listening.
Hybrid Protect the child.
Roslin Protect the child. She said, Protect the child. Thats what Caprica said...
Baltar You told me I was the one holding the child, so obviously I was the one protecting the child, wasnt I? In the Opera House...
Roslin No, no, no. It wasnt at all clear what you were doing. Let me listen.
Hybrid Booting up, booting up...
Baltar I mean, obviously youve done this a thousand times before.
Roslin Well, Im just doing the same thing youre doing.
Baltar No youre not, actually, no youre not, because if youll watch what Im doing, what Im doing is Im actually focusing on her, all right? Now tell us what happened in the Opera House now, all right?!
Roslin Oh, the only thing youre doing is yelling.
Hybrid Such a format will close the doors.
Roslin Close the door... No, no, open the door. Open the door. I want to open the door!
Baltar Yeah, open the door, close the door...
Roslin Do it again, do it again, do it again!
Baltar Im going for a walk. Love to see you do any better.
Roslin All right, Ill do it. Open the door!
Hybrid Three! The Three is online.
Roslin The Three is online. The Three is online. The Three is DAnna.
Hybrid Three is online. Processing data.
Roslin The Three is DAnna.
Hybrid Loading data...
Roslin DAnna is online... Oh, DAnnas in a body! Dannas back in a body...
Hybrid Booting up... Jump!
Roslin Ju...? Oh.
Roslin Why are we doing this again? I dont want to see this again.
Elosha The ancients used to say a people is only as strong as the body of its leader.
Roslin If I follow that thought... Are you saying that humanity died because I died? If youre my subconscious, Ive gotta say youre a little full of myself.
Elosha_charmed Humanity didnt die because you did. The ancients, they got a lot of things wrong. The body of a people is not the same as the body of its leader. But the soul and the spirit might be.
Roslin Oh I see, so youre only laying morality at my feet. Well, thats okay. I can take that. I mean, there are a lot of people who have sins far greater than mine.
Elosha_laughing_with_her Youre thinking of Gaius Baltar.
Adama ...Then I dug into the stump and pulled rocks from the ground until my fingers bled. I collected seeds from the few fruits the island offered, and planted them in long, straight furrows, like the ranks of soldiers. When I finished, I looked at what I had done. I did not see a garden. I saw a scar. This island had saved my life, and I had done it no service.
Baltar_to_a_Centurion I can see a real hierarchy around here. And I have to tell you, youre on the lower end of the scale, my friend. Yes you are. Which is odd when you think about the Cylon God... They told you about God, didnt they?
Roslin Im not even really sure if the Hybrid was referring to DAnna, but if its true...
Helo It certainly would make it easier.
Roslin How so?
Helo Well, we... Wouldnt have to find a... Find a body.
Roslin Yeah, good. Okay. Go get her and bring her here. ...Something else?
Helo Its just once you have what she knows, I cant help feeling like you could try to keep Earth for humans only and I just... Madam President, that doesnt seem...
Roslin -- What?
Helo Honest. Youre supposed to be conducting a fair deal here, and instead youre taking DAnna off by yourself. Taking what she knows.
Roslin Slow down, Captain. At best, DAnna knows the identities of the Cylons in our Fleet. And at best, they know a way to Earth.
Helo So youre not denying youd keep the way to Earth to yourself if you could.
Roslin Im not saying thats true. I will say that if the Cylons had the option, thats exactly -- exactly -- what they would do.
Helo No, I dont think so. Not the Sharons. The Eights.
Roslin Captain. You are not married to the entire production line. I cannot afford to be sentimental right now, and I cannot afford you to be sentimental either. If you cant do this job, find me someone who can. What is that?
Helo I think were there.
Boomer Somethings going on. Another Baseship, unscheduled.
Cavil Youve gotta speak to the Twos and Sixes and Eights and tell them theyve gone too far.
Three No. Why didnt you ask about the Final Five? You never ask about them.
Cavil Thats because I dont believe were meant to know them.
Three Well, Ill tell you. I will tell you, Ill start shouting out their names. Why do you risk it?
Cavil Are you going to help end this war or are you useless?
Boomer Twenty-five Heavy Raiders just launched from the new arrival, heading our way.
Seelix_being_towed Come on, lets get this carpool started. Now! Cut the frakkin cable now, you frakkin bastard!
Three Oh, the inhibitions been lifted... Oh, I sense it.
Boomer Its the rebel Baseship. I think theyre gonna attack. Theyre gonna blow the Hub.
Cavil That would be mass murder. Death would be permanent for all of us. Theyve gone insane...
Three Permanent death? Well, that makes this all the more meaningful.
Redwing_on_wireless Helo, weve blown their FTL. That Hubs not going anywhere.
Helo Okay, take us down.
Baltar Well, hes your God as well. And God doesnt want any of his creations to be... Slaves. Not that youre a slave... Exactly...
Helo_with_Eight Go.
Eight This place is gonna go. Grab her.
Helo Run!
Pike Hardball, Pike, Im hit. My attitude control is down, and I cant even program any frakkin ordnance...
Seelix Pike, Hardball. Man, dont jump. Youll never make it to Galactica. You know how many jumps that is?
Pike Look, Im out of here, okay, Im jumping back home.
Eight Karl... Come on, lets go.
Eight Go!
Baltar_with_the_Centurion ...There was this dog, see, and the master had placed a bit of food on the edge of its snout. And the dog had to wait until he was told he could eat it. I know. Pathetic. Pathetic, isnt it?
Roslin Put him over there. Wait. Easy, easy. Easy slim, easy. Okay. Find out whats going on!
Marine Yes sir.
Roslin_bandaging_him Okay.
Baltar Thank you, thank you.
Roslin Good.
Baltar Thank you, thank you. Thank you...
Roslin Okay, wait. Okay. Sorry. You have this, uh... You have this big hole in your hide, as Cottle would say. Okay. All right. Im gonna do this again.
Baltar Thank you.
Roslin Its the least I can do. I think youre gonna live. As usual.
Baltar You know something?
Roslin What?
Baltar Youre very pretty.
Roslin Man, that morpha worked fast.
Baltar Still... Do you know why Im so serene right now?
Roslin_indulging_and_funny Youre doped out of your mind?
Baltar Because I know God. You need God, Laura. Really, youd be a different woman. I know God, therefore I know myself. Truth is... I was harboring the most awful, desperate guilt. A heavy, dark... Unimaginable, soul-breaking guilt. Now its gone. Now its gone, its been transformed. Into ... I have been transformed.
Roslin What was your guilt about?
Baltar I have no guilt.
Roslin What was your guilt about?
Baltar I gave the access codes to the Cylons. They wiped out most of humanity. Of course, I didnt know thats what I was doing at the time, exactly, but thats what I did. And when I realized what I had done, the magnitude... In that moment, I was saved. I was loved. By God. Looking back... I think I was rewarded.
Roslin Rewarded.
Baltar Pythia talks about the flood that wiped out most of humanity. Nobody blames the flood, a flood is a force of nature. Through the flood, mankind is rejuvenated, born again. I was another flood, you see. I blamed myself. I blamed myself. But God made the man who made that choice. God made us all perfect. And in that thought, all my guilt flies away... Flies away, like a bird. I can give you that peace, Laura, that freedom. Pray with me. Pray with me.
Roslin Okay.
Baltar Thank you.
Roslin Okay...
Baltar What are you doing?
Roslin Shh.
Baltar What are you doing?
Roslin Its all right. Youre fine. Shh! Youre fine.
Baltar Dont do this to me. Dont do this to me, please.
Helo_on_wireless We have DAnna onboard. We are clear of the Hub. Commence nuclear strike. Repeat, nuclear strike is a go.
Three And with a whimper, every Cylon in the universe begins to die.
Eight Yes, thats right. And its a good thing, DAnna. Because now theres no difference. We can all start trusting each other.
Baltar Dont do this to me, dont... Dont do this to me. Dont do this to me, please. Please. No.
Roslin_hands_folded_in_prayer_as_he_dies No...
Elosha_over_Lauras_deathbed Im not saying Baltars done more good than harm in the universe. He hasnt. The thing is, the harder it is to recognize someones right to draw breath, the more crucial it is. If humanity is going to prove itself worthy of surviving, it cant do it on a case-by-case basis. A bad man feels his death just as keenly as a good man.
Roslin What do you want from me here?
Adama Laura.
Elosha Just love someone.
Roslin Love. Huh.
Adama You go. You go. You go to your rest now. Im not gonna be selfish anymore. You go. Rest.
Roslin_taking_Baltars_pulse No. No. Please, no. Stop bleeding. Stop the bleeding, stop the bleeding... Oh! Okay, good. Dont go...
Eight All right, weve got get DAnna to the control room...
Helo No, thats not the plan.
Eight What? What plan?
Three Interesting.
Roslin Please dont go, Gaius. Please. I dont know how... All right, put it in...
Helo I have to take her directly to the President. No one else.
Eight That wasnt the deal.
Helo Im just doing what she told me to do, okay?
Three Double-dealing. Its very human. You never got that, Eight.
Roslin No more. No more, dont go. Please dont ... die, live. Please, live. Dont go.
Helo Im not saying I agree. Im saying its my orders.
Eight_backing_away So I pretty much just made a prize fool of myself, didnt I? Trust.
Three Can we go find the President now?
Three Gaius?
Three Gaius, its me...
Helo The Hubs been destroyed.
Roslin Good. Dont let anyone in here. Whatever it takes. Thank you.
Three Hes injured, but I think hes going to survive. I think its gonna be a long time jumping back.
Roslin Ive got time.
Three Is that right? Well, you went to a lot of trouble to bring me here. Deceiving your so-called allies. I suppose youve got some questions for me.
Roslin Yes, I do. Id like to talk about the five Cylons in my Fleet.
Three So you know about the Final Five.
Roslin I know theyre supposed to know the way to Earth.
Three But you dont know that youre one of them?
Three Your face! Oh, its ridiculous! No, look, Im not giving you any names. Not until I feel like Im safe, because information is all I got, sweetie. Im mortal now. In fact, Im the only Three in the whole darn universe. So I gotta worry about protecting myself. Ill tell you who the Final Five are when you take me back to your Fleet. Oh, and by the way, Laura, I wouldve said the same thing if youd have met me with a whole lot of Cylons, because I dont trust anyone right now. So all this deception? Complete waste of time.
Hybrid To remove the pump with the attached hose and wiring, simultaneously release the three tangs while pulling the pump out of the retainer along with the line and wiring...
Roslin ...You lied to me.
Elosha_suddenly_there Did I?
Roslin I thought I was earning humanitys right to survive.
Elosha_laughing Oh! Its not a vending machine, Laura. You dont save a life, and then... Cue the celestial trumpets, heres the way to Earth...
Roslin_grinning -- I know.
Hybrid Jump!
Elosha Disorienting, isnt it? All these little limping steps back.
Roslin I like it. Im used to it. Every jump brings us a little bit closer to home. Galactica. ...My home. Maybe theres something there for me.
Elosha Maybe even closer.
Adama Missed you.
Roslin Me too. ...I love you.
Adama_grinning About time.
