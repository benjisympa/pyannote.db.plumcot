president_laura_roslin Previously on Battlestar Galactica...
Athena_in_VO_at_debrief#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode09 The Threes, the DAnnas? They were boxed after the battle on the Algae Planet.
Adama_VO#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode09 Why?
Natalie_VO#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode09 DAnna saw the faces of the Final Five... But if we unbox her, she can reveal their identities to us.
captain_kara_thrace The Final Five have been to Earth. If we help find them, they can help us get there.
president_laura_roslin So what could possibly motivate us to trust you now?
number_six The boxing facility resides within the Cylon Resurrection Hub. This Hub controls the functions of every Resurrection Ship. You destroy the Hub, Cylons lose their ability to download.
president_laura_roslin The Hybrid on the Baseship spoke of an Opera House and a dying leader. Were going to talk to the Hybrid.
dr_gaius_baltar And why would you require my presence?
president_laura_roslin Because youre in my visions.
Zarek_VO#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode09 President Roslin was apparently aboard the Cylon Baseship, along with Gaius Baltar and many of Galacticas pilots when it jumped away.
Tigh#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode09 Hubs gone. Were getting radiation signatures from multiple nukes. Baseship fragments. The Presidents Baseship was destroyed.
admiral_william_adama Its a different Baseship.
Lee_VO#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode09 Waiting alone in a Raptor as the rest of the Fleet jump away, well... That sounds a lot like suicide, Dad. Why are you doing this?
Adama_VO#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode09 Because I cant live without her.
president_laura_roslin Plug it in. I need to talk to it.
dr_gaius_baltar Let Gods will be done.
president_laura_roslin Shut up. Its time to get some answers.
the_hybrid Jump!
president_laura_roslin Elosha! Oh, my Gods.
the_hybrid ...Filters ... Filters ... the sublime elevation of the...
president_laura_roslin Why did it jump? Where are we?
lt_sharon_valerii Im more concerned about why were here.
the_hybrid Control... Filters...
dr_gaius_baltar why dont I talk to the Hybrid? Find out why.
captain_karl_agathon She can just do that? She can just...
the_hybrid Jump!
elosha Will you walk with me?
president_laura_roslin Galactica, it... Whats going on? Its empty.
elosha It is. Feels bigger this way, doesnt it?
president_laura_roslin Its so quiet. Its strange.
elosha A lot of things are strange.
the_hybrid Wingbeats of a dove drown out the heartbeats of those who follow. The Six is back in the stream...
lt_sharon_valerii Thats unusual, to jump again so quickly.
president_laura_roslin What do you think it means?
dr_gaius_baltar Look, it knows me. It trusts me. I think... I think it even likes me, because I...
president_laura_roslin Youre getting information from this liquid?
dr_gaius_baltar I spent some time at the foot of this... Tub.
lt_sharon_valerii The Hybrid is disorganized, its panicking. I dont know why.
dr_gaius_baltar Um, tell me. Why are you jumping the ship?
the_hybrid The Six, the Six who went among the makers is no longer. End of line. Back in the stream that feeds the ocean that feeds the stream...
lt_sharon_valerii The Six. She means Natalie, the Six who was our leader. Shes either been hurt or killed back on Galactica. Thats why the Hybrids panicking.
president_laura_roslin So shes upset. Okay, fine. Can you... Calm her down? Can you tell her to jump back?
lt_sharon_valerii It doesnt work like that. She makes her own decisions. And we cant unplug her because now shes wired herself into life support.
dr_gaius_baltar All right, then why dont we give this a go? Shh! Hey. Hey, stop jumping the ship, all right? Calm your mind.
the_hybrid Cease countdown, cease countdown. Circulation, ventilation, control... Filters...filters... the sublime elevation ...
dr_gaius_baltar Did you see that? I just opened myself up to it on a spiritual level...
the_hybrid -- Jump!
elosha Dont you just hate these people?
president_laura_roslin No.
elosha Oh, but you dont love them either. The people in this room are the closest thing youve got to family, and you... Youve been their President. Watch them try to comfort each other. At least you havent taken that away from them... Yet. You didnt rob them of their empathy. Yet. You just dont make room for people anymore. You dont love people. Is that clear enough? Practical enough for you, Madam President?
lt_sharon_valerii I think were going towards the Resurrection Hub. I think the mission is still on.
captain_karl_agathon You sure theres no ETA at the Hub?
lt_sharon_valerii No, the Hub is jumping and our Hybrids jumping after it. Sometimes were showing up six hours after its moved on, sometimes like six minutes.
captain_karl_agathon And one time itll be within one jump-length and well catch it.
lt_sharon_valerii Yeah, but we dont know when. So well have to assume that any jump could be the one that just drops us in next to it.
captain_karl_agathon Theyre gonna read our heat signatures the second we fire up the first Viper. Hell, theyll read our electronics.
lt_sharon_valerii Yeah, if we could only mask that.
captain_karl_agathon ...Go in cold. No electronics at all.
lt_sharon_valerii Send the Vipers out dead? towed by Cylon birds.
captain_karl_agathon Take out the Hubs jump drive, then settle in for the long fight. Yeah, good, okay, okay. But you and me, weve got to get onto the Hub in the middle of that mess and try to find DAnna.
lt_sharon_valerii We can do this.
captain_karl_agathon No, I... I dont know. Its crazy, isnt it? Were putting ourselves right where the action is. Its not a great plan. Theres no time...
lt_sharon_valerii Hey, let me help you.
captain_karl_agathon Athena, my wife, she learned to do that. She never did that when I met her. ...What?
lt_sharon_valerii I got curious about Athena. About her and Hera, and you. So I accessed her... Her memories from her last download.
captain_karl_agathon You have her memories...
lt_sharon_valerii Theyre mine now too. Theyre as real as my own. I know this must feel like a violation of trust or something, but I... I dont want it to be strange, okay?
captain_karl_agathon Right. Right, sure.
captain_karl_agathon Madam President? Sir? Hope I didnt wake you.
president_laura_roslin Uh, come in. Thank you for the use of your Raptor, I needed some familiar surroundings. Dont worry. Ill give it back to Lt. Pike the second you need it.
captain_karl_agathon About that. This mission, its very risky...
president_laura_roslin If theres even a chance that we can go in and blow up that Hub and end Cylon resurrection for all Cylons forever, we must take it. I cannot back away from that.
captain_karl_agathon Yes, sir.
president_laura_roslin If and when DAnna comes back from the dead, bring her to me.
captain_karl_agathon I think the Cylons think that shell be interrogated by both groups together.
president_laura_roslin Im sure they do. Bring her to me. She knows the identities of the five Cylons in our Fleet. It is a matter now of human security, and I will not let the Cylons have audience to that discussion. I want to talk to her alone.
captain_karl_agathon Yes, sir.
president_laura_roslin Good.
john_cavil Welcome home, DAnna.
danna_biers You told me Id never have to go through this again.
john_cavil I lied.
danna_biers You thought you were putting me away forever. So what changed?
john_cavil War. A genuine Cylon civil war. Ones and Fours and Fives, against Twos and Sixes and Eights that objected to your retirement. Now your supporters are working with humans against all the rest of us. All in your name.
danna_biers Boomers an Eight. Shouldnt she be on the other side?
john_cavil Boomers my pet Eight. Shes seen the light of reason. And an Eight can make a passionate ally.
danna_biers Oh, until she sees something shiny. Whyd you bring me back anyway?
john_cavil I brought you to heal us, sister, and end this shameful war.
lt_sharon_valerii Since Cylon pilots dont use call signs, were gonna be painting unique identifiers on all their birds.
ensign_diana_seelix Thats a relief.
captain_karl_agathon You address them, use that number, okay?
lt_brendan_constanza Shouldve scrubbed this frakkin mission.
lt_eammon_pike Yeah, tell me about it.
captain_karl_agathon Hey, everyone listen up. Now these Heavy Raiders arent like the other Raiders. They arent gonna make any hinky moves on their own. Theyre under the control of their pilots. The Cylon pilots are in charge of their birds.
ensign_diana_seelix Oh, and are there tiny pilots inside of them?
number_six We do our jobs. Our training is just as good as yours.
Redwing_fronting#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode09 Yeah? Twenty-some of you Ive taken out werent that good.
captain_karl_agathon Redwing. Redwing! Now lets talk about the surprise element. First wave of Vipers are gonna ride in engines cold, dradis and comm off, okay? Youre gonna come in towed by cables from the Heavy Raiders. Were rigging em up now.
lt_eammon_pike Captain, dont... Now I mean, if theyre all tied together here, kissing their gasholes so to speak, and they tap on the brakes, were gonna smash right in the back of them.
captain_karl_agathon They wont. Itll work, you guys. Really. When youre close enough, the cables gonna disconnect. Were mounting small explosive charges to cut it.
Redwing#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode09 Hold it, hold it. We cut the cable, right?
captain_karl_agathon Cylon pilots cut the cable. Then you sling out of their birds and you turn your power on. Youre gonna be gunning directly at the Hubs FTL. Then its an all-out fight until we can get in there with the nukes.
lt_eammon_pike Yeah, so if the Cylons dont lift up, then were toast, right? No, look, Im serious.
lt_sharon_valerii Hey, hey! Pilots! Youve flown with Cylons. Youve flown with Athena, you put your life in her hands, and she hasnt betrayed you. Well, I am the same as her. Now all of these Cylons here, all of these people? Theyre pilots like you, and theyre gonna be out in the soup with you, taking out other Cylons, just like Athena does every time shes asked to. And when that Hub is taken out, all of their lives will be at risk. Just like yours. So you might want to think about how youre gonna work together, because were all dead if you dont.
captain_karl_agathon Moving on...
dr_gaius_baltar Just go and ask it already.
president_laura_roslin Ive been told that you said something about an Opera House, and I... Because it seems pointless!
dr_gaius_baltar Look, there was an Opera House. An Opera House. Are you listening to me? Apparently I was in the Opera House.
president_laura_roslin I had a vision! I was chasing after a little girl, I came to a door, I saw Dr. Baltar and the Six take the child.
the_hybrid ...Close the doors...
president_laura_roslin Shes not listening.
the_hybrid Protect the child.
president_laura_roslin Protect the child. She said, Protect the child. Thats what Caprica said...
dr_gaius_baltar You told me I was the one holding the child, so obviously I was the one protecting the child, wasnt I? In the Opera House...
president_laura_roslin No, no, no. It wasnt at all clear what you were doing. Let me listen.
the_hybrid Booting up, booting up...
dr_gaius_baltar I mean, obviously youve done this a thousand times before.
president_laura_roslin Well, Im just doing the same thing youre doing.
dr_gaius_baltar No youre not, actually, no youre not, because if youll watch what Im doing, what Im doing is Im actually focusing on her, all right? Now tell us what happened in the Opera House now, all right?!
president_laura_roslin Oh, the only thing youre doing is yelling.
the_hybrid Such a format will close the doors.
president_laura_roslin Close the door... No, no, open the door. Open the door. I want to open the door!
dr_gaius_baltar Yeah, open the door, close the door...
president_laura_roslin Do it again, do it again, do it again!
dr_gaius_baltar Im going for a walk. Love to see you do any better.
president_laura_roslin All right, Ill do it. Open the door!
the_hybrid Three! The Three is online.
president_laura_roslin The Three is online. The Three is online. The Three is DAnna.
the_hybrid Three is online. Processing data.
president_laura_roslin The Three is DAnna.
the_hybrid Loading data...
president_laura_roslin DAnna is online... Oh, DAnnas in a body! Dannas back in a body...
the_hybrid Booting up... Jump!
president_laura_roslin Ju...? Oh.
president_laura_roslin Why are we doing this again? I dont want to see this again.
elosha The ancients used to say a people is only as strong as the body of its leader.
president_laura_roslin If I follow that thought... Are you saying that humanity died because I died? If youre my subconscious, Ive gotta say youre a little full of myself.
elosha Humanity didnt die because you did. The ancients, they got a lot of things wrong. The body of a people is not the same as the body of its leader. But the soul and the spirit might be.
president_laura_roslin Oh I see, so youre only laying morality at my feet. Well, thats okay. I can take that. I mean, there are a lot of people who have sins far greater than mine.
elosha Youre thinking of Gaius Baltar.
admiral_william_adama ...Then I dug into the stump and pulled rocks from the ground until my fingers bled. I collected seeds from the few fruits the island offered, and planted them in long, straight furrows, like the ranks of soldiers. When I finished, I looked at what I had done. I did not see a garden. I saw a scar. This island had saved my life, and I had done it no service.
dr_gaius_baltar I can see a real hierarchy around here. And I have to tell you, youre on the lower end of the scale, my friend. Yes you are. Which is odd when you think about the Cylon God... They told you about God, didnt they?
president_laura_roslin Im not even really sure if the Hybrid was referring to DAnna, but if its true...
captain_karl_agathon It certainly would make it easier.
president_laura_roslin How so?
captain_karl_agathon Well, we... Wouldnt have to find a... Find a body.
president_laura_roslin Yeah, good. Okay. Go get her and bring her here. ...Something else?
captain_karl_agathon Its just once you have what she knows, I cant help feeling like you could try to keep Earth for humans only and I just... Madam President, that doesnt seem...
president_laura_roslin -- What?
captain_karl_agathon Honest. Youre supposed to be conducting a fair deal here, and instead youre taking DAnna off by yourself. Taking what she knows.
president_laura_roslin Slow down, Captain. At best, DAnna knows the identities of the Cylons in our Fleet. And at best, they know a way to Earth.
captain_karl_agathon So youre not denying youd keep the way to Earth to yourself if you could.
president_laura_roslin Im not saying thats true. I will say that if the Cylons had the option, thats exactly -- exactly -- what they would do.
captain_karl_agathon No, I dont think so. Not the Sharons. The Eights.
president_laura_roslin Captain. You are not married to the entire production line. I cannot afford to be sentimental right now, and I cannot afford you to be sentimental either. If you cant do this job, find me someone who can. What is that?
captain_karl_agathon I think were there.
lt_sharon_valerii Somethings going on. Another Baseship, unscheduled.
john_cavil Youve gotta speak to the Twos and Sixes and Eights and tell them theyve gone too far.
danna_biers No. Why didnt you ask about the Final Five? You never ask about them.
john_cavil Thats because I dont believe were meant to know them.
danna_biers Well, Ill tell you. I will tell you, Ill start shouting out their names. Why do you risk it?
john_cavil Are you going to help end this war or are you useless?
lt_sharon_valerii Twenty-five Heavy Raiders just launched from the new arrival, heading our way.
ensign_diana_seelix Come on, lets get this carpool started. Now! Cut the frakkin cable now, you frakkin bastard!
danna_biers Oh, the inhibitions been lifted... Oh, I sense it.
lt_sharon_valerii Its the rebel Baseship. I think theyre gonna attack. Theyre gonna blow the Hub.
john_cavil That would be mass murder. Death would be permanent for all of us. Theyve gone insane...
danna_biers Permanent death? Well, that makes this all the more meaningful.
Redwing_on_wireless#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode09 Helo, weve blown their FTL. That Hubs not going anywhere.
captain_karl_agathon Okay, take us down.
dr_gaius_baltar Well, hes your God as well. And God doesnt want any of his creations to be... Slaves. Not that youre a slave... Exactly...
Helo_with_Eight#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode09 Go.
lt_sharon_valerii This place is gonna go. Grab her.
captain_karl_agathon Run!
lt_eammon_pike Hardball, Pike, Im hit. My attitude control is down, and I cant even program any frakkin ordnance...
ensign_diana_seelix Pike, Hardball. Man, dont jump. Youll never make it to Galactica. You know how many jumps that is?
lt_eammon_pike Look, Im out of here, okay, Im jumping back home.
lt_sharon_valerii Karl... Come on, lets go.
lt_sharon_valerii Go!
Baltar_with_the_Centurion#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season04.Episode09 ...There was this dog, see, and the master had placed a bit of food on the edge of its snout. And the dog had to wait until he was told he could eat it. I know. Pathetic. Pathetic, isnt it?
president_laura_roslin Put him over there. Wait. Easy, easy. Easy slim, easy. Okay. Find out whats going on!
marine_allan_nowart Yes sir.
president_laura_roslin Okay.
dr_gaius_baltar Thank you, thank you.
president_laura_roslin Good.
dr_gaius_baltar Thank you, thank you. Thank you...
president_laura_roslin Okay, wait. Okay. Sorry. You have this, uh... You have this big hole in your hide, as Cottle would say. Okay. All right. Im gonna do this again.
dr_gaius_baltar Thank you.
president_laura_roslin Its the least I can do. I think youre gonna live. As usual.
dr_gaius_baltar You know something?
president_laura_roslin What?
dr_gaius_baltar Youre very pretty.
president_laura_roslin Man, that morpha worked fast.
dr_gaius_baltar Still... Do you know why Im so serene right now?
president_laura_roslin Youre doped out of your mind?
dr_gaius_baltar Because I know God. You need God, Laura. Really, youd be a different woman. I know God, therefore I know myself. Truth is... I was harboring the most awful, desperate guilt. A heavy, dark... Unimaginable, soul-breaking guilt. Now its gone. Now its gone, its been transformed. Into ... I have been transformed.
president_laura_roslin What was your guilt about?
dr_gaius_baltar I have no guilt.
president_laura_roslin What was your guilt about?
dr_gaius_baltar I gave the access codes to the Cylons. They wiped out most of humanity. Of course, I didnt know thats what I was doing at the time, exactly, but thats what I did. And when I realized what I had done, the magnitude... In that moment, I was saved. I was loved. By God. Looking back... I think I was rewarded.
president_laura_roslin Rewarded.
dr_gaius_baltar Pythia talks about the flood that wiped out most of humanity. Nobody blames the flood, a flood is a force of nature. Through the flood, mankind is rejuvenated, born again. I was another flood, you see. I blamed myself. I blamed myself. But God made the man who made that choice. God made us all perfect. And in that thought, all my guilt flies away... Flies away, like a bird. I can give you that peace, Laura, that freedom. Pray with me. Pray with me.
president_laura_roslin Okay.
dr_gaius_baltar Thank you.
president_laura_roslin Okay...
dr_gaius_baltar What are you doing?
president_laura_roslin Shh.
dr_gaius_baltar What are you doing?
president_laura_roslin Its all right. Youre fine. Shh! Youre fine.
dr_gaius_baltar Dont do this to me. Dont do this to me, please.
captain_karl_agathon We have DAnna onboard. We are clear of the Hub. Commence nuclear strike. Repeat, nuclear strike is a go.
danna_biers And with a whimper, every Cylon in the universe begins to die.
lt_sharon_valerii Yes, thats right. And its a good thing, DAnna. Because now theres no difference. We can all start trusting each other.
dr_gaius_baltar Dont do this to me, dont... Dont do this to me. Dont do this to me, please. Please. No.
president_laura_roslin No...
elosha Im not saying Baltars done more good than harm in the universe. He hasnt. The thing is, the harder it is to recognize someones right to draw breath, the more crucial it is. If humanity is going to prove itself worthy of surviving, it cant do it on a case-by-case basis. A bad man feels his death just as keenly as a good man.
president_laura_roslin What do you want from me here?
admiral_william_adama Laura.
elosha Just love someone.
president_laura_roslin Love. Huh.
admiral_william_adama You go. You go. You go to your rest now. Im not gonna be selfish anymore. You go. Rest.
president_laura_roslin No. No. Please, no. Stop bleeding. Stop the bleeding, stop the bleeding... Oh! Okay, good. Dont go...
lt_sharon_valerii All right, weve got get DAnna to the control room...
captain_karl_agathon No, thats not the plan.
lt_sharon_valerii What? What plan?
danna_biers Interesting.
president_laura_roslin Please dont go, Gaius. Please. I dont know how... All right, put it in...
captain_karl_agathon I have to take her directly to the President. No one else.
lt_sharon_valerii That wasnt the deal.
captain_karl_agathon Im just doing what she told me to do, okay?
danna_biers Double-dealing. Its very human. You never got that, Eight.
president_laura_roslin No more. No more, dont go. Please dont ... die, live. Please, live. Dont go.
captain_karl_agathon Im not saying I agree. Im saying its my orders.
lt_sharon_valerii So I pretty much just made a prize fool of myself, didnt I? Trust.
danna_biers Can we go find the President now?
danna_biers Gaius?
danna_biers Gaius, its me...
captain_karl_agathon The Hubs been destroyed.
president_laura_roslin Good. Dont let anyone in here. Whatever it takes. Thank you.
danna_biers Hes injured, but I think hes going to survive. I think its gonna be a long time jumping back.
president_laura_roslin Ive got time.
danna_biers Is that right? Well, you went to a lot of trouble to bring me here. Deceiving your so-called allies. I suppose youve got some questions for me.
president_laura_roslin Yes, I do. Id like to talk about the five Cylons in my Fleet.
danna_biers So you know about the Final Five.
president_laura_roslin I know theyre supposed to know the way to Earth.
danna_biers But you dont know that youre one of them?
danna_biers Your face! Oh, its ridiculous! No, look, Im not giving you any names. Not until I feel like Im safe, because information is all I got, sweetie. Im mortal now. In fact, Im the only Three in the whole darn universe. So I gotta worry about protecting myself. Ill tell you who the Final Five are when you take me back to your Fleet. Oh, and by the way, Laura, I wouldve said the same thing if youd have met me with a whole lot of Cylons, because I dont trust anyone right now. So all this deception? Complete waste of time.
the_hybrid To remove the pump with the attached hose and wiring, simultaneously release the three tangs while pulling the pump out of the retainer along with the line and wiring...
president_laura_roslin ...You lied to me.
elosha Did I?
president_laura_roslin I thought I was earning humanitys right to survive.
elosha Oh! Its not a vending machine, Laura. You dont save a life, and then... Cue the celestial trumpets, heres the way to Earth...
president_laura_roslin -- I know.
the_hybrid Jump!
elosha Disorienting, isnt it? All these little limping steps back.
president_laura_roslin I like it. Im used to it. Every jump brings us a little bit closer to home. Galactica. ...My home. Maybe theres something there for me.
elosha Maybe even closer.
admiral_william_adama Missed you.
president_laura_roslin Me too. ...I love you.
admiral_william_adama About time.
