<p>Previously on Buffy:
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “Parker, did I do something wrong?”
<br>Parker:&nbsp; “Didn’t you have fun?”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “Is that all it was?”
<br>Parker:&nbsp; “What else was it supposed to be?”
<p>Buffy:&nbsp; “He’s manipulative and shallow, and why doesn’t he want
me?”
<br>Willow:&nbsp; “I think you’re missing something about the whole poop-head
principle.”
<p>Xander:&nbsp; “Hi again.”
<br>Anya drops her dress and Xander squeezes the juice box.
<br>Xander and Anya getting dressed.
<br>Xander(voice over):&nbsp; “So, college not so scary after all, huh?”
<br>Three masked commando guys with weapons drawn walking up to a vamp
laying on the ground.
<br>Buffy (voice over):&nbsp; “It’s turning out a lot like high school,
which I can handle.”
<p>Xander in his basement with a knife in his hand.
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “I don’t know, I was going for ferocious, scary, but
it’s coming out more dryly sardonic.”
<br>Willow:&nbsp; “It does appear to be mocking you with its eye holes.”
<br>Oz:&nbsp; “The nose hole seems sad and full of self-loathing.”
<br>Xander turns the jack-o-lantern around to show to Buffy who’s laying
on his bed:&nbsp; “What do you think, Buff?”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “I was just thinking about the life of a pumpkin.&nbsp;
Grow up in the sun - happily entwined with others, then someone comes along,
cuts you open and - rips your guts out.”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “Okay, and on that happy note, I’ve got a treat for tomorrow
nights second annual Halloween screening.&nbsp; People - prepare to have
your spines tingled, your gooses bumped by the terrifying (Pulls out a
video and reads the title) Fantasia.&nbsp; Fantasia?”
<br>Oz:&nbsp; “Maybe it’s because of all the - horrific things we’ve seen,
but hippos wearing tutus just don’t unnerve me the way they used to.”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “Phantasm.&nbsp; It was supposed to be ‘Phantasm”.&nbsp;
Stupid video store!”
<br>Willow:&nbsp; “I thought we were doing the alph delt thing.”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “What thing?”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “The scary house?&nbsp; Sounds kinda lame.”
<br>Oz:&nbsp; “It actually borders on fun.&nbsp; You have to go through
the scary house maze to get to the party.&nbsp; Which is usually worth
getting to.&nbsp; Those guys go all out.”
<br>Willow:&nbsp; “As witnessed last Friday.”
<br>Oz:&nbsp; “Very true.”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “There is a party?”
<br>Willow:&nbsp; “We didn’t tell you?”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “No, it’s cool.&nbsp; You guys got your little college
thing.&nbsp; I’m fine.&nbsp; I mean, I got better things to do than tag
along to some Fraternity.”
<br>Willow:&nbsp; “You can come.”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “Okay.&nbsp; But only because I lied about having better
things to do.”
<br>Oz:&nbsp; “A blast will be had by all.”
<br>Buffy gets up:&nbsp; “I’m gonna get going.”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “Now?&nbsp; Tonight’s still...(Looks at his watch) okay,
it’s a little mature, but still.”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “I’m sleepy.&nbsp; You guys have fun.”
<br>Willow:&nbsp; “You want me to come with?”
<br>Buffy leaves:&nbsp; “No I’m fine.”
<br>Xander shakes his head:&nbsp; “Sad Buffy.”
<br>Willow:&nbsp; “She didn’t even touch her pumpkin.&nbsp; It’s a freak
with no face.”
<br>Oz:&nbsp; “She’s still suffering a little post-Parker depression.”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “Bailing on the Buff.&nbsp; Does anyone else want to
smack that guy?”
<br>All three raise their hands.
<p>Cut to Buffy walking down the street alone.&nbsp; A demon jumps out
at her screaming and she hits it in the face knocking it down.&nbsp; It
pulls of its mask to reveal a young kid.
<br>Kid:&nbsp; “Jeez, that hurt!&nbsp; What the hell is wrong with you,
lady?”
<br>Gets up and walks away.
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “That’s what I’d like to know.”
<p>Intro.
<p>Cut to UC of Sunnydale.&nbsp; Willow and Buffy are walking into the
cafeteria.
<br>Willow:&nbsp; “I’ve got the basics down – levitation, charms, glamours.&nbsp;
I just feel like I’ve plateaued wicca-wise.”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “What’s the next level?”
<br>Willow:&nbsp; “Transmutation, conjuring, bringing forth something from
nothing.&nbsp; Gets pretty close to the primal forces.&nbsp; A little scary.”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “Well, no one’s pushing.&nbsp; You know, if it’s too much
don’t do it.”
<br>Willow:&nbsp; “Don’t do it?&nbsp; What kind of encouragement is *that*?”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “This is an ‘encouragement’ talk?&nbsp; I thought it was
‘share my pain’.”
<br>Willow:&nbsp; “I don’t know.&nbsp; Then again, what is college for
if not experimenting?&nbsp; You know, maybe I can handle it.&nbsp; I’ll
know when I’ve reached my limit.”
<br>Oz comes up to them:&nbsp; “Wine coolers?”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “Magic.”
<br>Oz:&nbsp; “Ooh, you didn’t encourage her, did you?”
<br>Willow:&nbsp; “Where is supportive boyfriend guy?”
<br>Oz:&nbsp; “He’s picking up your dry cleaning, but he told me to tell
you that he’s afraid you’re gonna get hurt.”
<br>Willow with a smile:&nbsp; “Okay, Brutus.&nbsp; (Oz just looks at her)&nbsp;
Brutus – Caesar?&nbsp; (Willow looks form Oz to Buffy)&nbsp; Betrayal –
trusted friend?&nbsp; (Makes stabbing motions with her banana)&nbsp; Back
stabby?”
<br>Oz:&nbsp; “Oh, I’m with you on the reference, but – I won’t lie about
the fact that I worry?&nbsp; I know what it’s like to have power you can’t
control.&nbsp; I mean, every time I start to wold out, I touch something
–deep – dark.&nbsp; It’s not fun.&nbsp; But just know that what ever you
decide, I back your play.”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “See?&nbsp; Concerned boy, sweet boy.”
<br>Willow:&nbsp; “I kinda like him - worrying anyway.”
<br>We hear laughter and Buffy looks over to see Parker sitting at a table
laughing with his friends.
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “You know I, uhm, I forgot – to (puts her food down and
turns to leave) be hungry.”
<br>Willow hands her food to Oz and runs after her:&nbsp; “Wait, Buffy.”
<br>Willow catches her in the hallway:&nbsp; “Buffy.&nbsp; Don’t let jerky
Parker chase you away.”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “He didn’t.&nbsp; I just don’t want to deal with this
right now.&nbsp; I’m taking a holiday from dealing, happily vacationing
in the land of not coping.”
<br>Willow:&nbsp; “You know what, you’ll feel better at the party tonight.&nbsp;
Maybe you’ll even meet someone.”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “Willow, I don’t want to meet someone.&nbsp; I’ve reached
my quota on someones.&nbsp; Besides, I think I’m gonna have to patrol anyway.”
<br>Willow:&nbsp; “Tonight, but – it’s Halloween!”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “I’ll double check with Giles, but I’m sure he’s going
to think I should be on active Slayer duty.&nbsp; He doesn’t care about
Halloween.”
<p>Cut to Giles opening his door dressed up like a Mexican holding a big
bowl of candy.
<br>Giles:&nbsp; “Happy Hallow - Hello, Buffy?”
<br>Buffy stares at him:&nbsp; “Oh – my – God.”
<br>Giles:&nbsp; “It’s a sombrero.”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “And it’s on your head.”
<br>Giles:&nbsp; “It seemed festive.&nbsp; Uhm, come in. (Buffy comes in)
Candy?”
<br>Buffy looks around at the decorations:&nbsp; “What’s going on here?&nbsp;
You hate Halloween.”
<br>Giles:&nbsp; “I never said any such a thing.&nbsp; As my Watcher’s
duties took precedence, I simply haven’t taken time to – well, to embrace
its inherent charms – until now.&nbsp; (Turns on a Frankenstein puppet
hanging from the ceiling)&nbsp; Look, look! (Laughs)&nbsp; It’s alive!
(Buffy just stares at him)&nbsp; See – how he shakes?&nbsp; -&nbsp; Is
– is there something you wanted?”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “I was thinking that I should patrol tonight.&nbsp; You
know, possibly the cemetery or if you had a better su... (Stares distractedly
at the fringe dangling from the edge of his sombrero) could you please
take that off?”
<br>Giles sets down the bowl of candy:&nbsp; “Oh, yes, of course.&nbsp;
(Takes the hat off)&nbsp; I see, is there some specific danger you were
sensing?”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “No.&nbsp; But then you know we were all caught of guard
when Ethan turned everyone into their costumes."
<br>Giles:&nbsp; “True, but what happened then was anomalous.&nbsp; Creatures
of the night shy away form Halloween.&nbsp; They find it all much too crass.”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “Hard to believe.”
<br>Giles:&nbsp; “Well, I-I promise you - there is little likelihood of
any supernatural activity tonight. (Holds up the bowl of Candy)&nbsp; You
sure you don’t want one?”
<p>Cut to the Alpha Delta Fraternity house.&nbsp; They are decorating the
haunted house.&nbsp; A guy walks down the hallway and a plastic skeleton
with a knife in its hand swings out in front of him, making him jump.
<br>1.Guy laughs and holds up a bag to the guy standing next to the skeleton:&nbsp;
“I come bearing spiders.”
<br>2.Guy:&nbsp; “The sound system is not going to cut it.&nbsp; Nothing
but lame.”
<br>1.Guy:&nbsp; “You want me to call Oz?&nbsp; He can probably hook us
up.”
<br>2.Guy:&nbsp; “Do it.&nbsp; If we not scare the young women, they will
not fall into our arms. - We’ll have woman-less arms.&nbsp; Halloween isn’t
about thrills, chills and funny costumes, it’s about getting laid.”
<br>1.Guy:&nbsp; “Is there any holiday that’s not about getting laid?”
<br>2.Guy:&nbsp; “Arborday.&nbsp; Call Oz, dude.”
<br>1.Guy:&nbsp; “Done.&nbsp; And oh, you wanted a symbol to paint upstairs,
something mystical?&nbsp; (Holds up a book with a pentagram in it) Check
this out.”
<p>Cut to Xander putting on a jacket in his basement, he turns and there
is Anya standing on the stairs.
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “Anya?&nbsp; You really have to get this knocking thing
down.&nbsp; -&nbsp; How did you...?”
<br>Anya:&nbsp; “You’re uncle Rory let me in.&nbsp; Does he always smell
like peppermint?”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “The man likes his schnapps.&nbsp; What are you doing
here?”
<br>Anya:&nbsp; “You haven’t called.&nbsp; Not once.”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “You said you were over me.”
<br>Anya:&nbsp; “And you just accepted that?&nbsp; I only said that because
I thought that’s what you wanted to hear.”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “That’s the funny thing about me, I tend to hear the
actual words people say and accept them at face value.”
<br>Anya:&nbsp; “That’s stupid.”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “I accept that.&nbsp; -&nbsp; I can’t say seeing you
falls into the realm of a bad thing.”
<br>Anya smiles:&nbsp; “Really?&nbsp; -&nbsp; I thought - maybe we could
go out tonight, for our anniversary.”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “Anniversary?”
<br>Anya:&nbsp; “It’s been exactly one week since we copulated. - Did you
forget?”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “Oh, no, of course not.&nbsp; It’s just I already have
plans with Buffy, Willow and Oz.&nbsp; It’s Halloween, you know.”
<br>Anya:&nbsp; “I don’t understand.”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “Well, every October 31st, we mortals dress up in masks...”
<br>Anya:&nbsp; “No, no, I understand that inane ritual.&nbsp; It’s those
people.&nbsp; You continue to associate with them though you share little
in common.”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “What are you talking about?”
<br>Anya:&nbsp; “I mean they go to college, you don’t.&nbsp; They no longer
live at home, - you do.”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “Oh, hey, those things...&nbsp; The bonds of true friendship
transcends...&nbsp; Could we just change the subject?”
<br>Anya:&nbsp; “Okay, okay.&nbsp; Don’t get upset with me.&nbsp; I just
wondered.”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “If you want you can come with me tonight to this party.”
<br>Anya:&nbsp; “You mean like a date? - Is that what this is? (Xander
swallows) Are we dating?”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “There are definitely date-like qualities at work here.
– Oh, you’ll need a costume.”
<br>Anya:&nbsp; “A costume?”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “Dress up, you know, something - scary.”
<br>Anya:&nbsp; “Scary.&nbsp; Scary how?”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “Anya, you ex-demon, terrorized mankind for centuries.&nbsp;
I’m sure you’ll come up with something.”
<p>Cut to Psyche-lecture room at UCS.&nbsp; Buffy walks up to Prof. Walsh
and Riley as they get ready to leave.
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “Excuse me, Professor Walsh?&nbsp; I came to get today’s
assignments.&nbsp; I, uh, couldn’t make it to class for personal reasons.”
<br>Walsh:&nbsp; “Right.&nbsp; I count four limbs, a head no visible scarring,
so I assume your personal issue wasn’t a life threatening accident of any
kind, I’m therefore uninterested.&nbsp; You got problems, solve them on
your own time.&nbsp; Miss another class and you’re out.”
<br>Prof. Walsh walks past Buffy.
<br>Riley:&nbsp; “She means it, you know.”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “Yeah.&nbsp; I got the impression she wasn’t saying it
to make me laugh.”
<br>Riley:&nbsp; “You’ve got to be aware your work’s taken a little down
turn lately.&nbsp; I can’t remember the last time I’ve seen your hand up.”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “Does stretching count?”
<br>Riley:&nbsp; “Look, things get pretty intense Freshmen year, - as I
dimly recall.&nbsp; Too much fun or not enough?”
<br>Buffy after a beat:&nbsp; “Both actually.”
<br>Riley hands her the assignments:&nbsp; “Yeah, well, you just got to
keep your priorities.&nbsp; Prof. Walsh is worth your time.”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “Thanks, I’ll get this done tonight.”
<br>Riley:&nbsp; “Tonight.&nbsp; It’s Halloween!&nbsp; What, your not going
to dress up and go party?”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “I have a lot of work to do.”
<br>Riley:&nbsp; “I may be out of line here, and it’s not really my business,
but - you seem like the kind of person that makes things really hard on
themselves.&nbsp; Halloween isn’t a night for responsibility.&nbsp; It’s
when the ghosts and goblins come out.”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “That’s actually a misnomer.”
<br>Riley:&nbsp; “Well, I didn’t mean real ones.&nbsp; (Buffy smiles and
looks down)&nbsp; But, hey, there is some good scary fun to be had on campus
tonight.”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “Yeah?&nbsp; What are you doing?”
<br>Riley:&nbsp; “Well, I’m going to sit here and grade papers.”
<br>Buffy turns to go:&nbsp; “Scary.”
<br>Riley:&nbsp; “Very.”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “Well, thanks for the pep talk, coach.”
<br>Riley:&nbsp; “Don’t make fun.&nbsp; I worked long and hard to get this
pompous.”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “No, I mean it.”
<br>Riley after a beat:&nbsp; “You’re welcome.”
<br>Buffy smiles and walks out while Riley looks after her.
<p>Cut to the Alpha Delta Fraternity house.&nbsp; A guy is painting the
symbol from the book onto the floor.&nbsp; Oz and Xander carry in a speaker.
<br>3.Guy:&nbsp; “Okay, watch your step, boys.&nbsp; Paint’s still wet
in a few spots.”
<br>2.Guy:&nbsp; “Thanks for the loan, man.&nbsp; Our sound system sucks.”
<br>Oz:&nbsp; “Mi casio es su casio.”
<br>Xander points at the pentagram:&nbsp; “Well, that’s an interesting
little design.&nbsp; What does it mean?”
<br>3.Guy:&nbsp; “No - clue.&nbsp; I got it out of this book.&nbsp; There
is a lot of really cool stuff about...”
<br>Xander spots a bowl on a table:&nbsp; “Ooh, grapes! (Picks up a grape)&nbsp;
Wow, peeled.&nbsp; You guys know how to spoil your guests.”
<br>2.Guy:&nbsp; “Eyeballs, man.&nbsp; Blindfold chicks and have them stick
their hands in the bowl and tell them it’s eyeballs.&nbsp; They love that.”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “And here I was wasting time buying them flowers and
complimenting them on their shoes.&nbsp; So, you go through the whole house
of horrors downstairs and it ends up here.&nbsp; Sweet.&nbsp; You fratly
guys have a nice setup.”
<br>2.Guy:&nbsp; “Hey, mighty, mighty Alpha Delts.&nbsp; You should think
about pledging.”
<br>Oz:&nbsp; “Oh, Xander is a civilian.”
<br>2.Guy:&nbsp; “Ah!&nbsp; Townie, huh?&nbsp; Didn’t know.&nbsp; He looked
so normal.&nbsp; You sure we should let him come to the party, Oz?”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “Hey, standing right here.”
<br>Scary sound effects start to play loudly.&nbsp; Oz looks at the speakers
unhappily.
<br>2.Guy:&nbsp; “Cranking.”
<br>Xander looks at Oz:&nbsp; “You’re sensing a disturbance in the force,
master?”
<br>Oz pulls out a folding pocketknife:&nbsp; “Ah, the left speaker is
crackling a little bit.”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “And you feel stabbing it is the proper solution?”
<br>Oz:&nbsp; “I’m just going to trim the wire.&nbsp; It might be a short.”
<br>Xander nods and turns away.
<br>Oz straightens up:&nbsp; “Ah!”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “Oz?”
<br>Oz:&nbsp; “Cut myself.&nbsp; It’s okay.”
<br>He walks over shaking his hand.&nbsp; Some blood drops on the symbol
on the floor.
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “Playing with knives, fun, yes, but not safe.&nbsp; And
when you bleed to death I’ve got dibs on your equipment.”
<br>A ripple runs over the symbol, but no one notices one of the plastic
spiders at its edge coming alive and crawling away.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Cut to Joyce altering a red cape on her sewing machine.
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “Thanks again for doing this at the last minute.”
<br>Joyce:&nbsp; “I’m just glad I could find it. There. Try it now.&nbsp;
I let down the hem and loosened it a little around the hood.”
<br>Buffy puts it on:&nbsp; “Oh, it feels better.&nbsp; (Joyce smiles at
her) Oh, no.&nbsp; Someone is getting nostalgic face.”
<br>Joyce:&nbsp; “I’m sorry.&nbsp; I’m thinking about the little girl who
wore that.&nbsp; What is it?&nbsp; Five?&nbsp; Six years ago.”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “Yeah, little red riding hood was the cutting edge in
costumes.”
<br>Joyce laughs:&nbsp; “Your father *loved* to take you out.”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “He was such a pain!&nbsp; 12 years old and I can’t go
trick-or-treating by myself?”
<br>Joyce:&nbsp; “He just wanted to keep you safe.”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “No, he wanted the candy.&nbsp; I was just the beard.”
<br>Joyce:&nbsp; “Oh, that’s not true actually.&nbsp; The candy was for
me.&nbsp; -&nbsp; Your father loved spending time with you.”
<br>Buffy looks down:&nbsp; “Not enough, I guess.”
<br>Joyce:&nbsp; “Buffy.”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “Oh, that just paved right over memory lane, huh?”
<br>Joyce:&nbsp; “Our divorce had nothing to do with you.”
<br>Buffy swallows:&nbsp; “I don’t know. – I’m starting to feel like there
is a pattern here. – Open your heart to someone, and he bails on you.&nbsp;
Maybe it’s easier to just not let anyone in.”
<br>Joyce gets up:&nbsp; “I thought it might be easier.&nbsp; You must
have noticed that I am not exactly the social butterfly I was when I was
with your dad.&nbsp; I don’t think I made a single new friend the year
we moved to Sunnydale.”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “Why not?”
<br>Joyce:&nbsp; “Fear.&nbsp; I didn’t believe I could trust anyone again.&nbsp;
It’s taken time and a lot of effort, but I’ve got a nice circle of friends
now.&nbsp; -&nbsp; I mean, don’t get me wrong.&nbsp; I – I’m still a little
gun shy.&nbsp; It certainly didn’t help that my last boyfriend turned out
to be a homicidal robot.&nbsp; (Sits down next to Buffy)&nbsp; I will *always*
be here for you.&nbsp; And you got Mr. Giles and your friends.&nbsp; (Buffy
looks at her)&nbsp; Believe me, there is nothing to be afraid of.”
<p>Cut to students in costumes toilet papering some trees.
<p>Cut to Willow in Joan of Arc costume.
<br>Willow on the phone:&nbsp; “No, I just meet you at your place. – Yeah,
Buffy said she was coming but I haven’t seen her.&nbsp; We have to make
sure she has fun.&nbsp; We have to force fun upon her.&nbsp; And if Parker
shows up we just - ax-murder him.&nbsp; That’s halloweeny!&nbsp; Okay,
I’ll see you in a little bit.”
<br>Willow hangs up the phone and goes into the hallway.&nbsp; It’s full
of college kids in costumes.&nbsp; Tall black guy in drag wearing a blond
wig comes up to her:&nbsp; “Willow, you’ve got to stop by the room.”
<br>Willow:&nbsp; “I’m late for a battle or I would.&nbsp; I love your
outfit though.”
<br>Willow walks by a red lobster talking to a girl dressed like a present.
<br>Lobster:&nbsp; “There is nothing going on here.”
<br>Present:&nbsp; “I saw you flirting with her!”
<br>Lobster:&nbsp; “Do we have to do this every time?&nbsp; I love you,
you know that!”
<p>Cut to the haunted house.&nbsp; It’s in full swing.
<br>2.Guy leads a blindfolded girl to the bowl of peeled grapes:&nbsp;
“Okay, Rach, what’s in the next one?”
<br>Rachel:&nbsp; “You guys are sick!”
<br>2.Guy:&nbsp; “Here, give me your hand.”
<br>Rachel with her hand in the bowl:&nbsp; “This is gross.”
<br>2.Guy:&nbsp; “Eyeballs, Rachel, they’re eyeballs! Muahaha!”
<br>Rachel giggles takes her blindfold of and looks at what she’s picked
up out of the bowl.&nbsp; She is holding eyeballs.&nbsp; Screams.
<p>Cut to Buffy, dressed like little red riding hood, is standing with
a basket in her hands.&nbsp; Xander walks up behind her wearing a tux.
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “Hey, Red.&nbsp; What you got in the basket, little girl?”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “Weapons.’
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “Oh.”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “Just in case.&nbsp; Like the tux, Xander.”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “Bond.&nbsp; James Bond.&nbsp; Insurance, you know, in
case we get turned into our costumes again.&nbsp; I’m going for cool, secret
agent guy.”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “I hate to break it to you, but you’ll probably end up
cool head waiter guy.”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “As long as I’m cool and wield some kind of power.”
<br>They meet up with Willow and Oz.
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “Will.&nbsp; Medieval Will.”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “Hail, ye olde – vareletty – thou.”
<br>Willow:&nbsp; “I’m Joan of Arc.&nbsp; I figured we had a lot in common,
seeing as how - I was almost burned at the stake, and plus she had - that
close relationship with God.”
<br>Xander to Oz:&nbsp; “And you are?”
<br>Oz pulls his jacket open to reveal a nametag with ‘God’ on it.
<br>Xander as they walk on together:&nbsp; “Of course.&nbsp; I wish I’d
thought of that before I put down my deposit.&nbsp; I could have been God.”
<br>Oz:&nbsp; “Blasphemer.”
<br>Two of the commando guys wearing ski masks and carrying guns step out
of the bushes in front of them.
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “Nice costumes.&nbsp; Very stealthy.”
<br>Willow:&nbsp; “What are they supposed to be?”
<br>Oz:&nbsp; “NATO?”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “Oh, yeah, I, ah, invited Anya to join us, but she’s
having some trouble finding a scary costume, so she’s just going to meet
us there.”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “Perfect, everybody’s got a date but third-wheel Buffy.”
<br>Willow:&nbsp; “You’re not a third wheel.”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “Technically speaking you’re a fifth wheel.”
<br>Willow pushes him aside impatiently and puts an arm around Buffy:&nbsp;
“We’re going to have the best time.”
<p>Cut to the inside of the haunted house.&nbsp; All the kids are running
around, screaming.&nbsp; There are strobe lights going, given everything
a creepy look.&nbsp; A voice rumbles:&nbsp; “Release me!”
<br>Cut to Buffy and Co. walking up to the house.
<br>Cut to the kids running and screaming.
<br>Cut to Willow and Oz smiling and holding hands as they walk up to the
door.
<br>Oz turns around in front of the door:&nbsp; “Let the horrors begin.”
<br>Cut to 2.Guy running down a corridor:&nbsp; “God, help me!”
<br>He falls down the steps and lands in a lifeless heap at the bottom.
<br>Voice rumbles:&nbsp; “Release me!”
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Cut to Buffy and Co. entering the silent haunted house.
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “The joint’s not jumping.&nbsp; Where is everybody?”
<br>Mechanical laughter comes from a head with one eye hanging from its
socket sitting in a punch bowl on a table next to the door.
<br>Oz:&nbsp; “Follow the signs.”
<br>Buffy looks at the severed head:&nbsp; “Terrifying.&nbsp; If I were
Abbott and Costello this would be fairly traumatic.”
<br>Willow walks into a cobweb decorating a doorway and screams:&nbsp;
“Uh, ah! Cobweb!&nbsp; (Pulls it off of her)&nbsp; Okay that part was realistic.”
<br>Oz:&nbsp; “Frat boys aren’t too obsessive with their cleaning.&nbsp;
Might not be decoration per se.”
<br>The plastic skeleton with the knife swings out at Xander and he jumps.
<br>Xander panting:&nbsp; “I wasn’t scared, I was in the spirit.”
<br>Willow:&nbsp; “And we back you up on that.&nbsp; Even if they question
us separately.”
<br>Oz looks back at Willow and notices a real tarantula on her shoulder.&nbsp;
Willow sees what he is looking at and screams:&nbsp; “Uh, get it off!”
<br>Oz brushes at it the checks her over:&nbsp; “It is gone.”
<br>Willow:&nbsp; “Okay, that is not sanitary!”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “Yeah, lets get to the party part of the – party.”
<br>Willow to Oz:&nbsp; “Are you sure it’s off?”
<br>Oz as they follow Buffy:&nbsp; “Yeah.”
<br>They walk into a room and Buffy bends down to examine a spot on the
carpet.
<br>Oz:&nbsp; “I thought this led to...”
<br>Xander to Buffy:&nbsp; “What is it?”
<br>Buffy looks at the stain on her fingers:&nbsp; “Blood.&nbsp; (Smells
her fingers) Real blood.”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “Okay, actual creeps have been given. (Loudly) Bravo,
frat boys!”
<br>Buffy stands up:&nbsp; “Shh!&nbsp; Do you hear something?&nbsp; Like
a - squeaking noise?”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “Oh, it’s these rented shoes, patent leather.&nbsp; I
asked the guy to...”
<br>Willow:&nbsp; “No, no, I – wait.&nbsp; It’s something else.&nbsp; I
hear it, too.&nbsp; Something like...”
<br>They all slowly look up at the ceiling.&nbsp; It’s covered with real
bats.&nbsp; All of them scream and cover their heads as the bats suddenly
drop down and fly off down the hall.&nbsp; Oz walks over and picks up a
bat that is laying on the floor.
<br>Willow:&nbsp; “No, Oz, don’t it might be...”
<br>Oz:&nbsp; “Rubber.&nbsp; It’s made of rubber.”
<br>Buffy looks around:&nbsp; “What the hell is going on here?”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “Look, maybe it’s nothing.&nbsp; Maybe it’s just a neat
trick.&nbsp; You know, something done with wires or...”
<br>Rumbling voice:&nbsp; “Release me!”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “Or it might be something else.”
<p>Cut to Anya walking up to the house wearing a furry, white bunny suit.&nbsp;
There is a welcome mat laying in front of a solid wall.
<br>Anya:&nbsp; “Where is the door?&nbsp; (Knocks on the wall)&nbsp; Hey!&nbsp;
Hello!”
<br>She sighs and walks back out to the street.&nbsp; She hears a scream
coming from the house and looks up to see a girl banging against one of
the upper story windows.
<br>Girl:&nbsp; “Help me!&nbsp; Help me!”
<br>The stones surrounding the window suddenly expand to cover it up.
<br>Anya turns to go:&nbsp; “Xander!”
<p>Cut to Buffy and Co. walking back into the entrance room.&nbsp; You
can hear all kinds of screams and creepy sound effects.
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “Where is the stairs?”
<br>Willow:&nbsp; “Where is the door?”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “This is the way we came in, right?&nbsp; We just went
in a circle? (The sound effects cut off as Oz flips a switch)&nbsp; Thank
the lord!”
<br>Oz:&nbsp; “You’re welcome.”
<br>Willow:&nbsp; “Hey, I have a neat idea: lets get out of here!”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “And you were so anxious for me to come.”
<br>Willow:&nbsp; “I’m serious, Buffy.&nbsp; We don’t know what we’re dealing
with.”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “My turn.&nbsp; Does anyone hear that?”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “As soon as we start dealing with it I’ll know what it
is we’re dealing with.&nbsp; Do you hear something?”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “Like I said.&nbsp; Sounds like a hissing.”
<br>Buffy puts down her basket:&nbsp; “It’s like a ‘ssss’ noise?”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “I thought the word hissing kind of covered that nicely.”
<br>Buffy pulls open the door to a closet.&nbsp; There is a guy in there
rocking back and forth.
<br>Chaz:&nbsp; “I’m sorry.&nbsp; I didn’t know.&nbsp; I’m sorry.”
<br>Oz crouches down in front of him:&nbsp; “Chaz.”
<br>Chaz:&nbsp; “I didn’t know.”
<br>Oz:&nbsp; “What’s happening?”
<br>Chaz rocking harder:&nbsp; “It ah...”
<br>Buffy impatiently:&nbsp; “What is it?”
<br>Chaz:&nbsp; “It’s alive.&nbsp; It’s alive.”
<br>Cut to the plastic skeleton.&nbsp; Cut to the knife in its hand.&nbsp;
As the camera pans back up the bones are suddenly real.&nbsp; There is
an eyeball in one of its sockets.&nbsp; It straightens its head and looks
at the camera.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Cut to Buffy:&nbsp; “What’s alive?”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “He’s in shock.”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “Chaz, what happened here?”
<br>Chaz looks up and screams as he sees the skeleton come up and stab
at Buffy’s shoulder from behind.&nbsp; Buffy turns and knocks its head
aside then kicks it in the middle.&nbsp; It lies back to land on the ground,
once again plastic.
<br>Buffy stares at it then checks her shoulder.
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “I think the cape took most of it.’
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “Let me see.”
<br>Oz:&nbsp; “Could need stitches.&nbsp; You should at least get a bandage
or something.”
<br>We hear a girl scream and Chaz crawls back into the closet and closes
the door.
<br>Oz:&nbsp; “Cowering in a closet is starting to seem like a reasonable
plan.”
<br>Buffy looks back over her shoulder:&nbsp; “What closet?&nbsp; (There
is only a blank wall) I’m gonna make my way upstairs and see if there are
any people up there. (Picks up her basket)&nbsp; You guys find a way out
of the house and use it.”
<br>Willow:&nbsp; “You’re telling us to run away and leave you behind?”
<br>Buffy pulls a loaded crossbow out:&nbsp; “We need help.&nbsp; We need
the only person that can make sense of what’s happening.”
<p>Cut to Giles sitting with his bowl of candy, looking bored.&nbsp; There
is an insistent knock on the door and he gets up.
<br>Giles swallows his candy:&nbsp; “Just a minute!&nbsp; -&nbsp; Coming!
(Opens the door)&nbsp; Happy Hall...”
<br>Anya walks past him:&nbsp; “Xander is in trouble.&nbsp; We’ve got to
do something, right now!”
<br>Giles stares at her with his mouth hanging open:&nbsp; “Anya.”
<br>Anya:&nbsp; “Are you listening?&nbsp; Xander is trapped!”
<br>Giles:&nbsp; “Uh, ah, where is Buffy and the others?”
<br>Anya:&nbsp; “They’re trapped, too, but we’ve got to save Xander!”
<br>Giles takes off his sombrero and sits down:&nbsp; “Slow down.&nbsp;
I need you to be more specific.”
<br>Anya:&nbsp; “Uhm, ah, we were supposed to meet at this house, and I
got there and there was no door where a door should be.&nbsp; And then
I see this girl standing in a window, and then poof!&nbsp; She’s gone.’
<br>Giles:&nbsp; “She vanished from the window?”
<br>Anya:&nbsp; “No, the window vanished from the house.”
<br>Giles:&nbsp; “Hmm.&nbsp; Matter and reality distortion. (Goes and pulls
a book from his shelf) Like a summoning spell’s temporal flux.”
<br>Anya:&nbsp; “What?”
<br>Giles:&nbsp; “Hmm?&nbsp; Oh, never mind.&nbsp; I just need to get some
- supplies together.&nbsp; (Looks over at Anya)&nbsp; I wouldn’t worry
about Xander.&nbsp; At least he’s amongst friends.”
<p>Cut to Buffy:&nbsp; “Will, I’m telling you...”
<br>Willow:&nbsp; “You’re telling me?&nbsp; You’re telling me?!?”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “I can’t do my job if I have to worry about each of your
safety.”
<br>Willow:&nbsp; “It’s not your decision!”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “Got to disagree with you there.”
<br>Willow:&nbsp; “Oh, of course you do.”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “Let’s all take a breath.&nbsp; Buffy, maybe...”
<br>Willow:&nbsp; “Being the Slayer doesn’t automatically make you boss.&nbsp;
You’re as lost as the rest of us.”
<br>Oz:&nbsp; “What are we talking about?”
<br>Willow:&nbsp; “It’s a simple incantation, a guiding spell for travelers
when they become lost or disoriented.”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “And how does it work?”
<br>Willow:&nbsp; “It conjures an emissary from the beyond that – lights
the way.”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “Conjuring.&nbsp; Will, let’s be realistic here.&nbsp;
Okay, your basic spells are usually only fifty-fifty.”
<br>Willow upset:&nbsp; “Oh yeah?&nbsp; Well, - so is your face!”
<br>Willow walks off while Buffy tries to figure out what that meant:&nbsp;
“What?!&nbsp; (Walks after Willow)&nbsp; What does that mean?”
<br>Willow turns around:&nbsp; “I’m not your sidekick!”
<br>Willow stomps out.&nbsp; Oz runs after her.&nbsp; Buffy stands there
and sighs.
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “Well, that was a bunch of laughs.&nbsp; (Buffy walks
past him back to her basket)&nbsp; Look, Buffy, we are all tired and a
*little* edgy.&nbsp; Maybe Willow is over reacting.&nbsp; I’m sure part
of it is because of how you’ve been ‘pushing away’ girl lately.&nbsp; (Buffy
picks up her crossbow, ignoring him totally)&nbsp; But now is not the time
to let that stuff tear us apart.&nbsp; (Buffy turns to go)&nbsp; What I’m
saying is, I’m right with ya.&nbsp; I’m right by your side.&nbsp; I’m...”
<br>Buffy looks around:&nbsp; “Xander?”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “Funny how you still haven’t lost your sense of inappropriate
humor.”
<br>Buffy turns around looking right through him:&nbsp; “Xander, where
did you go?”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “Buffy, knock it off. Skit’s over.&nbsp; I’m right here.”
<br>Buffy stomps off down the hall:&nbsp; “This is so *typical* of him!”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “Typical?”
<br>Buffy down the hall:&nbsp; “Xander?”
<br>Xander follows her after a beat:&nbsp; “Buffy!”
<p>Xander walks into a room lit by candles.&nbsp; The walls are covered
with cobwebs.
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “Buff?”
<p>Pan back down the corridor.
<br>Willow:&nbsp; “She thinks I’m not ready to be a full blown witch!&nbsp;
I can handle the dark forces as good as anyone else.&nbsp; It’s not that
hard.&nbsp; I-It’s just a guiding spell and I’m careful and all.”
<br>Oz looks around the room they just walked into:&nbsp; “This floor used
to have windows.”
<br>Willow:&nbsp; “Look.&nbsp; We found the stairs.&nbsp; (Starts walking
up)&nbsp; Buffy didn’t find the stairs, no sir!”
<br>Oz following Willow up the stairs:&nbsp; “You guys aren’t thinking
clearly.”
<br>He looks down at his hands.&nbsp; They are hairy and his fingernails
look more like claws.
<br>Willow in upstairs corridor:&nbsp; “We just need to get up to the goat
room and maybe we can...”
<br>Oz:&nbsp; “Willow, something is happening.”
<br>Willow turns back to him:&nbsp; “Something good? (Sees that he is turning
into a werewolf)&nbsp; Oh, no – not good.”
<br>Oz:&nbsp; “I’m changing.”
<br>Willow:&nbsp; “But – but you can’t!&nbsp; There is no moon tonight.”
<br>Oz:&nbsp; “I have to get away.”
<br>Willow:&nbsp; “No, we need to find something to restrain you, like
a rope or chains, or something.”
<br>Oz:&nbsp; “There is no time!”
<br>Willow:&nbsp; “I can do the guiding spell.&nbsp; I know I can make
it work!”
<br>Oz:&nbsp; “Will, please.”
<br>Willow tries to grab him:&nbsp; “No!”
<br>Oz bats her hand away with a growl:&nbsp; “NO!”
<br>Willow looks down at the three red scratches on the back of her hand.&nbsp;
Oz turns and runs off.
<br>Willow:&nbsp; “Oz! – Oz, don’t leave me!”
<br>We get several quick shots of different empty parts of the house with
Willows voice echoing:&nbsp; “Don’t leave me!&nbsp; Don’t leave me!”
<p>Cut to Xander walking up to a mirror:&nbsp; “There I am.&nbsp; I didn’t
go anywhere.&nbsp; (He looks at his reflection in the mirror.&nbsp; We
can see a decapitated head with one eyeball hanging from its socket sitting
on a dresser behind him) Great.&nbsp; Now I just have to live with the
fact that no one else can see me.”
<br>The head begins to jiggle, blood runs from its eye sockets.&nbsp; Xander
spins around and stares at it.
<br>Head:&nbsp; “I can see you.”
<br>Xander runs off.
<p>Camera pans down a corridor to reveal Oz sitting in a bathtub repeating
over and over:&nbsp; “You’re not going to change.&nbsp; You’re not going
to change.”
<p>Camera pans over some old pictures covered with cobwebs, comes up behind
Buffy walking down a corridor.&nbsp; She hears a noise and spins around,
crossbow at the ready, but there is nothing there.
<p>Cut to Willow sitting at a table:&nbsp; “Okay, Aradia, Goddess of the
lost, the path is murky, the woods are dense, darkness pervades, I beseech
thee, bring the light.&nbsp; (She opens her eyes and smiles as she sees
a tiny speck of light floating in front of her face)&nbsp; Woah!&nbsp;
I did it!&nbsp; I did you.&nbsp; Hi!&nbsp; -&nbsp; Right, you’re waiting
for instructions.&nbsp; Lead me to Oz. (The speck of light starts to float
past her, and Willow gets up) Wait!&nbsp; I should try to find the people
trapped upstairs first. (Willow looks down and doesn’t see that there are
now two then three sparks)&nbsp; But even if I get them we still need to
find a way out of the house.&nbsp; (They spark keep multiplying)&nbsp;
Okay, here is what we should do.&nbsp; (Sees the cloud of sparks)&nbsp;
Hey!&nbsp; What’s going on?&nbsp; (The sparks start to circle her)&nbsp;
Stop! (Willow starts to bat at them as they start to buzz around her like
a cloud of mosquitoes) Stop it! - Get off! - Oz, hel..”
<br>Some of the sparks fly into her mouth and she starts coughing, then
runs off.&nbsp; The sparks chase after her.
<p>Cut to Buffy.&nbsp; She hears Willow yell for help and spins around.&nbsp;
She tries to follow Willow’s voice.
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “Willow.”
<br>She comes up to a locked door and bust it open.&nbsp; There is no floor
in the room behind it and she falls down into the basement.
<br>We see her laying on the floor on her back, looking up as the door
swings slowly shut.
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “Basement.&nbsp; -&nbsp; I must be in the basement.”
<br>Hollow voice:&nbsp; “All alone.”
<br>Buffy pushes herself up:&nbsp; “Who said - that?”
<br>The guy that fell down the steps walks around a corner with his head
tilted at an unnatural angle.
<br>Guy:&nbsp; “They all ran away from you.&nbsp; They always will.&nbsp;
Open your heart to someone and&nbsp; (Smiles at her) – But don’t fret,
little girl, you’re not alone (Buffy screams as arms burst up through the
floor to grab at her) anymore.”
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Cut to Buffy struggling against the dead people coming up through the
floor trying to pull her down.
<p>Cut to Giles and Anya standing in front of the house.&nbsp; Giles is
running a hand over the place where the door used to be, holding an open
book in his other hand.
<br>Anya is bouncing impatiently:&nbsp; “Well?’
<br>Giles:&nbsp; “We’re gonna have to create a door.”
<br>He closes the book and walks over to his bag.
<br>Anya:&nbsp; “Create a door.&nbsp; You can do that?”
<br>Giles gets up with a chainsaw in his hands:&nbsp; “I can.”
<p>Cut to Buffy fighting the dead people.
<br>Broken neck guy:&nbsp; “No matter how hard you fight, you just end
up in the same place.&nbsp; (Buffy crawls along the floor on all fours,
kicking at the guys following her)&nbsp; I don’t see why you bother.”
<br>Buffy reaches a small door, goes through and slams it shut behind her.&nbsp;
She is in the big room with the pentagram on the floor.
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “I’m upstairs.&nbsp; The goat room.”
<br>She slowly walks into the room.&nbsp; There are college kids in costumes
cowering all along the walls, whimpering.
<br>Buffy looks at a boy cowering in a corner:&nbsp; “Oz?”
<br>Willow comes running into the room waving her arms around:&nbsp; “Get
them off me!&nbsp; Get them off me!&nbsp; (Oz looks at his normal hands
then up at her)&nbsp; Get’em off!&nbsp; Get’em off!”
<br>Oz takes a hold of her:&nbsp; “Willow, Willow, Willow, what’s wrong?”
<br>Willow:&nbsp; “Couldn’t get them off..”
<br>Oz:&nbsp; “It’s okay.&nbsp; It’s okay.&nbsp; (Pulls her into his arms)
We’re okay.”
<br>Buffy shakes her head:&nbsp; “We’re not okay.&nbsp; We need to get
out of here.”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “I’d offer *my* opinion but you jerks aren’t gonna hear
it anyway. (Buffy walks over to where he is rocking back and forth on the
edge of a chair) Not that ‘didn’t go to college’ boy has anything important
to say.&nbsp; I might as well hang out my new best friend, bleeding dummy
head, for all you dorks care.”
<br>Buffy yells:&nbsp; “What is wrong with you?”
<br>Xander gets up:&nbsp; “You – you heard that?&nbsp; You – you can see
me?&nbsp; (Buffy nods)&nbsp; Good.&nbsp; Oh, God, good!”
<br>Oz:&nbsp; “The house separated us.&nbsp; It wanted to scare us.”
<br>Willow:&nbsp; “But - we got away.”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “No.&nbsp; We were brought here.&nbsp; We all got so scared
that we ended up here. – Why?”
<br>Xander points at the pentagram on the floor:&nbsp; “I saw them painting
that.&nbsp; They were copying it out of&nbsp; (Looks around and spots the
open book on a table) that!”
<br>Willow take the book from him:&nbsp; “I think it’s Gaelic.”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “Can you translate?”
<br>Rumbling voice:&nbsp; “Release me!&nbsp; (They all look around but
there is nothing there)&nbsp; Release me!”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “Will, give me something.”
<br>Willow:&nbsp; “Okay, uhm, uhm, the icon’s called the-the Mark of Gachnar.&nbsp;
I-I think this is a summoning spell for something called..”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “Gachnar?”
<br>Willow:&nbsp; “Well, yes.&nbsp; Somehow the beginning of the spell
must have been triggered.&nbsp; Uhm, Gachnar is trying to manifest itself,
to-to come into being.”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “How?”
<br>Willow:&nbsp; “I-it feeds on fear.”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “Our fears are manifesting it.&nbsp; We’re feeding it.&nbsp;
We need to stop.”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “If we’re close our eyes and say it’s a dream it’ll stab
us to death!&nbsp; These things are real.”
<br>Rumbling voice:&nbsp; “Release me!”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “Okay, so our fears are feeding it, if we get everyone
out of here..”
<br>The walls start knocking and shaking.
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “Good plan.&nbsp; Lets go!”
<br>Walks towards the door.&nbsp; He screams when it burst open to reveal
Giles with the running chainsaw in his hands.&nbsp; Giles turns off the
saw.
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “Giles?&nbsp; Everyone, it’s Giles!&nbsp; With a *chainsaw*.
(Anya runs in and hugs Xander) Glad you could make it.”
<br>Giles:&nbsp; “The walls closed up behind us.&nbsp; (Walks over and
takes a look at Willow’s book) Gachnar, of course.&nbsp; It’s presence
infects the reality of the house, but it’s not managed to achieve full
manifestation.&nbsp; We can not allow this to come into being.”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “But if it does I can fight it, right?”
<br>Giles walks over and shows her a picture in the book:&nbsp; “Buffy,
this is Gachnar.”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “I *don’t* want to fight that.&nbsp; So, we break the
spell.”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “What ever we do, lets do it fast.”
<br>Giles flipping pages:&nbsp; “I have it, I have it. Uhm, ‘The summoning
spell for Gachnar can be shut down in one of two ways.&nbsp; Destroying
the mark of Gachnar&nbsp; (Buffy walks over to the mark and puts her fist
through it, ripping up the floorboards.&nbsp; Gets up and looks over at
Giles with a proud smile) – Is *not* one of them and will in fact immediately
bring forth the fear demon itself.”
<br>Buffy makes a face and looks at the mark that’s beginning to glow.
<br>Willow:&nbsp; “Look!”
<br>The floor rumbles as they all stare in horror.&nbsp; We get a close
up of Gachnar, and he’s one ugly dude.&nbsp; Gachnar looks up and the camera
pulls back to reveal that he is tiny, maybe a half a foot tall, if that.
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “This is Gachnar?”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “Big overture.&nbsp; Little show.”
<br>Gachnar:&nbsp; “I am the dark lord of nightmares!&nbsp; (Buffy tries
not to laugh) The bringer of terror!&nbsp; Tremble before me.&nbsp; Fear
me!”
<br>Willow laughing:&nbsp; “He – he’s no cute!”
<br>Gachnar:&nbsp; “Tremble!”
<br>Xander bends down:&nbsp; “Who’s a little fear demon?&nbsp; Come on!&nbsp;
Who’s a little fear demon!”
<br>Giles:&nbsp; “Don’t taunt the fear demon.”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “Why, can he hurt me?”
<br>Giles:&nbsp; “No, it’s just – tacky.&nbsp; Be that as it may, Buffy,
when it comes to slaying...”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “Size doesn’t matter?”
<br>Gachnar:&nbsp; “They’re all going to abandon you, you know.”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “Yeah, Yeah.”
<br>We get a shot of Buffy’s huge foot as she stomps down and squishes
the fear demon.
<p>Cut to the gang digging into Giles Halloween candy at his house.
<br>Oz:&nbsp; “Some quality treats here, Giles.”
<br>Giles:&nbsp; “*Please*, finish them.”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “Uhm, this is much better.&nbsp; There is no problem that
can not be solved with chocolate.”
<br>Willow leans back crossing her arms over her stomach:&nbsp; “I think
I’m going to barf.”
<br>Buffy: “Except that.”
<br>Xander stares at Anya while he’s eating his candy.
<br>Anya:&nbsp; “What?”
<br>Xander:&nbsp; “That’s your scary costume?”
<br>Anya:&nbsp; “Bunnies frighten me.”
<br>Giles:&nbsp; “Oh, bloody hell.&nbsp; The inscription!”
<br>Buffy:&nbsp; “What’s the matter?”
<br>Giles comes over to show her the book:&nbsp; “I should have translated
the Gaelic inscription under the illustration of Gachnar.”
<br>Buffy looks at it:&nbsp; “What’s it say?”
<br>Giles:&nbsp; “Actual size.”
<br>After a beat Buffy shrugs and closes the book.
