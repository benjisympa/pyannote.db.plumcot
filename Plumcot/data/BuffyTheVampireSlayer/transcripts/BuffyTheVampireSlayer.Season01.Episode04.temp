Xander May I cut in?
Xander You alright?
Buffy Thanks to you!
Buffy You hurt your hand! Will you still be able to...
Xander ...finish my solo and kiss you like you've never been kissed before?
Buffy You're drooling.
Buffy Xander!
Buffy You've got a little...
Dr._Gregory Their ancestors were here long before we were. Their progeny will be here long after we are gone. The simple and ubiquitous ant.
Dr._Gregory Now. If you read the homework you should know the two ways that ants communicate.
Dr._Gregory Miss Summers.
Buffy Ways that ants communicate.
Dr._Gregory Mm.
Buffy With other ants.
Dr._Gregory From the homework.
Dr._Gregory Ants are communicating...
Buffy Um, uh, uh...
Buffy Touch...
Dr._Gregory Mm-hmm.
Buffy And, um...
Buffy B.O.?
Blayne Thank God someone finally found the courage to mention that!
Dr._Gregory That would be 'touch' and 'smell', Miss Summers. Is there anything else Miss Rosenberg would like to tell you?
Dr._Gregory Alright, chapters six through eight by tomorrow, people. Can I see you for a moment?
Dr._Gregory I gather you had a few problems at your last school?
Buffy Well, what teenager doesn't?
Dr._Gregory Cut school, get in fights, burn down the gymnasium... Principal Flutie showed me your permanent record.
Buffy Well, that fire, I mean, there was major extenuating circumstances. Actually, it's, uh, kinda funny!
Dr._Gregory Can't wait to see what you're gonna do *here*.
Buffy Destructo Girl. That's me.
Dr._Gregory But I suspect it's gonna be great.
Buffy You mean, 'great' in a bad way?
Dr._Gregory You have a first-rate mind and you can think on your feet. Imagine what you could accomplish if you actually did the...
Buffy ...the homework thing.
Dr._Gregory The homework thing. I understand you probably have a good excuse for not doing it. Amazingly enough, I don't care. I know you can excel in this class, and so I expect no less. Is that clear?
Buffy Yeah! Sorry.
Dr._Gregory Don't be sorry, be smart. And please don't listen to the principal or anyone else's negative opinion about you. Let's make 'em eat that permanent record. Whadaya say?
Buffy Okay! Thanks.
Dr._Gregory Chapters six through eight!
Lyrics The first date's the worst date / It's hard to know just what to do / And I take you to dinner / You don't eat, you just play with your food
Lyrics And there's something familiar...
Lyrics About every word you say
Lyrics It's hard to believe it's happened again / I already met you / And I already met you / You're like my last girlfriend / Yes, and the girlfriend I had before her
Blayne Seven, including Cheryl. I'll tell you, though, her sister was lookin' to make it eight!
Boy Ooo, Cheryl's sister? The one in college?
Blayne Home for the holidays and lookin' for love! She's not my type, though. Girls really gotta have something to go with me.
Xander Something like a lobotomy?
Blayne Xander. How many times you score?
Xander Well, uh...
Blayne It's just a question.
Xander Are we talking today, or the whole week?
Xander Ooo! Duty calls!
Xander Babes!
Buffy What are you doing?
Xander Work with me here. Blayne had the nerve to question my manliness. I'm just gonna give him a visual.
Willow We'll show him!
Buffy I don't believe it.
Xander I know, and after all my conquests.
Xander Who's that?
Willow That must be Angel! I think?
Xander That weird guy that warned her about all the vampires?
Willow That's him, I'll bet you.
Xander Well, he's buff! She never said anything about him being buff!
Willow You think he's buff?
Xander He's a very attractive man! How come *that* never came up?
Buffy Well! Look who's here!
Angel Hi.
Buffy I'd say it's nice to see you, but then we both know that's a big fib.
Angel I won't be long.
Buffy No, you'll just give me a cryptic warning about some exciting new catastrophe, and then disappear into the night. Right?
Angel You're cold.
Buffy You can take it.
Angel I mean, you look cold.
Xander Oh, right! Give her your jacket. It's a balmy night, no one needs to be trading clothing out there!
Buffy A little big on me. What happened?
Angel I didn't pay attention.
Buffy To somebody with a big fork?
Angel He's coming.
Buffy The Fork Guy?
Angel Don't let him corner you. Don't give him a moment's mercy. He'll rip your throat out.
Buffy Okay, I'll give you improved marks for that one. Ripping a throat out, it's a strong visual, it's not cryptic!
Angel I have to go.
Buffy Sweet dreams to you, too.
Giles That's all he said? Fork Guy?
Buffy That's all Cryptic Guy said: Fork Guy.
Giles I think there are too many 'guys' in your life.
Giles I'll see what I can find out. God, every day here is the same.
Buffy Bright, sunny, beautiful, how ever can we escape this torment?
Giles Really.
Giles Good morning.
Xander Mornin'. Guess what I just heard in the office? No Dr. Gregory today. Ergo, those of us who blew off our science homework aren't as dumb as we look.
Buffy What happened, is he sick?
Xander They didn't say anything about sick, something about missing.
Buffy He's missing?
Xander Well, let me think. Um, the cheerleaders were modeling their new short skirts, that kinda got... Yeah! Yeah, they said missing.
Xander Which is bad?
Buffy If something's wrong, yeah!
Willow He's one of the only teachers that doesn't think Buffy's a felon.
Xander I'm really sorry, I'm sure he'll...
Xander I, uh, huh...
Xander Uh, huh... huh...
Natalie Could you help me?
Xander Uuuuuuhhhhhh... Yes!
Natalie I'm looking for Science... 109.
Xander Oh! It's, um...
Xander I go there every day!
Xander Oh, God, where is it?
Blayne Hi! Blayne Mall. I'm going there right now. It's not far from the varsity field where I took All-City last year.
Natalie Oh! Thank you, Blayne!
Xander It's funny how the Earth never opens up and swallows you when you want it to.
Willow What's wrong?
Buffy Dr. Gregory dropped his glasses... Why wouldn't he pick them up?
Natalie My name is Natalie French, and I will be substituting for Dr. Gregory.
Buffy Do you know when he's coming back?
Natalie No, I don't, um, Buffy. They just call and tell me where they want me.
Blayne I'll tell you where I want you.
Natalie Excuse me, Blayne?
Blayne Uh, I was just wondering if you were gonna pick up where Dr. Gregory left off.
Natalie Yes. His notes tell me you were right in the middle of insect life.
Natalie The praying mantis is a fascinating creature. Forced to live alone. Who can tell me why? Buffy?
Buffy Well, the words 'bug-ugly' kinda spring to mind.
Natalie There is nothing ugly about these unique creatures. The reason they live alone is because they're cannibals!
Buffy Eww!
Natalie Oh, well, it's hardly their fault! It's the way nature designed them: noble, solitary and prolific. Over 1800 species worldwide, and in nearly all of them the female is larger *and* more aggressive than the male.
Blayne Nothing wrong with an aggressive female.
Natalie The California Mantis lays her eggs, and then finds a mate...
Natalie ...to fertilize them. Once he's played his part, she covers the eggs in a protective sack and attaches it to a leaf or twig out of danger. Now, if she's done her job correctly, in a few months she'll have several hundred offspring.
Natalie You know, we should make some model egg sacks for the science fair. Who would like to help me do that after school?
Natalie Good!
Buffy Hot dog surprise. Be still, my heart.
Willow Call me old-fashioned, I don't want any more surprises in my hot dogs.
Xander I wonder what she sees in me? It's probably the quiet good looks coupled with a certain smoky magnetism.
Xander Miss French. You two're probably a little young to understand what an older woman would see in a younger man.
Buffy Oh, I understand.
Xander Good!
Buffy The younger man is too dumb to wonder why an older woman can't find someone her own age, and too desperate to care about the surgical improvements!
Xander What surgical improvements?
Willow Well, he is young.
Buffy And so terribly innocent!
Xander Hey, those that can, do. Those that can't *laugh* at those who... can do.
Blayne Gotta carb up for my one-on-one with Miss French today. When's yours? Oh, right, tomorrow. You came in second, I came in first. Guess that's what they call natural selection.
Xander Guess it's what they call a rehearsal! Rehearsal...
Cordelia Excuse you!
Cordelia Medically prescribed lunch. My doctor ships it daily... I'll only be here as long as I can hold my breath.
Cordelia His head! His head! Oh, my God, where's his head?!
Giles Here. Drink this.
Buffy No, thank you.
Xander I've never seen...
Xander I mean, I've never seen anything like... That was new.
Willow Who would wanna hurt Dr. Gregory?
Giles Uh, he didn't have any enemies on the staff that I'm aware of. He was a civilized man. I liked him.
Buffy So did I.
Willow Well, we're gonna find out who did this. We'll find them and we'll stop them.
Buffy Count on it.
Giles What do we know?
Buffy Oh, not a lot, um... He was killed here on campus. I'm guessing the last day we saw him.
Giles How do you work that out?
Buffy He didn't change his clothing.
Xander This is a question that no one particularly wants to hear, but... where did they put his head?
Willow Good point. I *didn't* wanna hear that.
Buffy Angel! He warned me that something was coming.
Giles Yes. Yes he did, didn't he? I wish I knew what he meant. I've been trying to gather more information about the Master, our, uh, local vampire king. There was one oblique reference to a, a, a vampire who displeased the Master and cut his hand off in penance.
Buffy Cut off his hand and replaced it with a fork?
Giles I don't know what he replaced it with.
Xander So, why would he come after a teacher?
Giles I'm not certain he did. There was an incident two nights ago...
Giles ...uh, involving a homeless person in Weatherly Park. He was practically shredded, but, uh, nothing like Dr. Gregory.
Buffy Fork Guy doesn't do heads.
Giles Not historically.
Buffy And Dr. Gregory's blood wasn't drained.
Xander So there's something else out there? Besides Silverwareman? Oh, this is fun, we're on Monster Island.
Buffy We're on a Hellmouth. It's a center of mystical convergence. Guess it's the same thing.
Giles Well, unpleasant things do gravitate here, it's true, but, uh, we don't know there's anything besides this chap. He's still our likely suspect.
Buffy Where was that guy killed? Weatherly Park?
Giles Buffy. I know you're upset, but, uh, this is no time to go hunting, not until we know more. Please promise me you won't do anything rash?
Buffy Cross my heart.
Bum Shouldn't be out here at night, little lady. Dangerous.
Voices Hold it! Police! Did you see that? I got nothing here!
Voices I heard it. Spread out. Let's go over here. This way, this way. Alright...
Giles You went hunting last night.
Buffy Yes.
Giles When you assured me you wouldn't.
Buffy Yes, I lied, I'm a bad person, let's move on.
Giles Did you see someone with a fork?
Buffy More like a jumbo claw.
Giles Oh. Well, uh, at least you're not hurt.
Buffy And I saw something else. Something much more interesting than your average run-of-the-mill killer vampire.
Giles Oh?
Buffy Do you know Miss French, the teacher that's subbing for Dr. Gregory?
Giles Yes. Yes, she's lovely. In a, a common, extremely well proportioned way.
Buffy Well, I'm chasing Claw Guy last night, and Miss Well Proportioned is heading home. The Claw Guy takes one look at her and runs screaming for cover.
Giles He what? Ran away?
Buffy He was petrified.
Giles Of Miss French?
Buffy Uh-huh! So I'm an undead monster that can shave with my hand... How many things am I afraid of?
Giles Not many. And not substitute teachers, as a rule.
Buffy So what's her deal?
Giles I think perhaps it would be a good idea if we kept an eye on her.
Buffy Then I better get to class.
Mr._Flutie You were there. You saw Dr. Gregory, didn't you?
Buffy Um, you mean yesterday in the cafeteria when we found him...
Mr._Flutie Don't say dead! Or decapitated, or decomposing, I'd stay away from D-words altogether. But you witnessed the event, so this way, please.
Buffy Well, no, I'm gonna be late for biology...
Mr._Flutie Extremely late! You have to see a counselor. Everyone who saw the body has to see a crisis counselor.
Buffy But I really don't need...
Mr._Flutie We all need help with our feelings. Otherwise we bottle them up, and before you know it, powerful laxatives are involved. I really believe if we all reach out to one another we can beat this thing. I'm always here if you need a hug, but not a real hug! Because there's no touching, this school is sensitive to wrong touching.
Buffy But, I really, really don't...
Mr._Flutie No, you have to talk to a counselor and start the healing. You have to heal.
Buffy But Mr. Flutie, I...
Mr._Flutie Heal!
Cordelia I don't know what to say, it was really, I mean, one minute you're in your normal life, and then who's in the fridge? It really gets to you, a thing like that. It was... let's just say I haven't been able to eat a thing since yesterday. I think I lost, like, seven and a half ounces? Way swifter than that so-called diet that quack put me on. Oh, I'm not saying that we should kill a teacher every day just so I can lose weight, I'm just saying when tragedy strikes, we have to look on the bright side. You know?
Cordelia Like, how even used Mercedes still have leather seats!
Natalie Keep your eyes straight ahead on your own test.
Natalie I think you meant 'pollination' for number fourteen. I'll see you here after school.
Buffy Oh, great, a pop quiz.
Buffy No, I'm not saying she craned her neck. We are talking full-on Exorcist twist.
Willow Ouch!
Buffy Which reminds me, how come Blayne, who worked with her one-on-one yesterday, isn't here today?
Willow Inquiring minds wanna know.
Buffy Any luck?
Giles Um, I've not found any creature as yet that strikes terror in a vampire's heart.
Buffy Try looking under things that can turn their heads all the way around.
Giles Nothing human can do that.
Buffy No, nothing human. There are some insects that can. Whatever she is, I'm gonna be ready for her.
Giles What are you going to do?
Buffy My homework.
Buffy Where are the books on bugs?
Xander Hi!
Natalie Oh, Hi! I was just grabbing a snack. Can I fix you something?
Xander No thanks, I never... eat when I'm making egg sacks. Wow, if this were real the bugs would be...
Natalie ...as big as you!
Xander Yeah! So! Where do we start?
Natalie Oh, Xander! I've done something really stupid. I hope you can forgive me.
Xander Oh, forgiveness is my middle name! Well, actually it's LaVelle, and I'd appreciate it if you guard that secret with your life.
Natalie I have a teacher's conference in half an hour, and I left the paint and papier-mâché at home. I don't suppose you'd like to come to my place tonight to work on it there?
Xander Come to, uh... your place?
Natalie 7:30? Here's my address.
Natalie I'll see you tonight?
Xander Yeah!
Xander Ooo, yes!
Buffy Dig this: 'The praying mantis can rotate its head 180 degrees while waiting for its next meal to walk by.' Ha! Well, c'mon, guys. Ha!
Willow Well, Miss French is sort of big. For a bug?
Giles And she is, by and large, woman shaped.
Buffy Okay. Factoid 1: Only the praying mantis can rotate its head like that. Factoid 2: A pretty whacked-out vampire is scared to death of her. Factoid 3: Her fashion sense screams predator.
Willow It's the shoulder pads.
Buffy Exactly.
Giles If you're right, then she'd have to be a shape shifter or a perception distorter. On a helpful note, I had a chum at Oxford, Carlyle, advanced degrees in entomology mythology.
Buffy Entoma-who?
Giles Bugs and fairy tales.
Buffy I knew that.
Giles If I recall correctly, poor old Carlyle, just before he went mad, claimed there was some beast...
Willow Buffy, 911! Blayne's mom called the school. He never came home last night.
Giles The boy who worked with Miss French yesterday?
Willow Yeah! If Miss French is responsible for... Xander's supposed to be helping her right now! He's got a crush on a giant insect!
Buffy Okay, don't panic, I'll warn him. But I need you to hack onto the coroner's office for me.
Willow Well, what are we looking for?
Buffy Autopsy on Dr. Gregory. I've been trying to figures out these marks that I saw on his corpse... I'm thinking they were teeth. And, uh, these cuddlies? Should definitely be brushing after every meal. And you were saying something about a beast?
Giles Oh, uh, yeah, I just need to make one transatlantic telephone call. Um, this computer invasion that Willow's performing on the coroner's office, one, one assumes it is entirely legal?
Willow Entirely!
Buffy Of course!
Giles Right. Wasn't here, didn't see it, couldn't have stopped you.
Buffy Good idea.
Buffy Hey!
Xander Hey!
Buffy So, how'd it go with Miss French?
Xander Well, it's a bit demanding being her absolute favorite guy in the universe, but I'll muddle through.
Buffy Xander, she's not what she seems.
Xander I know, she's so much more.
Buffy Okay, um... I'm gonna have to tell you something about her, and I'm gonna need you to really listen, okay?
Xander Okay.
Buffy I don't think she's human.
Xander I see. So if she's not human she's...?
Buffy Technically? A big bug.
Buffy This sounds really weird, I'm aware of that...
Xander It doesn't sound weird at all, I completely understand. I've met someone, and you're jealous.
Buffy What?
Xander Look, there's nothing I can do about it. Uh, there's just this certain chemical thing between Miss French and me.
Buffy I know, I read all about it, it's call, um, a pheromone. It's a chemical attractant that insects give off.
Xander She's not an insect! She's a woman, okay? And hard as that may be for you to conceive, an actual woman finds me attractive. I realize it's no mystery guy handing out leather jackets, and while we're on the subject, what kind of a girlie name is 'Angel' anyway?
Buffy What does that have to do with...
Xander Nothing! It just kinda bugs me. Look, I really gotta...
Buffy Wha...?
Natalie Hi! Come on in!
Natalie Should I change? Is, is this too...
Xander No, no, it's, the most beautiful chest... dress I've ever seen.
Natalie Thank you. That's sweet. Martini? Oh, I'm sorry, would you like something else?
Natalie I just need to relax a little, I'm kinda nervous around you. You're probably cool as a cucumber!
Xander I like cucumbers. Like in that Greek salad thing with the yogurt. Do you like Greek food? I'm exempting Schwarma, of course, I mean, what's that all about? It's a big meat hive.
Xander Hhhhhhho! Hello!
Natalie Cheers! Can I ask you a personal question?
Natalie Have you ever been with a woman before?
Xander You mean, like, in, uh, the same room?
Natalie You know what I mean.
Xander Oh, that, uh... Well, let me think. Um...
Xander Yeah, there was, uh... several!
Xander I mean, and, uh, quite a few times... And then there was, uh... Oh, she was incredibly... No. Uh-uh.
Natalie I know. I can tell.
Xander You can?
Natalie Oh, I like it. You might say, I... *need* it.
Xander Oh! Well, needs should, uh, y'know... Needs should definitely be met, as long as it doesn't require ointments the next day, or...
Xander Do you hear...
Natalie No...
Xander Sounds like someone crying...
Natalie I don't hear anything. Your hands are so hot!
Buffy Oh, you hurt your hand!
Xander Buffy. I love Buffy. Wow! So that's a martini, huh?
Natalie Mm-hmm.
Xander Do you hear...
Natalie Would you like to touch me with those hands?
Xander Your hands are sss... really... serrated! Oh, wow, that martini, I... I really think I have to...
Xander Miss... French?
Natalie Please, call me Natalie.
Giles Frankly, madam, I haven't the faintest idea what time it is, nor do I care. Now, unlock his cell, unstrap him, and bring him to the telephone immediately. This is a matter of life and death!
Willow Got it! Coroner's report, complete with... Yuk! ...color pictures.
Buffy There *are* teeth marks. Which match perfectly the one insect that nips off its prey's head.
Willow Okay, I-I don't like this.
Buffy Huh! It's the way they feed, head first. It's also the way they mate. The female bites off the male's head while they're...
Willow No, no, no! See? Xander's, I like his head! I-it's where you find his eyes, and his hair, and his adorable smile...
Buffy Hey, hey, take it easy, Willow. Xander is not in any immediate danger. I saw him leave school. He's probably safe at home right now.
Xander Ah! Blayne!
Blayne Oh, God! Oh, God!
Xander Are you all right?
Blayne Oh, God! You gotta get me outta here! You gotta! She, she, she gets you, and, uh...
Xander What?
Blayne ...she, she...
Xander What does she do?
Blayne Oh, God! Oh, oh, no!
Xander Blayne! What does she do?
Blayne She, she... she, she takes you outta the cage, and she ties you up, and, and... she... she starts movin', and throbbin', and these eggs come shootin' out of her! And then...
Xander What?
Blayne And then...
Xander Then what?
Blayne She mates with you!
Xander Sheeee...
Blayne That's not the worst part!
Xander That's not?
Blayne You seen her teeth? Right while she's, you know, right in the middle of... I saw her do it! I don't wanna die like that!
Xander Blayne! Blayne! Chill! It's okay. It's gonna be okay. We'll get outta this.
Blayne You gotta plan? What is it?
Xander Just, uh, let me perfect it!
Blayne Oh, God... Oh, God... Oh, God...
Giles I-I understand, Carlyle. Yes... I-I'll take every precaution. Uh, absolutely, i-i-it sounds exactly like the creature you described. Y-you were right all along about everything. Well, n-no, you weren't right about your mother coming back as a Pekinese, but... uh... Try to rest, old man. Yes... Ta! Bye now!
Giles Dr. Ferris Carlyle spent years transcribing a lost pre-Germanic language. What he discovered he kept to himself until several teenage boys were murdered in the Cotswolds. Then he went hunting for it.
Buffy It being...
Giles Uh, he calls her a She-Mantis. This type of creature, the Kleptes-Virgo, or, or virgin-thief, appears in, in many cultures. The Greek sirens, the Celtic sea maidens, who, who tore the living flesh from the bones of, um...
Buffy Giles, while we're young!
Giles Uh, well, basically the, uh, the She-Mantis assumes the form of a beautiful woman and then lures innocent virgins back to her nest.
Buffy Virgins? Well, Xander's not a, uh... I mean, he's probably...
Willow ...gonna die!
Buffy Okay, okay, so this thing is breeding and we need to find it and snuff it. Any tips on the snuffing part?
Giles Uh, Carlyle recommends cleaving all body parts with a sharp blade.
Buffy Slice and Dice.
Giles Well, whatever you do, it had better be certain and swift. This beast is extremely dangerous.
Buffy Well, your buddy Carlyle faced it, and he's still around.
Giles Yes, in a straitjacket, howling his innards out day and night.
Buffy Okay, Admiral, way to inspire the troops!
Giles Sorry...
Willow Xander's not home! He told his mom he was going to his teacher's house to work on a science project. He didn't tell her where.
Buffy See if you can get her address off the substitute rolls. And you need to record bat sonar, and fast!
Giles Bat sonar, right. What?
Buffy Bats eat them. The mantis hears sonar, its entire nervous system goes kaplooey.
Giles Where am I gonna find the...
Buffy In the vid library? There're no books, but it's dark and musty, you'll feel right at home, go! I guess I'll handle the armory.
Blayne Don't do anything to make her mad!
Blayne Hey, alright, now I can get outta my cage! Into yours. What'd you do that for?
Xander A weapon!
Blayne I think you're gonna need it.
Willow Getting the address.
Buffy Great! Giles?
Giles Recording bat sonar is something soothingly akin to having one's teeth drilled.
Buffy Let's roll!
Willow According to Miss French's personnel records, she was born in 1907. She's, like, 90 years old!
Giles And extremely well preserved!
Blayne Oh, God! Uh, he did that, he broke the cage, take him, not me, take him!
Giles What now, exactly? We can't just kick the door down.
Buffy Yeah, that *would* be wrong.
Miss_French Hello, dear! I thought I heard... Are you selling something? Because I'd like to help you out, but... You see, I'm on a fixed income.
Buffy I'm looking for Miss French.
Miss_French I'm Miss French.
Buffy Natalie French, the substitute biology teacher?
Miss_French Goodness, that's me! I taught for over thirty years. I retired in 1972.
Buffy I can't believe this! She used Miss French's records to get into the school. She could be anywhere!
Miss_French No, dear! I'm right here!
Xander What's she doing?
Blayne I think it's eeny, meeny, miney...
Xander Moe?
Xander I'm comin', I'm comin'.
Willow What do we do now?
Giles Abject prayer and supplication would spring to mind.
Buffy I saw her walking past this park with her grocery bags. She lives in this neighborhood.
Willow I'm gonna start banging on doors.
Buffy Wait, no, we do *not* have time for that!
Willow We have to do something!
Buffy We will.
Buffy I won't be long.
Giles W... Buffy?
Blayne Oh, yeah, here it comes!
Xander What? What's happening?!
Blayne How do you like your eggs, bro, over easy or sunny side up?
Xander Eggs? She's gonna lay some...
Natalie The California Mantis lays her eggs, and then finds a mate to fertilize them.
Willow Come on, Buffy!
Claw_Guy You!
Buffy Me!
Buffy Come on! Come on, where is she? Which house is it? I know you're afraid of her, I saw you! Come on!
Buffy Come on. What? What is it? This is her, isn't it, this is her house? This is it! Better than radar!
Willow Buffy!
Natalie Kiss me! Kiss me!
Xander Can I just say one thing? HEEEELLLLP! HEEEELLLLP!
Blayne Uh, hey, o-over here, hello! In the cage!
Buffy Let him go!
Blayne Help me! Help me!
Buffy Get them outta here!
Blayne Hey, help me! Help me!
Buffy Remember Dr. Gregory? You scarfed his head? Yeah, well, he taught me, you do your homework, you learn stuff. Like what happens to your nervous system when you hear this!
Tape ...extremely important to file not simply alphabetically...
Buffy Giles!
Giles I-it's the wrong side!
Buffy Bat sonar. Makes your whole nervous system go to Hell. You can go there with it!
Giles Well, I... I'd say it's deceased.
Willow And dissected.
Xander You okay?
Buffy Yeah.
Xander Just for the record, you were right, I'm an idiot, and God bless you!
Xander And thank you guys, too.
Blayne Yeah, really!
Giles Pleasure...
Willow I'm really glad you're okay. It's so unfair how she only went after virgins.
Xander What?
Willow I mean, here you guys are, doing the right thing, the smart thing, when a lot of other boys your age...
Blayne Flag down on that play, babe. I am *not*...
Giles Well, you see, that's the She-Mantis' modus operandi. Uh, she only preys on the pure.
Xander Well, isn't this a perfect ending to a wonderful day!
Blayne My dad's a lawyer. Anyone repeats this to anybody, they're gonna find themselves facing a lawsuit.
Xander Blayne! Shut up!
Willow I don't think it's bad, I think it's really...
Willow ...sweet! It's certainly nothing I'll ever bring up again.
Angel I heard a rumor there was, uh, one less vampire walking around making a nuisance of himself.
Buffy There is. Guess I should thank you for the tip.
Angel Pleasure's mine.
Buffy Course, it would make things easier if I knew how to get in touch with you.
Angel I'll be around.
Buffy Or who you were?
Buffy Well... Anyway, you can have your jacket back.
Angel It looks better on you.
Buffy Oh boy!
Teacher All midterm papers will be exactly six pages long. No more, no less. One third of your grade will be dependent...
Teacher ...on those papers. No more, no less.
