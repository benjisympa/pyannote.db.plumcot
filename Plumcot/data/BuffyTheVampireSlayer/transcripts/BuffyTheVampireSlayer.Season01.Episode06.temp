Kyle Oh, look. It's Buffy and all her friends.
Buffy That's a witty.
Tor Do you ever wonder why nobody cool wants to hang out with you?
Buffy Just thankful.
Rhonda Were you this popular at your old school? Before you got kicked out?
Tor Careful! She might beat you up!
Xander Hey! Buffy!
Willow You missed it!
Buffy Missed what?
Xander We just saw the zebras mating! Thank you, very exciting...
Willow It was like the Heimlich, with stripes!
Buffy And I missed it. Yet somehow I'll find the courage to live on.
Willow Where were you?
Buffy Uh, I was looking at the fishes.
Willow Was it cool?
Buffy It was fishes.
Xander I'm feelin' that you're not in the field trip spirit here.
Buffy Well, it would... It's nothing, I... We do the same zoo trip at my old school every year. Same old, same old.
Xander Buffy, this isn't just about looking at a bunch of animals. This is about not being in class!
Buffy You know, you're right! Suddenly the animals look shiny and new.
Xander Gotta have perspective.
Kyle Lance! How's it goin'?
Lance Hey, Kyle.
Kyle So, is this like a, uh, family reunion?
Lance No.
Kyle I think it's a family reunion. It's so... touching. Doesn't anybody have a camera? Whapish!
Rhonda Hey, does your mom still pick out your lice, or are you old enough to do that yourself now?
Lance Quit it, huh? Hey! Guys, c'mon! It's got my notes in there!
Mr._Flutie What's going on here? I've had it up to here with you four! What're you doing?
Kyle Nothing.
Mr._Flutie Did I ask you to speak? Okay, I guess I did, but I want the truth. Lance?
Lance They weren't doing anything. Really! We were just playin' around.
Mr._Flutie Alright. I'll be watching you.
Kyle You! Came through big time.
Rhonda Way to go, Lance!
Tor Flutie's been looking for a reason to come down on us.
Lance It's okay.
Kyle Come on, we're gonna check out the Hyena House.
Lance But I think it's off-limits.
Kyle And therein, my friend, lies the fun.
Willow What are Kyle and his buds doing with Lance?
Xander Oh, playing with him as a cat plays with a mouse.
Buffy What is it with those guys?
Willow They're obnoxious. Professionally.
Xander Well, every school has 'em. So, you start a new school, you get your desks, some blackboards and some mean kids.
Buffy Yeah, well, I'd better extract Lance before...
Xander I'll handle it. This job doesn't require actual slaying.
Buffy You don't think we should follow?
Willow Kyle and those guys are jerks, but they're all talk. Mostly.
Buffy Why don't we...
Willow Yeah, why don't we?
Zookeeper Oh, hold it, hold it, are you blind, or are you just illiterate? Because hyenas are very quick to prey on the weak.
Buffy Oh, w-we were just gonna take...
Zookeeper You're not going in there. Anyone that does is in a world of trouble.
Willow No, no one's going in there.
Buffy Why is it off-limits?
Zookeeper It's a quarantine. These hyenas just came in from Africa, so keep out. Even if they call your name.
Buffy What are you talking about?
Zookeeper The Masai tribesmen told me that hyenas are capable of understanding human speech. They follow humans around by day, learning their names. At night, when the campfire dies, they call out to a person. Once they separate him, the pack devours them.
Kyle Cool!
Lance I don't see any hyenas.
Lance Okay! Now we've seen it.
Rhonda Looks cute.
Kyle I think it looks hungry.
Lance No!
Tor C'mon, Spot!
Lance C'mon, stop it!
Tor Supper time!
Lance Guys! Stop! It's not funny!
Lance Ow! Stop it! It's not funny!
Xander Why don't you pick on somebody your own species?
Kyle What, are *you* gonna get in my face?
Willow I thought Xander would be here by now.
Buffy Hmm, that'd make him on time. We couldn't have that!
Willow Did he seem upset at all on the bus back from the zoo?
Buffy About what?
Willow I dunno. He was quiet.
Buffy I didn't notice anything. But then again I'm not as hyperaware of him as, oh, say, for example, you.
Willow Hyperaware?
Buffy Well, I'm not constantly monitoring his health, his moods, his blood pressure...
Willow 130 over 80!
Buffy You got it bad, girl!
Willow He makes my head go tingly. You know what I mean?
Buffy I dimly recall.
Willow But it hasn't happened to you lately?
Buffy Not of late.
Willow Not even for a dangerous and mysterious older man whose leather jacket you're wearing right now?
Buffy Goes with the shoes!
Willow Come on, Angel pushes your buttons. You know he does.
Buffy I suppose some girls might find him good looking... ...if they have eyes, alright, he's a honey, but... it's just he's never around, and when he is, all he wants to do is talk about vampires, and... I, I just can't have a relationship...
Willow There he is!
Buffy Angel?
Willow Xander!
Xander Girls!
Buffy Boy!
Xander Sorry I'm late, I... just forgot that we were gonna be here. Hungry!
Willow Xander, you still want me to help you with geometry tomorrow? We can work after class...
Xander Yeah. What is this crap?
Buffy Well, it *was* my buttery croissant.
Xander Man, I need some food! Birds live on this!
Xander What?
Buffy What's up with you?
Willow Is something wrong? Did I do something?
Xander What could you possibly do? That's crazy talk. I'm just... restless.
Willow Well, we could go to the ice cream place...
Xander I like it here.
Buffy Okay, now what?
Xander You took a bath.
Buffy Yeah, I-I often do, I'm actually known for it.
Xander That's okay.
Buffy And the weird behavior award goes to...
Lyrics Oh, Reluctant Man
Buffy Oh, great. It's the winged monkeys.
Lyrics Who's afraid to touch the world / Why are you hiding? / What is the base of all your fears?
Lyrics Do you find yourself in a cold cruel world
Lyrics Dark and desperate, scared and lonely?
Lyrics Selfish Man / Who never gave to no one else / What are you holding? / Is it worth the price you pay?
Kyle Y'know, I don't understand why you're sitting at our table.
Lyrics 'Cause your eyes they see just what you want to see
Rhonda Yeah, shouldn't you be hovering over the football stadium with 'Goodyear' written on you?
Lyrics And I hope they're not staring blindly at me
Xander Kid's fat.
Giles Right! That's enough training for one day.
Buffy Well, that last roundhouse was kinda sloppy. Are you sure you don't wanna do it again?
Giles No! No, no, that's fine. You just... run along to class. While I wait for the feeling to return to my arms.
Mr._Flutie Look out! It's gotten loose!
Mr._Flutie Lordy, Herbert! Gave Mr. Flutie quite a scare, didn't he? Students, I'd like you all to met Herbert, our new mascot for the Sunnydale High Razorbacks!
Buffy He's so cute!
Mr._Flutie He's not cute. No! He's a fierce Razorback!
Buffy He doesn't look mean, Mr. Flutie.
Mr._Flutie He's mean, he's ready for action! See? Here are the tusks... the scary Razorback!
Buffy You're right. He's a fine mascot and will engender school spirit.
Mr._Flutie Uh, he better. Costs a fortune to feed him. Alright, let's get you back into your cage.
Mr._Flutie This way.
Xander I'm not getting this.
Willow It's simple, really. See, 'The bisector of a vertex is the line that divides the angle at that vertex into two equal parts.'
Xander It's like a big blur, all these numbers and angles.
Willow It's the same stuff from last week. You had it down then.
Xander Why do I need to learn this?
Willow 'Cause otherwise you'll flunk math?
Xander Explain the part where that's bad.
Willow You remember, you fail math, you flunk out of school, you end up being the guy at the pizza place that sweeps the floor and says, 'Hey, kids, where's the cool parties this weekend?' We've been through this. Do you have a headache?
Xander Yeah, and I think I know what's causing it. Ah! That's better, it goes right to the source of the pain.
Willow Xander...
Xander Look, forget it, okay? I don't get it. I won't ever. I don't care.
Willow We can finish this another time.
Mr._Flutie See, the problem is you kids today have no school spirit. Hold on, let me get his outfit off. Today it's all gangs and drugs and those movies on Showtime with the nudity. I don't have cable, I only heard. When I was your age we cared about the school's reputation and the football team's record, all that stuff! Of course, when I was your age I was surrounded by old guys telling me how much better things were when they were *my* age.
Buffy Yeah!
Coach_Harrold Alright, it's raining, all regular gym classes have been postponed, so you know what that means: dodgeball! Now, for those of you that may have forgotten, the rules are as follows: you dodge.
Coach_Harrold God, this game is brutal. I love it!
Willow Xander... What's wrong with you?
Xander I guess you've noticed that I've been different around you lately.
Willow Yes.
Xander I think, um... I think it's because my feelings for you have been changing.
Xander And, well, we've been friends for such a long time that I feel like I need to tell you something.
Xander I've, um... I've decided to drop geometry. So I won't be needing your math help anymore. Which means I won't have to look at your pasty face again.
Buffy You gonna say something to me?
Xander Dogs!
Kyle Where?
Boy#1 You're out of your mind, that's no way to play guitar.
Boy#2 What are you talking about?
Boy#1 I mean, that's just hunt and peck!
Boy#2 It's not!
Boy#1 Hey, Xander, you've heard Wretched Refuse play, what do you think of the guy who plays lead?
Boy#1 Hey. Hey, what are you guys...
Rhonda Shut up.
Kyle You're sharing.
Xander Friends like to share. Good?
Tor It's too well-done.
Boy#1 Hey! That is *not* cool.
Boy#1 Hey!
Xander Let's do lunch.
Lyrics I'm sure this rain won't last / I'm sure its time is up / Though it's pouring down
Lyrics I'm sure this rain won't last / And it falls on Job's eyes / This water of doubt / And I'm wading in lies / It's wearing me out / But if you want it, alright / I'll buy it / I'll buy it / I'll buy it / I'll buy it / I'll buy it / I'll...
Willow I've known him my whole life, Buffy.
Willow Well, we haven't always been close, but he's never...
Buffy I think something's wrong with him.
Willow Or maybe there's something wrong with me.
Buffy What are you talking about?
Willow C'mon. He's not picking on you. He's just sniffing you a lot. I don't know, maybe three isn't company anymore.
Buffy You think this has something to do with me?
Willow Of course.
Buffy No. That still doesn't explain why he's hanging out with the dode patrol. Something's going on. Something weird.
Willow What're you gonna do?
Buffy Talk to the expert on weird.
Giles Xander's taken to teasing the less fortunate?
Buffy Uh-huh.
Giles And, there's been a noticeable change in both clothing and demeanor?
Buffy Yes.
Giles And, well, otherwise all his spare time is spent lounging about with imbeciles.
Buffy It's bad, isn't it.
Giles It's devastating. He's turned into a sixteen-year-old boy. Course, you'll have to kill him.
Buffy Giles, I'm serious.
Giles So am I. Except for the part about killing him. Testosterone is a great equalizer. It turns all men into morons. He will, however, get over it.
Buffy I cannot believe that you, of all people, are trying to Scully me. There is something supernatural at work here. Get your books! Look stuff up!
Giles Look under what?
Buffy I don't know. That's your department.
Giles The evidence that you've presented me with is sketchy at best.
Buffy He scared the pig. Well, he did...
Giles Buffy, boys can be cruel. They tease, they, they, they prey on the weak. I-i-it's natural teen behavior pattern.
Buffy What did you just say?
Giles Um, they tease.
Buffy They prey on the weak. I've heard that somewhere bef... Xander has been acting totally wiggy ever since we went to the zoo. Him and Kyle and all those guys, they went into the hyena cage. Oh, God, that laugh...
Giles You're saying that, uh, Xander's becoming a hyena.
Buffy I don't know. Or been possessed by one? Not just Xander, all of them.
Giles Well, I-I-I've cer-certainly never heard of, uh...
Willow Herbert! They found him.
Buffy The pig?
Willow Dead. And also eaten. Principal Flutie's freaking out.
Buffy Testosterone, huh?
Willow What're you gonna do?
Giles Get my books. Look stuff up.
Mr._Flutie You four!
Kyle What?
Mr._Flutie Oh, don't think I don't know. Three kids saw you outside Herbert's room. You're busted! Yeah! You're goin' down.
Rhonda How is Herbert?
Heidi Crunchy!
Mr._Flutie That's it! My office, right now. Now!
Mr._Flutie You're gonna have so much detention, your grandchildren'll be staying after school.
Buffy Wow! Apparently Noah rejected the hyenas from the Ark because he thought they were an evil impure mixture of dogs and cats.
Willow Hyenas aren't well liked.
Buffy They do seem to be the schmoes of the animal kingdom.
Willow Why couldn't Xander be possessed by a puppy or, or some ducks?
Buffy That's assuming 'possession' is the right word.
Giles Oh, I'll say it is. The Masai of the Serengeti have spoken of animal possession for, for generations. I... I should have remembered that.
Buffy So how does it work?
Giles Well, apparently there's a, a sect of animal worshipers known as Primals. They believe that humanity, uh, consciousness, uh, the soul, is a, is a perversion, a dilution of spirit. Uh, to them the animal state is holy. They are able, through trans-possession, to, to, um, draw the spirit of certain animals into themselves.
Buffy And then they started acting like hyenas.
Giles Well, only the most predatory of animals are, are of interest to the Primals, so, uh, yes, yes, that would fit, yes.
Buffy So, what happens to the person once the spirit's in them?
Giles If it goes unchecked...
Buffy I gotta find Xander.
Buffy They are strong.
Buffy Xander.
Buffy This is ridiculous. We need to talk.
Xander Been waitin' for you to jump my bones.
Mr._Flutie I have seen some sick things in my life! Believe me! But this is beyond the pale! What is it with you people?
Mr._Flutie Is it drugs? How could you? A poor defenseless pig? What are you doing?
Buffy Get off of me.
Xander Is that what you really want? We both know what you really want. You want danger, don't cha? You like your men dangerous.
Buffy You're in trouble, Xander. You are infected with some hyena thing, it's like a demonic possession!
Xander Dangerous and mean, right? Like Angel. Your Mystery Guy. Well, guess who just got mean.
Mr._Flutie Now, stop that! You're only gonna make things worse for yourselves. I tell you how this is gonna work: I am gonna call your parents, and they are gonna take you all home.
Mr._Flutie Thank you.
Rhonda I'm sorry...
Mr._Flutie That is it!
Xander Do you know how long... I've waited... until you'd stop pretending that we aren't attracted...
Xander Until Willow... stops kidding herself... that I could settle with anyone but you?
Buffy Look, Xander, I don't wanna hurt you...
Xander Now do you wanna hurt me?
Xander Come on, Slayer. I like it when you're scared.
Xander The more I scare you, the better you smell.
Mr._Flutie You're about this close to expulsion, people! I'm willing to talk to the school counselor, and we can discuss options...
Mr._Flutie Get down from there this instant!
Mr._Flutie Are you insane?!
Buffy Hurry up. We gotta get him locked up somehow before he comes to.
Willow Oh, my God, Xander! What happened?
Buffy I hit him.
Willow With what?
Buffy A desk.
Buffy He tried his hand at felony sexual assault.
Willow Oh, Buffy, the hyena in him didn't...
Buffy No. No, but it's safe to say that in his animal state his idea of wooing doesn't involve a Yanni CD and a bottle of Chianti. There, that oughtta hold him. Where's Giles?
Willow He got called to some teacher's meeting. What are we gonna do? I mean... how do we get Xander back?
Buffy Right now I'm a little more worried about what the rest of the pack are up to.
Giles The rest of the pack were spotted outside Herbert the mascot's cage. They were sent to the principal's office.
Willow Good! That'll show 'em. Did it show 'em?
Buffy They didn't hurt him, did they?
Giles They, uh... ate him.
Buffy They ate Principal Flutie?
Willow Ate him up?
Giles The, uh, official theory is that wild dogs got into his office somehow. There was no one at the scene.
Willow But Xander didn't. He, he was with you.
Giles Oh! Uh, well, that's a small mercy.
Buffy Giles, how do we stop this? How do you trans-possess someone?
Giles I-I'm afraid I still don't have all the pieces. Um, the accounts of the Primals and their methods are a bit thin on the ground. There is some talk of a-a-a predatory act, but the exact ritual is, is, um... The Malleus Maleficarum deals in particulars of demonic possession, which... may apply... Yes, one, one should be able to transfer the spirits to another human.
Buffy Oh, that's great. Any volunteers?
Giles Oh. Good point.
Buffy What we need to do is put the hyena back in the hyena.
Giles B-but until we know more, uh...
Buffy Betcha that zookeeper could tell us. Maybe he didn't quarantine those hyenas because they were sick.
Giles We should talk to him.
Buffy Okay. Oh, wait, somebody's gotta watch Xander.
Willow I will.
Buffy Will, are you sure? If he wakes up...
Willow I'll be alright. Go.
Buffy C'mon.
Xander Willow.
Willow How are you feeling?
Xander Like somebody hit me with a desk. What am I doin' here?
Willow You're... resting?
Xander You guys got me locked up now.
Willow 'Cause you're sick. Buffy said...
Xander Oh, yeah. Buffy and her all-purpose solution: punch 'em out 'n' knock 'em down. I'd love to see what she'd do to somebody who was *really* sick.
Willow That's not fair. Buffy saved both of our lives.
Xander Before she came here our lives didn't need that much saving, did they? Weren't things a lot simpler when it was just you and me?
Willow Maybe...
Xander When we were alone together... Willow, I know there's something wrong with me. I think it's gettin' worse. But I can't just stand around waitin' for Buffy to decide it's time to punch me out again. Look, I want you to help me. I want you.
Willow I am helping you.
Xander You're doing what you're told.
Willow Buffy's trying to help you, too. You know that. Or Xander does.
Xander Yeah... Buffy's so selfless. Always thinking of us. Well, if I'm so dangerous, how come she left you alone with me?
Willow I told her to.
Xander Why?
Willow 'Cause I know you better than she does... and I wanted to be here to see if... you were still you.
Xander You know I am. Look at me. Looook.
Willow Xander...
Willow Now I know.
Xander LET ME OUT! LET ME OUT!
Zookeeper The students have been possessed by the hyenas?
Giles Yes.
Zookeeper Are you sure?
Buffy We're really, really sure.
Giles Y-you don't seem enormously surprised by this.
Zookeeper The zoo imported those hyenas from Africa. There was something strange about them from day one. I did some homework... That particular breed is very rare. Totally vicious. Historically they were worshipped by these guys...
Giles Primals.
Zookeeper Yeah! Creepy guys! Now, they had rituals for taking the hyena spirits, but I-I don't see how that coulda happened to your kids.
Giles Uh, we don't know exactly how the ritual works. We know that it involves a, um, um... predatory act and some kind of symbol.
Zookeeper Predatory act? Of course. That makes sense. Where did you read that?
Giles Do you have Sherman Jeffries' work on, on cults and on...
Buffy Boys?
Giles Sorry.
Zookeeper Look.
Giles Sorry.
Zookeeper Look. I think we may have enough information so that together we could pull off a reverse trans-possession.
Buffy What do we do?
Zookeeper We've gotta get those possessed students over to the hyena cage right away. I'll meet you there. We can begin the rituals.
Buffy W-well, we can guarantee one of them, but there are four more, and we have no idea where they are.
Zookeeper No, I wouldn't worry about that. After hyenas feed and rest they will track the missing member of their pack until they find him. They should come right to you.
Buffy Willow!
Xander Willow...
Willow I'm not listening.
Kyle Wiiillooow...
Kyle Wiiillooow...
Willow Xander, shut up!
Kyle Wiiillooow...
Giles Run!
Buffy I think they're going.
Willow They could be faking it.
Buffy No, they're hungry. They'll be looking for somebody weak. I'm really sorry, Will. I didn't know they were gonna come after Xander.
Willow It's okay.
Giles We must lead them back to the zoo if we're going to stop this.
Buffy And before their next meal. Guess that's my job.
Giles Well, individually they're almost as strong as you. As a group they're...
Buffy They're tough, but I think they're getting stupider. You guys go to the zoo and I will bring them to you.
Mr._Anderson I didn't say she looks better than you, I said she looks better.
Mrs._Anderson I heard what I heard. Joey, chew! You have to chew or you'll choke!
Mr._Anderson I don't see why we have to have this conversation every time we see them.
Mrs._Anderson I didn't start it.
Mr._Anderson Damn. Where are the keys?
Mrs._Anderson Huh?
Mr._Anderson What going on?! Hey! Get off! Get off of there!
Joey Get away!
Mrs._Anderson Joey! Joey! Joey!
Mrs._Anderson Joey!
Buffy Didn't your mom teach you? Don't play with your food.
Buffy C'mon. You know what you want.
Willow The pathway to the Hyena House. Where's the zookeeper?
Giles Uh, he must be inside. I-I'll go in and prepare things. You just warn, uh, us when you hear Buffy and the others approaching.
Giles Doctor? Uh... Zookeeper?
Giles Oh! Oh, of course, the, uh, Masai ceremonial garb. Yes... Very good. Are you, uh, otherwise prepared for the trans-possession?
Zookeeper Almost.
Giles Oh, right! The, uh, sacred circle. Yes, you'd need that to, um... This would be here when... when the children first came. Why would you... How terribly frustrating for you, that a bunch of school children could accomplish what you could not.
Zookeeper It bothered me. But the power will be mine.
Willow They're almost here! Giles! Giles! Where are the hyenas for the trans-possession?
Zookeeper They're right here in the feeding area.
Zookeeper Stay back! They haven't been fed.
Willow Where's Giles?
Zookeeper He's... laying in wait.
Willow They're almost here. Shouldn't you bring the hyenas out?
Zookeeper When the time is right. I'm gonna need your help.
Buffy They're right behind me!
Willow That's Buffy! Get ready!
Zookeeper Here.
Willow What is this?
Zookeeper A predatory act, remember?
Willow Uh, right. You'll pretend to slash my throat and, and put the evil in the hyenas?
Zookeeper Something like that.
Willow Buffy, it's a trap!
Zookeeper YU BA YA SA NA!
Xander Willow!
Giles Uh, did I miss anything?
Willow I heard the vice-principal's taking over till they can find a replacement.
Buffy It shouldn't be too hard to find a new principal. Unless they ask what happened to the last one.
Xander Okay, but I had nothing to do with that, right?
Buffy Oh, right.
Willow You only ate the pig.
Xander I ate a pig? Was it cooked and called bacon or...
Xander Oh, my God! I ate a pig? I mean, the whole trichinosis issue aside, yuck!
Buffy Well, it wasn't really you.
Xander Well, I remember I was goin' on the field trip, and then goin' down to the Hyena House, and next thing some guy's holding Willow and he's got a knife.
Willow You saved my life.
Xander Hey! Nobody messes with my Willow.
Buffy This is definitely the superior Xander. Accept no substitutes.
Xander I didn't do anything else, did I, around you guys or anything embarrassing?
Buffy Nah!
Willow Not at all.
Buffy C'mon. We're gonna be late.
Willow See you at lunch.
Xander Cool! Oh, hey, goin' vegetarian! Huh?
Giles I've been reading up on my, uh, animal possession, and I cannot find anything anywhere about memory loss afterwards.
Xander Did you tell them that?
Giles Your secret dies with me.
Xander Shoot me, stuff me, mount me.
