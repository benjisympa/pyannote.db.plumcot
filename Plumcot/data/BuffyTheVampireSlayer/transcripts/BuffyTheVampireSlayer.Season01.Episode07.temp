Master Zachary didn't return from the hunt last night.
Darla The Slayer.
Master Zachary was strong, and he was careful. And still the Slayer takes him... as she has taken so many of my family. It wears thin. Collin, what would you do about it?
Collin I'd annihilate her.
Master Out of the mouths of babes...
Darla Let me do it, Master. Let me kill her for you.
Master You have a personal interest in this.
Darla I don't get to have any fun.
Master I will send the Three.
Darla The Three?
Boy Get it! Go get it, right there!
Girl I got it!
Girl Free drink, please.
Willow Ah, the fumigation party.
Buffy Hmm?
Willow It's an annual tradition. The closing of the Bronze for a few days to nuke the cockroaches?
Buffy Oh.
Willow It's a lot of fun... What's it like where *you* are?
Buffy I'm... sorry, I was just... thinking about things...
Willow So, we're talking about a guy?
Buffy Not exactly a guy. For us to have a conversation about a guy, there'd have to be a guy for us to have a conversation about. Is that a sentence?
Willow You lack a guy.
Buffy I do. Which is fine with me, most of the time, but...
Willow What about Angel?
Buffy Angel? I can just see him in a relationship. 'Hi, honey, you're in grave danger. I'll see you next month.'
Willow He's not around much, it's true.
Buffy When he is around... it's like the lights dim everywhere else. You know how it's like that with some guys?
Willow Oh, yeah!
Xander Hey, Annie! Dino, just leaving!
Cordelia Ouch! Please get your extreme oafishness off my two-hundred-dollar shoes!
Xander I'm sorry, I was just...
Cordelia ...getting off the dance floor before Annie Vega's boyfriend squashes you like a bug?
Xander Oh, so you noticed.
Cordelia Uh-huh.
Xander Yeah, thanks for being so understanding.
Cordelia Sure.
Xander Y'know, hey, I don't know what everyone's talking about. That outfit doesn't make you look like a hooker!
Xander Boy, that Cordelia is a regular breath of vile air. What are you vixens up to?
Willow Just sitting here, watching our barren lives pass us by. Oh, look, a cockroach.
Xander Whoa, well, let's stop this crazy whirligig of fun! I'm dizzy!
Buffy Alright, now I'm infecting those nearest and dear to me. I'm gonna call it a night.
Willow Oh, don't go!
Xander Uh, yeah! It's early! We could, um, dance!
Buffy Rain check? Good night.
Willow Want a free drink?
Buffy It's late, I'm tired, and I don't wanna play games. Show yourself.
Buffy Wuh!
Buffy Ooo! Okay, okay, nice...
Buffy Okay, okay... Look, I really don't wanna fight all three of you... unless I have to.
Angel Good dogs don't... ...*bite*!
Buffy Look out!
Buffy Run!
Buffy Get in! C'mon!
Angel It's alright. A vampire can't come in unless it's invited.
Buffy I've heard that before, but I've never put it to the test. Oh... I'll go get some bandages, just... take your jacket and your shirt off.
Buffy Nice tattoo. I was lucky you came along. How did you happen to come along?
Angel I live nearby. I was just out walking.
Buffy So, you weren't following me? I just had this feeling you were.
Angel Why would I do that?
Buffy You tell me. You're the Mystery Guy that appears out of nowhere. I'm not saying I'm not happy about it tonight, but... if you are hanging around I'd like to know why.
Angel Maybe I like you.
Buffy Maybe...
Joyce Hi! What are you doing?
Buffy There's a lot of weird people outside at night...
Buffy ...I just feel better with you safe and sound inside. You must be beat.
Joyce I am. We're a little gallery. You have no idea how much...
Buffy Well, then why don't you go upstairs and get into bed, and I can bring you some hot tea?
Joyce That's sweet! What'd you do?
Buffy Can't a daughter just be concerned about her mother?
Joyce Hi.
Angel Hi.
Buffy Oh! Okay... Um... Angel, uh, this is my mom. Mom, this is Angel. Uh, we ran into each other on the way home.
Angel Nice to meet you.
Joyce What do you do, Angel?
Buffy He's a student. Uh, first year community college. Angel's been helping me with my history, you know I've been toiling there.
Joyce It's a little late for tutoring. I'm gonna go to bed, and, uh, Buffy?
Buffy I'll say good night and do the same!
Joyce It was nice to meet you.
Buffy Good night! We'll hook up soon and do that study thing!
Angel Look, I don't wanna get you in any more trouble...
Buffy And I don't wanna get you dead. They could still be out there. So, uh, oh... two of us, one bed. That doesn't work. Um, why don't you take the bed? Y'know, you're wounded...
Angel I'll take the floor.
Buffy Uh, no, that's not...
Angel Oh, believe me, I've had worse.
Buffy Okay. Um, then why don't you check and see if the Fang Gang is still loitering and, um, keep your back turned while I change?
Angel I don't see them.
Buffy Y'know, I'm the Chosen One, it's my job to fight guys like that. What's your excuse?
Angel Uh, somebody has to.
Buffy Well, what does your family think of your career choice?
Angel They're dead.
Buffy Was it vampires?
Angel I-it was.
Buffy I'm sorry.
Angel It was a long while ago.
Buffy So, this is a vengeance gig for you.
Angel Y-you even look pretty when you go to sleep.
Buffy Well, when I wake up it's an entirely different story.
Buffy Here. Sleep tight.
Buffy Angel?
Angel Hmm?
Buffy Do you snore?
Angel I don't know. It's been a long time since anybody's been in a position to let me know.
Xander He spent the night? In your room? In your bed?
Buffy Not *in* my bed, *by* my bed.
Willow That is so romantic! Did you, uh... I mean, did he, uh...
Buffy Perfect gentleman.
Xander Buffy, c'mon, wake up and smell the seduction. It's the oldest trick in the book.
Buffy What? Saving my life? Getting slashed in the ribs?
Xander Duh! I mean, guys'll do anything to impress a girl. I-I once drank an entire gallon of Gatorade without taking a breath.
Willow It was pretty impressive. Although later there was an ick factor.
Giles Can we steer this riveting conversation back to the events that happened earlier in the evening? You left the Bronze and were set upon by three unusually virile vampires. Did they look like this?
Buffy Yeah. What's with the uniforms?
Giles It seems you encountered the Three. Warrior vampires, very proud and very strong.
Willow How is it you always know this stuff? You always know what's going on. I never know what's going on.
Giles Well, you weren't here from midnight until six researching it.
Willow No, I was sleeping.
Giles Uh, o-obviously you're hurting the Master very much. He, he wouldn't send the, the Three for just anyone. We must step up our training with weapons.
Xander Buffy, you should stay at my house until these Samurai guys are history.
Buffy What?
Xander Ah-ah-ah, don't worry about Angel, Willow can run to your house and tell him to get out of town fast.
Giles Angel and Buffy are, are not in any immediate jeopardy. Eventually the Master will send someone else, but in the mean time the Three, having failed, will offer their own lives in penance.
Vampire We failed in our duty, and now our lives belong to you.
Master Pay attention, child. You are the Anointed, and there is much you must learn. With power comes responsibility. True, they did fail, but also true, we who walk at night share a common bond. The taking of a life I'm not talking about humans, of course is a serious matter.
Collin So you would spare them?
Master Hmm. I am weary, and their deaths will bring me little joy.
Master Of course, sometimes a little is enough.
Buffy Cool! Crossbow! Huh. Check out these babies. Hmm. Goodbye stakes, hello flying fatality. What can I shoot?
Giles Um, nothing. The crossbow comes later.
Giles You must first become proficient with the basic tools of combat. And let's begin... ...with the quarterstaff. Which, incidentally, will, uh, require countless hours of vigorous training. I speak from experience.
Buffy Giles, 20th Century? I'm not gonna be fighting Friar Tuck.
Giles You never know with whom or what you'll be fighting. And these traditions have been handed down through the ages. Now, you show me good, steady progress with the quarterstaff, and in due course we'll discuss the crossbow. Put on your pads.
Buffy I'm not gonna need pads to fight you.
Giles Well, we'll see about that. En garde!
Giles Good. Let's move on to the crossbow.
Buffy Angel?
Angel Hey.
Buffy Brought you some dinner. It's a little plateless, sorry.
Buffy So! What'd you do all day?
Angel Uh, I read a little.
Angel And just thought about a lot of things. Buffy, I...
Buffy My diary? You read my diary? That is *not* okay! A diary is like a person's most private place! I... You don't even know what I was writing about! 'Hunk' can mean a lot of things, bad things. And, and when it says that your eyes are 'penetrating', I meant to write 'bulging'.
Angel Buffy...
Buffy And 'A' doesn't even stand for 'Angel' for that matter, it stands for... 'Achmed', a charming foreign exchange student, so that whole fantasy part has nothing to even do with you at all...
Angel Your mother moved your diary when she came in to straighten up. I watched from the closet. I didn't read it, I swear.
Buffy Oh! Oh.
Angel I did a lot of thinking today. I really can't be around you. Because when I am...
Buffy Hey, no big. Water... over the bridge, under the bridge...
Angel When I am all I can ever think about is how badly I want to kiss you.
Buffy ...over the dam... Kiss me?
Angel I'm older than you, and this can't ever... I better go.
Buffy H-how much older?
Angel I should...
Buffy ...go... You said...
Buffy What? What is it? What's wrong?
Joyce Buffy, what happened?
Buffy Uh, nothing. I saw a shadow.
Willow Angel's a vampire?
Buffy I can't believe this is happening. One minute we were kissing, and the next minute... Can a vampire ever be a good person? Couldn't it happen?
Giles A vampire isn't a person at all. It may have the movements, the, the memories, even the personality of the person that it took over, but i-it's still a demon at the core, there is no halfway.
Willow So that'd be a no, huh?
Buffy Well, then what was he doing? Why was he good to me? Was it all some part of the Master's plan? It doesn't make sense!
Xander Alright, uh... ...you have a problem, and it's not a small one. Let's take a breath and look at this calmly and objectively. Angel's a vampire. You're a Slayer. I think it's obvious what you have to do.
Giles Uh, it is a Slayer's duty...
Xander I-I know you have feelings for this guy, but it's not like you're in love with him, right?
Xander You're in love with a vampire?! What, are you outta your mind?!
Cordelia What?!
Xander Not vampire... How could you love an umpire? Everyone hates 'em!
Cordelia Where did you get that dress? This is a one-of-a-kind Todd Oldham. Do you know how much this dress cost? Is this a knockoff? This is a knockoff, isn't it?! Some cheesy knockoff! This is exactly what happens when you sign these free trade agreements!
Buffy You think *we* have problems...
Angel Who's here?
Darla A friend.
Darla Hi. It's been a while.
Angel A lifetime.
Darla Or two, but who's counting?
Angel What's with the Catholic schoolgirl look? Last time I saw you it was kimonos.
Darla And last time I saw you it wasn't high school girls. Don't cha like? Remember Budapest? Turn of the century? You were such a bad boy during that earthquake.
Angel You did some damage yourself.
Darla Is there anything better than a natural disaster? The panic. The people lost in the streets. It's like picking fruit off the vine. Nice! You're living above ground, like one of them. You and your new friend are attacking us, like one of them. But guess what, precious? You're not one of them.
Darla Are you?
Angel No. But I'm not exactly one of you either.
Darla Is that what you tell yourself these days?
Darla You're not exactly living off quiche. You and I both know what you hunger for. What you need. Hey, it's nothing to be ashamed of. It's who we are. It's what makes eternal life worth living. Mm. You can only suppress your real nature for so long. You can feel it brewing inside of you. I hope I'm around when it explodes.
Angel Maybe you don't wanna be.
Darla I'm not afraid of you. I bet she is, though. Or maybe I'm underestimating her. Talk to her. Tell her about the curse. Maybe she'll come around. And if she still doesn't trust you, you know where I'll be.
Giles Here's something at last.
Xander Can you please warn us before you do that?
Giles There's nothing about Angel in the texts, but it suddenly occurred to me that it's been ages since I've read the diaries of any of the watchers before me.
Willow That musta been so embarrassing when you thought he had read your diary, but then it turned out he hadn't, but then he felt the same way... I'm listening.
Giles There's mention some two hundred years ago in Ireland of, of Angelus, the one with the angelic face.
Buffy They got that right.
Xander I'm not saying anything, I have nothing to say.
Giles Does this, uh, Angel have, um, a tattoo behind his right shoulder?
Buffy Yeah, it's a, it's a bird or something.
Xander Now I'm sayin' something. You saw him naked?
Willow So, Angel's been around for a while.
Giles Not long for a vampire. Uh, two hundred and forty years or so.
Buffy Huh! Two hundred and forty. Well, he said he was older.
Giles Angelus leaves Ireland, uh, wreaks havoc in, in Europe for, uh, several decades, and then, um, about eighty years ago, the most curious thing happens. He, he comes to, uh, to America, um, shuns other vampires, and, and lives alone. There's, there's no, no record of him hunting here.
Willow So he *is* a good vampire! I mean, on a scale of one to ten, ten being someone who's killing and maiming every night, and one being someone who's... not.
Giles I say that there's no record, but, uh, vampires hunt and kill. It's, it's what they do.
Xander Fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly.
Buffy He could've fed on me. He didn't.
Xander Question: a hundred years or so before he came to our shores, what was he like then?
Giles Uh, like all of them. Uh, a vicious, violent animal.
Darla Don't think I'm not grateful, you letting me kill the Three.
Master How can my children learn if I do everything for them?
Darla But you've gotta let me take care of the Slayer.
Master Oh! You're giving me orders now!
Darla Okay, then, we'll just do nothing while she takes us out one by one.
Master Do I sense a plan, Darla? Share...
Darla Angel kills her and comes back to the fold.
Master Angel! He was the most vicious creature I ever met. I miss him.
Darla So do I.
Master Why would he kill her if he feels for her?
Darla To keep her from killing him.
Master Hmm. You see how we all work together for the common good? That's how a family is supposed to function!
Willow Okay, so let's review.
Willow Reconstruction began when? Buffy?
Buffy Huh? Oh! Um, reconstruction... Uh, reconstruction began after the... construction, which was... shoddy, so they had to reconstruct.
Willow After the destruction of the Civil War.
Buffy Right. Civil War. During which Angel was already, like, a hundred and change...
Willow Are we gonna talk about boys, or are we gonna help you pass history?
Willow Sometimes I have this fantasy that Xander's just gonna grab me and kiss me right on the lips.
Buffy You want Xander, you've gotta speak up, girl!
Willow No, no, no, no. No speaking up. That way leads to madness and sweaty palms.
Willow Okay, so here's something I gotta know. When Angel kissed you... I mean before he turned into... how was it?
Buffy Unbelievable!
Willow Wow! And it is kinda novel how he'll stay young and handsome forever, although you'll still get wrinkly and die, and... Oh, and what about the children? I'll be quiet now.
Buffy No, it's okay. I need to hear this. I need to get over him so I can...
Willow So that you can...
Buffy Like Xander said, I'm the Slayer, and he's a... vampire. God, I can't! He's never done anything to hurt me... Okay, no, I need to stop thinking about this. Okay, let's give another half an hour and maybe something will sink in. And then I'm going home for some major moping.
Willow Okay. The era of the congressional reconstruction, usually called radical...
Joyce Hello?
Darla Hi! I'm Darla? A friend of Buffy's?
Joyce Oh! Nice to meet you.
Darla She didn't mention anything about me coming over for a study date, did she?
Joyce No, I thought she was studying with Willow at the library.
Darla She is. Willow's the Civil War expert, but then I was supposed to help her with the War of Independence. My family kinda goes back to those days.
Joyce Well, I, I know she's supposed to be home soon. Would you like to come in and wait?
Darla It's very nice of you to invite me into your home.
Joyce You're welcome. I've been wrestling with the IRS all night. Would you like something to eat?
Darla Yes, I would!
Joyce Let's see what we have. Do you feel like something little or something big?
Darla Something big!
Angel Let her go!
Darla I just had a little, there's plenty more. Aren't you hungry for something warm after all this time? Come on, Angel. Just say 'Yes'!
Darla Welcome home!
Buffy Hey! I'm home.
Buffy You're not welcome here. You come near us and I'll kill you.
Buffy Mom! Mom, can you hear me?! Yes, I need an ambulance, 1630 Revello Drive! My mother cut herself, she lost a lot of blood! Please, please hurry! Mom!
Xander Hey, Buffy!
Xander Oh, my God!
Willow What happened?!
Buffy Angel!
Buffy Do you remember anything, Mom?
Joyce Just, um, your friend came over... I was gonna make a snack...
Buffy My friend?
Joyce I guess I slipped and cut my neck on... The doctor said it looked like a barbecue fork. We don't have a barbecue fork. Are you another doctor?
Buffy Oh! Um... No, Mom, this is Mr. Giles.
Joyce Oh, the librarian from your school! What's he doing here?
Giles Uh, I-I just came to pay my respects, wish you a speedy recovery.
Joyce Boy, the teachers really *do* care in this town.
Buffy Get some rest now.
Buffy She's gonna be okay. They, they gave her some iron... Her, uh, blood count was a, a little...
Giles ...a little low. It presents itself like mild anemia. Uh, you, you were, uh, lucky you got to her as soon as you did.
Buffy Lucky? Stupid.
Xander Buff, it's not your fault.
Buffy No? I invited him into my home. Even after I knew who he was, what he was, and I didn't do anything about it... 'cause I had feelings for him, because I cared about him.
Willow If you care about somebody you care about them. You can't change that by...
Buffy ...killing them? Maybe not. But I think it's a start.
Xander Uh, we'll keep an eye on your mom.
Giles Buffy!
Buffy You can't stop me. The Three found me near the Bronze and so did he. He lives nearby.
Giles This is no ordinary vampire. If there is such a thing. Now, he knows you, he, he's faced the Three! I think this is gonna take more than a simple stake.
Buffy So do I.
Darla She's out hunting you right now.
Darla She wants to kill you.
Angel Leave me alone.
Darla What did you think? Did you think she would understand? That she would look at your face... your true face... and give you a kiss?
Darla For a hundred years you've not had a moment's peace because you will not accept who you are. That's all you have to do. Accept it. Don't let her hunt you down. Don't whimper and mewl like a mangy human. Kill! Feed! Live!
Angel Alright!
Darla What do you want?
Angel I want it finished!
Darla That's good. You're hurting me. That's good, too.
Joyce She talks about you all the time.
Joyce It's important to have teachers who make an impression.
Giles She makes quite an impression herself.
Joyce I-I know she's having trouble with history. I-is it too difficult for her or is she not applying herself?
Giles She lives very much in the 'now', um, and, uh, history, of course, is, is very much about the, uh... the 'then'. B-b-but there's no reason...
Joyce She's studying with Willow, she's studying with Darla, I-I mean, she is trying.
Giles Darla? I-I-I don't believe I know, uh...
Joyce Her friend, the one who came over tonight.
Giles Darla came to your house tonight? Sh-she's the friend that you mentioned earlier?
Joyce Poor thing, I must've frightened her half to death when I fainted. Someone should really check and make sure she's alright.
Giles Yes, someone should, right away. I'll do it.
Joyce That school is amazing!
Giles We have a problem.
Buffy I know you're there. And I know what you are.
Angel Do you?
Angel I'm just an animal, right?
Buffy You're not an animal. Animals I like.
Angel Let's get it done!
Angel C'mon! Don't go soft on me now!
Angel Little wide.
Buffy Why? Why didn't you just attack me when you had the chance? Was it a joke? To make me feel for you and then... I've killed a lot of vampires. I've never hated one before.
Angel Feels good, doesn't it? Feels simple.
Buffy I invited you into my home and then you attacked my family!
Angel Why not? I killed mine. I killed their friends... and their friend's children... For a hundred years I offered ugly death to everyone I met, and I did it with a song in my heart.
Buffy What changed?
Angel Fed on a girl about your age... beautiful... dumb as a post... but a favorite among her clan.
Buffy Her clan?
Angel Romany. Gypsies. The elders conjured the perfect punishment for me. They restored my soul.
Buffy What, they were all out of boils and blinding torment?
Angel When you become a vampire the demon takes your body, but it doesn't get your soul. That's gone! No conscience, no remorse... It's an easy way to live. You have no idea what it's like to have done the things I've done... and to care. I haven't fed on a living human being since that day.
Buffy So you started with my mom?
Angel I didn't bite her.
Buffy Then why didn't you say something?
Angel But I wanted to. I can walk like a man, but I'm not one. I wanted to kill you tonight.
Buffy Go ahead.
Buffy Not as easy as it looks.
Darla Sure it is!
Willow We're near the Bronze. What now?
Giles Keep looking for her.
Xander I have a question: what if we find her and she's fighting Angel and some of his friends? What the heck are we gonna do about it?
Darla Do you know what the saddest thing in the world is?
Buffy Bad hair on top of that outfit?
Darla To love someone who used to love you.
Buffy You guys were involved?
Darla For several generations.
Buffy Well, you been around since Columbus, you are bound to pile up a few ex's. You're older than him, right? Just between us girls, you are looking a little worn around the eyes.
Darla I made him. There was a time when we shared everything, wasn't there Angelus? You had a chance to come home, to rule with me in the Master's court for a thousand years, but you threw that away because of her. You love someone who hates us. You're sick. And you'll always be sick. And you'll always remember what it was like to watch her die. You don't think I came alone, do you?
Buffy I know I didn't.
Darla Hmm, scary.
Darla Scarier!
Darla Oh, don't worry. Bullets can't kill vampires. Can hurt them like hell, but...
Xander Did you just hear...
Darla So many body parts, so few bullets. Let's begin with the kneecaps. No fun dancing without them.
Darla Close, but no heart.
Xander We need to distract her, fast!
Willow Buffy, it wasn't Angel who attacked your mom, it was Darla!
Darla C'mon, Buffy. Take it like a man!
Darla Angel?
Collin Forget her.
Master How dare you? She was my favorite. For four hundred years...
Collin She was weak. You don't need her. I'll bring you the Slayer.
Master But to lose her to Angel! He was to have sat at my right hand, come the day. And now...
Collin They're all against you. But soon you shall rise. And when you do... ...we kill them all.
Xander Ah, the post-fumigation party.
Buffy Okay, so what's the difference between this and the pre-fumigation party?
Xander Much hardier cockroaches.
Willow So, no word from Angel?
Buffy Nah. It's weird, though. In his way I feel like he's still watching me.
Willow Well, in a way he sort of is. In the way of that he's right over there.
Xander I don't need to watch because I'm not threatened. Just gonna look this way.
Lyrics Did they know what they wanted / The times they kissed me? / And your hands / I held in mine
Angel I just wanted to see if you were okay. And your mother.
Buffy We're both good. You?
Angel If I can go a little while without getting shot or stabbed I'll be alright. Look, this can't...
Buffy ...ever be anything. I know. For one thing, you're, like, two hundred and twenty-four years older than I am.
Angel I just gotta... I gotta walk away from this.
Buffy I know. Me, too. One of us has to go here.
Angel I know.
Lyrics Your eyes / That always make me shiver / Now they are closed / They just sometimes twitch a little
Xander What's going on?
Willow Nothin'...
Xander Well, as long as they're not kissing.
Lyrics And your body / I could hold for an hour / It sent me to Heaven / With its heat and power
Buffy You okay?
Angel It's just...
Buffy ...painful. I know. See you around?
Lyrics I'll remember you / You will be there in my heart / I'll remember you / And that is all that I can do / But I'll remember
