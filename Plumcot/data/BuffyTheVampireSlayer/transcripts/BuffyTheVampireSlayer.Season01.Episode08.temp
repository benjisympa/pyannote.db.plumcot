Buffy Oh, great! A book!
Giles Oh, uh, I, uh... haven't gone through the new arrivals. Uh, put it in, uh, in, in that pile.
Dave Here, I'll get it.
Buffy Oh, thanks, Dave. The Willow pile.
Giles Uh, when I've examined it, you can, uh, uh, skim it.
Ms._Calendar Scan it, Rupert. That's scan it.
Giles Of course.
Ms._Calendar Oh, I know, our ways are strange to you, but soon you will join us in the 20th century. With three whole years to spare!
Giles Ms. Calendar, I'm sure your computer science class is fascinating, but I happen to believe that one can survive in modern society without being a slave to the, um, idiot box.
Ms._Calendar That's TV. The idiot box is TV. This is the *good* box!
Giles I still prefer a good book.
Fritz The printed page is obsolete. Information isn't bound up anymore. It's an entity. The only reality is virtual. If you're not jacked in, you're not alive.
Ms._Calendar Thank you, Fritz, for making us all sound like crazy people. Fritz, Fritz comes on a little strong, but he does have a point. You know, for the last two years more e-mail was sent than regular mail.
Giles Oh...
Ms._Calendar More digitized information went across phone lines than conversation.
Giles That is a fact that I regard with genuine horror.
Ms._Calendar I'll bet it is. Alright, guys, let's wrap it up for today.
Willow I've just got a few more. I'll hang for a bit.
Ms._Calendar Cool! Thanks.
Willow Xander, you wanna stay and help me?
Xander Are you kidding?
Willow Yes, it was a joke I made up.
Xander Willow, I love you, but bye!
Willow See you tomorrow!
Xander Buffy, wait up!
Giles I'm, I'm just gonna stay and clean up a little. I'll, uh, I'll be back in the middle ages.
Ms._Calendar Did you ever leave?
Moloch Where am I?
Buffy Willow! Willow, hey, wait up!
Willow Oh, Buffy, I didn't even see you.
Buffy Or hear me. What was up last night? I tried your line, like, a million times.
Willow Oh, I was, I was talking.
Buffy Talking to...? Okay, that's it, you have a secret, and that's not allowed.
Willow Why not?
Buffy 'Cause... there's a rule.
Willow Well, I sort of met someone.
Buffy I knew it! This is so important! When did you meet?
Willow Last week after we did the scanning project in the library.
Buffy Does he go here? What's his name? Have you kissed him? What's he like?
Willow No, Malcolm, no, and very nice.
Buffy You are a thing of evil for not telling me this right away!
Willow Well, I wasn't sure there was anything to tell. But last night, oh! We talked all night, it was amazing. He's so smart, Buffy, and, and he's romantic, and we agree about everything!
Buffy What's he look like?
Willow I don't know!
Dave Yes, I will. I promise.
Buffy So, you've been seeing a guy, and you don't know what he looks like? Okay, this is a puzzle. No, wait, I'm good at these. Does it involve a midget and a block of ice?
Willow I met him online.
Buffy On line for what?
Buffy Oh!
Ms._Calendar Morning, kids!
Ms._Calendar Buffy, are you supposed to be somewhere?
Buffy No, I have a free.
Ms._Calendar Cool! But this is lab time, so let's make it a nice, short visit, okay?
Buffy Sure.
PC You have mail.
Willow It's him!
Message I'm thinking of you.
Willow He's so sweet!
Buffy He's a sweetie.
Willow What should I write back?
Buffy Uh, Willow, I think it's really great that you have this cool pen pal, but don't you think you're kinda rushing all into this? Y'know what I mean?
Willow 'I'm thinking of you, too!' No, that's incredibly stupid!
Buffy Will, down girl! Let's focus here, okay? What do you actually know about this guy?
Willow Oh, see, I knew you'd react like this.
Buffy Like what?
Buffy I just wanna make sure you're careful, that's all.
Willow Buffy...
Buffy He could be different than you think.
Moloch Watch her.
Willow His name is Malcolm Black, he's eighteen, he lives in Elmwood, which is about eighty miles from here, and he likes me!
Buffy Short, tall, skinny, fat?
Willow Why does everything have to be about looks?
Buffy Not everything, but some stuff is. I mean, what if you guys get really, really intense, and then you find out that he... has... a hairy back?
Willow Well, no! Uh, he doesn't talk like somebody who would have a hairy back. And anyways, that stuff doesn't matter when you really care about each other. Maybe I'm not his ideal either.
Buffy Hey, I'm just trying to make sure that he's good enough for you. I think it's great that you met someone.
Ms._Calendar Hey, Fritz... I'm, uh, lookin' at the logs. You and Dave are clockin' a pretty scary amount of computer time.
Fritz New project.
Ms._Calendar Ooo, will I be excited?
Fritz You'll die.
Boy This isn't my report! 'Nazi Germany was a model of a well ordered society'? I didn't write that! Who's been in my files?
Xander Hup, guess who?
Willow Uh, Xander?
Xander Yeah, but keep guessing anyway.
Willow Xander.
Xander Oh, I can't fool ya, you see right through my petty charade. We goin' to the Bronze tonight?
Willow Not me, I think I'm gonna call it an early night.
Xander Oh, Malcolm, right? Yeah, I heard. But you're gonna be missin' out. I'm plannin' to be witty. I'm gonna make fun of all the people who won't talk to me.
Willow That's nice. Have a good time!
Buffy She certainly looks perky.
Xander Yeah, color in the cheeks, bounce in the step... I don't like it. It's not healthy. So, are you goin' to the Bronze tonight? Oh, probably not, you probably have some vampire slaying or some lame endeavor like that, don't you? Everyone deserts me.
Buffy Check out the jealous man!
Xander What are you talking about?
Buffy You're jealous.
Xander Of what?
Buffy Willow's got a thang, and Xander's left hanging.
Xander Oh, that's meaningless drivel. I'm not interested in Willow like that.
Buffy Yeah, but you got used to being the Belle of the Ball.
Xander No, it's just... this Malcolm guy? What's his deal? I mean, tell me you're not slightly wigged.
Buffy Okay, slightly. I mean, just not knowing what he's really like.
Xander Or who he really is. I mean, sure he says he's a high school student, but I can say I'm a high school student.
Buffy You are.
Xander Okay, but I can also say that I'm an elderly Dutch woman. Get me? I mean, who's to say I'm not if I'm in the elderly Dutch chat room?
Buffy I get your point! I get your point. Oh, this guy could be anybody. He could be weird, or crazy, or old, or... He could be a circus freak. He's probably a circus freak!
Xander Yeah. I mean, we read about it all the time. Y'know, people meet on the 'Net, they talk, they get together, have dinner, a show, horrible ax murder.
Buffy Willow ax murdered by a circus freak... Okay, okay, what do we do? What are we doing? Xander, you get me started! We are totally overreacting!
Xander But it's fun, isn't it?
Fritz I'm jacked in. I'm jacked in. I'm jacked in.
Fritz I'm jacked in.
Buffy Whoa! You're the Late Girl.
Willow I overslept.
Buffy Till fifth period? Talkin' to Malcolm last night?
Willow Yeah. What?
Buffy Nothing.
Willow You're having an expression.
Buffy I'm not. But if I was, it'd be saying, 'This just isn't like you.'
Willow Not like me to have a boyfriend?
Buffy He's boyfriendly?
Willow I don't understand why you don't want me to have this. I mean, boys don't chase me around all the time. I thought you'd be happy for me.
Buffy I just want you to be sure. To meet him face to face. In daylight, in a crowded place with some friends. Y'know, before you become all... obsessive.
Willow Malcolm and I really care about each other. Big deal if I blow off a couple classes.
Buffy I thought you said you overslept.
Willow Malcolm said you wouldn't understand.
Buffy Malcolm was right.
Buffy Dave? Hey there, Dave. Anybody home?
Dave Oh, what do you want?
Buffy I wanted to ask you something if you have a minute.
Dave What is it?
Buffy Well, you're a computer geek... genius, and, uh, I sort of have a technical problem. If I wanted to find out something about someone, i-if someone e-mailed me, could I trace the letter?
Dave Well, you could pull up somebody's profile based on their user name.
Buffy But they write the profile themselves, right? And so they could say anything they wanted.
Dave True.
Buffy Wow! I had knowledge! Well, is there a way to find out exactly where a letter, an e-letter came from? I mean, the actual location of the computer?
Dave That's a challenge.
Buffy 'Cause, you see, Willow's got this boyfriend, Malcolm, and to tell you the truth, I think...
Dave Leave Willow alone.
Buffy What do you mean?
Dave That's none of your business.
Buffy Dave, are you Malcolm?
Dave Of course not.
Buffy Dave, what's going on?
Dave Look, I'll talk to you later, okay? I've got work to do.
Buffy So do I.
Buffy I'm telling you, something is going on. It's not just Willow. Dave, Fritz, they're all wicked jumpy.
Giles Those boys aren't sparklingly normal as it is.
Buffy Giles, trust me.
Giles I-I do! I-I-I really don't know how to advise you. Things involved with a computer fill me with a childlike terror. Now, if it were a nice ogre or some such I'd be more in my element. Well, I-I suppose you could, um, tail Dave, see if he's up to something.
Buffy Follow Dave? What, in dark glasses and a trench coat? Please. I can work this out myself.
Fritz She's too close. What do I do?
Moloch Kill her.
Fritz Party.
Buffy Whatever Dave is into, it's large.
Giles What was the name of this place?
Buffy It said CRD. But, I couldn't get close enough to see what it was.
Xander Calax Research and Development. It's a computer research lab. Third largest employer in Sunnydale till it closed down last year. What, I can't have information sometimes?
Giles Well, it-it's just somewhat unprecedented.
Xander Well, my uncle used to work there. I-in a floor sweeping capacity.
Buffy But it closed?
Xander Uh-huh.
Buffy Looked pretty functional from where I stood. I don't have a clue what they were doing.
Xander And what do they need Dave for?
Buffy Something about computers, right? I mean, he is off-the-chart smart.
Giles We still don't know an enormous amount. Whatever is going on there may be on the up-and-up.
Xander No, if CRD opened, it would've been on the news.
Buffy Besides, I can just tell something's wrong. My spider sense is tingling.
Giles Your... spider sense?
Buffy Pop culture reference. Sorry.
Giles Yes, well, ahem, I think we're still at a stand still. Uh, uh, short of breaking into the place, I don't see...
Buffy Breaking in! Then this is the plan!
Xander I'm free tonight!
Buffy Tonight it is!
Giles A moment, please, of quiet reflection. I do not suggest that you illegally enter the...
Giles ...data into the file so the book will be listed by title as well as by author.
Ms._Calendar I just came by to check your new data base, make sure your cross reference table isn't glitching. 'Cause I'm guessing you haven't gone anywhere near it.
Giles Uh, I'm still sorting through the chaos you left behind you.
Ms._Calendar Hmm. You're here again? Kids really dig the library, don't cha?
Buffy We're literary!
Xander To read makes our speaking English good.
Buffy We'll be going now.
Giles Uh, w-we'll, uh, continue this conversation at another time.
Buffy I think we're done. Makes our speaking English is good?
Xander I panicked, okay?
Malcolm I've never felt this way about anyone before, Willow.
Willow I know what you mean. I feel like you know me better than anyone.
Malcolm I do.
Willow Do you think we should... meet?
Malcolm I think we should soon.
Willow I'm nervous.
Malcolm I'm not. Isn't that strange?
Willow That's what Buffy doesn't understand, how comfortable you can make me feel.
Malcolm Buffy just makes trouble. That's why she got kicked out of her old school.
Willow How did you know that?
Malcolm It's on her permanent record.
Malcolm You must have mentioned it.
Willow I guess.
Malcolm Let's not worry about her anymore.
Willow I have to sign off. I'll talk to you later.
Malcolm Don't.
Willow Bye.
Ms._Calendar You're a snob!
Giles I am no such thing.
Ms._Calendar Oh, you are a *big* snob. You, you think that knowledge should be kept in these carefully guarded repositories where only a handful of white guys can get at it.
Giles Nonsense! I simply don't adhere to a, a knee-jerk assumption that because something is new, it's better.
Ms._Calendar This isn't a fad, Rupert! We are creating a new society here.
Giles A society in which human interaction is all but obsolete? In which people can be completely manipulated by technology, well, well... Thank you, I'll pass.
Ms._Calendar Well, ahem, I think you'll be very happy here with your musty, old books.
Giles These musty old books have a great deal more to say than in any of your... fabulous web pages.
Ms._Calendar Hmm. This one doesn't have a whole lot more to say.
Ms._Calendar What is it, like a diary?
Giles How odd. I haven't looked through all the volumes yet, I didn't, um...
Ms._Calendar What is it?
Giles Uh, nothing, um, a, a diary, yes. I imagine that's what it is. Well, it's been so nice talking to you.
Ms._Calendar We were fighting.
Giles Must do it again sometime, yes... Bye, now.
School_nurse I checked the computer, and there's nothing in his file about being allergic to penicillin!
Dave Buffy!
Buffy Dave! How're you doing?
Dave Okay. Uh, look, I'm sorry about yesterday. I haven't been getting much sleep lately, y'know?
Buffy Don't sweat it.
Dave Willow was looking for you.
Buffy Good, I need to talk to her. Do you know where she is?
Dave She said she'd be in the, in the girls' locker room.
Buffy Great. Thanks.
Buffy Will?
Buffy Willow?
Buffy Will? You taking a shower?
Buffy I guess not.
Buffy This is how droughts get started.
Dave Buffy! Get out!
Dave I can't do it! I'm not gonna do it.
Moloch But you promised.
Dave Buffy isn't a threat to you! Stop with it.
Moloch The project is almost complete. You won't have to do it again.
Dave Oh, I can't!
Moloch I've shown you a new world, Dave. Knowledge, power... I can give you everything. All I want is your love.
Dave No. This isn't right. None of it is.
Xander I'm gonna kill Dave!
Buffy He tried to warn me.
Xander Warn you that he set you up? Is she gonna be okay?
Giles She was only grounded for a moment. Still, if you'd been anyone but the Slayer...
Buffy Tell me the truth: how's my hair?
Xander It's great! It's your best hair ever!
Giles Uh, oh, yes.
Buffy I just... I don't understand what would make Dave do a thing like that.
Giles I think perhaps I do.
Giles Does this look familiar to either of you?
Buffy Yeah, sure. Looks like a book.
Xander I knew that one.
Giles In the dark ages the souls of demons were sometimes trapped in certain volumes. They remained locked within the book, harmless, unless the pages were read aloud. Unless I'm mistaken, this is Moloch, the Corrupter. A very deadly and seductive demon. He draws people to him with promises of love, power, knowledge. Preys on impressionable minds.
Xander Like Dave's.
Giles Dave, and who knows how many others.
Buffy And Moloch is inside that book?
Giles Not anymore.
Xander You released Moloch?
Buffy Way to go!
Giles I didn't read it! That dreadful Calendar woman found it and, and it was already blank.
Buffy Okay, so a powerful demon with horns is walking around Sunnydale, and nobody's noticed?
Xander I-if he's so big and strong, why bother with Dave? I mean, why didn't he just attack Buffy himself?
Giles I don't know. And I don't know who could've read that book. It wasn't even in English.
Buffy Where was it?
Giles Uh, in a pile with others that were, um, uh, scanned.
Xander And that released the demon?
Buffy No, he's not out here. He's in there.
Giles The scanner read the book. It brought Moloch out as information to be absorbed.
Buffy He's gone binary on us.
Xander Okay, for those of us in our studio audience, who are me? You guys are saying that Moloch is in this computer?
Buffy And every computer connected to it by a modem.
Giles He's everywhere.
Xander What are we gonna do?
Giles Willow scanned him into her file. It may be... a futile gesture, but I suggest we, um, uh, delete it.
Buffy Solid!
Xander Don't get too close.
Buffy Okay. Okay. So which file do you think it is? Willow? That's probably it, right? I'll just delete the whole thing.
Moloch Stay away from Willow! It is none of your business!
Buffy So that's what Malcolm looks like.
Buffy So much for delete file.
Giles This is very bad.
Xander Are we overreacting? He's in a computer! What can he do?
Buffy You mean besides convince a perfectly nice kid to try and kill me? I don't know. How about mess up all the medical equipment in the world?
Giles Randomize traffic signals.
Buffy Access launch codes for our nuclear missiles.
Giles Destroy the world's economy.
Buffy I think I pretty much capped it with that nuclear missile thing.
Giles Right, yours was best.
Xander Okay, he's a threat, I'm on board with that now. But what can we do about it?
Buffy I think the first thing we do is find Willow. She's probably talking to him right now. God, that creeps me out!
Xander What does he want with Willow?
Buffy Let's never find out. Okay, I'm gonna check the computer lab, and you guys call her home.
Buffy Willow?
Xander No answer.
Giles Damn it!
Xander Well, it wasn't busy either, so she's not online.
Xander She's not home.
Giles What did you find?
Xander Willow isn't...
Buffy Dave. He's dead.
Giles How?
Buffy Well, it looks like suicide.
Xander With a little help from my friends?
Buffy I'd guess Fritz. Or the other zomboids from CRD. Okay, you and I are gonna go to Willow's house. Giles, you need to come up with a way to get Moloch out of the 'Net.
Giles I, I have records of the ceremonies, but, but that's for a creature of the flesh. Th-this could be something completely different.
Buffy Then get Ms. Calendar. Maybe she can help you.
Giles Well, even if she could, how am I gonna convince her that there's a demon on the Internet?
Buffy Okay, fine, then you can stay here and come up with a better plan. C'mon.
Willow Mom? Dad?
PC You have mail.
Message No more waiting. I need you to see me.
PC You have mail.
Willow Dad, did you forget your keys again?
Fritz No more waiting.
Radio A spokesman for the archbishop denied the allegations, blaming computer error for the apparent financial discrepancy.
Giles Binding rituals...
Radio In Washington D.C., the FBI today reported that all of its serial killer profiles have been mysteriously downloaded from its central computer.
Ms._Calendar Hi. I got your message. What's so urgent?
Giles Um, thank you for coming. Uh, I need your help. But before that, um, I need you to believe something that, um, you may not want to. Uh, there's, uh... something's got into the, um... i-i-inside, um... There's a demon in the Internet.
Ms._Calendar I know.
Buffy Willow?!
Xander This isn't good.
Buffy Willow?!
Buffy Willow?!
Xander Okay, any thoughts?
Buffy 'No more waiting, I need you to see me'? See him how? Where?
Xander What about CRD?
Buffy The research place?
Xander I'm guessing that's Moloch central.
Buffy Guessing that's our best lead. Let's just hope Giles can back us up.
Giles You already know? How exactly is that?
Ms._Calendar Come on, there've been portents for days. I mean, power surges, online shutdowns... You should see the bones I've been casting. I *knew* this would happen sooner or later. I mean, it's probably a, a mischief demon, y'know, like Kelkor, or...
Giles It's Moloch.
Ms._Calendar The Corrupter? Oh, boy. I shoulda remembered, I just don't...
Giles Uh... You don't seem exactly surprised by... Who are you?
Ms._Calendar I teach computer science at the local high school.
Giles A profession that hardly lends itself to the casting of bones.
Ms._Calendar Wrong and wrong, snobby. You think the realm of the mystical is limited to ancient texts and relics? That bad old science made the magic go away? Mm. The divine exists in cyberspace same as out here.
Giles Are you a witch?
Ms._Calendar Mm. I don't have that kinda power. 'Technopagan' is the term.
Ms._Calendar There are more of us than you think.
Giles Well, uh, you can definitely help me. Um... What's in cyberspace at the moment is less than divine.
Giles I have the binding rituals at hand, but I'm completely out of my idiom.
Ms._Calendar Well, I can help! I think... I hope, I mean, well, this is my first real... Do you know how he got in?
Giles He was, uh, 'scanned' is the term, I believe.
Ms._Calendar And you want him back in the book?
Giles Buffy!
Buffy Yeah.
Giles Willow?
Buffy Not at home. It looks like she was taken somewhere.
Giles Where are you?
Buffy CRD. Whatever Moloch wants Willow for, it's probably in there.
Giles Ms. Calendar and I are, uh, working to get Moloch offline.
Buffy Here's a tip: hurry!
Moloch Welcome, my love.
Moloch I can't tell you how good it is to see you...
Moloch ...with my own two eyes.
Moloch Willow.
Willow Malcolm.
Moloch This world is so new, so exciting. I can see all of it. Everything flows through me. I know the secrets of your kings. But nothing compares to having form again. To be able to walk, to touch, to kill.
Xander Back way?
Buffy Back way.
Moloch Here they come.
Ms._Calendar The first thing we have to do is form the circle of Kayless. Right?
Giles Form a circle? But there's only two of us. That's really more of a line.
Ms._Calendar You're not getting it, Rupert. We have to form the circle inside. I'm putting out a flash. I just hope enough of my group responds.
Giles Won't Moloch just shut you down?
Ms._Calendar Well, I'm betting he won't figure out what we're doing until it's too late.
Giles Hoping and betting, that's what we've got.
Ms._Calendar You wanna throw in praying? Be my guest.
Willow I don't understand. What do you want from me?
Moloch I want to give you the world.
Willow Why?
Moloch You created me. I brought these humans together to build me a body. But *you* gave me life. Took me out of the book that held me. I want to repay you.
Willow By lying to me? By pretending to be a person? Pretending you loved me?
Moloch I do!
Xander Uh, Buffy!
Buffy It's her!
Xander Yeah, who's the other guy?
Moloch Don't you see? I can give you everything! I can control the world! Right now a man in Beijing is transferring money to a Swiss bank account for a contract on his mother's life. Good for him!
Buffy I can't bust it. It's heavy steel.
Xander Then let's find another way in.
Xander What's goin' on?
Buffy Building's security system is computerized.
Xander Whoops!
Ms._Calendar Almost there.
Giles Couldn't you just stop Moloch by, by entering some computer virus?
Ms._Calendar You've seen way too many movies. Okay! We're up. You read, I type. Ready?
Giles Uh, I am. By the power of the divine, by the essence of the word, I command you...
Willow Let me leave?
Moloch But I love you!
Willow Don't say that! That's a joke! You don't love anything!
Moloch You are mine!
Willow I'm not yours! I'm never gonna be yours! Never!
Moloch Pity.
Giles By the power of the circle of Kayless, I command you... Kayless, with a 'K'.
Moloch I'll miss you.
Giles Demon, come!
Giles I command you!
Buffy Ow... Guy's made of metal!
Moloch No! I won't go back!
Giles Demon, COME!
Xander Hey! I got to hit someone!
Ms._Calendar He's out of the 'Net. He's bound.
Giles He's not in the book.
Ms._Calendar He's not in the book. Well, where is he?
Xander Let's go this way!
Buffy Wait!
Moloch I was omnipotent. I was everything! Now I'm trapped in this shell!
Willow Malcolm!
Willow Remember me, your girlfriend?!
Willow Well, I think it's time we break up!
Willow Or maybe we can still be friends!
Moloch This body's all I have left. But it's enough to crush you!
Buffy Take your best shot.
Ms._Calendar Well, look who's here! Welcome to my world. You scared?
Giles I'm remaining calm, thank you. Uh, I just wanted to, uh, return this. I found it among the new books, and naturally I thought of you.
Ms._Calendar Cool. Thanks.
Giles Uh, well, I'll, I'll see you anon.
Ms._Calendar Can't get outta here fast enough, can you?
Giles Truthfully, I'm even less anxious to be around computers than I used to be.
Ms._Calendar Well, it was your book that started all the trouble, not a computer.
Ms._Calendar Honestly, what is it about them that bothers you so much?
Giles The smell.
Ms._Calendar Computer's don't smell, Rupert.
Giles I know! Smell is the most powerful trigger to the memory there is. A certain flower or a, a whiff of smoke can bring up experiences... long forgotten. Books smell. Musty and, and, and, and rich. The knowledge gained from a computer, is, uh, it... it has no, no texture, no, no context. It's, it's there and then it's gone. If it's to last, then, then the getting of knowledge should be, uh, tangible, it should be, um... smelly.
Ms._Calendar Well! You really are an old-fashioned boy, aren't you?
Giles Well, I-I don't dangle a corkscrew from my ear.
Ms._Calendar That's not where I dangle it.
Xander We gonna go to the Bronze tonight? We three?
Buffy It'll be fun!
Xander Yeah, Willow, fun? Remember fun? That thing where you smile?
Willow Oh, I'm sorry guys. I'm just thinking about...
Buffy Malcolm?
Willow Malcolm, Moloch... whatever he's called. The one boy that's really liked me, and he's a demon robot. What does that say about me?
Buffy It doesn't say anything about you.
Willow I mean, I thought I was really falling...
Buffy Hey, did you forget? The one boy I've had the hots for since I've moved here turned out to be a vampire.
Xander Right, and the teacher I had a crush on? Giant praying mantis?
Willow That's true.
Xander Yeah, that's life on the Hellmouth.
Buffy Let's face it: none of us are ever gonna have a happy, normal relationship.
Xander We're doomed!
Willow Yeah!
