Xander You know how I feel about you. It's, uh, pretty obvious, isn't it? There's never been anyone else for me... but you. And we're good friends, and it's time to take the next step.
Xander Would you, um... date me? Oh that's good! Date me! It's terrible, right?
Willow Huh? Oh, no! Oh, yes, 'date me' is silly...
Xander See, what I should do is I should just start with talking about the dance. Y'know, Buffy, Spring Fling just isn't any dance. It's a time for students to choose, um... a mate and then we can... observe their... mating rituals and tag them before they migrate. Just kill me!
Willow You're doing fine!
Xander Why's it so hard? I should just walk up to her and say, 'Hey, I like you. Let's go to the dance together.'
Willow Direct and to the point.
Xander I'm ready. I wanna do it now. I *gotta* do it now.
Willow Oh, Buffy's not here. You can practice on me some more.
Xander No, no, I can't wait until tomorrow, I-I'll be thinking about it too much. Why didn't Buffy show up tonight? What's she doing?
Willow Oh, you know, the usual.
Cordelia What was that?
Kevin What was what?
Cordelia Someone's out there.
Kevin That's silly! Who would be out there?
Buffy Three in one night. Giles would be so proud.
Giles Ho korias phanaytie toutay... tay nuktee. 'The Master shall rise...' Yes, yes, this is it! 'The Master shall rise, and the Slayer...' My God!
Xander Under the stairs! Under the stairs!
Master Yes! YES! Shake, Earth! This is a sign! We are in the final days! My time has come! Glory! GLORY!
Master Whadaya think? 5.1?
Buffy Morning!
Buffy Wow. The damage looks fairly structural. Are we safe in here?
Giles Buffy!
Buffy What? Do I have something on my face?
Giles No! Uh, and, and yes, we're, we're safe. Uh, but probably best not to go up there.
Buffy How're you doin' there, Giles? Get much sleep last night?
Giles Um... I-I-I've been working.
Buffy Me, too. I went hunting last night, and it is awfully sweet of you to ask. It's getting hairy out there, Giles. I killed three vampires last night, and one of them was practically on school grounds.
Giles Their numbers are increasing.
Buffy And they're getting cockier. Look, I'm not loving it. Last night was a pretty close call.
Giles Yes.
Buffy Giles, care? I'm putting my life on the line battling the undead. Look, I broke a nail, okay? I'm wearing a press-on. The least you could do is exhibit some casual interest. You could go, 'hmm'.
Giles Hmm? Oh, sorry. Um, yes, I'm very glad that you're alright. Uh, I-I need to verify, um... I just can't really talk right now.
Buffy Fine. That's okay. I can't put it off any longer. I have to meet my terrible fate.
Giles What?!
Buffy Biology.
Buffy Wow. That was boring.
Xander I don't feel that boring covers it.
Buffy No, boring falls short.
Willow Even I was bored. And I'm a science nerd.
Buffy Don't say that.
Willow I'm not ashamed. It's the computer age. Nerds are in. They're still in, right?
Xander Willow, don't you have a thing?
Willow A thing? The thing! That I have! Which is... a thing that I have to go to.
Willow See ya later.
Buffy What on earth is her deal?
Xander Uh, she's Willow. So, uh, Buffy, I wanted to, um... There was this thing I wanted to ask you, to talk to you about.
Buffy Okay, what's up?
Xander Uh, let's go over here and sit.
Buffy Okay, now you're making me nervous.
Xander Oh, no, no, there's nothing to be nervous about. Really, it's silly. Ha, ha!
Xander Hey. Leave. Thanks.
Buffy Well?
Xander Um... You know, Buffy, uh, Spring Fling is a... time for students to gather and... Oh, God! Buffy, I want you to go to the dance with me. You and me, on a date.
Buffy I-I don't know what to say.
Xander Well, you're not laughing. So that's a good start. Buffy, I like you. A lot. And I know we're friends, and we've had experiences... We've fought some blood-sucking fiends, and that's all been a good time. But I want more. I wanna dance with you.
Buffy Xander, you're one of my best friends. You and Willow...
Xander Well, Willow's not looking to date you. Or if she is, she's playing it pretty close to the chest.
Buffy I don't want to spoil the friendship that we have.
Xander Well, I don't want to spoil it either. But that's not the point, is it? You either feel a thing or you don't.
Buffy I don't. Xander, I'm, I'm sorry. I-I just don't think of you that way.
Xander Well, try. I'll wait.
Buffy Xander...
Xander Nah. Forget it. I'm not him. I mean, I guess a guy's gotta be undead to make time with you.
Buffy That's really harsh.
Xander Look, I'm sorry. I don't handle rejection well. Funny! Considering all the practice I've had, huh?
Buffy Xander, I'm sorry, I don't know...
Xander You know what? Let's just not.
Giles Hello. Uh, this is Giles. Uh... Uh, Rupert Giles.
Giles I-I need to see you. No, I-I realize that. Uh... Come after sundown. Good. I'll see you then.
Ms._Calendar You know, that outfit looks just like the one you wore yesterday. Only wrinklier. Were you here all night?
Giles Sorry, uh... I'm not really up to, uh, socializing just now.
Ms._Calendar Something's going on, Rupert, and I'm guessing you already know what it is.
Giles What do you know?
Ms._Calendar Well, I have been surfing the 'Net, looking for unexplained incidents. You know, people are always sending stuff my way. They know the occult's my turf. Now, here is the latest. A cat last week gave birth to a litter of snakes. A family was swimming in Whisper Lake when the lake suddenly began to boil. And Mercy Hospital last night, a boy was born with his eyes facing inward. I'm not stupid. This is apocalypse stuff. And throw in last night's earthquake, and I'd say we've got a problem. I would say the end is pretty seriously nigh.
Giles I don't know if I can trust you.
Ms._Calendar I helped you cast that demon out of the Internet. I think that merits some trust. Look, I'm scared, okay? Oh, plus, I've got this, this crazy monk e-mailing me from Cortona about some Anointed One?
Giles The Anointed One? He's dead!
Ms._Calendar Someone's dead?
Giles Uh, who is this monk?
Ms._Calendar Uh, a brother Luca something? Keeps sending out global mailings about a prophecy.
Giles I need you to talk to him, find out everything he knows.
Ms._Calendar Look, Rupert, you haven't told me jack, so what's with the order?
Giles Just do it! I'll e-explain later.
Ms._Calendar You better.
Kevin I'll get everything tonight after practice. The guys'll help me.
Cordelia Well, it's all in the A-V room. The sound system, and the decorations... And, oh, Aura needs help, um, moving the coolers.
Kevin Don't sweat it!
Cordelia Well, bring everything to the Bronze, and I'll meet you there in the morning!
Kevin Done!
Cordelia You're so sweet! Why're you so sweet?
Kevin I dunno! 'Cause I'm usually mean as a snake!
Cordelia Willow! I'll see you in the morning.
Kevin Okay.
Cordelia Willow! I really like your outfit!
Willow No, you don't.
Cordelia No, I really don't, but I need a favor.
Willow What kind?
Cordelia Well, the Bronze won't let us use their sound system, and I need someone who knows how to hook one up. If you could just show up tomorrow morning...
Cordelia ...I'd be really, really grateful! I mean, I'd talk to you at the dance and everything.
Willow Sure.
Cordelia Great! Tomorrow at ten?
Willow Sure.
Willow Hey!
Xander Hey!
Willow How'd it go?
Xander On a scale of one to ten? It sucked.
Willow Oh.
Xander Well, I guess it could be worse. I could have gangrene on my face.
Willow Well, what'd she say?
Xander Apart from 'no', does it really matter? She's still jonesin' for Angel, and could care less about me.
Willow At least now you know.
Xander Yeah, you're right. The deal's done. The polls are in, and it's time for my concession speech. Hey, I know what we'll do! We can go! Be my date! We'll, we'll have a great time! We'll dance, we'll go wild... Whadaya say?
Willow No.
Xander Good! What?
Willow There's no way.
Xander Willow, come on!
Willow You think I wanna go to the dance with you and watch you wish you were at the dance with her? You think that's my idea of hijinks? You should know better.
Xander I didn't think.
Willow I'm sorry it didn't work out for you. I'll see you on Monday.
Xander That's okay. I don't wanna go. I'm just gonna go home, lie down and listen to country music. The music of pain.
Buffy Giles, you are not gonna believe this.
Giles It's clear. It's what's gonna happen. Uh, it's happening now!
Buffy Angel?
Angel It can't be. You've gotta be wrong.
Giles I've checked it against all my other volumes. It's very real.
Angel Well, there's gotta be some way around it.
Giles Listen. Some prophecies are, are a bit dodgy. They're, they're mutable. Buffy herself has, has thwarted them time and time again, but this is the Codex. There is nothing in it that does not come to pass.
Angel Then you're reading it wrong.
Giles I wish to God I were! But it's very plain! Tomorrow night Buffy will face the Master, and she will die.
Angel Well, have you verified the text?
Buffy So that's it, huh? I remember the drill. One Slayer dies, next one's called! Wonder who she is. Will you train her? Or will they send someone else?
Giles Buffy, I...
Buffy They say how he's gonna kill me? Do you think it'll hurt?
Buffy Don't touch me! Were you even gonna tell me?
Giles I was hoping that I wouldn't have to. That there was... some way around it. I...
Buffy I've got a way around it. I quit!
Angel It's not that simple.
Buffy I'm making it that simple! I quit! I resign, I-I'm fired, you can find someone else to stop the Master from taking over!
Giles I'm not sure that anyone else can. All the... the signs indicate...
Buffy The signs? READ ME THE SIGNS! TELL ME MY FORTUNE! YOU'RE SO USEFUL SITTING HERE WITH ALL YOUR BOOKS! YOU'RE REALLY A LOTTA HELP!
Giles No, I don't suppose I am.
Angel I know this is hard.
Buffy What do you know about this? You're never gonna die!
Angel You think I want anything to happen to you? Do you think I could stand it? We just gotta figure out a way...
Buffy I already did. I quit, remember? Pay attention!
Giles Buffy, if the Master rises...
Buffy I don't care! I don't care. Giles, I'm sixteen years old. I don't wanna die.
Lyrics I fall to pieces
Lyrics Each time I see you again
Lyrics I never knew what enough was
Joyce Hi, honey. You alright?
Lyrics Until I'd had more than my share
Buffy Sure.
Joyce Probably just full from that bite of dinner you nearly had.
Lyrics I let the darkness in
Joyce Feel like telling me what's on your mind?
Lyrics And it was then I lost the dare
Buffy Mom, let's go away!
Joyce What?
Buffy Anywhere, just for a while, all weekend!
Joyce Honey, I...
Buffy No, it'll be great! You and me, a mother-daughter thing... We can talk about all the embarrassing things you love to bring up.
Joyce You know the gallery's open on weekends.
Buffy Mom, please!
Joyce Isn't the Prom tomorrow night? Or Spring Fling, whatever they're calling it?
Buffy I-I guess.
Joyce Nobody asked you?
Buffy Oh, someone...
Joyce But not the right someone. See, sometimes I actually do know what you're thinking. Well, then, uh, this probably isn't the best time for this, but, uh...
Joyce I saw you eyeing it at the store. I figured...
Buffy Mom, we can't afford this.
Joyce The way you've been eating, we can afford it.
Buffy It's beautiful.
Joyce I think you should wear it. To the dance.
Buffy No, I-I can't go to the dance.
Joyce Says who? Is it written somewhere? You should do what you want. Homecoming, my freshman year of college. I didn't have a date, so I got dressed up and I went anyway.
Buffy Was it awful?
Joyce It was awful. For about an hour.
Buffy Then what happened?
Joyce I met your father.
Buffy He didn't have a date either?
Joyce He did. And that's a much funnier story that you will *not* get to hear. Oh, but it was a beautiful night!
Buffy And you had your whole life ahead of you.
Joyce Yeah.
Buffy Must be nice.
Cordelia Oh, Kevin said that he'd bring everything to the Bronze last night. He promised! We'll never get everything ready in time.
Willow He probably forgot. It's not *that* big a deal.
Cordelia Uh, you don't understand. I'm not mad! He totally flaked on me. On me! And I don't even care. God help me, I think it's cute! Oh...
Cordelia There they are! They're watching cartoons. That's so cu... That's not cute. That's annoying. I'm annoyed.
Willow Right. I'm furious.
Cordelia Men. I don't know why we put up with them.
Willow I hear ya.
Cordelia Obviously, Kevin has underestimated the power of my icy stare.
Cordelia Oh, my God! Kevin! No!
Cordelia Kevin!
Joyce Buffy?! There's something on the news. Willow.
Willow I've seen so much.
Willow I thought I could take anything. But, Buffy, this... this was different.
Buffy It'll be alright.
Willow I'm trying to think how to say it... to explain it so you understand.
Buffy It doesn't matter as long as you're okay.
Willow I'm not okay. I knew those guys. I go to that room every day. And when I walked in there, it... it wasn't our world anymore. They made it theirs. And they had fun. What are we gonna do?
Buffy What we have to. Promise me you'll stay in tonight, okay?
Willow Buffy?
Willow I like your dress.
Buffy Take care.
Master Soon.
Master Soon!
Ms._Calendar Okay, so this Master guy tried to open the Hellmouth. But he got stuck in it, and now all the signs are reading that he's gonna get out, which opens the Hellmouth, which brings the demons, which ends the world.
Giles Yes. That about sums it up, yes.
Ms._Calendar The part that gets me, though, is where Buffy is the Vampire Slayer. She's so little.
Giles You know how to get in touch with this, uh, brother Luca chap?
Ms._Calendar Hmm. As far as I can tell, no one can. He's disappeared. Did send out one last global though. A short one.
Giles What did it say?
Ms._Calendar Isaiah 11:6, which I dutifully looked up.
Giles 'The wolf shall live with the lamb, the leopard shall lie down with the kid, the calf, the lion and the fatling together, and the little child to lead them.'
Ms._Calendar That's kinda warm and fuzzy for a message of doom.
Giles Well, that depends where he's leading them to. Aurelius wrote of the Anointed One, 'The Slayer will not know him, and he will lead her into Hell.'
Ms._Calendar So Luca thinks the Anointed is a kid.
Giles If the vampire that Buffy killed was in fact not the Anointed, then it may well be.
Ms._Calendar Well, then we need to warn her.
Giles I don't intend involving her at all.
Ms._Calendar What do you mean?
Giles Buffy's not gonna face the Master. I am.
Buffy No, you're not.
Buffy So, I'm looking for a kid, huh? And he'll lead me to the Master?
Giles Buffy, I'm not gonna send you out there to die. Now, you were right. I-I've waded around in these old books for so long, I've forgotten what the real world is like. I-it's time I found out.
Buffy You're still not going up against the Master.
Giles I've made up my mind.
Buffy So have I.
Giles I made up my mine first! I'm older and wiser than you, and just... just do what you're told for once! Alright?
Buffy That's not how it goes. I'm the Slayer.
Giles I don't care what the books say. I defy prophecy, and I am going. There's nothing you can say will change my mind.
Buffy I know.
Buffy When he wakes up tell him... I don't know. Think of something cool, tell him I said it.
Ms._Calendar You fight the Master, and you'll die.
Buffy Maybe. Maybe I'll take him with me.
Collin Help me...
Buffy It's okay. I know who you are.
Xander She what?
Willow I told you there was something going on with her.
Xander And she knew about this prophecy of yours? Aw, man, what do we do?
Giles We stay calm, first thing.
Xander Calm?
Willow I think he's right.
Xander I'm sorry, calm may work for Locutus of the Borg here, but I'm freaked out, and I intend to stay that way.
Willow Xander...
Xander How could you let her go?
Giles As the soon-to-be-purple area of my jaw will attest, I did *not* *let* her go!
Willow Well, how can we help her?
Ms._Calendar Uh, I'm sorry to bring this up, but we also have an apocalypse to worry about?
Xander Do you mind?
Willow How come she's in the club?
Ms._Calendar Hey! Once the Master gets free, the Hellmouth opens, the demons come to party, and everybody dies.
Xander Uh, uh, I don't care. I'm sorry, I don't. Right now I gotta help Buffy.
Giles We don't even know where she's gone.
Xander No. But I can find out.
Angel Oh. Look who's here.
Xander Mind if I come in?
Angel Make yourself at home.
Xander She's gone.
Angel Whadaya mean?
Xander Buffy, she's gone to fight the Master.
Angel He'll kill her.
Xander Rumor has it. Only we're not gonna let it happen.
Angel Well, what do you propose we do about it?
Xander Look, I know you can find this Master guy. He's underground, right? Take me to him.
Angel You're way outta your league, kid. The Master'll kill you before you can even breathe. If you're lucky.
Xander How can I say this clearly?
Xander I don't like you. At the end of the day, I pretty much think you're a vampire. But Buffy's got this big old yen for you. She thinks you're a real person. And right now I need you to prove her right.
Angel You're in love with her.
Xander Aren't you?
Giles The Master is as old as any vampire on record. There's no telling how powerful he'll be if he reaches the surface.
Ms._Calendar Okay, here's my question: the Hellmouth opens.
Giles Yes.
Ms._Calendar Where? If he's underground, and it's right where he is, where's it gonna open?
Giles Good point. Uh, well, look, you have a look through the Black Chronicles...
Ms._Calendar Okay.
Giles Uh, Willow? Willow?
Willow Huh?
Giles Could you look through the local histories, please. Check for any common denominators, uh, locations of incidences and such.
Willow Right, okay.
Master Welcome.
Buffy Thanks for having me.
Buffy Y'know, you really oughtta talk to your contractor. Looks like you got some water damage.
Master Oh, good. The feeble banter portion of the fight. Why don't we just cut to the...
Master Nice shot.
Angel This way. What?
Xander You were looking at my neck.
Angel What?
Xander You were checking out my neck! I saw that!
Angel No, I wasn't!
Xander Just keep your distance, pal.
Angel I wasn't looking at your neck!
Xander I told you to eat before we left.
Master You're not going to kill me with that thing.
Buffy Don't be so sure.
Master You still don't understand your part in all this, do you? You are not the hunter. You are the lamb.
Giles Well, let's think about this, then. The vampires have been gathering, they know he's coming, they will be his army.
Ms._Calendar Do you think they'll gather at the Hellmouth?
Willow Well, the last time the Master tried to rise was the Harvest. He sent a bunch of vampires to get him fresh blood.
Ms._Calendar Well, where did that go down?
Giles The Bronze.
Willow The Prom!
Giles We have to warn them.
Ms._Calendar No! We'll go. You have to concentrate on demon killing. My car's in the lot.
Giles Stay close together, and for goodness' sake, be careful!
Willow We will.
Buffy You know, for someone who's all powerful, you sure do like to hide.
Master I'm waiting for you. I want this moment to last.
Buffy Well, I don't.
Master I understand.
Willow What if they get to the Bronze before we do?
Ms._Calendar Don't need to worry about that!
Willow Why not?
Ms._Calendar 'Cause they're not goin' to the Bronze.
Master You tried. It was noble of you. You heard the prophecy that I was about to break free and you came to stop me. But prophecies are tricky creatures. They don't tell you everything. You're the one that sets me free! If you hadn't come, I couldn't go. Think about that!
Master Oh, God! The power!
Master And by the way...
Master I like your dress.
Xander What was that?
Angel It's too late. He's gone up.
Angel She's dead!
Xander No. She's not dead.
Angel She's not breathing.
Xander But if she drowned, uh, there's a shot! CPR!
Angel You have to do it. I have no breath.
Xander C'mon. C'mon!
Ms._Calendar Why are they coming here?
Willow Not caring!
Cordelia Get in!
Xander C'mon! Breathe! Breathe!
Xander C'mon!
Xander Buffy!
Xander Buffy.
Buffy Xander?
Xander Welcome back.
Cordelia I was sitting where Kevin and I used to park, and all of a sudden these things are coming at me!
Ms._Calendar What do we do now?
Willow We've gotta get to the library!
Cordelia Library! Great!
Willow Of course, we generally walk there.
Giles What the...
Giles What's happening?
Ms._Calendar Guess!
Giles Why are they coming here?!
Master My world! Oh, my beautiful world!
Xander Easy. Easy.
Buffy The Master?
Angel He's gone up.
Xander No. You're still weak.
Buffy No. No, I feel strong. I feel different. Let's go!
Giles They're coming in through the stacks!
Ms._Calendar C'mon!
Ms._Calendar The bookshelves!
Giles My office...
Cordelia Somebody help!
Xander So, how do you know where the Master's going?
Buffy I know.
Buffy Oh, look, a bad guy.
Buffy Okay, you two wait here, keep the rest of the vampires off me.
Xander Right.
Buffy Angel, better put on your game face.
Angel I'm ready.
Buffy One way or another, this won't take long.
Cordelia See how *you* like it!
Willow This won't keep 'em out for long!
Ms._Calendar GILES! GILES!
Giles The Hellmouth!
Master Yes. Come forth, my child. Come into my world.
Buffy I don't think it's yours just yet.
Master You're dead!
Buffy I may be dead, but I'm still pretty. Which is more than I can say for you.
Master You were destined to die! It was written!
Buffy What can I say? I flunked the written.
Master Come here!
Ms._Calendar GIIILES!
Ms._Calendar GILES!
Master Did you really think you could best me here when you couldn't below?
Buffy You have fruit punch mouth.
Master What?
Buffy Save the hypnosis crap for the tourists.
Master Where are your jibes now?
Master You laugh when my Hell is on Earth?
Buffy You're that amped about Hell... Go there!
Giles The vampires?
Cordelia Gone.
Angel The Master?
Giles Dead. The Hellmouth is closed. Buffy... Buffy?
Buffy Oh, sorry. It's just been a really weird day.
Xander Yeah! Buffy died, and everything!
Willow Wow! Harsh.
Giles I should have known that wouldn't stop you.
Ms._Calendar Well, what do we do now?
Giles I don't know about the rest of you, but I'd like to get out of this place. I don't like the library very much anymore.
Xander Hey! I hear there's a dance at the Bronze tonight. Could be fun.
Cordelia Yeah!
Willow Buffy?
Buffy Sure! We saved the world. I say we party! I mean, I got all pretty.
Ms._Calendar And what about him?
Buffy He's not going anywhere. Loser.
Giles I'm not dancing, though.
Ms._Calendar We'll see.
Willow You can come with us, Angel.
Buffy I'm hungry.
Xander So what's the story with the car?
Cordelia Oh, that was me, saving the day!
Willow Get something to drink.
Buffy Is anybody else hungry?
Willow Well, no, don't do that. Just hang.
Buffy I'm really, really hungry.
Angel By the way, I really like your dress.
Buffy Yeah, yeah. Big hit with everyone.
