Willow Okay, um...
Xander It's your turn.
Willow I, alright, okay, uh... 'In the few hours that we had together, we loved a lifetime's worth.'
Xander Terminator.
Willow Good! Great.
Xander Um, oh, okay, I got one. 'It's a madhouse! A mad...'
Willow Planet of the Apes.
Xander Can I finish, please?
Willow Oh! Sorry, go ahead.
Xander '...house!'
Willow Planet of the Apes. Okay, good. Me. Uh...
Xander Well?
Willow I'm thinking. 'Use the Force, Luke.'
Xander Do I even have to dignify that with a guess?
Willow I couldn't think of anything. It's a dumb game anyway.
Xander Well, what else do you wanna do? We already played rock, paper, scissors. My hands cramped up.
Willow Well, yes, if you're always scissors of course your tendons are gonna strain...
Xander Y'know, I just gotta say that this has been the most boring summer ever.
Willow Yeah, but on the plus side no monsters or stuff.
Xander I'm just so restless! I'm actually looking forward to school startin' up again.
Willow Yeah, and that wouldn't have anything to do with a certain girl we both know who is a Vampire Slayer?
Xander Please, I'm so over her. Did she, uh, mention when she might be gettin' back? About which I do not care.
Willow I haven't heard from her. I got a couple postcards when she went to L.A., but then, like, nothing.
Xander Well, she's probably with her dad having a good time.
Willow And you don't care?
Xander Well, okay, there might be some interest. I'm a man. I have certain desires, certain needs...
Willow Uhhh! I don't wanna know.
Xander I got a movie for ya!
Willow Xander!
Xander You're Amish! You can't fight back... 'cause you're Amish! I mock you with my ice cream cone, Amish guy!
Willow Witness. My nose is cold.
Xander Let me get that for ya.
Willow Xander!
Xander I'm sorry, I can't help myself. Your nose looks so tasty.
Xander Willow, go!
Buffy Hi, guys!
Buffy Miss me?
Willow Buffy!
Xander Hey!
Buffy Hey. Hey, Will!
Xander Man, your timing really doesn't suck.
Willow When'd you get back?
Buffy Uh, just now. Dad drove me down. And I figured you two losers would be getting into some kind of trouble.
Willow I think we had the upper hand. I-in a subtle way.
Buffy Does either of you even have a cross? Very sloppy.
Xander Well, it's been a slow summer. I mean, that's the first vampire we've seen since you killed the Master.
Buffy It's like they knew I was coming back.
Xander So, what about you? How was your summer? Did you slay anything?
Buffy No. Uh, just hung out, partied some, shopping was also a major theme.
Xander Well, you haven't lost your touch. That vampire...
Buffy I did kinda whale on him, didn't I?
Xander I like your hair.
Buffy So, how did you guys fare? Did you have any fun without me?
Xander No.
Willow Yes!
Xander Uh, our summer was kinda yawnworthy. Our biggest excitement was burying the Master.
Willow That's right, you missed it. Right out by that tree. Giles buried the bones and we poured holy water and we got to wear robes.
Xander Very intense. You shoulda been.
Willow Have you seen Giles?
Buffy Why would I do that? I'll see him at school.
Xander Man, I'm really glad you're back.
Buffy Me, too.
Hank Okay, then. This is the last of it.
Joyce More clothes?
Hank Oh, do shoes count as clothes?
Joyce How much shopping did you let her do?
Hank Oh, I just thought I was saving you from the big back-to-school clothing nightmare.
Joyce My nightmares of Buffy in school have nothing to do with clothes. Did she manage to stay out of trouble in L.A.?
Hank She did, yeah. She was, um... you know, great.
Joyce But?
Hank She was just, I don't know, um... distant. Not brooding or sulking, just... there was no connection. The more time we spent together, the more I felt like she was nowhere to be seen.
Joyce Hence the shoes?
Hank I may have overcompensated a little bit.
Joyce Hmm.
Hank It's so strange. You know, at least when she was burning stuff down I knew what to say.
Joyce Well, welcome to my world. I haven't been able to get through to her for so long. I'll just be happy if she makes it through the school year.
Cordelia It was a nightmare, a total nightmare.
Cordelia I mean, they promised me they'd take me to St. Croix, and then they just decide to go to Tuscany. Art and buildings? I was totally beachless for a month and a half. No one has suffered like I have. Of course I think that that kind of adversity builds character. Well, then I thought, I already have a lot of character. Is it possible to have too much character?
Snyder The first day back. It always gets me.
Giles Yes.
Snyder I mean, it's incredible. One day the campus is completely bare. Empty. The next, there are children everywhere. Like locusts. Crawling around, mindlessly bent on feeding and mating. Destroying everything in sight in their relentless, pointless desire to exist.
Giles I do enjoy these pep talks. Have you ever considered, given your abhorrence of children, school's principal was not, perhaps, your true vocation?
Snyder Somebody's got to keep an eye on them. They're just a bunch of hormonal time bombs. Every time a pretty girl walks by every boy turns into a gibbering fool.
Giles Ms. Calendar!
Jenny Mr. Giles!
Giles Well, I, uh, um... Hello!
Snyder You see the way these kids gaze at each other... all moony.
Jenny It's good to see you.
Giles Yes.
Snyder You think they're thinking about learning?
Giles Uh, were you headed to the, uh, faculty room?
Jenny Sounds like fun!
Snyder I try and tell 'em about the important things in life. Discipline, responsibility, punctuality. Might as well be talking to myself.
Giles How was your summer?
Jenny Extreme. I did Burning Man in Black Rock, ohhh, such a great festival, you should've been there. They had drum rituals, mobile sculptures, raves, naked mud dances, you would've just... hated it with a fiery passion!
Giles I can't imagine finding any redeeming, uh... Naked?
Jenny Hmm. And you probably spent all summer with your nose in a book.
Giles Yes. I suppose you'd consider that frightfully dull.
Jenny Depends on the book.
Willow Giles!
Xander Yo! G-man! What's up?
Giles Nice to see you. And don't ever call me that.
Jenny Hi, kids.
Willow Hi!
Giles How are you?
Buffy Live and kicking.
Willow Buffy killed a vampire last night.
Buffy Uh, I think you can get a little more volume if you speak from the diaphragm.
Willow Sorry.
Jenny We've got vampires? I thought the Hellmouth was closed.
Giles Well, it's, it's closed, but not gone. The mystical energy that emanates from it is still concentrated in this area.
Xander Which means we're still the undead's favorite party town.
Giles I wonder if they're here for any purpose, particularly.
Buffy You're the Watcher. I just work here.
Giles Yes, I-I must consult my books.
Xander Oh, eight minutes and thirty-three seconds, pay up. I called ten minutes before you'd consult your books about something. Thanks.
Willow We better get to class.
Giles Oh, uh, Buffy! Uh, I realize you've only just returned, but when you're ready I-I think we should start your training again.
Buffy I'm ready. I'll see you after school.
Giles Well, I-I-I understand if, if you want a few days to...
Buffy I'm ready.
Giles Buffy, that's enough.
Giles Buffy!
Giles Uh, safe to say you've stayed in shape.
Buffy I'm ready. Whatever they've got coming next, I'm ready. Yeah.
Absalom We have been put down, kinsmen. We have lost our way. We have lost the night. But despair is for the living. Where they are weak, we will be strong. Where they weep, we rejoice. Where they bleed, we drink! Within three days a New Hope will arise. We will put our faith in him. He will show us the way.
Xander Buffy! Buffy!
Buffy Fine! I'm fine.
Xander Good! It's good that you're fine.
Willow What were you thinking about?
Buffy Nothing.
Xander Oh, c'mon, you can tell us. We're your bosom friends! The friends of your bosom!
Willow Xander.
Buffy I wasn't thinking anything, really.
Willow What'd you do last night?
Buffy Mm. Slept. I had weird dreams.
Xander Dreams are meaningful.
Willow Tsh! Tell me about it. The other night I dreamt that Xander... Uh, I-it wasn't Xander. I-in fact it wasn't me. It was a friend's dream, and she doesn't remember it.
Buffy I bet she doesn't.
Giles Buffy!
Buffy Giles! What is it? You look worried.
Giles This vampire activity, I think I know what they're up to.
Buffy Well, we'll deal with it.
Giles I hope it's that simple.
Buffy It is not to worry. Trust me.
Giles Oh, I don't know. I mean, I've killed you once, it shouldn't be too difficult to do it again.
Buffy What?
Buffy Hello.
Angel Mind if I come in?
Buffy Be my guest.
Angel How are you?
Buffy Peachy. So, is this a social call? It is kinda late. Or, well, it is for me, anyway. What is it for you, lunch hour?
Angel It's not a social call.
Buffy Ah. So, lemme guess. That means grave danger. Gosh, it's good to be home.
Angel I'm sorry. I wish I had better news.
Buffy So, some of your cousins are in town for a family barbecue, and we're all on the menu!
Angel The Anointed One. He's been gathering forces somewhere in town. I'm not sure why.
Buffy Guess I'll find out soon enough, huh?
Angel You don't sound too concerned.
Buffy I can handle myself. Besides, I could use a little action anyway.
Angel Don't underestimate the Anointed One just because he looks like a child. He has power over the rest of them. They'll do anything for him.
Buffy Is that it? Is that everything? Y'know, 'cause you woke me up from a really good dream.
Angel Sorry. I'll go. I missed you.
Buffy I missed you?
Lyrics It doesn't matter what I want / It doesn't matter what I need
Lyrics It doesn't matter if I cry
Joyce How are your new classes?
Buffy Good.
Lyrics Don't matter if I bleed
Joyce Good. Is there the slightest chance that if I asked you what was wrong you would tell me?
Lyrics You've been on a road
Joyce Course not. It would take all the fun out of guessing.
Lyrics Don't know where it goes or where it leads
Willow Angel stopped by? Wow. Was there... Well, I mean, was it having to do with kissing?
Buffy Willow, grow up. Not everything is about kissing.
Xander Yeah. Some stuff's about groping. It wasn't about groping?
Buffy Okay, hormones on parade here? It was pure shoptalk. Remember vampires, pointy teeth, they walk by night, am I ringing a bell?
Willow What did he say?
Buffy Oh, something's up. Nothing I can't handle.
Xander Oh, hey, did you guys hear that Cibo Matto's gonna be at the Bronze tonight?
Willow Cibo Matto? They're playing?
Xander No, Willow, they're gonna be clog dancing.
Willow Cibo Matto can clog dance? Oh, sarcasm, right.
Xander We should attend, no?
Cordelia Oh, look, it's the Three Musketeers.
Buffy Was that an insult?
Xander Kinda lacked punch.
Willow The Three Musketeers were cool.
Cordelia I see your point.
Xander I woulda gone with Stooges.
Cordelia Well, I just meant that you guys always hang out together. So, did you guys fight any demons this summer?
Willow Uh, yes! Our own personal demons.
Xander Uh, such as, as, as lust and, uh, thrift!
Buffy I would have to go with Stooges also.
Cordelia What are you guys talking about? I'm talking about big squiggly demons that came from the ground? Remember? Prom night? With all the vampires.
Buffy Cordelia, your mouth is open and sound is coming from it. This is never good.
Xander No. It's, see, we can't mention that stuff in front of other people, Buffy being the Slayer and all.
Willow You haven't been talking about our little adventure all summer, have you?
Cordelia Are you nuts? Do you think I would tell people that I spent the whole evening with you? Besides, it was all so creepy. That Master guy? And all the screaming? I don't even like to think about it. So your secret's safe with me.
Buffy Well, that works out great. You won't tell anyone that I'm the Slayer, and I won't tell anyone you're a moron.
Xander Now, that was a good insult.
Willow A little too good.
Cordelia What's up with her?
Lyrics Don't, don't want the boys
Willow I just think something's up is all.
Lyrics Don't, don't note the heat
Xander Willow, you're paranoid.
Willow Buffy's never acted like this before. Ever since she got back she's... different.
Lyrics Can't find a spoon...
Xander Buffy's always been different.
Willow She's never been mean.
Lyrics ...that we have had
Xander Any sign of her? She said she was coming.
Lyrics The sugar cubes...
Willow No. The band's cool, though.
Xander Yeah, cool.
Lyrics ...can melt our mouth / We belong, yes, to-to-together
Lyrics We belong, yes, to-to-together / We belong, yes, to-to-together
Xander You got somethin' on your nose.
Lyrics We belong, yes, to-to-together / We belong, yes, to-to-together
Lyrics We belong, yes, to-to-together
Absalom Don't just stand there. Dig! We have to hurry.
Vampire The ground is consecrated! It burns!
Collin Dig.
Lyrics The velocity of time... turns her voice into... sugar water
Buffy Hi.
Angel Hi.
Buffy So, is there danger at the Bronze? Should I beware?
Angel I can't help thinking I've done something to make you angry. And that bothers me more than I'd like.
Buffy I'm not angry. I don't know where that comes from.
Angel What are you afraid of? Me? Us?
Buffy Could you contemplate getting over yourself for a second? There's no 'us'. Look, Angel, I'm sorry if I was supposed to spend the summer mooning over you, but I didn't. I moved on. To the living.
Lyrics I'm on a concrete way / The wind is blowing...
Buffy Hey!
Willow Hi.
Xander Hey.
Lyrics ...to the north-northwest
Willow What's wrong with Angel?
Buffy Beats me.
Lyrics It smells like sands of the southern island
Buffy Let's dance.
Xander Ooo-kay.
Lyrics When a black cat crosses my path
Lyrics A woman in the moon is singing to the earth / A woman in the moon is singing to the earth / La la la, la la la la la la / La la la, la la la la la la
Lyrics La la la, la la la la la la / La la la, la la la la la la
Lyrics I'm riding on a camel that has big eyes / The buildings are changing into coconut trees / Little by little
Buffy Xander? Did I ever thank you... for saving my life?
Lyrics When a black cat...
Xander No.
Lyrics ...crosses my path
Lyrics A woman in the moon is singing to the earth
Buffy Don't you wish I would?
Lyrics A woman in the moon is singing to the earth
Lyrics La la la, la la la la la la
Lyrics La la la, la la la la la la
Cordelia Buffy. You're really campaigning for bitch-of-the-year, aren't you?
Buffy As defending champion, you nervous?
Cordelia I can hold my own. You know, we've never really been close, which is nice, 'cause I don't really like you that much, but... you have on occasion saved the world and stuff, so I'm gonna... do you a favor.
Buffy And this great favor is...
Cordelia I'm gonna give you some advice. Get over it.
Buffy Excuse me?
Cordelia Whatever is causing the Joan Collins 'tude, deal with it. Embrace the pain, spank your inner moppet, whatever, but get over it. 'Cause pretty soon you're not even gonna have the loser friends you've got now.
Buffy I think it's about time you start minding your own business.
Cordelia It's long past.
Buffy Nighty-night.
Cordelia I'll just see if Angel feels like dancing.
Cordelia Ms., Ms. Calendar? Oh, God, Ms. Calendar?
Willow She's possessed!
Giles Possessed?
Willow That's the only explanation that makes any sense. I mean, you should've seen her last night. That wasn't Buffy.
Xander Are we overlooking the idea that she may be very attracted to me? She's possessed.
Giles Possessed by what?
Willow Aaaaa possessing thing!
Giles Well, that narrows it down.
Xander Well, you're the expert. Hey, maybe when the Master killed her some... mystical bad guy transference thing happened.
Willow That's what it was! I mean, why else would she be acting like such a b-i-t-c-h?
Giles Willow, I think we're all a little too old to be spelling things out.
Xander A bitca?
Giles Yes. I suggest that, uh, the explanation for her behavior may be something more, more mundane.
Giles She may simply have what you Americans refer to as issues. Uh, her experience with the Master must have been extremely traumatic. Well, she was, for at least a few minutes, technically dead. I-I don't think she's dealt with that on a conscious level. She's convinced herself that she's invulnerable... for the very reason that she feels...
Xander That's a very interesting point about trout, you just brought up now.
Giles Trout? Trout! Yes, trout, i-is a fish. Good morning. Did you sleep well?
Buffy Like a rock. Master's gone.
Giles I'm sorry?
Buffy The Master. I went by his grave last night, and they have a vacancy.
Giles Good God!
Willow What would somebody want with Master bones?
Xander A trophy, a horrible conversation piece?
Buffy They're gonna bring him back. They're gonna bring the Master back to life, and I seem to recall you telling me he was history.
Giles Buffy, I-I-I've never heard of a-a revivification ritual being successful.
Buffy But you've heard of them? Thanks for the warning.
Willow Well, Buffy, Giles did bury him and...
Buffy Look, this is Slayer stuff, okay? Could we have just a little less from the civilians, please?
Xander Okay, that's just about enough!
Snyder I believe some of us have class? And some of us have jobs.
Giles Y-yes, well, I'll, uh, I'll see you all, uh, in the library later. We'll, we'll continue this discussion.
Willow About trout.
Snyder There're some things I can just smell. It's like a sixth sense.
Giles No, actually that would be one of the five.
Snyder That Summers girl. I smell trouble. I smell expulsion, and just the faintest aroma of jail.
Giles Well, before you throw away the key, you might consider giving her the benefit of the doubt. She may surprise you.
Snyder You really have faith in those kids, don't you?
Giles Yes, I do.
Snyder Weird.
Giles Alright, alright, I-I-I've got something. It's Latin, so bear with me. Uh, to revive the vampire they need his bones, uh... w-which they have, and, um, the blood... this is very unclear, of the closest person... uh, someone connected to the vampire.
Buffy That'd be me.
Giles Perhaps.
Buffy We were close. We killed each other. It really promotes togetherness.
Xander Well, is there anything on when the ceremony might take...
Xander Whoa!
Buffy This is Cordelia's. 'Come to the Bronze before it opens, or we make her a meal.'
Xander They're gonna cook her dinner? I'll pretend I didn't say that.
Willow What do we do?
Buffy I go to the Bronze and save the day.
Xander I don't like this.
Giles Nor I!
Buffy Yeah? Well, you guys aren't going.
Willow What do you mean?
Buffy I can't do it anymore. I can't look after the three of you guys while I'm fighting.
Willow Well, what about the rest of the note?
Buffy What rest of the note?
Willow The part that says, 'P.S. This is a trap'?
Giles You'll be playing straight into their hands.
Buffy I can handle this.
Willow Stop saying that! God, what's wrong with you?
Xander Cordelia may be dead.
Buffy This is my fight.
Buffy Y'know, being stalked isn't really a big turn-on for girls.
Angel You need help. Someone to watch your back.
Buffy Sure you don't mean my neck?
Angel Why are you ridin' me?
Buffy Because I don't trust you. You're a vampire. Oh, I'm sorry, was that an offensive term? Should I say 'undead American'?
Angel You have to trust someone. You can't do this alone.
Buffy I trust me.
Angel You're not as strong as you think.
Buffy You think you can take me?
Angel What?
Buffy Oh, c'mon! I mean, you must've thought about it. What would happen if it ever came down to a fight, you vampire, me the Slayer, I mean, you must've wondered! Well, why don't we find out?
Angel I'm not gonna fight you.
Buffy Come on! Kick my ass!
Angel Don't you have somewhere to be?
Buffy I do.
Angel Well, you're wasting time.
Buffy Just stay out of my way.
Angel Happy to oblige.
Buffy That's not Cordelia.
Vampire Cordelia couldn't make it.
Buffy Where is she?
Vampire I'm not supposed to tell.
Angel I don't like this.
Buffy Don't like what?
Angel There's the bait. Where's the hook?
Buffy You're right. Why would they send just one?
Willow I still think we should've gone with her.
Xander Buffy's about to lose it. I think we should be trying to reach minimum safe distance.
Willow Xander, you know it's a trap!
Giles Ah! Ah, ah, ah! Uh, uh, the Latin is, is translated from the Sumerian, a-a-and rather badly. Closest to the Master actually translates as 'nearest'. Physically. The, the, the person or persons who were with him... when he... It is a trap.
Giles It just isn't for her.
Buffy Watch her. Don't kill her unless you have to.
Angel Buffy! What's goin' on?
Buffy I'll be back.
Buffy Xander!
Buffy What happened?
Xander Vampires. The ones you could handle yourself.
Buffy Where are the others?
Xander I don't know. I don't know what your problem is, what your issues are. But as of now, I officially don't care. If you'd worked with us for five seconds, you coulda stopped this.
Buffy We, we just have to think. Where would they have taken them?
Xander If they hurt Willow, I'll kill you.
Buffy Why did they take them and not you?
Xander Giles said the ritual was, um... They needed people who were close to the Master. Physically close. When he, uh...
Buffy The ones who were with the Master when he died.
Xander Giles, Willow, Cordelia...
Buffy Ms. Calendar.
Xander Odds are they've got a complete set by now.
Buffy We need to find out where.
Xander How?
Buffy One more time: where are they?
Vampire You're too late. Your friends are dead.
Buffy Tell me where they are!
Vampire What are you gonna do? Kill me?
Buffy As a matter of fact...
Buffy ...yes. But since I'm not gonna kill you any time soon, the question becomes...
Buffy ...how are we gonna pass the time till then?
Buffy So. One more time.
Absalom Begin.
Absalom Behold, these four mortals.
Absalom Witnesses to our Master's wretched demise. They will breathe their last this night. The blood that pours from their throats will bring NEW LIFE to the old one. We gather for his resurrection. For the dawn of this new hell.
Xander Buffy! Buffy! We gotta do something now!
Buffy You two get the others out of here.
Angel We need you to distract the vampires.
Buffy Right.
Xander What are you gonna do?
Buffy I'm gonna kill them all. That oughta distract them.
Absalom For the old one. For his pain. For the dark.
Vampires For the dark!
Absalom The sacrifices! Stop them!
Giles Are you alright?
Jenny Yeah, I'm okay.
Giles Where's Buffy?
Xander Uh, she's working out her issues.
Absalom ENOUGH!
Absalom Your day is done, girl. I'll grind you into a *sticky* paste, and hear you beg before I smash in your face.
Buffy So, are you gonna kill me or are we just making small talk?
Willow It's over.
Xander No, it's not.
Angel It's okay. It's okay.
Cordelia What an ordeal. And you know what the worst part is?
Jenny What?
Cordelia It stays with you forever. No matter what they tell you, none of that rust and blood and grime comes out. I mean, you can dry clean till judgment day, you are living with those stains.
Jenny Yeah that's the worst part of being hung upside down by a vampire who wants to slit your throat: the stains.
Cordelia I hear ya!
Buffy I don't think I can face them.
Giles Hmm? Of course, you can.
Buffy I can't! What am I supposed say? 'Sorry I almost got your throat slit. What's the homework?'
Giles Punishing yourself like this is pointless.
Buffy It's entirely pointy. I was a moron. I put my best friends in mortal danger on the second day of school.
Giles What are you gonna do? Crawl inside a cave for the rest of your life?
Buffy Would it have cable?
Giles Buffy, you acted wrongly, I admit that. But believe me, that was hardly the, the worst mistake you'll ever make. Uh, that wasn't quite as comforting as it was meant to be.
Buffy Well, points for effort. See ya.
Willow Hey, Buffy.
Buffy Hey.
Willow We saved you a seat.
Xander There's a rumor going around that, uh, Mr. Cox is the most boring teacher in the entire world. Like, I think he won a belt or something.
Buffy Like, yes.
Willow Well, I hear he nods off a lot. So that's a plus.
Xander So, we Bronzin' it tonight?
Willow Wednesday, it's kinda beat.
Xander Well, we could grind our enemies into talcum powder with a sledgehammer, but, gosh, we did that last night.
Xander Hey, I got a plan: how 'bout miniature golf.
Willow There's no course here.
Xander Okay, uh, miniature tennis! A very tiny form of tennis that we could invent...
Collin I hate that girl.
