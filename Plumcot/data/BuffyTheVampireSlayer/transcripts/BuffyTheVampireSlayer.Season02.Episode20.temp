Custodian Can I help you?
Philip Rupert Giles! I need to see him!
Custodian Mr. Giles, uh, he's our librarian. Next building over, first door on your left.
Custodian You're welcome.
Philip Oh, God!
Philip Diedre?
Diedre Philip.
Philip Help! Help! Somebody, please!
Philip God, no! Help!
Giles Must we have this noise during your calisthenics?
Buffy It's not noise! It's music!
Giles I know music. Music has notes. This is noise.
Buffy I'm aerobicising! I must have a beat!
Giles Wonderful. You work on your muscle tone while my brain dribbles out of my ears.
Philip Help! Help! Please!
Philip Help me, somebody, please!
Giles Ahhh! Very good. And the rest is silence.
Young_Giles Time to go to sleep!
Buffy I'm on a beach, but not one of those American beaches, one of those island beaches where the water's way too blue, and I'm laying on my towel, and it's just before sunset, and Gavin Rossdale's massaging my feet!
Willow Oh, that's good! Uh, I'm in Florence, Italy, I've rented a scooter that's parked outside, and I'm in a little restaurant eating ziti, and there are no more tables left, so they have to seat this guy with me, and it's John Cusack!
Buffy Ooo! Very impressive. You have such an eye for detail.
Willow 'Cause with the ziti!
Xander What are you two up to?
Buffy Just having a quick game of 'Anywhere But Here'.
Xander Ooohhh. Amy Yip at the waterslide park.
Willow You never come up with anything new.
Xander I'm just not fickle like you two, okay? I'm constant in my affections. Amy Yip at the waterslide park!
Willow Do you think Giles ever played 'Anywhere But Here' when he was in school?
Xander Giles lived for school. He's actually still bitter that there are only twelve grades.
Buffy He probably sat in math class thinking, 'There should be more math. This could be mathier.'
Willow C'mon, you don't think he ever got restless as a kid?
Buffy Are you kidding? His diapers were tweed.
Buffy Giles!
Giles Oh! There you are.
Buffy Hey, morning. Say, is that tweed?
Giles What? Oh, uh, yes. Um, now, uh, look, tonight is very important, um...
Buffy Now, that's a surprise.
Buffy So, what's on tap tonight that's so important? Uprising, prophesied ritual, preordained deathfest?
Xander Ah, the old standards!
Giles Um, a medical transport is delivering the monthly supply of blood to the hospital.
Buffy Mm. Vampire Meals-On-Wheels.
Giles Hopefully not. Uh, we'll meet outside the hospital at 8:30 sharp. I'll bring the weaponry.
Buffy I'll bring the party mix!
Giles Just don't be late.
Buffy Have I ever let you down?
Giles Do you want me to answer that, or shall I just glare?
Jenny Morning, England.
Giles Oh, hello, Ms., uh, uh, tuh, Jenny.
Willow Feel the passion!
Xander Mm-hm!
Jenny Willow...
Willow Coughing, not speaking.
Jenny We still on for tomorrow?
Xander What's tomorrow?
Jenny I'm reviewing some computer basics for the couple of students who've fallen behind. Willow's helping out for extra credit.
Xander Those poor schlubs have to attend school on Saturday!
Jenny 9am okay with you, Xander?
Buffy Got a bit of schlub on your shoe there.
Xander Heh, heh.
Jenny Well, Cordelia's gonna meet us.
Xander Ooo, gang, did ya hear that? A bonus day of class plus Cordelia! Mix in a little rectal surgery, and it's my best day ever!
Jenny Walk me to class?
Giles Pleasure.
Buffy Look at them.
Xander A twosome of cuteness.
Willow Can't you just imagine them getting together?
Jenny Oh! Thank you so much for loaning me the Forrester book. It's wonderful!
Giles Well, I'm glad you enjoyed it!
Jenny Yeah, it was so romantic, so evocative.
Giles That edition was my father's. I, I, I must've read it... twenty times.
Jenny Yeah, y'know how you have to, to dog-ear your favorite pages so you can go back to them?
Giles Uh, uh, uh, what?
Jenny Well, I mean, I-I practically had to fold back every single page. So finally I just, I just started underlining all the pages I really wanted to discuss.
Giles U-u-underlined...?
Jenny But then, of course, I spilled coffee all over it, I can't even read it...
Giles It's a first edition!
Jenny I'm lying, Rupert. The book's fine. I just love to see you squirm.
Giles Yes, well, I, uh... trust I gave good... squirm.
Jenny Did anyone ever tell you you're kind of a fuddy-duddy?
Giles Nobody ever seems to tell me anything else.
Jenny Did anyone ever tell you you're kind of a sexy fuddy-duddy?
Giles Well, no. Actually that, that part usually gets left out. I c-can't imagine why.
Jenny This weekend.
Giles Would you like to go out?
Jenny Mm, no, I think I'd like to stay in.
Giles Uh, this, Saturday, then.
Jenny Saturday night. I'll see if I can make you squirm.
Det._Winslow Rupert Giles?
Giles Yes?
Det._Winslow Detective Winslow. You're gonna have to come with me.
Giles Why?
Det._Winslow There was a homicide on campus last night. The victim had no identification, but he was carrying this slip of paper with your name and address on it.
Giles My name?
Cordelia Well, evil just compounds evil, doesn't it? First I'm sentenced to a computer tutorial on Saturday, now I have to read some computer book... There are books on computers? Isn't the point of computers to replace books?
Giles Cordelia, I'm a little busy right now.
Cordelia Oh! Great! Can you help me with a ticket? It's totally bogus. It was a one-way street. I was going one way.
Giles Cordelia!
Cordelia What?! Why does everyone always yell my name? I'm not deaf! And I can take a hint. What's the hint?
Giles To come back later.
Cordelia Yeah, when you've visited decaf land.
Giles Where do you want me to go?
Attendant Have you had your breakfast?
Giles No.
Attendant That was probably a good idea.
Det._Winslow Do you know him?
Giles Yes. Yes. I-I mean, I did. His name's Philip Henry. He was a friend of mine in London. I... I haven't spoken to him in twenty years.
Det._Winslow Can you think of any reason why he might've wanted to contact you?
Giles No.
Det._Winslow Do you know what that is? The tattoo.
Giles No. No, I don't.
Buffy 'Don't be late.' Sheesh.
Driver Hey, fellas.
Doctor Hey.
Buffy All's well that ends with cute ER doctors, I always say.
Buffy Since when do doctors take deliveries?
Doctor See ya.
Driver Hey! No sampling the product!
Buffy Angel!
Angel Buffy! Look out!
Buffy How did you know about this?
Angel It's delivery day. Everybody knows about this. They only ruined one bag.
Buffy Do you think you could make sure the hospital gets the rest?
Buffy Thanks. I'm worried about Giles. He was supposed to meet me here.
Angel Maybe he's late.
Buffy Giles? Who counts tardiness as, like, the eighth deadly sin?
Angel Right. Go.
Giles Buffy. I-it's late. Uh, are you alright?
Buffy I was gonna ask you the same thing.
Giles Yes, I'm fine, fine. Look, I'm, uh, I'm rather busy a-at the moment, so, uh, I'll see you on Monday at, at school.
Buffy Giles, did you forget? The hospital, vampires, handy carryout packets of blood?
Giles Oh! Yes, uh, are you alright? W-were you hurt?
Buffy No. I mean, my feelings a little. What's wrong?
Giles Nothing, nothing, nothing's wrong. I-I'm just in the, uh, middle of something extremely important, and, uh, I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to say good night now.
Giles Yes, I'm, I'm sorry to disturb you. It's, uh... I-I realize it's, uh, five in the morning there, um... Uh, I-I'm trying to reach Diedre Page. My name is Rupert Giles, uh, uh, she knows me. It's, it's very important. I'm terribly sorry. I... I-I didn't know. W-when did she, uh, pass away? Ohhhh. That recently. Um, yes, yes, um, we were friends when we were young. My condolences.
Giles So. You're back.
Cordelia This isn't right. School on a Saturday. It throws off my internal clock.
Xander When are we gonna need computers for real life anyway?
Jenny Hmm, let's see. There's home, school, work, games...
Xander Y'know, computers are on the way out. I think paper's gonna make a big comeback.
Willow And the abacus.
Xander Yeah, you know, you don't see enough abaci.
Jenny Alright, guys. The first thing we're gonna do is... Buffy!
Xander Huh? Did I fall asleep already?
Willow Aw, you miss your friends?
Xander Uh, sit here, Buffs! Demilitarize the zone between me and Cordelia!
Cordelia Yeah, and delouse him while you're at it.
Buffy Actually I wanted to talk to you for a second?
Jenny Something wrong?
Xander Is there some crisis that requires instant action? Very far from here?
Buffy It's Giles.
Jenny Well, he's alright, isn't he?
Buffy I don't know. Uh, he didn't show up when he was supposed to last night, and then, when I went over to his place, he was acting... well, very anti-Giles. He wouldn't let me in, and he looked really bad. I-I think he might've been... I think he was drinking.
Jenny He was home alone drinking?
Willow But... tea, right?
Buffy Wasn't tea, Will.
Xander Yep, yep, I knew this would happen. Nobody can be wound as straight and narrow as Giles without a dark side erupting. My Uncle Roary was the stodgiest taxidermist you've ever met by day. By night, it was booze, whores, and fur flying. Were there whores?
Buffy He was alone.
Xander Give it time.
Buffy So, none of you guys have noticed anything different lately?
Willow No!
Jenny Not really.
Buffy Uh, you haven't seen anything weird?
Xander Nope.
Cordelia No, he seemed perfectly normal yesterday when I saw him talking to the police.
Buffy And you waited till now to tell us this because...?
Cordelia I didn't think it was important.
Xander We understand. It wasn't about you.
Jenny Well, what were the police talking to him about?
Cordelia Oh, don't tell me, I know this one. Um... Something about... a homicide.
Buffy That's it. I-I'm calling him right now.
Buffy I know you! You were in that costume shop.
Ethan Oh, I'm pleased you remember.
Buffy You sold me that dress for Halloween, and nearly got us all killed!
Ethan But you looked great.
Ethan Owww! So now we're even?
Buffy I'll let you know when we're even. What're you doing here?
Ethan Snooping around.
Buffy Honesty. Nice touch.
Ethan It's one of my virtues. Not really.
Buffy I've got a great idea: why don't I just call the police and have you arrested for breaking and entering, and then I can get back to my fun Saturday?
Ethan Yes, the police. Well, they'll have all those questions, and they'll really need Rupert to answer them all.
Buffy You know Giles.
Ethan We go back. Way back. You don't happen to know where he is, do you?
Giles Hello.
Buffy Giles, it's me.
Giles Buffy, u-unless this is an emergency, I'll see you on Monday.
Buffy What's the Mark of Eyghon?
Buffy Giles?
Ethan Cat got his tongue?
Buffy I'm in your office with someone who claims to be an old friend of yours. Ethan Rayne?
Giles He's there with you? Listen, Buffy, you're... you're in grave danger while Ethan's there. I want you to put the phone down and get out of the library as soon as possible.
Buffy I'm not going anywhere until you give me some answers!
Giles Buffy?
Philip Ethan!
Buffy Don't let him get away!
Willow I'm not gonna get close enough to feel his pulse, but... he looks dead.
Xander Except for the walking and attacking Buffy part.
Ethan He's dead. Sorry, Philip. Really I am.
Giles Is everyone alright?
Cordelia Super! I kicked a guy!
Jenny We're okay.
Xander Deadguy here interrupted our tutorial. Been meaning to thank you for that.
Giles It can't be!
Ethan Yes, it can. Hello, Ripper.
Giles I thought I told you to leave town.
Ethan You did. I didn't. Shop's lease is paid till the end of the month.
Cordelia Uh, why did he call him Ripper?
Giles You should've left when I told you.
Cordelia Ohhhh...
Buffy Giles?!
Giles You put these people in danger. The people I care about.
Ethan If you cared so much about them, why didn't *you* leave town? You've been having the dreams, I know. I have. We both know what's coming.
Buffy What dreams?! What is going on here?!
Ethan Tell her, Ripper.
Buffy Giles...
Giles JENNY!
Willow Now, there's something you don't see everyday.
Cordelia I'm gonna be in therapy till I'm thirty.
Buffy Where's Ethan? Where'd he go?
Giles Are you alright, Jenny?
Jenny Ow!
Giles Careful!
Jenny Ohhh...
Giles Can you stand?
Jenny I think so.
Cordelia This is what happens when you have school on Saturday.
Jenny Mm.
Giles Lean on me. It'll be alright.
Jenny Promise?
Giles I promise.
Jenny I believe you.
Giles How's your head?
Jenny Throbbing.
Buffy I lost Ethan. Giles, what's going on?
Giles It's complicated, Buffy, and quite frankly, it's private.
Buffy I don't care from private! I care from dead guys attacking us. I care from you lost weekending in your apartment.
Giles I wasn't... I was just trying to find a solution.
Buffy Giles, share! What is the Mark of Eyghon?
Giles Hey! This is not your battle! And as your Watcher, I'm telling you unequivocally to stay out of it!
Giles I have to get Jenny home.
Jenny Mm. Thank you.
Buffy We have work to do. Will, I want you to find out anything and everything you can about the Mark of Eyghon.
Willow I'll try the 'Net, but 'Mark of Eyghon' sounds like Giles and his books sorta deal.
Buffy Then we hit the books.
Buffy Xander, how do you feel about digging through some of Giles' personal files and seeing what you can find?
Xander I feel pretty good about it. Does that make me a sociopath? Nah.
Buffy What?
Cordelia What about me? I care about Giles.
Buffy Uh, work with Xander.
Cordelia Well, when I say 'care', I, I mean...
Buffy Cordelia...
Cordelia Okay, okay!
Jenny Thanks for bringing me here. Not quite ready to be home alone just yet.
Jenny Ooo!
Giles Jenny, uh... I'm so very sorry about all of this. I, uh... I never meant for you to be involved in, in, uh, any of this.
Jenny So I got involved. That's what happens when two people get involved.
Giles I really am, however, gonna have to get you home. It's not, uh... I'm not a very safe person to be around at the moment.
Jenny Nothing's safe in this world, Rupert. Don't you know that by now?
Willow Ah! Aha! It's not Egyptian, it's Etruscan mistaken for Egyptian by the design pattern, but any fool can see it predates their iconology. Look, the Mark of Eyghon, worn by his initiates. 'Eyghon, also called the Sleepwalker, can only exist in this reality by possessing an unconscious host. Temporary possession imbues the host with a euphoric feeling of power.'
Buffy Yeah, but what about non-temporary?
Willow 'Unless the proper rituals are observed, the possession is permanent, and Eyghon will be born from within the host.'
Cordelia I'm guessing eww!
Willow Wait. Hey, listen. 'Once called, Eyghon can also take possession of the dead, but its demonic energy soon disintegrates the host, and it must jump to the nearest dead or unconscious person to continue living.'
Buffy I still don't get what this has to do with Giles.
Willow I don't know about Giles, but ancient sects used to induce possession for bacchanals and, and orgies.
Xander Okay! Giles and orgies in the same sentence. I coulda lived without that one.
Buffy Uh, wait a minute. The dead guy's all puddly now.
Cordelia So the demon's gone. There was no one dead to jump into. I mean, we're all not dead, right?
Buffy No, no one dead.
Xander But someone unconscious.
Giles What was that?
Jenny What was what?
Giles I thought I heard something.
Jenny I didn't.
Giles Here. Drink that, and then I'll drive you home.
Jenny You could take me home. Or you could take advantage of me in my weakened state.
Buffy Thank you, operator. There's no answer at Ms. Calendar's, and Giles' phone is out of order. I'm gonna go over there.
Giles Jenny, uh... I'm, I'm really very attracted t-to you.
Jenny Good.
Giles But, um, now really isn't the right time.
Jenny Oh, there's never been a better time.
Giles It's not right. I would be taking advantage.
Jenny God, you just don't change, do you?
Giles What?
Jenny It's not right, it wouldn't be proper, people might get hurt. You're like a woman, Ripper. You cry at every funeral. You never had the strength for me. You don't deserve me. But guess what? You've got me. Under your skin.
Jenny/Eyghon Was it good for you?
Jenny/Eyghon Aw, you never had the stomach. But that's okay. 'Cause I'm about to rip it out!
Buffy Back off!
Jenny/Eyghon Three down, two to go. Be seeing ya.
Buffy Are you alright?
Giles Oh, Jenny! Oh, God!
Buffy Giles, how do we stop this?
Giles Oh, God, what have I done?
Buffy Talk to me! Giles, you're scaring me.
Giles I'm sorry.
Buffy Don't be sorry, be Giles. C'mon, we fight monsters. This is what we do. They show up, they scare us, I beat 'em up and they go away. This isn't any different!
Giles It *is* different.
Buffy Because you don't know how to stop it?
Giles Because I created it!
Willow Did you find anything?
Xander The most meticulous banking and phone records you've ever seen. And, um, this.
Willow That's Giles?
Giles I was twenty-one, studying history at Oxford. And, of course, the occult by night. I hated it. The tedious grind of study, the... overwhelming pressure of my destiny. I dropped out, I went to London... I fell in with the worst crowd that would have me. We practiced magicks. Small stuff for pleasure or gain. And Ethan and I discovered something... bigger.
Buffy Eyghon.
Giles Yes. One of us would, um... go into a deep sleep, and the others would, uh, summon him. It was an extraordinary high! God, we were fools.
Buffy You couldn't control it.
Giles One of us, Randall, he lost control. Eyghon took him whole. We tried to exorcise the demon from Randall, but it killed him. No. We killed him. We thought we were free of the demon after that. But now he's back. And one by one, he will kill us all.
Buffy Three down, two to go?
Buffy Then it's going after Ethan. I better beat it there.
Giles *We'd* better.
Buffy *I'd* better. Giles, you're barely mobile, and speed is of a serious essence here.
Giles I don't know how to stop it without killing Jenny.
Buffy I've got the guys working on it. I'll, um, try to contain it until we figure something.
Giles Buffy? I'm sorry.
Buffy I know.
Buffy Ethan? Ethan? Giles told me everything. Look, it's coming for you.
Ethan And you came to protect me? I'm touched.
Buffy Don't worry, it's nothing personal. To protect Giles I have to protect you.
Ethan How does Ripper inspire such goodness?
Buffy 'Cause he's Giles.
Ethan And I'm not. Still, lucky me.
Buffy Hmm. Lucky you.
Ethan Well, we can't run. Eyghon will find us. This mark's like a homing beacon.
Buffy That's okay. I'm not much into running.
Ethan Aren't we manly?
Buffy One of us is. You're gonna hide till it's over.
Ethan Excellent plan.
Buffy Is there a way in through the back?
Ethan Uh, there's a back door. It's locked. I think it's solid.
Buffy We'll set up there. Let's go.
Ethan Oh, no, please.
Ethan Ladies first.
Ethan Wakey, wakey. You're missing all the fun.
Buffy What fun?
Ethan Your initiation.
Buffy You know what? I'm not real interested in joining your club.
Ethan Too late. I already voted you in. Y'know, I hope you're not taking this personally, Buffy. I actually kinda like you. It's ju, it's just that I like myself a whole lot more. If you think of it karmically, this is, this is really big for your soul.
Ethan You know, taking my place with the demon, giving so that others may live.
Buffy I'm gonna kill you. Will that blow the whole karma thing?
Ethan Sweet child. Now, this may sting a little just at first. But don't worry, that'll go away once the searing pain kicks in.
Ethan You can go ahead and scream if you like.
Willow We have to figure out how to kill this thing, and we need to do it fast.
Xander Uh, 'hot lava.'
Willow That's for a heretic.
Xander Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, okay. Uh, ooo, ooo! 'Bury a potato!' No, that's for warts. Who writes this stuff?
Cordelia I've got the solution right here. 'To kill a demon cut off its head.'
Xander Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah! We'll, uh, find Ms. Calendar, then we'll decapitate her. Hey! She'll be the first headless computer teacher in school. You think anybody'll notice?
Cordelia Do you know what you need, Xander, besides a year's supply of acne cream? A brain.
Xander That's it! Twelve years of you and I'm snappin'! I don't care if you're a girl or not, I'm throwin' down! Come on!
Cordelia I've seen you fight. And don't think I can't take you!
Xander Give it your best shot.
Willow HEY! We don't have time for this! Our friends are in trouble! Now, we have to put our heads together and, and get them out of it! And if you two aren't with me a hundred and ten percent, then get the hell out of my library!
Cordelia We're sorry.
Xander We'll be good.
Willow Okay. Now, we've done the research. We just have to figure out how to use it.
Xander Oh, hey! Why don't we find another dead body for the demon to jump into!
Cordelia Yes! At the cemetery.
Willow Well, that won't kill the demon. It'll only give it a change of scenery. Oh. Oh! Oh, I've got it! I've got it!
Xander She's good!
Ethan Hmm. I think I missed my calling as an artist.
Buffy Ethan, listen to me. This is a bad idea. You're dealing with something very dangerous.
Ethan But it will get Eyghon off my scent.
Ethan Now relax. I'm finished with you. This is for me.
Giles Oh! Ethan... No. No!
Ethan Well, I hate to mutilate and run, but...
Jenny/Eyghon It's your time.
Giles Eyghon! Take me.
Giles Buffy, get out of here!
Buffy NO! No!
Jenny/Eyghon I've been waiting a long time to do this.
Giles He's killing her!
Willow No! Trust me! This is gonna work!
Giles Jenny!
Giles Jenny!
Jenny Rupert...
Buffy You knew that if the demon was in trouble it was gonna jump into the nearest dead person.
Angel I put it in danger.
Willow And it jumped.
Angel I've had a demon inside me for a couple hundred years... just waitin' for a good fight.
Buffy Winner and still champion.
Xander Uh, I think that Ethan guy disappeared again.
Buffy Darn. I really wanted to hit him till he bled.
Cordelia Well, at least it's over.
Buffy You know what the worst thing is? I was saving up for some very important shoes, and now I have to blow my entire allowance to get this stupid tattoo removed. Let's just hope my mom doesn't see it first.
Xander Puttin' that demon into Angel was pretty brill, Will.
Willow I wasn't sure it was gonna work.
Buffy But it did.
Xander Like a charm.
Buffy Hey! Maybe you should consider a career as a Watcher.
Willow Oh, no, I don't think I could handle the stress.
Xander And the dental plan is crap.
Willow I don't see how Giles does it.
Buffy I don't think he has a choice.
Giles Uh, uh, Jenny! Jenny...
Jenny Rupert, hi.
Giles Uh... I-I-I tried to call you last night, s-see how you were.
Jenny Yeah, I-I-I, uh... I left my phone off the hook. I seem to need a lot of sleep lately.
Giles But, but you're al-alright? Is, is, is there anything you need?
Jenny Mm, no, I'm fine. I mean, I'm not... running around, wind in my hair, 'the hills are alive with the sound of music' fine, but... I'm coping.
Giles I, I would like to help.
Jenny I know.
Giles Perhaps we could, um, talk sometime, um... dinner, or, or a drink? When you're feeling stronger.
Jenny Sure, sometime.
Jenny Yeah. Sometime. I better get to class.
Giles Yes, of course.
Buffy Hey.
Buffy Is she okay?
Giles Um... The hills are not alive.
Buffy I'm sorry to hear that. I think.
Giles I don't think she'll ever really forgive me. Maybe she shouldn't.
Buffy Maybe you should.
Giles I never wanted you to see that side of me.
Buffy I'm not gonna lie to you. It was scary. I'm so used to you being a grownup, and then I find out that you're a person.
Giles Most grownups are.
Buffy Who would've thought?
Giles Some are even, uh... shortsighted, foolish people.
Buffy So, after all this time, we finally find out that we *do* have something in common. Which, apart from being a little weird, is kind of okay. I think we're supposed to be training right now.
Giles Yes. Yes. Um, need to concentrate on your flexibility.
Buffy And you know what? I have just the perfect music. Go on, say it. You know you want to.
Giles It's not music, it's just, uh, meaningless sounds.
Buffy There. Feel better?
Giles Yes. Thanks.
Giles Bay City Rollers. Now, that's music.
Buffy I didn't hear that.
