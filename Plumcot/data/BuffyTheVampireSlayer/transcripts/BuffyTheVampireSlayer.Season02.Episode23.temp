Xander You don't know what you're talking about.
Willow Xander, he was obviously in charge.
Xander He was a puppet! She was using him!
Willow He didn't seem like the type of guy who would let himself be used.
Xander Well, that was her genius! He didn't even know he was playing second fiddle. Buffy.
Buffy Huh?
Xander Who was the real power? The Captain, or Tennille?
Buffy Ummm... Who are these people?
Xander The Captain and Tennille? Boy, somebody was raised in a culture-free environment!
Buffy I'm sorry. I was just...
Willow Thinking?
Buffy No, not thinking. Having a lot of happy non-thoughts. I love it when things are quiet around here.
Xander Yeah, with Spike and Drusilla out of the way, we've really been ridin' the mellow, and I am really jinxing the hell out of us by saying that.
Buffy Yeah, but we'll let you off this time.
Willow So, we're pretty sure that there're not more Tarakan assassins coming our way?
Buffy Angel's sources say the contract's off.
Xander How *is* Angel? Pretend I care.
Buffy Getting better.
Willow And you're loving playing nursemaid?
Buffy Oh, yeah!
Xander So, is it better than playing naughty stewardess?
Buffy Xander...
Buffy You guys wait here a second.
Joyce No!
Buffy Mom!
Buffy Oh, my... I'm sorry, I... I heard...
Joyce Uh, I-I-I broke a wineglass. Y-y-you're home early.
Ted Hi.
Buffy Hi.
Joyce Oh! Uh, this is my daughter, Buffy. Buffy, this is Ted.
Ted Okay, here we go!
Buffy So. All these late nights at the gallery recently I gather you were cataloging more than art.
Joyce Well, I... I've been looking for the right moment to introduce you two. He's a wonderful man.
Ted Sprinkle that on...
Xander Uh, a little more. Okay, more...
Buffy How'd you meet?
Joyce Oh, he sells, uh, computer software. He redid my entire system at the gallery, freed up a lot of my time.
Buffy To meet new people. And smooch them in my kitchen.
Joyce You weren't supposed to see that.
Willow I like my new nine-Gig hard drive.
Ted But you don't love it, 'cause without the DMA upgrade your computer's only half a rocket ship.
Willow Yeah, but who can afford the upgrades?
Ted Well, you can! I get the demos for free, I don't see why I shouldn't give 'em to you for the same price! Any friend of Buffy's...
Ted What?
Xander Oh, that's the sound she makes when she's speechless with geeker joy. Can I just say, this is the finest pizza *ever* on God's green Earth. What is your secret?
Ted Well, after you bake it, you fry it in herbs and olive oil, but you gotta use a cast-iron skillet. No room for compromise there.
Xander Y'know, you should market these things. I mean, you can get two, three hundred bucks apiece!
Ted Hungry?
Buffy No, thanks.
Ted Buffy, I want to apologize. That wasn't how I wanted us to meet. I wanted it to be... perfect. I'm very fond of your mother, I guess that's pretty obvious. I know you're the most important thing in her life, and, well, gosh, that makes you pretty important to me, too.
Joyce Buffy, I really want you to be okay with this.
Ted Beg to differ: *we* really want you to be okay with this.
Buffy I'm okay.
Joyce You are?
Buffy I am.
Giles Buffy? I-I believe he's, he's, um...
Giles It, it's, it's staking time, really. Don't you think?
Buffy Any others?
Giles Well, for their sakes, I certainly hope not.
Buffy What? I kill vampires, that's my job.
Giles Well, true, true, although you don't usually beat them into quite such a bloody pulp beforehand. Everything alright?
Buffy Yeah! Fine!
Buffy I killed a vampire here on Wednesday. Why are they hanging out at the park?
Giles Well, they're... scattered, you know. Now their leaders are gone, with any luck dead. In times of crisis they usually return to the easiest feeding grounds.
Buffy Vampires are creeps.
Giles Yes, that's why one slays them.
Buffy I mean, people are perfectly happy getting along, and then vampires come, and they run around and they kill people, and they take over your whole house, they start making these stupid little mini pizzas, and everyone's like, 'I like your mini pizzas,' but I'm telling you, I am...
Giles Uh, uh, Buffy! I-I believe the... subtext here is, is, rapidly becoming, uh, uh, text. Are you sure there's nothing you want to share?
Buffy No. Forget it. Think there'll be any more? I-I can wait.
Buffy If you say one more word, things will become dire.
Xander Did you even bother to taste 'em? Nooo! Well, I did, and I'm here to tell ya those mini pizzas have changed my life! Ted is the master chef!
Buffy Fine! So he's a good cook. Well, what does that really tell you about a person?
Xander Everything.
Willow You don't like him?
Buffy I don't *know* him. I, I mean, so far all I see is someone who apparently has a good job, seems nice and polite, and my mother really likes him.
Xander What kind of a monster is he?
Buffy I'm just saying there's something a little too clean about this clown.
Willow He's a clean clown! I have my own fun.
Xander Buff, you're lacking evidence. I think maybe we're in Sigmund Freud territory.
Willow He has a point. Separation anxiety, the mother figure being taken away, conflict with the father figure...
Buffy He's *not* my father figure.
Xander Having issues much?
Buffy I am not!
Xander You're having parental issues, you're having parental issues...
Willow Xander...
Xander What? Freud would've said the exact same thing. Except he might not have done that little dance.
Buffy Okay, I admit it's weird. Seeing my mother frenching a guy is definitely a ticket to therapy land, but it's more than that. I'm pretty good at sensing what's going on around me, and there is definitely something wrong with this... Ted.
Xander Ted!
Buffy Of course, Ted. Who'd you think I was talking about?
Xander Hi, Ted! Ted, who's here.
Ted Hello, kids!
Buffy What are you doing here?
Ted I'm updating the software in the guidance office. Which reminds me, your upgrades.
Willow Oh, what a day! Thank you!
Ted Think nothing of it. Buffy, do you like miniature golf?
Xander Who doesn't!
Ted Well, your mother and I were thinking maybe this Saturday we could drag the three of you out to the course, spend some time swinging the iron with the stuffy old people.
Buffy Well, uh...
Ted I'm making a picnic basket.
Xander With mini pizzas?
Ted And cookies!
Buffy You know what, we, we would love to, honestly, but, um, unfortunately we have that thing on Saturday.
Willow Ohhh, that thing. That thing.
Xander Hey, we can do that thing anytime. I'm tired of doing that thing. We're on!
Ted Great!
Giles Hello, Jenny.
Jenny Rupert. Hi.
Giles Some of your, uh, textbooks were delivered to the library. Um, do you want me to, uh, hang on to them?
Jenny Yeah, that's fine. I'll send the kids by to pick 'em up.
Giles Right. Good.
Jenny Pretty flimsy excuse for coming by to see me.
Giles You should have heard the ones I threw out. I just, I wanted to, uh... see how you were doing.
Jenny I'm doing pretty good, actually. I've stayed out of mortal danger for three whole weeks. I could get used to it. I'm still having trouble sleeping, though.
Giles Oh, of course. Um... you, you, you need time.
Jenny Or possibly space. Rupert, I know you're concerned. But having you constantly poking around, making little puppy dog eyes at me, wondering if I'm okay... You make me feel bad that I don't feel better. I don't want that responsibility.
Giles Sorry. I certainly don't mean to make, um, 'dog eyes'... at you. I'm just...
Jenny Worried. I know.
Giles I shouldn't have bothered you.
Buffy So mom's like, 'Do you think Ted will like this?' and 'This is Ted's favorite show,' and 'Ted's teaching me computers,' and 'Ted said the funniest thing,' and I'm like, 'That's really great, Mom,' and then she said I was being sarcastic, which I was, but I'm sorry if I don't wanna talk about Ted all the time.
Angel So, you gonna talk about something else at some point?
Buffy I'm sorry. I just have so much to deal with, I don't need some new guy in my life.
Angel No, but maybe your mom does.
Buffy Well, sure, if you're gonna use wisdom.
Angel Loneliness is about the scariest thing there is.
Buffy Okay, so my mom needs a guy in her life. Does it have to be Ted?
Angel Do you have somebody else in mind? There's a guy out there that would satisfy you?
Buffy My dad? Yeah, okay, that's not gonna happen. Fine, fine, I'll give Ted a chance. I'll play mini-golf, and I'll smile and curtsy and be the dutiful daughter. Do I have to like him?
Angel Kiss me.
Buffy Finally, something I wanna do!
Xander Ah, the dreaded five-par cuckoo clock. Ha! So many have come, so few have conquered.
Joyce That picnic was delicious.
Joyce You know how rare it is to find a man that cooks?
Ted I know I've been looking a long time for one. So, Buffy, I bet the boys are lined up around the block tryin' to get a date with you.
Buffy Not really.
Willow Oh, they are, but she's only interested in... uh, her studies! 'Book-cracker Buffy', it's kind of her nickname.
Ted Well, glad to hear it. I bet that means your grades will be picking up soon.
Buffy My grades? How does he know about my grades?
Joyce I told him. He wants to know everything about you. He's concerned. That's a good thing. Ooo, nice shot, Ted!
Ted Keep your eye on the ball. Watch those elbows!
Ted Oh! Bad luck, little lady!
Joyce Oh, we won't count it.
Ted We won't?
Joyce Well, it's just miniature golf.
Ted It is, but the rules are the rules. And what we teach her is what she takes out into the world when we're not there, whether it's at school or an unchaperoned party. I don't mean to overstep my bounds, this is between you and your mother, I just think right is right.
Joyce He has a point.
Buffy Fine. I'll just go hit my ball from the rough.
Buffy Hey, how 'bout that! Got a hole in two!
Ted Beg to differ.
Buffy Okay, so fine my score or whatever.
Ted I think you're missing the point here, little lady. Right is right, wrong is wrong. Why don't people see that?
Buffy It's just a game?
Ted Right, it's just a game, do your own thing, well, I'm not wired that way. And I am here to tell you it is *not* a game! It *does* count, and I don't stand for that kind of malarkey in my house!
Buffy Then I guess it's a good thing I'm not *in* your house.
Ted Do you want me to slap that smart-ass mouth of yours?
Ted Who's up for dessert? I made chocolate-chip cookies!
Xander Yum-my!
Willow Cookies!
Ted Yeah! I-I made, uh, too many, so you guys are gonna have to take some home!
Joyce Mm! Buffy, you've got to try one of these! They're really good! Mm!
Willow Mm!
Xander Mm! These are tasty!
Joyce Good morning, sunshine!
Buffy Hey.
Joyce I've got juice, I've got sticky buns, oh, don't they smell good!
Joyce Ted made them.
Joyce What?
Buffy I'd just like to eat something around here that Ted didn't make.
Joyce Oh, what kind of an attitude is that?
Buffy Look, Mom, I know you think he's great and all, but I...
Joyce Y'know, he went out of his way to be nice to you, and you couldn't say two words to him on Saturday. I do not expect you to love him right away like I do, but I do expect you to treat him decently.
Buffy You love him?
Joyce I-I don't know. That just slipped out. But I guess, I mean, it's not exactly like men beat down the door when you're a single...
Buffy When you're a single parent.
Joyce Honey, look. I wouldn't have anything to do with anybody if they didn't care about you. But he does! I don't understand why you can't see that!
Buffy He threatened me.
Joyce What?
Buffy He threatened me. He said that he was gonna slap my face.
Joyce He said no such thing! Honey, Ted told me what happened. He caught you cheating, didn't he?
Buffy Yeah, I kicked my ball in, put me in jail, but he totally wigged!
Joyce And he didn't say anything about it in front of the others, did he?
Buffy Uh, no, but I don't think that's the...
Joyce Well, I thought that that was pretty decent of him! Ted said we are just gonna have to give you time to come around. Oh, speaking of which, he's making dinner for us tonight, so I'd like you at home, please, promptly at six.
Joyce Mm, this is sooo delicious!
Willow What do you mean, check him out?
Buffy I mean investigate him. Find out his secrets, hack into his life.
Xander Can you say 'overreaction'?
Buffy Can you say 'sucking chest wound'?
Willow Buffy, it just seems like you *want* him to be corrupt, or something.
Buffy The guy lost his senses over mini-golf.
Xander So he's a little uptight. Last I heard that's not a slaying offense. Don't gimme the look, I'm on your side. I'm just saying there are some things in life you have to accept.
Buffy And I'm saying Ted ain't one of 'em.
Xander Hey, Cordy! Nice outfit.
Cordelia Oh, very funny.
Xander Not really.
Cordelia What are you saying?
Xander Nice outfit?
Cordelia Well, why don't you just keep your mouth shut!
Xander Would you guys excuse me for a sec?
Willow What's up with them?
Cordelia What's wrong with you?
Xander I gave you a compliment.
Cordelia In front of your friends! They're gonna know!
Xander Know what?
Cordelia Please! It's too traumatic for me to even say it!
Xander That we kissed?
Cordelia Uhhh!
Xander Look, I'm not gonna tell, they're not gonna know. Not your friends, not my friends. You wanna go to the utility closet and make out?
Cordelia God! Is that all you ever think about? Okay.
Buffy Will, I'm not wrong here. Ted has a problem with me. He acts like I'm in the way or something. And Mom's been totally different since he's around.
Willow Different, like happy?
Buffy Like Stepford. Will you help me?
Willow You know I will. What do you want me to look for?
Buffy Let's start small. Can you find out where he works?
Neal Yeah, i-i-it's a terrific product. No PC should be without it.
Ted No, Mrs. Lawnsdale, it is not an inexpensive piece of software. As a matter of fact it's a very expensive one. Which removes the risk of crashing your whole system. Of course, if you prefer something cheap, I can always recommend... Trust me, you won't be sorry. Thank *you* very much.
Ted Goin' to lunch!
Neal You're new, aren't ya?
Buffy Oh...
Neal I'm Neal.
Buffy I'm B... Linda. Belinda. I'm just temping for the day. Wow, that guy's a salesman. I guess he's the one to beat around here.
Neal Nobody beats 'The Machine'. The guy's a genius. Knows everything about computers, never loses a client... If I sound bitter, I am.
Buffy Well, nobody likes an overachiever. Uh, he's probably got ex-wives and, and families to support.
Neal He's just got a girlfriend. I'm amazed he let her clutter his desk.
Neal Thank God he's taking off for the wedding.
Buffy The wedding?
Neal Yeah, he's got it set for two months from now. Believe me, I am counting the days. Uh-oh, the ueber-boss. Back to the salt mines.
Ted We thank you for what we are about to receive, and we ask that you bless this house, and help the people in it to be more productive, more considerate and more honest. Amen.
Joyce Amen.
Ted Well, another great day at work! How was school today, Buffy? Did you learn anything?
Buffy Quite a bit.
Ted Good for you! Well, Joycie, what do you think?
Joyce I think every home should have one of you. It's fantastic! Don't you think?
Buffy Looks good.
Ted Well, you know, little lady, it's not just for looks, it's for building strong bodies.
Joyce Honey?
Buffy Are you two engaged?
Joyce Goodness, no! Whatever gave you that idea?
Ted Now, Joycie, let me handle this. Buffy, your mother and I are taking it one step at a time. And if things go the way I hope, maybe someday soon I just might ask her to tie the knot. How would you feel about that? It's okay to have feelings, Buffy, and it's okay to express them.
Buffy I'd feel like killing myself.
Joyce Buffy!
Ted No, no, I, I told her to be honest. Sweetheart, you should try and get used to me, 'cause you know what? I'm not going anywhere.
Buffy May I be excused?
Joyce You can go to your room, young lady, that's where you can go.
Joyce Ted, I I am so embarrassed! I-I-I don't know what's wrong with her!
Ted Joycie, you don't get to be salesman of the year by giving up after a couple of rejections. She'll come 'round.
Buffy Vampires... Here, vampires...
Buffy What are you doing in here?
Ted Your mother told you to go to your room, Buffy. You and I both know she didn't mean climb out a window and go gallivanting about town.
Buffy First of all, this is *my* room, second... You've been going through my things?
Ted Yes, I have.
Buffy That's my personal property! How *dare* you?!
Ted I don't see how it's any different from you snooping around my office, do you? What exactly is a Vampire Slayer?
Buffy It's none of your business.
Ted Beg to differ, little lady. Everything you do is nothing *but* my business from now on.
Buffy I think you better get out of here. Now!
Ted Or what? You'll slay me? I'm real. I'm not some goblin you made up in your little diary. Psychiatrists have a word for something like this: delusional. So, from now on, you'll do what I say, when I say, or I show this to your mother, and you'll spend your best dating years behind the wall of a mental institution. Your mother and I are going to be happy. You're not going to stand in the way. Sleep tight!
Buffy That's mine, and you are *not* leaving this room with it!
Ted Take your hand off me.
Buffy No.
Buffy Ohhh! I was *so* hoping you'd do that.
Joyce Buffy! Stop that!
Joyce Stop it!
Joyce Ted...
Joyce Ted! Ted!
Joyce You killed him!
Det._Stein Ma'am, I'm Detective Stein. I'm sorry, but I need to ask you a few questions. Your relationship with the deceased?
Joyce We were, uh, seeing each other.
Det._Stein Can you tell me what happened?
Joyce He fell. Down the stairs, he fell.
Det._Stein I see. Uh, did he slip? Do you know what made him fall?
Buffy I hit him.
Buffy I hit him.
Buffy He was in my room. And we got into an argument.
Det._Stein About what?
Buffy He, um...
Det._Stein Was this the first time that you two had had an argument?
Buffy No. He threatened me. He, he said that he would slap me.
Det._Stein That was tonight.
Buffy No. But he had my diary, and I-I tried to take it back, a-and that's when he hit me.
Det._Stein Where?
Det._Stein Well, it doesn't look like he hit you very hard.
Buffy I don't bruise easily.
Det._Stein So you've been hit before?
Buffy Yes.
Det._Stein But Ted never hit you.
Buffy I told you...
Det._Stein Before tonight, Ted never hit you before tonight?
Buffy What do you want? I-I told you what happened, I didn't mean to!
Det._Stein I believe you. Things get outta hand. He's a big guy.
Joyce Are you charging her with something?
Det._Stein We're not bringing anything up against your daughter right now. She says Mr. Buchanan struck her, and if that's the case... Anyway, we've gotta examine it further. Right now I think you should just take her home, and the two of you should try and get some rest.
Xander Buffy!
Xander Are you okay?
Willow How come you're here?
Buffy I couldn't stay at home. Mom won't even look at me.
Willow What happened? Unless you don't want to talk about it.
Buffy We had a fight and I lost my temper. I really let him have it.
Willow The paper said he fell.
Buffy He fell. Hard.
Xander What was he?
Buffy What?
Xander What was he? A-a demon? A giant bug? Some kind of dark god with the secrets of nouvelle cuisine? I mean, we are talking creature-feature here, right?
Xander Oh man!
Willow But I'm sure it wasn't your fault. He started it.
Buffy Yeah. That defense only works in six-year-old court, Will.
Xander Court? Wa-wait. Are they charging you with something?
Buffy I-I don't know. Not yet.
Buffy He was a person, and I killed him.
Willow Don't say that!
Buffy Why not? Everyone else is. And it's the truth.
Xander It was an accident.
Buffy I'm the Slayer. I had no right to hit him like that.
Xander Look, Buffy, I don't know what happened exactly. But I do know you. And I know you would never hurt anyone intentionally. Well, you know, unless...
Buffy Unless they were dating my mother?
Buffy I gotta go.
Giles Buffy?
Giles Are you alright?
Giles Oh, uh, stupid question, I'm sorry. Look, i-i-if there's anything you need, of course, just, just ask.
Buffy What's going on?
Giles Oh, you needn't worry about that. They're just asking a few questions, your, your, your behavior and... um... uh...
Giles Of course, I told them you, uh... I...
Xander Man, this is killing me! That bastard was up to something, I know it. If I could just get my hands on him...
Xander Earlier this week.
Cordelia I thought you liked him.
Xander I sometimes like things that are not good for me. Besides, no way, no how does Buffy put the big hurt on an innocent man. Nice Uncle Ted was dirty.
Willow We've gotta prove that somehow. Xander, do you have a pen?
Xander If Buffy has to go to jail because of that creep I'm gonna lose it. He's gotta be in there, Will. Uh, history of domestic violence, a criminal record? Ooo! Cookies!
Cordelia I don't get it. Buffy's the Slayer. Shouldn't she have...
Xander What, a license to kill?
Cordelia Well, not for fun. But she's like this superman. Shouldn't there be different rules for her?
Willow Sure, in a fascist society.
Cordelia Right! Why can't we have one of those?
Willow Buffy's not going to jail. It's not fair.
Giles Whatever the authorities have planned for her, it can't be much worse than what she's doing to herself. She's taken a human life. The guilt, it-it's, it's pretty hard to bear, and it won't go away soon.
Cordelia I guess you should know, since you helped raise that demon that killed that guy that time?
Giles Yes. Do let's bring that up as often as possible.
Xander So, Giles, you takin' over tonight?
Giles Um, well, Buffy's not in any shape to patrol. The least I can do is pick up the slack. Someone has to.
Willow Giles, you shouldn't go out there without the Slayer.
Giles Until Buffy regains her equilibrium, there *is* no Slayer.
Cordelia If you need help...
Giles No, uh, Buffy needs your help more than I. You carry on investigating, see if you can find out as much about this Buchanan chap as possible.
Willow Be careful.
Giles I-I will.
Willow Ted's got no criminal record! Damn! This guy's like citizen of the year!
Xander Don't sweat it. It'll be fine.
Willow Don't sweat it?
Xander Yeah, cute buddy! We'll work it out! No worries!
Cordelia What happened to 'this is killing me'?
Xander Worrying isn't gonna solve any problems.
Buffy Can I help?
Joyce It's done. I've been meaning to clean out this junk for months. Do you, uh, have homework?
Buffy I didn't mean to hurt him.
Joyce I don't wanna talk about this.
Buffy Mom, please, you have to know...
Joyce I can't, not yet. Please, Buffy, just go to your room.
Willow Okay!
Xander What do we know?
Willow Well, apparently the secret ingredient is not love.
Xander What is it then?
Willow I'm not positive, but I think it's Dematorin. It's like a tranquilizer, keeps you all mellow and compliant. It also shares a few components with Ecstasy.
Xander This is evidence! This is real evidence that Ted was some kind of a crook! Buffy's cleared! Willow, you are the best human ever! I adore you!
Xander Well, that's the cookies talkin', but you rock!
Cordelia Well, your search finally hit pay dirt. You got some personal records, marriage certificates and an address.
Xander Well, let's check it out, get our Slayer back on her feet before somebody else gets hurt.
Giles Ah!
Jenny Yeah, I get that reaction from men all the time.
Giles Jenny! What are you doing here?
Jenny I saw your car back there. I wanted to apologize.
Giles Well, now is... not the best time to go ta...
Jenny No, no, please, please, lemme just, lemme get this out. I was sooo... harsh the other day. I am so sorry. I mean, I know how badly you must feel about putting me in danger before, and...
Giles Right in harm's view now.
Buffy Mom? The hell with this.
Buffy She nailed it shut. Well, it's official, this day can't get any worse.
Ted Beg to differ.
Buffy You died.
Ted That's right, little lady, you killed me. Do we have something to say about that? Are we sorry?
Buffy What are you?
Ted I'm a salesman! That's what you should've remembered. No matter how you put him down...
Ted ...a good salesman always bounces back!
Giles MY BAG!
Ted You see I had to shut down for a while to get you off my back. You should've seen the intern's face when I got up off the table, it was a hoot! Fun's over, though.
Jenny Say good night, big guy!
Giles AHHH!
Jenny OH, GOD!
Jenny Oh, no!
Vampire Nice shot, lady!
Ted That wasn't playing fair, missy!
Ted You're gonna find...
Ted Hell of a day! Makes you feel like you're eighteen again! ...that I don't like being disobeyed!
Ted Don't worry about me and your mother. We're gonna be very happy!
Willow Careful!
Xander Let's look around.
Cordelia I'll take the back.
Xander Check for cookies.
Xander For evidence!
Willow So far I've counted four marriage certificates.
Xander Any divorce papers?
Willow Not a one.
Xander So either our boy was a Mormon, or...
Willow Whoa, whoa, 1957! Ted musta married young! Like pre-school young.
Cordelia Nothing interesting back here. Doesn't look like anybody's worked here, let alone lived here.
Xander Something's missing here. This doesn't seem like Ted at all.
Cordelia Yeah, and this rug? It doesn't go with the rest of the decor.
Joyce Oh. Buffy, I'm sorry... I know you didn't mean to...
Ted Joyce?
Joyce Ted! Is it really you? But you were...
Ted I'm okay! I'm okay.
Joyce I-I don't understand this! You were dead!
Ted They said I must've been dead for six minutes. They said any longer and it would've caused brain damage.
Joyce Oh, why didn't they tell us?
Ted Nobody knew! They took me to the morgue. I was unconscious for almost a day. An intern found me. It's a miracle, Joyce. A miracle.
Joyce Oh, Ted!
Ted I know.
Joyce Oh, my God, Buffy! Oh, Ted, I swear... she never meant to hurt you. You have to believe me.
Ted You don't have to worry about Buffy. You don't have to worry about anything. Daddy's here.
Cordelia Feels like home. If it's the fifties and you're a psycho.
Xander Whatcha got in the closet, Ted?
Xander Let's go.
Cordelia But we need evidence!
Xander We got it.
Willow What's in there?
Xander His first four wives.
Ted You know what brought me back, Joyce? It was you. I couldn't go into that light. I had to come back for you. I'm gonna make you so happy!
Joyce You should sit down.
Ted I feel fine! Never better!
Joyce Ted, I think I should talk to Buffy first. Before she sees you, 'cause I'm sure she's...
Ted Do we have to worry about Buffy right now? How about worrying about Teddy? He's the one who died!
Joyce I-I-I'm, I'm sorry, I just... I... I-I don't know what to do!
Ted Don't I always tell you what to do? I'm going to make things right. Then you and I... Want a little gravy with that? ...can go away where no one will bother us again.
Joyce Ted, I, I think you might wanna rest for awhile.
Ted I think you might wanna stop telling me what to do! I don't take orders from women! I'm not wired that way!
Jenny Oh, God, I am so sorry!
Giles I think I'm alright.
Jenny No, you're just in shock.
Giles No, no, really, I, uh, I don't think it went in too deep. The... advantages of layers of tweed. Better than kevlar.
Jenny Oh, okay, alright, we have to get you to the hospital.
Giles Yes, yes.
Jenny C'mon.
Giles Ow! Ow! Ow! Oh!
Jenny Sorry! Sorry!
Giles Let's move slowly, shall we?
Jenny Sorry! Okay...
Jenny Okay...
Giles What? Wha-what is it?
Jenny Some night, huh? Yeah, you really know how to woo a girl back, don't cha?
Giles Ow! Ow!
Jenny Hospital.
Giles Yes.
Joyce I-I think I could use a drink. Um, to-to-to celebrate!
Ted We should probably be hitting the road.
Joyce Hitting the road?
Ted You're going to love the house. It's furnished just the way you like it. I spent a lot of... ...telling me what to do! ...time decorating.
Joyce Well, then I'd, I'd probably better go pack.
Ted I already have your clothes. They're your size, they're always your size. You left me once, but I keep bringing you back. Husband and wife is forever. Forever.
Ted Let's go.
Joyce Ted, let go, please. Get off me!
Ted Fine then. I'll have to carry you.
Ted Buffy, come out! I don't stand for this kind of malarkey in my house!
Buffy Uncle Teddy?
Buffy This house is mine!
Ted Buffy? How about a nice game of Parcheesi?
Joyce Do you wanna rent a movie tonight?
Buffy Sounds like fun.
Joyce Just nothing with horror in it. Or romance. Or men.
Buffy I guess we're 'Thelma and Louise'ing it again.
Joyce Mm-hm. Good call. I still think he's gonna jump out at me. Especially after what the police found in his house. It's just too horrible.
Buffy I wouldn't worry. He's not coming back.
Joyce I wish I could be so sure.
Buffy Trust me. He's on the scrap heap. Of life.
Xander So, I'm Ted, the sickly loser. I'm dying and my wife dumps me. I build a better Ted. He brings her back, holds her hostage in his bunker'o'love until she dies. And then he keeps bringing her back, over and over. Now, now that's creepy on a level I hardly knew existed.
Willow The sad part is the real Ted must've been a genius. There were design features in that robot that pre-date...
Buffy Willow, tell me you didn't keep any parts.
Willow Not any big ones.
Buffy Oh, Will, you're supposed to use your powers for good!
Willow I just wanna learn stuff.
Cordelia Like how to build your own serial killer?
Xander Uh, it's so hard to rent one nowadays.
Cordelia Can we just drop the subject?
Buffy Absolutely. I plan to forget the whole thing and pick up right where we left off.
Buffy Okay! That's it! I give up! Do I have to sound an air horn every time I walk into a room?
Buffy I mean, what is it with grownups these days?
