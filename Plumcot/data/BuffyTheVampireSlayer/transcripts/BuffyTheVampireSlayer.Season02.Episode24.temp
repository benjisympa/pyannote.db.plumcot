Buffy Come on, Mom, please?
Joyce I'm sorry, honey.
Buffy Don't you understand how important this is?
Joyce It's an outfit. An outfit that you may never buy.
Buffy But I looked good in it.
Joyce You looked like a streetwalker.
Buffy But a thin streetwalker. That's probably not gonna be the winning argument, is it?
Joyce You're just too young to wear that.
Buffy Yeah, and I'm gonna be too young to wear it until I'm too old to wear it.
Joyce That's the idea. The stores are closing, and I still need to order the flyers for the opening. Okay. I'll go to the printers and then get our food, you go to the tailor and pick up my outfit from Everyday Woman.
Buffy Everyday Woman?
Joyce Mm-hm. There's the receipt.
Buffy Why didn't you just go to Muu-Muus R Us?
Joyce Do now, make fun of your mother later.
Lyle Turn around, baby, I have somethin' to show ya.
Girl Wait a sec. This is my high score.
Lyle Well, ain't you just got the prettiest little neck I ever did see.
Buffy Boy, you guys really never come up with any new lines, do you?
Girl Do you mind? We were talking here.
Buffy But you promised you'd never cheat on me again, honey.
Girl Um, I better go.
Lyle But I ain't done yet.
Lyle Alright, sugar lips. Giddy-up!
Lyle Well, you're a rough one, ain't cha! I like that!
Lyle You must be that Slayer I've been hearin' so much about. Lyle Gorch. Pleased to meet cha!
Buffy Pleasure's mine!
Lyle This ain't over!
Buffy Oh, sure. They *say* they'll call.
Buffy Oh, bliss. Mall food.
Joyce Buffy?
Buffy Mom?
Joyce Where's my dress?
Buffy Your dr...? Oh. Oh, God.
Joyce Let me guess: you were distracted by a boy.
Buffy Technically.
Joyce Buffy...
Buffy Look, I-I can go get it right now.
Joyce They're closed. I'll just have to fit it in tomorrow.
Buffy Sorry.
Joyce A little responsibility is all I ask. Honestly, don't you ever think about anything besides boys and clothes?
Buffy Saving the world from vampires?
Joyce I swear, sometimes I don't know what goes on in your head.
Cordelia Xander?
Xander Shhh-sh-sh.
Cordelia It's just that I'm worried we're gonna miss class.
Xander You know what? This would work a lot better for me if you didn't talk.
Cordelia Well, it'd work a lot better for me with the lights off.
Xander Are you saying that you can't look at me when we do... whatever it is we do?
Cordelia No, it's not that I can't, it's just more... I don't want to.
Xander That's great! That's just dandy! We're repulsed by each other, we, we hide from our friends...
Cordelia Well, I should hope so! Please!
Xander All in all this is not what I'd call a big self-esteem booster.
Cordelia Tell me about it! Just look at you! And those clothes. Where did you get those shoes?!
Xander Okay, you know what? I don't need this.
Cordelia Ditto! Like a hole in the head!
Mr._Whitmore S-E-X. Sex. The sex drive in the human animal is intense. How many of us have lost countless productive hours plagued by unwanted sexual thoughts and feelings?
Xander Yes! Mm-hm.
Mr._Whitmore That was a rhetorical question, Mr. Harris, not a poll.
Xander Oh.
Mr._Whitmore Of course, for teenagers such as yourselves these feelings are even more overwhelming. With all sorts of hormones surging...
Mr._Whitmore ...through your bodies, compelling you to action, it's often difficult to remember that there *are* negative consequences to, uh, having sex. Would anyone care to offer one such consequence?
Cordelia Well, that depends. Are you talking about sex *in* the car or *out* of the car? Because I have a friend, not me, that was in a Miata at, parked at the top of the hill, and then she kicked the gearshift, and, and...
Mr._Whitmore Yeah, I, I was thinking of something a little more commonplace, Ms. Chase.
Xander You wanna talk negative consequence? What about the heartbreak of halitosis? I mean, a girl may seem spiffy, but if she ignores her flossing the bloom is definitely off the rose.
Cordelia Like that compares to kissing a guy who thinks the Hoover technique is a *big* turn-on.
Xander What about having to feign interest in her vapid little chit-chat just so you can get some touch?
Mr._Whitmore Now. Another consequence of sexual activity? Anyone?
Mr._Whitmore Uh, else?
Willow How about pregnancy? That would be a major one, right?
Mr._Whitmore Thank you, Ms. Rosenberg! Among teens unwanted pregnancy is the number one negative consequence of sexual activity. So, as discussed last week, I present you with... ...your offspring. You will split into parenting teams. You and your partner will share equally in the daily task of raising your egg. Now, please choose a partner and come pick up your children.
Cordelia You wanna have a baby?
Xander Hey. I know we just met, but isn't that Xander Jr. you're holding?
Willow Buffy! How come you weren't in class?
Buffy Vampire issues. Did Mr. Whitmore notice I was tardy?
Xander I think the word you're searching for is 'absent'.
Willow Tardy people show.
Buffy Right.
Willow And, yes, he did notice, so he wanted me to give you this.
Buffy As far as punishments go this is fairly abstract.
Willow No, it's your baby!
Buffy Okay, I get it even less.
Xander Well, you know, it's the whole 'sex leads to responsibility' thing, which I personally don't get. You gotta take care of the egg. It's a baby. You gotta keep it safe and teach it Christian values.
Willow My egg is Jewish.
Xander Then teach it that Dreidel song.
Buffy I can't do this! I can't take care of things! I killed my Giga Pet. Literally, I sat on it and it broke.
Willow You'll do fine!
Xander Yeah, the only thing that stresses me is when do we tell them that they're adopted?
Buffy I'll just lay that one off on my partner. Who'd I get?
Willow Well, there were an uneven number of students, and you didn't show, so...
Buffy I'm a single mother?
Xander No man of her own.
Buffy Do you know what this says about me? That I am doomed to lead my mother's life! How deeply scary is that?
Xander How 'bout this: it says nothing, it means nothing, this whole egg experiment thing is completely pointless!
Giles Success! At last. Your playmate is a fellow of repute, it seems.
Giles That's, um, Lyle Gorch, and that one's his brother, Tector. They're from Abilene. They, uh, they made their reputation by massacring an entire Mexican village in 1886.
Buffy Friendly little demons.
Giles That was before they became vampires.
Giles B-but, um, the good news is that they're... not amongst the great thinkers of our times. I doubt if they're up to much. They're probably just drawn here by the, uh, Hellmouth's energy.
Xander 'Nuff said! I propose Buffy slays 'em. All in favor?
Willow Aye!
Giles I-I don't think you should underestimate them. I mean, y-you may need to have some help if, if, if, if... Why do you all have eggs?
Willow Hey, maybe you can have Angel help you find the Gorches.
Giles Yes! Yes, yes, that's not a bad idea. Strength in numbers.
Xander Oh, right. I see a lotta hunting getting done in *that* scenario.
Buffy Please. Like Angel and I are just helpless slaves to passion. Grow up!
Buffy I really...
Angel I know.
Buffy You know, this isn't hunting in the classical sense. We should...
Angel You're right.
Angel Okay.
Buffy Okay. Okay.
Buffy You see anything?
Angel No.
Buffy Okay. Enough hunting.
Tector That the Slayer?
Lyle Yep.
Tector Ain't that Angelus with her?
Lyle Yep.
Tector Well, how come she ain't slayin'? And how come he's about to make me blush?
Lyle Well, I don't know, Tector. And how come you's always askin' me so many stupid questions?
Tector So, you wanna take him, or, uh, you want me to, Lyle?
Lyle I say we leave it. Wait till she's alone.
Tector Why? You scared?
Lyle Nope. I could whip 'em both right now if I wanted to.
Tector Then why don't ya?
Lyle 'Cause I got me a plan. I'm the one that does the thinkin', 'member?
Tector Yeah. You do the thinkin', Lyle. That is definitely your department. So why don't you tell me again why we can't kill 'em now?
Buffy Okay, little egg dude. Let's see. Feeding? Check. Burping? Eeeew... Check Diapers Sort of, in theory, I guess.
Buffy Okay.
Buffy Good night, Eggbert.
Tector I'm tired of rat. How come we can't stay in a nice place? A motel or somethin'? Maybe, uh... Maybe one with an ice machine.
Lyle 'Cause we got to keep a low profile till we get this Slayer business taken care of.
Tector Well, how come Angelus is gettin' all cuddly with her, Lyle? I mean, does the man have no code?
Lyle Tector... You gonna be pesterin' me with these questions all damn day?
Tector I just don't like it here. Ain't a decent whore in the whole city limits.
Lyle So, this is the thanks I get? Well. Don't I take care of ya? Didn't I near raise ya myself? Hmm? Burden that you were, maybe I shoulda left you on that doorstep when Momma blew town.
Tector Don't say that, Lyle.
Lyle Now I'm takin' care of this.
Tector You afraid of the girl?
Lyle I'm just playin' it safe. We're just gonna follow her around a little while, find our time. 'Cause this ain't over.
Tector I think you *are* afraid of the Slayer.
Lyle Alright. I'm gonna beat you like a redheaded stepchild. Throw your ass out in that sunlight. C'mon.
Tector You think you can?
Lyle Giddy-up, son.
Tector Oh, man!
Lyle Yippe-ki-yay, matey!
Buffy Oh... Oh, God...
Joyce At least eat something if you're gonna drink that.
Buffy Not that hungry.
Joyce How's the parenting going?
Buffy Fine.
Joyce Are you sure your egg is secure in that?
Buffy Did I ask for backseat mommying?
Joyce Are we a little touchy this morning?
Buffy No, I just feel all funky.
Joyce Hmm. You don't have a fever.
Buffy Oh, no, it's not that, I just... I didn't sleep well.
Joyce What's the matter? Your egg keep you up all night?
Buffy You're killing me. Parenting's a pain!
Joyce Wait till it starts dating.
Giles Oh! Why are you three hanging about? Don't you have classes to go to?
Willow Teen health got canceled.
Xander Mr. Whitmore's out. Couldn't find an egg sitter or something.
Giles Well, then, can you give me a hand?
Buffy_and_Willow No.
Xander Sure!
Giles How did the, um... hunt go last night, Buffy?
Buffy No go.
Giles Uh, 'no', 'no' you didn't go, or, or, or you were unsuccessful?
Buffy No Gorches.
Xander Apparently Buffy has decided the problem with the English language is all those pesky words. You... Angel... big... smoochies?
Buffy Shut... up.
Giles I-it's true, Buffy, you and Willow do seem a little sluggish. Are you quite sure everything's alright?
Willow Maybe something we ate.
Xander Or perhaps it's the burden of parenthood. Notice how seriously you two have taken this egg thing. While I, in turn, have, uh, well, chosen a more balanced approach.
Willow Xander, maybe you shouldn't...
Xander That's exactly what I'm talking about. You can't stress over every little thing! A child picks up on that. Which is a one-way ticket to neurotic city.
Willow It didn't break! How come it didn't break?
Xander Which is another secret to conscientious egg care: pot of scalding water and about eight minutes.
Willow You boiled your young?
Xander Yeah! I know it sounds cruel, but sometimes you gotta be cruel to be kind! I mean, you can bet that little Xander here is thick skinned now.
Giles Technically that would be cheating, yes?
Xander No! It's like a short cut. You know, when you run a race?
Buffy That would also be cheating.
Willow You should be ashamed.
Giles I suppose there is a sort of... Machiavellian ingenuity to your transgression.
Xander I resent that! Or possibly thank you.
Cordelia Figures you three would all be hanging in the dungeon while something major's going on at Sunnydale High.
Xander And what would that be, Cordelia? Barrette Appreciation Day?
Cordelia Mr. Whitmore didn't show today.
Buffy That news is of the past.
Cordelia He's missing? Presumed dead?
Giles Presumed by whom?
Cordelia Well, me!
Giles I think we should give him a few hours before we give up on him completely.
Cordelia Well, I think we should look around, don't you Xander?
Xander It can wait.
Cordelia Well, his body could fall out of a closet somewhere.
Cordelia So we should check some closets to see if he's in a closet?
Xander You're right. There could be a closet. Let's go.
Xander You guys look for more clues. We'll meet back here.
Buffy We'll get right on it.
Willow Are they getting weirder? Have you noticed the weirdness of them?
Buffy They're weird. Should I have guilt about not looking for Mr. Whitmore?
Giles I-I'd rather you conserve your strength for hunting the Gorches.
Buffy I'll be fine by tonight. Maybe I'll sweep the cemetery?
Giles Well, be careful, i-i-if you're still feeling a little sluggish.
Buffy No worries.
Willow And Angel's helping you, right?
Buffy He does what he can.
Buffy Ahh... As much as I hate to say this, we should really go kill bad guys.
Angel It's late. You should really get home. Hmm?
Buffy What about the Gorches?
Angel I'll hunt.
Buffy Really? You'd do that?
Angel Not like I have an early day tomorrow.
Buffy Mm, true. I still have to go home and fill out my egg diary.
Angel Your what?
Buffy Oh, I told you, that faux parenting gig we're doing at school. Like I'm really planning to have kids anytime soon. Uh, maybe *some*day, in the future, when I'm done having a life, but... right now kids would be just a little too much to deal with.
Angel I wouldn't know. I don't... Well, you know, I, I can't.
Buffy Oh. That's okay, um... I-I figured there were all sorts of things vampires couldn't do. You know, like work for the Telephone Company, or volunteer for the Red Cross, or... have little vampires.
Angel So you don't think about the future?
Buffy No.
Angel Never?
Buffy No.
Angel You really don't care what happens a year from now? Five years from now?
Buffy Angel, when I look into the future, a-a... all I see is you! All I want is you.
Angel I know the feeling.
Watchman Hello? Is anybody in here?
Buffy Come on! Pick up!
Willow Hello?
Buffy Willow! Are you okay?
Willow Why shouldn't I be?
Buffy Your egg! I-is it doing anything?
Willow Doing what?
Buffy Break it! Right now! I want you to smash it with something heavy!
Willow Buffy, what...
Buffy My egg! It went... It went postal on me! The thing hatched, and it, it sprung this creepy-crawly thing, and it attacked me!
Willow Are you okay?
Buffy Yeah, no, I'm fine, but, but your egg!
Willow I-is totally normal. Uh, I put it in the fridge.
Buffy Oh.
Willow Maybe it's a trap. Something the Gorch bothers planted for you?
Buffy Maybe. Yeah, uh... I'm sorry, I shouldn't have woken you. Uh, g-go back to sleep.
Willow You sure?
Buffy Yeah! Yeah, I'm, I'm better. I'm, I'm fine.
Willow Okay. I'll see ya tomorrow.
Joyce What's going on in here?
Joyce Buffy, who are you talking to at this ho...?
Joyce Why are you dressed? Where exactly do you think you're going at this hour of the night?
Buffy Nowhere.
Joyce Who was that on the phone?
Buffy Um, uh, Willow. She wasn't feeling well today, so I was just calling to make sure she was feeling better.
Joyce You're gonna have to do much better than that, young lady.
Buffy I had a bad dream?
Joyce Oh, no, you're about to have a bad dream! A dream that you are grounded for the rest of your natural life.
Joyce Which means: no after school socializing, no Bronze, no nothing. Not until I say so. Do you understand?
Buffy Yeah, but I think you're...
Joyce Now, school ends at 2:30. I want you to go to the library at 2:33 and study until I pick you up there at 5:30. Understood?
Buffy Yeah.
Joyce Good. Have a nice day.
Buffy Nice bear. Listen is your...
Cordelia Hey, I'll have you know that my father brought this bear back from Gstaad years ago. Then all of a sudden these trendoids everywhere started sporting them. So I'm totally not wearing it. Then I thought, hey, I'm the one who started this nationwide craze! What am I ashamed of?
Buffy Okay, Soliloquy Girl, I just wanted to ask about your egg.
Cordelia My egg?
Buffy Yeah. Your egg. The one Mr. Whitmore gave you.
Cordelia It's in my bear.
Buffy So, your egg isn't acting odd or anything?
Cordelia It isn't acting anything. It's an egg, Buffy, it doesn't emote. Shanisse! Is that your real hair?
Willow Hey!
Buffy Hi!
Xander Mm. Cardboardy!
Xander Sorry, Junior, but a man's gotta eat.
Willow So, was there any more hatchling activity last night?
Buffy No. Uh, you were probably right. It was just a trap from them set for me. And, mm, everyone else's egg seemed perfectly normal.
Xander Did you bring the thing that attacked you.
Buffy Yeah. Giles wants to see it. He's in full research mode.
Willow Okay. Well, bring it to the science lab, and I'll get Giles, and we'll analyze it.
Buffy Great. You know, I always say that a day without an autopsy... is like a day without sunshine.
Xander Hey.
Xander Can I just say Gyughhh!
Buffy I see your 'Gyughhh!' and raise you a Nyaghhh!
Cordelia What is it?
Xander We don't know what it is, Cordelia, that's why we're here. Capisce?
Cordelia 'Capisce'? What are you, world traveler now?
Buffy Hey, where's Giles? I know he won't wanna miss this.
Willow He said to get started. He'll be by as soon as possible.
Xander So, okay! Get started, Buffy! Dissect it or something.
Buffy Me? Why do *I* have to dissect it?
Xander Uh, because you're the Slayer?
Buffy And I slayed! My work here is done.
Xander Oh, no, I almost *ate* one of those things. I think I've fulfilled my gross-out quota for the decade.
Willow Guys...
Xander Do we even know what to look for? I mean, how are we supposed to figure out what this thing is?
Buffy Turn it over. Maybe we missed its ID bracelet.
Xander So, now I guess, uh, we know what happened to Mr. Whitmore.
Cordelia He saw this and ran away?
Buffy Try best case scenario.
Willow It's possible that Mr. Whitmore wasn't harmed. Maybe the offspring simply used him to return to the mother bezoar.
Xander Yeah. Maybe he... What?
Buffy What's a bez...
Xander Cordy! What...
Joyce Buffy?
Joyce Hello?
Giles Hello?
Joyce Oh! Mr. Giles, hi. Uh, I-I was looking for Buffy. She, she was supposed to wait for me here.
Giles Well, sh-she hasn't been in. I-I've been waiting to talk to her myself about, uh, uh... h-history texts.
Joyce That is just the last straw!
Giles I-I'm sure she didn't mean to, uh...
Joyce She never means to, but somehow she always manages to anyway. Do you have children, Mr. Giles?
Giles Um...
Joyce Sh-should I be whispering?
Giles No. A-a-and, uh, no, I, I haven't any children. A-although, uh, sometimes I feel as though I do, uh, working here...
Joyce They can be such a... Oh, uh, I-I-I don't want to say 'burden', but, uh... Uh, actually I kind of *do* want to say 'burden'!
Giles Feel free!
Joyce Oh, they're just so irresponsible.
Giles Sometimes.
Joyce 'Bristow's Demon Index', 'Hell's Offspring'?
Giles A hobby of mine, uh, but, uh, having nothing to do with Buffy in any way.
Giles Um, you say Buffy told you that she'd be here all afternoon?
Joyce Well, yes. I-i-is something wrong?
Giles Oh, I'm sure it's nothing. What was that?
Joyce Mm, probably the janitor.
Buffy Hey! Xander! Hey! You alright?
Xander Last time Cordy dragged me in here it was a lot nicer.
Buffy What?
Xander Uh... Huh? Nothing. Uh, crazy talk. Head trauma.
Buffy Tell me about it. I'm gonna have a big bump.
Xander Uh, I'm gonna have a peninsula! Here, what, what the hell's goin' on? Cordy and Willow?
Buffy Something to do with the hatchlings, I'm sure of it.
Xander What, are they possessed?
Buffy I don't know. But they sure wanted us out of the way.
Xander Well, why not kill us? Why, uh, why drag us in here?
Xander Oh. Bad now.
Xander Thank you.
Buffy Giles!
Xander Giles!
Xander He must be out somewhere.
Buffy Well, he picked a helluva time to get a life.
Xander What are we gonna do?
Buffy We can't fight these things until we know something about 'em.
Xander Alright, Willow said something. Uh, a name. What was it?
Buffy A bozo! Not a bozo.
Xander A bezoar.
Buffy That's it! Okay, so now... we look it up?
Xander In what?
Buffy A book?
Buffy Giles said he was gonna try to find something...
Buffy And I'd say he found something.
Xander I'd say something found him.
Buffy 'Pre-pre-historic parasite. The mother hibernates underground, laying eggs. The offspring then attach themselves to a host, taking control of their motor functions through neural clamping.'
Xander 'Neural clamping.' That sounds skippable.
Buffy So, our people are taking orders from the mama bezoar. Which begs the question...
Xander What does mama want?
Jonathon Somebody help me!
Jonathon Get this thing off me! Get this... Somebody help me! Help!
Buffy Are you okay?
Jonathon I'm fine. I slipped.
Buffy I think I hear mommy calling.
Xander Uh-huh.
Xander Do we really wanna go in there?
Buffy We really don't.
Xander Careful.
Xander What are they diggin' up?
Buffy Oh, boy.
Buffy We can't let them spread those eggs.
Xander I'll handle it. Um, can you, uh, hold down the fort?
Buffy I'm gonna need a weapon. I'm gonna need a *big* weapon.
Xander Yeah.
Lyle I told you this weren't over.
Tector She's so cute. And little. Think we can keep her?
Buffy Guys, this really isn't a great time.
Lyle Oh, it's gonna be.
Lyle ALRIGHT! THAT'S MY BROTHER!
Lyle What the hell is this?
Buffy Mom?
Willow Kill them.
Lyle What the hell is goin' on?!
Buffy Long story.
Xander Cordelia! I don't wanna hurt ya. Some of the time.
Xander That's my BUMP!
Tector Well, alright!
Tector Well, looky there!
Tector Well, hello!
Lyle TECTOR!
Lyle Tector?
Lyle This is all *your* fault!
Buffy How?
Lyle Alright. It's over.
Giles Yes, yes, uh, i-i-it was a-a, a gas leak, everyone. Uh, well, just, uh, get some air, and a... good night's rest, you know, uh, you'll be fine. These gas things... will happen. W-w-what was it really?
Xander Stick with the gas thing. I'll fill you in tomorrow.
Giles Right.
Xander How you guys doin'?
Willow Did I really hit you?
Xander You knocked me out.
Cordelia Did *I* hit you?
Xander Yes, everyone hit me.
Cordelia Good. Well, I don't mean 'good' because I hit you, but I didn't wanna be left out.
Buffy How is she?
Xander She's a bit confused, but it's goin' around.
Buffy Are you okay?
Joyce Buffy, I was worried you'd gotten caught in the building. There, there was a gas leak.
Buffy Uh, yeah, I-I just heard. I was in the gym.
Joyce I went looking for you in the library.
Buffy Oh, well, I was on my way there, when I...
Joyce I thought I made it pretty clear that you weren't to leave the library till I came.
Buffy The other side of that is there was a gas leak, and...
Joyce Well, I'm not really interested in the other side right now. Young lady, you have to learn some responsibility, okay? Once and for all.
Buffy I'm grounded?
Joyce You're already grounded.
Buffy Oh, yeah.
Joyce Until further notice you are confined to your room. You will not leave your room at any time except to go to school or the bathroom. Am I making myself clear?
Buffy You're clear. I won't leave my room.
Joyce You're damn right, you won't.
Angel Are you sure you're not gonna get in trouble?
Buffy Hey, I earned this. Besides, I'm not breaking any rules.
Joyce Buffy? Are you going to bed?
Buffy In a minute!
