Willow L'hippo a pique' ses pantalons.
Translation The hippo stole his pants.
Lyrics I'm a hurricane
Lyrics I cannot describe this feeling
Lyrics Now that I've found this love
Joyce Do you really think you're ready, Buffy?
Buffy What?
Lyrics I'll do anything for you
Lyrics Now that I've found this love
Lyrics I'm a fire, burning like a house aflame
Lyrics I'm a hurricane
Lyrics I cannot move or see you fly / Now that I've found...
Buffy ANGEL!
Lyrics ...this love
Drusilla Happy Birthday, Buffy.
Angel Hold on.
Angel Hey. Is everything okay?
Buffy That's what I was gonna ask you. You're okay, right?
Angel Sure. I-I'm fine. What's up?
Buffy Um... I-I had this... dream that Drusilla was alive.
Angel What happened?
Buffy She killed you. Right in front of me.
Angel It was just a dream. It wasn't real.
Buffy But it felt so real.
Angel It wasn't. I'm right here.
Buffy Angel, th-this happened before. The dreams that I had about the Master, they came true.
Angel Still, not every dream you have comes true. I mean, what else did you dream last night? Can you remember?
Buffy I dreamt... I dreamt that Giles and I opened an office supply warehouse in Vegas.
Angel See my point?
Buffy Yeah, I-I do, but... what if Drusilla is alive? We never saw her body.
Angel She's not. But even if she was, we'd deal.
Buffy W-w-what if she is...
Angel What if what?
Buffy I'm sorry. Were we talking?
Buffy I'm sorry. I, um... I-I have to go to school.
Angel I know.
Buffy Oh, God, you feel...
Angel You have to go to school.
Buffy Right. I know. This is me. I'm going.
Angel You still haven't told me what you wanted for your birthday.
Buffy Surprise me.
Angel Okay. I will.
Buffy This is nice. I like seeing you first thing in the morning.
Angel It's bedtime for me.
Buffy Well, then I like seeing you at bedtime. Um... Um, heh... Y-you know what I mean.
Angel I think so. What do you mean?
Buffy I like seeing you. The part at the end of the night where we say good-bye... It's getting harder.
Angel Yeah. It is.
Willow 'I like you at bedtime?'
Willow You actually said that?
Buffy I know, I know.
Willow Man, that's like... I-I dunno, that's moxie or something.
Buffy Totally unplanned. It just... came out.
Willow And he was into it? I mean, he wants to see you at bedtime, too?
Buffy Yeah, I, I, I think he does. Well, I, I mean he-he's cool about it.
Willow Well, of course he is. 'Cause he's cool. I mean, he would never... you know...
Buffy Push.
Willow Right. H-he's not the type.
Buffy Will, what am I gonna do?
Willow What do you wanna do?
Buffy I don't know. I... I mean, 'want' isn't always the right thing *to* do. To act on want can be wrong.
Willow True.
Buffy But... to *not* act on want... What if I never feel this way again?
Willow Carpe diem. You told me that once.
Buffy 'Fish of the day'?
Willow Not carp. Carpe. It means 'seize the day.'
Buffy Right. I... I think we're going to. Seize it. Once you get to a certain point, then seizing is sort of inevitable.
Willow Wow...
Buffy Yeah.
Willow Wow...
Buffy Oh...
Willow Wow!
Willow Wow.
Buffy Yeah.
Buffy Hey, speaking of 'wow' potential, there's Oz over there. What are we thinking, any sparkage?
Willow He's nice. Hey, I like his hands.
Buffy Mm. A fixation on insignificant detail is a definite crush sign.
Willow Oh, I don't know, though. I mean, he is a senior.
Buffy You think he's too old 'cause he's a senior? Please. My boyfriend had a bicentennial.
Willow That's true. Uh... I guess... I just...
Buffy You can't spend the rest of your life waiting for Xander to wake up and smell the hottie. Make a move. Do the talking thing.
Willow Well, what if the talking thing becomes the awkward-silence thing?
Buffy Well, you won't know until you try.
Willow Hey.
Oz Hey.
Willow Do you guys, uh, have a gig tonight?
Oz Oh, no. Practice. See, our band's kinda moving towards this new sound where... we suck, so... practice.
Willow I think you guys sound good.
Oz Thanks.
Willow I bet you have a lot of groupies.
Oz It happens. Now, I'm living groupie-free nowadays. I'm clean.
Willow Oh.
Oz I'm gonna ask you to go out with me tomorrow night. And I'm kinda nervous about it, actually. It's interesting.
Willow Oh. Well, if it helps at all, I'm gonna say yes.
Oz Yeah, it helps. It-it creates a comfort zone. Do you wanna go out with me tomorrow night?
Willow Oh! I can't!
Oz Well, see, I like that you're unpredictable.
Willow Oh, it's just it's Buffy's birthday, and we're throwing her a surprise party.
Oz It's okay.
Willow But you could come. If you want to.
Oz Well, I don't wanna crash.
Willow No, it's fine! Well, you could be m... my date.
Oz All right. I'm in.
Willow I said 'date'.
Xander So... Buffy's party. Manana.
Cordelia Well, just because she's Miss Save-The-World and everything, you have to make a big deal? I have to cook! And everything.
Xander You're cooking?
Cordelia Well, I'm chips and dips girl.
Xander Horrors! All that opening and stirring.
Cordelia And shopping and carrying.
Xander Well, then you should have a person who does such things for you.
Cordelia Well, that's what I've been saying to my father, but does he listen?
Xander Um, so, uh... You're going, and, and, and I'm going. Should... we maybe... go?
Cordelia Why?
Xander I dunno. This... thing with us, despite our better judgment, it keeps happening. Maybe we should just admit that we're dating.
Cordelia Groping in a broom closet isn't dating. You don't call it a date until the guy spends money.
Xander Fine. I'll spend, then we'll grope. Whatever. I just think it's some kind of whacked that we feel we have to hide it from all our friends.
Cordelia Well, of course *you* wanna tell everybody. You have nothing to be ashamed of. I, on the other hand, have *everything* to be ashamed of.
Xander You know what? 'Nuff said. Forget it. It must've been my multiple-personality guy talking. I call him Idiot Jed, glutton for punishment.
Giles Oh, good morning. Is everything in order for the party?
Xander Absolutely. You ready to get down, you funky party weasel?
Giles Here comes Buffy. Now remember: discretion is the better part of valor.
Xander You coulda just said, 'shh!' God, are all you Brits such drama queens? Buffy, I feel a pre-birthday spanking coming on.
Jenny I'd curb that impulse if I were you, Xander.
Xander Check, cancel spanking.
Giles You alright, Buffy? You seem a little fatigued.
Buffy Rough night. I had a dream that Drusilla was alive and she killed Angel. I-it just really freaked me out.
Giles You fear it was more of a, a... a portent?
Buffy See, I don't know. I don't wanna start a big freakout over nothing.
Giles Still, best to be, uh, on the alert. If Drusilla is alive, i-i-it could be a fairly... cataclysmic state of affairs.
Xander Again, so many words! Couldn't you just say, 'we'd be in trouble'?
Giles Go to class, Xander.
Xander Gone. Notice the economy of phrasing: 'gone.' Simple. Direct.
Buffy Maybe I should get 'gone', too.
Giles Uh, don't worry unduly, Buffy. I-I-I'm sure it's nothing.
Buffy I know. I should keep my Slayer cool, but... it's Angel, which automatically equals maxi-wig.
Giles Hmm.
Dalton I have your package.
Spike Just put it on the table... near the other gifts.
Spike Are you dead set on this, pet? Wouldn't you rather have your party in Vienna?
Drusilla But the invitations are sent.
Spike Yeah. It's just I've had it with this place. Nothing ever comes off like it's supposed to.
Drusilla My gatherings are always perfect. Remember Spain? Hey... The bulls?
Spike I remember, sweet. But Sunnydale's cursed for us. Angel and the Slayer see to that.
Drusilla Shhh... I've got good games for everyone. You'll see.
Drusilla These flowers... are wrong. They're all... wrong! I can't abide them!
Spike Let's try something different with the flowers then.
Drusilla Can I open one? Can I?
Drusilla Can I? Ooo...
Spike Just a peek, love.
Spike They're for the party.
Spike Do you like it, baby?
Drusilla It reeks of death.
Drusilla This will be the best party ever.
Spike Why is that?
Drusilla Because...
Drusilla It will be the last.
Joyce Mall trip for your birthday on Saturday. Don't forget.
Buffy Space on a mom-sponsored shopping opportunity? Not likely.
Joyce Hmm. So, does, um, 17 feel any different than 16?
Buffy It's funny you should ask that. You know, I woke up feeling more responsible, mature and levelheaded.
Joyce Really? Tch. It's uncanny.
Buffy I now possess the qualities one looks for in a... licensed driver.
Joyce Buffy...
Buffy You said we could talk about it again when I was 17.
Joyce Do you really think you're ready, Buffy?
Enyos Jenny Calendar.
Jenny You startled me.
Enyos You look well.
Jenny Yes, I'm fine. I know I haven't written as much lately. I've been busy.
Enyos I cannot imagine what is so important to make you ignore the responsibility to your people.
Jenny Well, I've been working and...
Enyos The elder woman has been reading signs. Something is different.
Jenny Nothing has changed. The curse still holds.
Enyos The elder woman is never wrong. She says his pain is lessening. She can feel it.
Jenny There is...
Enyos There is what?
Jenny A girl.
Enyos What? How could you let this happen?
Jenny I promise you. Angel still suffers. And he makes amends for his evil. He even saved my life.
Enyos So you just forget that he destroyed the most beloved daughter of your tribe?! That he *killed* every man, woman and child that touched her life?! Vengeance demands that his pain be eternal as ours is! If this, this girl gives him one *minute* of happiness, it is one minute too much!
Jenny I'm sorry. I thought...
Enyos You thought what?! You thought you are Jenny Calendar now?! You are still Janna, of the Kalderash people! A Gypsy.
Jenny I know... Uncle. I know.
Enyos Then prove it. Your time for watching is past. The girl and him, it ends now! Do what you must to take her from him!
Jenny I will see to it.
Buffy ...and then my mom broke the plate. It was just like my dream. Every gesture, every word. It was so creepy.
Giles Yes, well, I-I-I'd imagine it would be... fairly unnerving.
Xander Hey! It's the woman of the hour.
Willow It's Happy Birthday Buffy!
Willow Not Happy Birthday Buffy?
Giles I-it's just that, um, part of the nightmare that Buffy had the other night actually transpired.
Buffy Which means Drusilla might still be alive. Giles, in my dream, I couldn't stop her. She blindsided me. A-Angel was gone before I knew what happened.
Giles Even if she is alive, uh, we can still protect Angel. Dreams aren't prophecies, Buffy. Y-y-y-you dreamt that the Master had risen, but you stopped it from happening.
Xander You ground his bones to make your bread.
Buffy That's true. Except for the bread part. Okay, so, fine. We're one step ahead, but I wanna stay that way.
Giles Absolutely. Let me read up on Drusilla, uh, see if she has any particular patterns. Why don't you meet me here at 7:00? We'll map out a strategy.
Buffy What am I supposed to do until then?
Giles Go to classes, do your homework, have supper...
Buffy Right. Be *that* Buffy.
Xander Well, that's not a perky birthday puppy.
Willow So much for our surprise party. I bought little hats and everything.
Xander Mm-hm.
Willow Oh, well. I guess I'll tell Cordelia.
Giles No, you won't. We're having a party tonight.
Xander Looks like Mr. Caution Man, but the sound he makes is funny.
Giles Buffy's surprise party will go ahead as we planned. Except I won't be wearing the little hat.
Willow But Buffy and Angel...
Giles May well be in danger... as they have been before, and, I imagine, will be again. One thing I've learned in my tenure here on the Hellmouth is that there is no good time to relax. And Buffy's turning 17 just this once, and she deserves a party.
Xander You're a great man of our time.
Willow And anyway, Angel's coming. So she'll be able to protect him *and* have cake.
Giles Precisely.
Jenny Buffy.
Buffy Oh, my God, I didn't see you there.
Jenny Sorry. Um, Giles wanted me to tell you that there's been a change of plans. Uh, he wants to meet you someplace near his house 'cause he had to run home and get a book or something.
Buffy 'Cause heaven knows there aren't enough books in the library.
Jenny Uh, he's... very thorough.
Buffy Oh, which is not to bag. It's kind of manly in an obsessive-compulsive kind of way, don't you think?
Jenny Mm-hm. Um, you know, my car's here. Why don't I drive you?
Buffy Okay.
Buffy Are we goin' to the Bronze?
Jenny I'm not sure. Giles gave me an address. I'm just following his directions.
Buffy This looks funky. Stop for a sec.
Jenny No, Buffy, maybe you shouldn't.
Buffy Sorry. Sacred duty, yada yada yada.
Jenny What is this?
Buffy Every time I see you, you're stealing something. You really should speak with someone about this klepto issue.
Angel Where is she?
Willow Shhh! I think I hear her coming.
Cordelia Surprise!
Oz That pretty much sums it up.
Xander Tch.
Angel Buffy, are you okay?
Giles Yes. W-what happened?
Buffy Uh, there were these vamps outs... W-what's going on?
Giles Oh, um... A surprise party.
Cordelia Happy Birthday.
Buffy You guys did all this for me? That is so sweet.
Angel You sure you're okay?
Buffy Yes, I'm fine.
Willow Are you okay?
Oz Yeah. Hey, did everybody see that guy just turn to dust?
Willow Uh, well, uh... sort of.
Xander Yep. Vampires are real. A lot of them live in Sunnydale. Willow will fill you in.
Willow I know it's hard to accept at first.
Oz Actually, it explains a *lot*.
Jenny Hey, can somebody give me a hand here?
Jenny Those creeps left this behind.
Buffy What is it?
Giles I have no idea. Can, can it be opened?
Buffy Yeah. This looks like a release right here.
Xander Well, clearly the Hellmouth's answer to 'what do you get the Slayer who has everything?'
Giles Good heavens. Buffy, are you all right?
Buffy Man, that thing had major grip.
Willow W-what was that?
Oz It looked like an arm.
Angel It can't be. She wouldn't.
Xander What, uh, vamp's version of 'snakes in a can', or do you care to share?
Buffy Angel?
Angel It-it's a legend... way before my time... of a demon brought forth to rid the Earth of the plague of humanity... separate the righteous from the wicked... and to burn the righteous down. They call him the Judge.
Giles The Judge? This is he?
Angel Not all of him.
Buffy Um, still needing backstory here.
Giles Um... He, he, he couldn't be killed, yes? Um, a-an army was sent against him. Most of them died... but, uh, finally they were able to dismember him, but, uh... not kill him.
Angel The pieces were scattered... buried in every corner of the Earth.
Jenny So all these parts are being brought here.
Buffy By Drusilla. The vamps outside were Spike's men.
Angel She's just crazy enough to do it.
Willow Do what, reassemble the Judge?
Angel And bring forth Armageddon.
Cordelia Is anybody else gonna have cake?
Giles We need to get this out of town.
Jenny Angel.
Buffy What?
Jenny You have to do it. You're the only one that can protect this thing.
Buffy What about me?
Jenny What, you're just gonna skip town for a few months?
Buffy 'Months'?
Angel She's right. I gotta get this to the remotest region possible.
Buffy But that's not months.
Angel I gotta catch a cargo ship to Asia, maybe trek to Nepal...
Buffy You know, those newfangled flying machines really are much safer than they used to be.
Angel I can't fly. There's no sure way to guard against the daylight. I-I-I don't like this any more than you do, Buffy. But there's no other choice.
Buffy When?
Angel Tonight. As soon as possible.
Buffy But it's my birthday.
Jenny I'll drive you to the docks.
Drusilla You lost it? You... lost my present.
Dalton I know. I'm sorry.
Spike It was a bad turn, man. She can't have her fun without the box.
Dalton The Slayer. She came out of nowhere. I didn't even see her. She...
Drusilla Make a wish.
Dalton What?
Drusilla I'm going to blow out the candles.
Spike You might give him a chance to find your lost treasure. He is a wanker, but he's the only one we've got with half a brain. If he fails, you can eat his eyes out of the sockets for all I care.
Dalton I'll get it. Please. I swear.
Drusilla Okay.
Drusilla Hurry back then.
Angel I should go the rest of the way alone.
Buffy Okay.
Angel But I'll be back. I will.
Buffy When? Six months, a year? You don't know how long it's gonna take or if we'll even...
Angel Hey... If we'll even what?
Buffy Well, if you haven't noticed, someone pretty much always wants us dead.
Angel Don't say that. We'll be fine.
Buffy We don't know that.
Angel We can't know, Buffy. Nobody can. That's just the deal. I have something for you. For your birthday. I... I was gonna give it to you earlier, but...
Buffy It's beautiful.
Angel My people before I was changed they exchanged this as a sign of devotion. It's a claddagh ring. The hands represent friendship, the crown represents loyalty... and the heart... Well, you know... Wear it with the heart pointing towards you. It means you belong to somebody. Like this.
Angel Put it on.
Buffy I don't wanna do this.
Angel Me either.
Buffy So don't go.
Angel Buffy... I...
Buffy Angel! The box!
Angel Buffy!
Giles They should be back by now.
Willow Maybe Buffy needed a few minutes to pull herself together. Poor Buffy, on her birthday and everything.
Xander Hmm, it's sad, granted. But let's look at the upside for a moment. I mean, what kind of a future would she've really had with him? She's got 2 jobs Denny's waitress by day, Slayer by night and Angel's always in front of the TV with a big blood belly, and he's dreamin' of the glory days when Buffy still thought this whole creature of the night routine was a big turnon.
Willow You've thought way too much about this.
Xander No, no. That's just the beginning. Have I told you the part where I fly into town in my private jet and take Buffy out for prime rib?
Willow Xander...
Xander And she cries?
Giles What happened?
Buffy Dru's guys ambushed us. They got the box.
Giles Where's Jenny?
Buffy Uh, she took Angel to get clothing. I, I had some here.
Xander And we needed clothes because...
Buffy We got wet. Giles, what do we know?
Giles The more I study the Judge, the less I like him. His touch can literally burn the humanity out of you. A true creature of evil can survive the process. No human ever has.
Xander What's the problem? We send Cordy to fight this guy, and we go for pizza.
Buffy Can this guy be stopped? Without an army?
Giles Um, 'no weapon forged can kill him.' Not very encouraging. If we could only stop them from assembling him.
Buffy We need to find his weak spots, and we need to figure out where they'd be keeping him.
Giles This could take time.
Willow Better do a round robin. Xander, you go first.
Buffy Good call.
Giles Round robin?
Willow It's when everybody calls everybody else's mom and tells them they're staying at everyone's house.
Buffy Thus freeing us up for world saveage.
Willow And all-night keggers! What, only Xander gets to make dumb jokes?
Xander Mom, hi. Xander. Yeah, uh, Willow and I are gonna be studying all night long, so I'm not gonna be coming home.
Xander Tsk. I think I read this already.
Willow I can't get over how cool Oz was about all this.
Xander Gee, I'm over it.
Willow You're just jealous 'cause you didn't have a date for the party.
Xander No, I sure didn't.
Giles Angel? Any luck?
Giles Sh-sh-sh.
Giles Seems Buffy needed some rest.
Angel Yeah. She hasn't been sleeping well. Tossing and turning. She told me. Because of her dreams?
Drusilla Now, now.
Drusilla Hands off my presents.
Buffy No!
Buffy Angel!
Angel Buffy, it's okay. I'm here. I'm right here.
Drusilla More music!
Lyrics If you want to know how / To fly high then go now / To the place where all the concubines... / Meet and converse with them / Marvel at their pale skin / Wonder how they chew on their pointy... / Teeth and hair are beauty / They know it's their duty / To be Countess in their hearts and their...
Spike Look what I have for you, ducks.
Lyrics Minds that have to whisper / See in them a sister / Look into their eyes and you'll become / Transylvanian Concubine
Drusilla Ahh... The best is saved for last.
Lyrics You know what flows there like wine / Sorrow is their master / Cackling with laughter / Now he's having just one piece of...
Lyrics Cakey is their make up / Catholics try to shake up...
Drusilla Hmm.
Drusilla He's perfect, my darling.
Drusilla Just what I wanted.
Drusilla Goll...
Judge You!
Spike Ho, ho, ho. What's that, mate?
Judge You two stink of humanity. You share affection and jealousy.
Spike Yeah. What of it? Do I have to remind you that we're the ones who brought you here?
Drusilla Would you like a party favor?
Judge This one is full of feeling. He reads. Bring him to me.
Spike What's with the bringing? I thought you could just zap people.
Judge My full strength will return in time. Until then... I need contact.
Dalton No. No! NO!
Drusilla Do it again! Do it again!
Giles Buffy, what's happening?
Angel She had another dream.
Buffy I think I know where Spike and Drusilla are.
Giles That's very good, however, you, you do need a plan. I-I know you're concerned, Buffy, but you can't just go off half-cocked.
Buffy I have a plan. Angel and I go to the factory and do recon, figure out how far they've gotten assembling the Judge. You guys check any places the boxes could be coming into town. Shipping yards, airports, anything. We need to stop them from getting all the boxes in one place.
Giles Yes. Yes, well, um, actually, that's quite a good plan.
Buffy This thing is nasty, and it's real, Giles. We can't wait for it to come get us.
Giles Right.
Buffy I saw this. The party.
Spike What? What is it?
Angel We gotta get outta here.
Spike Well, well. Look what we have here. Crashers.
Buffy I'm sure our invitations just got lost in the mail.
Drusilla It's delicious. I only dreamed you'd come. Rrrr.
Angel Leave her alone.
Spike Yeah, that'll work. Now say 'pretty please'.
Judge The girl.
Drusilla Chilling, isn't it? She's so full of good intention.
Angel Take me!
Buffy No!
Angel Take me instead of her!
Spike Uh, you're not clear on the concept, pal. There is no instead. Just first and second.
Drusilla And if you go first, you don't get to watch the Slayer die.
Angel Don't touch him!
Buffy This way!
Drusilla Go!
Angel Come on. We need to get inside.
Angel You're shaking like a leaf.
Buffy Cold.
Angel Let me get you something.
Angel Put these on. Get under the covers, just to warm up.
Angel Sorry.
Angel What?
Buffy Oh, um... It's okay. I just have a cut or something.
Angel Can I... Lemme see.
Buffy Okay.
Angel It's already closed. You're fine.
Buffy You almost went away today.
Angel We both did.
Buffy Angel... I feel like I lost you... You're right, though. We can't be sure of anything.
Angel Shhh. I...
Buffy You what?
Angel I love you. I try not to, but I can't stop.
Buffy Me, me, too. I can't either.
Angel Buffy, maybe we shouldn't...
Buffy Don't. Just kiss me.
Angel Ahh!
Angel Buffy!
Angel Buffyyyyy!
