Xander So, what do you think?
Buffy It's nice.
Xander But do you think Cordelia will like it?
Buffy I don't know.
Buffy Does she know what one of these is?
Xander Okay, big yuks. When are you guys gonna stop making fun of me for dating Cordelia?
Buffy I'm sorry. But never. I just think you could find somebody more... better.
Xander Uh, parallel universe, maybe. Here the only other person I'm interested in is, um... unavailable. Besides, Cordy and I are really getting along. We're not fighting as much, and yesterday we just sat together, not even speakin'. You know, just, uh, enjoying comfortable silence. Man, that was dull.
Buffy I'm glad that you guys are getting along. Almost really. And don't stress over the gift.
Xander Well, this is new territory for me. I mean, my valentines are usually met with heartfelt restraining orders.
Buffy She'll love it.
Xander I wish dating was like slaying: you know, simple, direct, stake to the heart, no muss, no fuss.
Buffy Sorry to say, Xand, slaying is a tad more perilous than dating.
Xander Well, you're obviously not dating Cordelia.
Cordelia Wait up. Hey, wait up! Excuse me! Where's the fire sale?
Harmony Oh, sorry. Didn't see you.
Cordelia Well, why didn't you call me back last night? We need to talk about our outfits for the dance. I'm gonna wear red and black, so you need to switch.
Kate Red and black? Is that what Xander likes?
Cordelia Xander? What does he have to do with this?
Harmony Well, a girl wants to look good for her geek.
Cordelia Xander's just...
Harmony When are you two gonna start wearing cute little matching outfits? 'Cause I'm planning to vomit. Let's go.
Ms._Beakman Papers on my desk. Anybody tries to leave without giving me a paper is looking at a failing grade.
Xander Ha, ha, ha. This time I'm ready for you. No 'F' for Xander today. No, this baby's my ticket to a sweet D-minus.
Willow Hey, Amy.
Amy Hey. Are you guys going to the Valentine's Day dance at the Bronze? I think it's gonna be a lot of fun.
Buffy Go ahead. You know you wanna say it.
Willow My boyfriend's in the band!
Amy Cool.
Buffy I think you've now told everybody.
Willow Only in this hemisphere.
Amy What about you?
Buffy Oh, Valentine's Day is just a cheap gimmick to sell cards and chocolate.
Amy Bad breakup, huh?
Buffy Believe me when I say, 'uh-huh'.
Mrs._Beakman Thank you.
Mrs._Beakman Thank you.
Mrs._Beakman Thank you, Amy.
Willow I just hate to think of you solo on Valentine's Day.
Buffy I'll be fine. Mom and I are gonna have a pig-out and vid fest. It's a time-honored tradition among the loveless.
Xander Did you guys see that?
Buffy See what?
Xander In class. I think Amy just worked some magic on Ms. Beakman.
Buffy You mean like witchcraft?
Willow You know, her mom's a witch.
Buffy And an amateur psycho. Amy's the last person that should be messing with that stuff.
Xander Maybe I should go talk to her.
Giles Buffy! Buffy... Might I have a word?
Buffy Have a sentence, even.
Giles Oh. Good. Well, uh...
Jenny Back it up before you leave.
Jenny Rupert.
Giles Ms. Calendar.
Jenny I'm glad we ran into each other, actually. I was hoping that we could, uh... Do you have a minute?
Giles Um... Actually, not, not just now. Um, I, uh, have a matter to discuss with, with Buffy.
Buffy Right. Let's go.
Buffy Are you okay?
Giles Me? I-I-I'll be fine. Um, I was more concerned about you, actually. Uh, since Angel, um... uh... turned... I've, um, been reading up on, on his earlier activities. Y'know, uh, feeding patterns a-and the like.
Buffy And?
Giles Around Valentine's Day, he, he, he's rather prone to, uh... well, um, brutal displays of, uh... He would think of it as affection, I suppose.
Buffy Like what?
Giles No, no, uh, no need to go into details.
Buffy That bad?
Giles Suffice it to say I, I think it would be best if you stayed off the streets for a few nights. I-I-I'll, um... I'll patrol and keep an eye on things. Better safe than sorry.
Buffy It's a little late for both.
Spike Fancy it, pet?
Drusilla Ahhh. It's beautiful. Mm.
Spike Nothing but the best for my gir...
Angelus Happy Valentine's Day, Dru.
Drusilla Oh... Angel!
Drusilla It's still warm.
Angelus I knew you'd like it. I found it in a quaint little shopgirl.
Angelus Cute. Here.
Spike I'll get it.
Angelus Done. I know Dru gives you pity access, but you have to admit it's so much easier when I do things for her.
Spike You would do well to worry less about Dru and more about that Slayer you've been tramping around with.
Angelus Dear Buffy. I'm still trying to decide the best way to send my regards.
Spike Why don't you rip her lungs out? It might make an impression.
Angelus Lacks... poetry.
Spike It doesn't have to. What rhymes with lungs?
Drusilla Don't worry, Spike. Angel always knows... what speaks to a girl's heart.
Lyrics Feeling I've been lost for years
Lyrics You can never understand me / Unless you've seen those tears / But you never get to sleep

Willow Oz has his cool hair today.
Lyrics ...that you lay
Willow I think I'm a groupie!
Lyrics Out of time
Lyrics Pain, I can't sleep
Cordelia Oh, hey!
Lyrics Pain, I can't sleep
Harmony Let's get outta here.
Lyrics Running...
Buffy Here.
Buffy Mom?
Buffy Mom?
Joyce Buffy, it's me.
Buffy Yeah. You just startled me a little.
Joyce I was just checking the back door. Somebody, um, left these for you.
Lyrics Pain, I can't sleep / Pain, I can't sleep
Lyrics Pain, I can't sleep
Xander Hey.
Cordelia Your clothes... You look so good.
Xander Oh. I let Buffy dress me. Well, not physically.
Cordelia Perfect. You had to make this harder, didn't you?
Xander Okay, clearly the fact that I please you visually has got us off on the wrong foot here.
Cordelia Xander...
Xander Let me finish. I've been thinking a lot about us lately... the why and the wherefore. You know, once, twice, a kissy here, a kissy there. And you can chalk it all up to hormones. A-and maybe that's all we have here. Tawdry teen lust. But maybe not. Maybe something in you sees something special inside me. And vice versa. I mean, I think I do. See something. So...
Cordelia Xander... Thank you. It's beautiful. I wanna break up.
Xander Okay, not quite the reaction I was looking for.
Cordelia I know. I'm sorry. It's just... Who are we kidding? Even if parts of us do see specialness, we don't fit.
Xander Yeah! Okay... Do you know what's a good day to break up with somebody? Any day besides Valentine's Day! I mean, what, were you running low on dramatic irony?
Cordelia I know. I didn't mean to do it this way. I...
Xander Well, you did.
Jack Dude. Way to get dumped.
Xander Ooo, Buffy, my bud, you will not believe...
Buffy Can't talk right now. Angel.
Xander Do you need help?
Buffy It's alright.
Harmony Gee, Xander, maybe you should learn a second language so that even more girls can reject you.
Amy What are you doing?
Xander Amy. Good to see you. You're a witch.
Amy No, I'm not. That, that was my mom, remember?
Xander Yeah, I'm thinking it runs in the family. I saw you working that mojo on Ms. Beakman. Maybe I should go tell somebody about...
Amy That's not even... That is so mean!
Xander Blackmail is such an ugly word.
Amy I didn't say blackmail.
Xander Yeah, but I'm about to blackmail you, so I thought I'd bring it up.
Amy What do you want?
Xander What do I want? I want some respect around here. I want, for *once*, to come out ahead. I want the Hellmouth to be working for me. You and me, Amy... we're gonna cast a little spell.
Amy A love spell?
Xander Yeah. You know, just the basic can't eat, can't sleep, can't breathe anything but little old moi.
Amy Well, that kind of thing is the hardest! I mean, to make someone love you for all eternity?
Xander Whoa! Whoa, back up. Who said anything about eternity? A man can only talk self-tanning lotion for so long before his head explodes.
Amy Well, then I don't get it. If you don't wanna be with her forever, then what's the point?
Xander The point is I want her to want me. Desperately. So I can break up with *her* and subject her to the same hell she's been puttin' *me* through.
Amy Oh, I don't know, Xander. Intent has to be pure with love spells.
Xander Right. I intend revenge. Pure as the driven snow. Now, are you gonna play, or do we need to have another chat about invisible homework?
Amy I'll need something of hers. A personal object.
Xander Alright.
Buffy 'Soon' what, Giles? You never held out on me until the big, bad thing in the dark became my ex-honey.
Giles Where did this come from?
Buffy He said it with flowers. Look, this isn't the time to start becoming Mr. Protective Guy. I can't just hang around, and I can't prepare when I don't know what's coming.
Giles N-no, of-of course, you're right. Uh, s-s-sit, sit down.
Xander Oh, come on, don't flatter yourself. I'm not gonna make a big scene. I just want the necklace back.
Cordelia What? I thought it was a gift.
Xander No. Last night it was a gift. Today it's scrap metal. Figure I can melt it down and sell it for fillings or something.
Cordelia You're pathetic!
Xander Come on, I'm not gonna add to the Cordelia Chase castoff collection.
Cordelia It's in my locker.
Xander I can wait.
Cordelia Here. It's a good thing we broke up. Now I don't have to pretend I like it.
Amy Diana... goddess of love and the hunt... I pray to thee. Let my cries bind the heart of Xander's beloved. May she neither rest nor sleep until she submits to his will only.
Amy Diana, bring about this love and bless it.
Amy Blow out the candle now!
Cordelia What?
Xander Morning, ladies. Some kind of weather we've been having, huh?
Cordelia What do you want? You can't be sniffing around for more jewelry to melt, because all you ever gave me was that Smallmart-looking thing.
Xander Is this love? 'Cause maybe on you it doesn't look that different.
Cordelia What are you doing? Are you going, like, stalker-boy on me now?
Xander Sorry. My mistake.
Cordelia Yeah, I should say so.
Cordelia What is his deal?
Giles Look, here's another. Here. Um, 'Valentine's Day.' Yes, uh... 'Angel nails a puppy to the...'
Buffy Skip it.
Giles Uh, but it...
Buffy I don't wanna know. I don't have a puppy. Skip it.
Giles Right you are. I'll get another batch.
Xander I have a plan: we use me as bait.
Buffy You mean make Angel come after you?
Xander No, I mean chop me into little pieces and stick me on hooks for fish to nibble at 'cause it would be more fun than *my* life.
Buffy Yeah. I heard about you and Cordy. That's her loss.
Xander Yeah. Not really the popular theory.
Buffy You know what I'd like? Why don't you and I do something together tonight? Just the two of us.
Xander Really?
Buffy Yeah. We can comfort each other.
Xander Well, would lap dancing enter into that scenario at all? 'Cause I find that very comforting.
Buffy Play your cards right...
Xander Okay, uh... You do know that I'm Xander, right?
Buffy I don't know, I just... heard that you and Cordy broke up, and I guess I was just surprised how glad I was. It's funny... how you can see someone every day but not really see them. You know?
Xander Yeah, it's funny. And it's just gettin' funnier.
Amy Xander, can I talk to you for a minute?
Xander Yeah, okay.
Amy Xander.
Xander Yeah.
Amy I don't think the spell worked out right.
Xander Oh, yeah, it bombed. No biggie.
Amy Well, we can always try again.
Amy I am still pretty new at this.
Xander Oh, no, no, no. It's okay. You know what? It was wrong to meddle with the forces of darkness. I see that now. I think we've all grown. I gotta go.
Amy Oh, we don't have to cast any spells.
Amy We can just... hang out.
Xander Sure. What?
Amy Well, I liked spending time with you. You're so sweet. You know, it's funny how you can... you can see a person every day and...
Xander Not really see them.
Amy Exactly. So, anyway, I thought it might...
Cordette Hi, Xander.
Xander What?
Cordette You're in Mr. Baird's history class, right?
Xander Yeah.
Cordette I thought maybe we could study together tonight.
Amy Do you mind? We were talking.
Xander Uh, I really gotta go. Right now.
Willow Sorry. I wanted to surprise you.
Xander Good job! High marks.
Willow Don't be so jumpy. I've been in your bed before.
Xander Yeah, but Will, we were both in footy pajamas.
Willow Xand, I've been thinking.
Xander Will, I, I think I know what you've been thinking. But this is all my fault. I cast a spell, and it sort of backfired.
Willow How long have we been friends?
Xander A long, long time. Too long to do anything that might change that now.
Willow Well, friendships change all the time. People grow apart. They grow closer.
Xander Uh, this is good! How close we are now. I feel very comfortable with this amount of closeness. In fact, I can even back up a few paces and still be happy. See?
Willow I want you, Xander... to be my first!
Xander Baseman. Please tell me we're talking baseball.
Willow Shhh.
Willow We both know it's right.
Xander It's not that I don't find you sexy.
Willow Is it Oz? Don't worry about him. He's sweet, but... he's not you.
Xander Yes, he is. And you should go to him. 'Cause he's me.
Xander I-I don't wanna use force.
Willow Mm. Force is okay!
Xander Th-that's it! This has gotta stop. It's time for me to act like a man. And hide.
Cordelia Ha. Very funny. What did I do now, wear red and purple together?
Harmony You know what you did. Xander is wounded because of you.
Cordelia Are you tripping? I thought you wanted me to break up with him!
Harmony Only a sick pup would let Xander get away, no matter what her friends said.
Cordelia What does it take to make you people happy?
Lyrics Hey, yeah / Got the love, got the love
Lyrics Mm, yeah / Got the love, got the love
Lyrics Got the love, got the love / Sugar baby / Got the love, got the love
Lyrics Oh, now, babe, you've been gone such a long time
Lyrics Been thinkin' 'bout what it is we got
Lyrics Not all the time in the world / Whoo! / But got a lot
Lyrics Now, there's much more than a ghost of a chance
Lyrics We can make it right this time
Lyrics 'Cause you've got to stay mine
Lyrics Yeah, I got the love / Got the love, got the love
Lyrics We got to make it work / Got the love, got the love
Giles Xander. What is it?
Xander It, it's me... throwing myself at your mercy.
Giles What? Why?
Xander I made a mess, Giles. See, I found out that Amy's into witchcraft, and I was hurt, I guess, so I... made her put the love whammy on Cordy, but it backfired, and now every woman in Sunnydale wants to make me her cuddle monkey, which may sound swell on paper, but...
Jenny Rupert, we need to talk. Hey, Xander. Nice shirt. Look, Rupert, I know that you're angry at me, and I don't blame you, but I am not just gonna go away. I mean, I care far too much about you to... Have you been working out?
Jenny Oh!
Giles I cannot believe that you are fool enough to do something like this!
Xander Oh, no, I'm twice the fool it takes to do something like this.
Giles Has, uh... Has Amy tried to reverse the spell?
Xander I get around Amy and all she wants to do is talk honeymoon plans.
Jenny Rupert, maybe I need to talk to Xander alone.
Giles Do you have any idea how serious this is? People under a-a love spell, Xander, are-are deadly. They lose all capacity for reason.
Giles And if what you say is true and the entire female population is affected, I... Don't leave the library. I'll find Amy and see if we can put a stop to this thing.
Jenny No!
Buffy Alone at last.
Xander Buff, give me a heart attack!
Buffy Oh, I'm gonna give you more than that.
Xander Buff, for the love of God, don't open that raincoat.
Buffy Come on! It's a party! Aren't you gonna open your present?
Xander It's not that I don't want to. Sometimes the remote impossible possibility that you might like me was all that sustained me. But not now. Not like this. This isn't real to you. You're only here because of a spell. I mean, if I thought you had one clue what it would mean to me... But you don't. So I can't.
Buffy So you're saying this is all a game?
Xander A game? I... No!
Buffy You make me feel this way, and then you reject me? What am I, a toy?
Xander Buffy, please calm down.
Buffy I'll calm down when you explain yourself!
Amy Get away from him. He's mine.
Buffy Oh, I don't think so. Xander, tell her.
Xander What? I, uh...
Amy He doesn't have to say. I know what his heart wants.
Buffy Funny, I know what your face wants.
Buffy What is this, you're two-timing me?
Amy Goddess Hecate, work thy will.
Xander Uh-oh.
Amy Before thee let the unclean thing crawl!
Xander Buffy! Oh, my God!
Giles What, what just happened?
Xander Buffy.
Giles Where is she?
Giles Oh, my God!
Amy Why is she here?
Xander Can you focus for a minute? You just turned Buffy into a rat.
Amy Buffy can take care of herself. Why don't we go someplace private?
Xander Can you... I'm not going anywhere until you change her back.
Jenny You heard him. So why don't you undo your little magic trick and get lost?
Amy Who made you Queen of the World? Well, you're old enough to be.
Jenny Well, what can I say? I guess Xander's just too much man for the pimple squad.
Amy Goddess Hecate, to you I pray, with this...
Xander Would you quit with the Hecate?!
Cordelia Okay, what now? You don't like my locker combination?
Harmony It's just not right. You never loved him. You just used him. You make me sick.
Cordelia Okay, Harmony, if you need to borrow my Midol, just ask.
Giles You two, sit. And be quiet. We have to catch the Buffy rat.
Xander Ooo, there!
Xander Good Buffy. Just...
Oz That kinda hurt.
Xander Kinda?! What was that for?
Oz I was on the phone all night, listening to Willow cry about *you*. Now, I don't know exactly what happened, but I was left with a very strong urge to... hit you.
Xander I didn't touch her. I swear.
Giles Xander! Where's Buffy?
Xander Amy turned her into a rat.
Oz Oh.
Giles I don't see her. If anything happens to her, I'll... Oh, just go home. Lock yourself away. You're only going to cause more problems here. Now, Amy, Jenny and I will, uh... try and break the spell. Oz, if, if you could aid us in, in finding, um... Buffy.
Oz Sure. Absolutely.
Giles Just go. Get out of my sight.
Oz Buffy...
Cordelia What are you doing?! You guys are crazy!
Harmony You thought you could do better, is that it?
Cordelia No, I...
Cordette We'll knock that snotty attitude right out of you!
Cordelia Ow! Stop!
Giles You must have botched the ritual so that Cordelia's necklace actually protected her from the spell. Th-th-that one should be easily reversible. W-w-where did you learn animal transformation?
Amy Why did you send Xander away? He needs me.
Jenny That's a laugh.
Amy He loves me. We look into each other's souls.
Jenny No one can love two people at once. What *we* have is real.
Giles Instead of making me ill, why doesn't one of you try to help me?
Amy You have no idea what I'm going through.
Giles I know it's not love. It's obsession. Selfish, banal obsession. Now, Xander has put himself in very great danger. If you cared at all about him, you'd help me save him, rather than wittering on about your feelings.
Giles Now, let's get on with some work. Now, Jenny... Great!
Xander I think we... lost 'em.
Willow I should've known I'd find you with her.
Xander Will... Come on, you don't wanna hurt me.
Willow Oh, no? You don't know how hard this is for me. I love you so much! I'd rather see you dead than with that bitch.
Harmony Get away from him! He's mine!
Xander Okay, now I really think we've lost them.
Cordelia Damn it, Xander, what's going on? Who died and made *you* Elvis?
Xander Buffy's house. Let's get inside. I'll explain later.
Cordelia Come on!
Joyce Xander, Cordelia, what...
Cordelia Yeah, hi.
Joyce What happened? Why are you all scratched up? Where's Buffy?
Xander She's, um... around.
Joyce Well, sit down and tell me about it. Why don't you run upstairs and grab some bandages out of the bathroom?
Joyce Let me, uh, get you something to drink. You in the mood for cold or hot?
Xander I, uh...
Joyce I think it's more of a *hot* night, don't you?
Xander Whatever.
Joyce Ooo, you are so tense. Mm.
Cordelia What are you doing? Make me yak!
Joyce Cordelia, go back upstairs. This is between us.
Cordelia Gross! I think not.
Joyce What are you doing? Hey! Get your hands off me!
Cordelia And keep your mom-aged mitts off my boyfriend. Former! Why has everyone gone insane?
Xander Insane? Is it so impossible for you to believe that other women find me attractive?
Cordelia The only way you could get girls to want you would be witchcraft.
Xander That is such a... Well, yeah, okay, good point.
Cordelia Oh, my God!
Joyce Xander, honey, let Joycie in. Hon, let Joycie in!
Xander Upstairs! Buffy's room!
Joyce Sweetheart...
Xander Good. The mob still hasn't found us. We should be safer up here.
Angelus Works in theory.
Cordelia Xander!
Angelus Where's Buffy?!
Xander Cordy, get outta here!
Angelus Perfect. I wanted to do something special for Buffy, actually to Buffy, but this is *so* much better!
Angelus If it's any consolation, I feel very close to you right now.
Xander Buffy, how...
Drusilla Don't fret, kitten. Mummy's here.
Angelus I don't know what you're up to, Dru, but it *doesn't* amuse!
Drusilla If you harm one hair on this boy's head...
Angelus You've gotta be kidding. Him?
Drusilla Just because I finally found a *real* man...
Angelus I guess I really *did* drive you crazy.
Drusilla Your face is a poem. I can read it.
Xander Really? It doesn't say 'spare me' by any chance?
Drusilla Shhh. How do you feel about eternal life?
Xander We couldn't just start with a coffee? A movie, maybe?
Girl There he is! Get them!
Jenny He's mine! Get off!
Willow All you had to do was love me!
Cordelia No!
Cordelia Get out of the way! Move it! Get off him!
Cordelia Back off!
Girl I love you!
Angelus Ahh! Sorry, Dru. I guess you're not invited.
Joyce It's never gonna work for us, Xander. We have to end it.
Oz Here, Buffy.
Giles Right. Go on. You first.
Xander Gimme a nail!
Cordelia If we die in here I'm gonna kick your ass! I mean it!
Xander None of this would've happened if you hadn't broken up with me. But no, you're so desperate to be popular!
Cordelia Me? I'm not the one who embraced the black arts just to get the girls to like me. Well, congratulations, it worked!
Xander Would've worked fine, except your hide's so thick, not even magic can penetrate it!
Cordelia You mean the spell was for me?
Girl_reaching_in Oh, please let me touch you!
Amy Goddess of creatures great and small, I conjure thee to withdraw.
Amy Hecate, I hereby license thee to depart.
Oz Buffy?
Cordelia Oh, my God!
Xander Stay behind me.
Giles Um... Diana, goddess of love, be gone.
Giles Hear no more thy siren's song.
Cordelia Get off!
Cordelia Get off me!
Girl What's going on? Where am I? What's going on?
Buffy Hi, Oz!
Oz Hi.
Buffy I seem to be having a slight case of nudity here.
Oz But you're not a rat. So call it an upside.
Buffy You think maybe you could get me some clothing?
Oz Yes, I can. Just, uh... don't go anywhere.
Buffy Really not an issue.
Joyce What... What did we...
Cordelia Boy, that was the best scavenger hunt ever.
Buffy Scavenger hunt.
Xander Your mom seemed to buy it.
Buffy So she says. I think she's just so wigged at hitting on one of my friends that she's repressing. She's getting pretty good at that. I should probably start worrying.
Xander Well, I'm back to being incredibly unpopular.
Buffy It's better than everyone trying to ax-murder you, right?
Xander Mostly, but, uh... Willow won't even talk to me.
Buffy Any particular reason she should?
Xander How much groveling are we talking here?
Buffy Oh, a month, at least. Xander, come on, I mean... this is worse for her than anyone. She loved you before you invoked the great Roofie spirit. The rest of us...
Xander You remember, huh?
Buffy Oh, yeah. I remember coming on to you, I remember begging you to undress me... And then a sudden need for cheese. I also remember that you didn't.
Xander Need cheese?
Buffy Undress me. It meant a lot to me what you said.
Xander C'mon, Buffy, I couldn't take advantage of you like that. Okay, for a minute, it was touch and go there...
Buffy You came through. There might just be hope for you yet.
Xander Well, tell that to Cordelia.
Buffy You're on your own there.
Harmony Cody Weinberg called me at home last night.
Cordelia Cody Weinberg? The one with the 350sl?
Harmony The very one. Said he's thinking of asking me to the pledge dance on Thursday.
Cordelia That's so huge!
Harmony Yeah, there's just two other girls he's gonna ask first, and if they refuse, then I'll...
Harmony Watch it!
Xander Sorry.
Harmony God! Y'know, I'm glad your mom stopped working at the drive-through long enough to dress you. Oh, that reminds me. Did you see Jennifer's backpack? It is *so* a crying...
Cordelia Harmony, shut up. Do you know what you are, Harmony? You're a sheep.
Harmony I'm not a sheep.
Cordelia You're a sheep. All you ever do is what everyone else does just so you can say you did it first. And here I am, scrambling for your approval, when I'm *way* cooler than you are 'cause I'm *not* a sheep. I do what I wanna do, and I wear what I wanna wear. And you know what? I'll date whoever the hell I wanna date. No matter how lame he is.
Cordelia Oh, God! Oh, God!
Xander You're gonna be okay. Just keep walkin'.
Cordelia Oh, God, what have I done? They're never gonna speak to me again!
Xander Oh, sure, they are. If it helps, whenever we're around them you and I can fight a lot.
Cordelia You promise?
Xander You can pretty much count on it.
