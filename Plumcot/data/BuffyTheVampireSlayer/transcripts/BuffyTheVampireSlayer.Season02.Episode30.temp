Buffy Non-vampire. Plus two.
Willow Hi.
Xander Man, Buffy! My whole life just flashed before my eyes! I gotta get me a life!
Buffy What are you doing here?
Willow What are *you* doing here?
Buffy Well, I'm patrolling!
Willow Buffy, you're sick.
Buffy No, I feel fine. I mean, I'm... the world's spinning a little bit, but I like it, it's kinda like a ride.
Cordelia Half the school's out with this flu. It's a serious deal, Buffy. We're all concerned about how gross you look.
Buffy I'm touched. Really. But I have work to do.
Willow Buffy, come on, one night of rest is not gonna kill you.
Buffy No, but it might kill somebody else.
Xander You mean Angel might. Buffy, this is not the time to challenge Angel for the ultimate fighting championship. He's at full strength, you're only half a Slayer.
Buffy Yeah, but I'm still the Slayer. And as long as I am, Angel's not gonna kill anybody else.
Angelus Aw, c'mon. Just one more.
Angelus Not feeling well, lover?
Buffy That helps.
Angelus You know, you being off your game's kinda takin' the fun out of all this.
Angelus Nope, still fun!
Angelus Uh-oh. This does *not* look good for our heroine.
Xander Take a walk, overbite.
Angelus We'll have to do this again sometime.
Xander Buffy, are you okay?
Buffy I told you guys to leave, I... I... Oh...
Xander Buffy!
Willow Buffy?
Xander We need help!
Willow Somebody, please, now!
Intern What happened?
Xander She fell.
Willow The flu.
Cordelia She fainted.
Xander The flu, fainted and fell. She's sick, make it better!
Intern It's gonna be okay. Let's get her up.
Intern Patient's unconscious... Pupils are unequal and unresponsive.
Cordelia What does that mean?
Willow Is she gonna be okay?
Intern Please, you gotta give us some room.
Dr._Wilkinson What do we have?
Intern High-grade fever, possible fractures.
Dr._Wilkinson Get her into Trauma 1, give her a CBC, Chem 7, type and screen.
Intern Right.
Dr._Wilkinson I'm sorry, you can't go any further.
Xander Someone should be with her!
Dr._Wilkinson I'm sorry! You can't go any further.
Willow I'll call Giles, tell him what happened. You call Buffy's mom, tell her, n-not what happened, just get her here.
Joyce Where is she?
Giles She's still in the emergency room.
Joyce I wanna see her.
Cordelia They won't let us in there.
Dr._Wilkinson Mrs. Summers?
Joyce Yes?
Dr._Wilkinson I'm Dr. Wilkinson.
Joyce Is Buffy okay?
Dr._Wilkinson We were able to stabilize and...
Joyce Is she okay?
Dr._Wilkinson She's going to be fine.
Joyce Thank you.
Xander Good. Good. That's good.
Dr._Wilkinson I wanna keep her here a few days, though. She still has some healing to do.
Joyce Buffy? Hi, sweetheart.
Xander Hey, Buffy, we're all here.
Buffy Hey. Here we are. It's all of we. Are we taking me home?
Dr._Wilkinson No. Buffy, you need to lie down, honey.
Buffy Yeah? Lie at home. My bed is better than any bed that's... not my bed.
Dr._Wilkinson She's still a little out of it.
Buffy Shhh! Hospital zone. No singing.
Dr._Wilkinson She'll feel better after she's been here a while.
Buffy No! Lemme go. Look, I wanna go.
Willow Buffy, what's wrong?
Buffy No! No! Let me go!
Cordelia I think she wants to go.
Buffy No, don't do that! Stop it!
Dr._Wilkinson Hold her steady!
Buffy Giles, tell them!
Orderly I got her.
Buffy The vampires! I need to kill the vampires!
Dr._Wilkinson This'll help you relax.
Buffy Ow! No!
Xander It's gotta be the fever.
Willow Yeah, it made her delusional.
Buffy They're out there!
Giles Yes, uh, well, we'll, uh, we'll get those, uh, vampires later. I hear it's best t-to play along.
Joyce Honey, listen...
Buffy I wanna go home.
Joyce It's gonna be okay. I promise.
Buffy Please don't make me stay here...
Joyce I *promise*.
Xander That was a new experience. I'm not used to seeing Buffy scared like that.
Joyce Yeah, she just *hates* hospitals. Ever since she was a little girl.
Willow What happened?
Joyce When she was eight her cousin Celia died in a hospital. Buffy was alone with her at the time.
Cordelia Yuk!
Joyce Yeah, they were very close.
Willow Wow, and she was eight?
Joyce Well, it looks like she's asleep. I should go call her father.
Giles Um, I-I think there's a, a phone...
Joyce Thank you for coming. I-I *really* appreciate the way you look out for her.
Giles Oh...
Joyce *All* of you.
Giles Well, we're, uh, we're very fond of her. The, uh, the telephone.
Joyce I, I... I hope I'm not out of line, but... I-I-I wanted to say how sorry I am about, uh, that teacher, Ms. Calendar. Buffy said you were close.
Giles Oh, uh... Thank you.
Joyce Buffy's been so down since it happened. I mean, she never gets sick.
Giles Well, I'm sure she'll be, uh... She'll be fine.
Joyce I'm sorry, I, I babble when I'm nervous, I just wanted to... Well, if, if you need anything...
Giles Thank you. Thank you.
Xander Do you think she's gonna be okay in here?
Cordelia I don't know, Lysette got her nose done here, and she came in looking for the Gwyneth Paltrow, and it looked more like the Mr. Potatohead.
Xander Cordy...
Willow Buffy's not here for cosmetic surgery.
Cordelia No, but while she's in here, she might as well get that thing done.
Cordelia You know, that thing on her face? You know that thing.
Willow Do you think Angel will attack Buffy in here?
Xander He can come in, it's a public building.
Willow That's true.
Cordelia Am I the only one that's noticed that thing?
Woman You'll be fine. Is that better?
Orderly Man, I hate it when you lose the young ones.
Dr._Wilkinson I'm just saying, step back on the dosage until we can analyze the results.
Dr._Backer There isn't time. I should think that would be clear to you by now.
Dr._Wilkinson The normal course of treatment...
Dr._Backer They *aren't* responding to the normal course of treatment. Look, they're getting worse.
Dr._Wilkinson Raising their temperatures is poten...
Dr._Backer Dr. Wilkinson! I have the consent of the parents.
Dr._Wilkinson They're desperate! They don't understand what you're...
Dr._Backer You know what, if-if you have a problem with my methods, just take it up with the board.
Dr._Wilkinson I have!
Ryan He comes at night. The grownups don't see him. He was with Tina. He'll come back for us.
Buffy Who?
Ryan Death.
Xander Visiting hours are over.
Angelus Well, I'm pretty much family.
Xander Yeah. Why don't you come back during the day? Oh, gee, no, I guess you can't.
Angelus If I decide to walk into Buffy's room, do you think for one microsecond that you could stop me?
Xander Maybe not. Maybe that security guard couldn't either. Or those cops... or the orderlies... But I'm kinda curious to find out. You game?
Angelus Buffy's White Knight. You still love her. It must just eat you up that I got there first.
Xander You're gonna die. And I'm gonna be there.
Angelus Tell her I stopped by.
Celia Help me, help! Avalanche! Help! Help! I'm trapped! Avalanche! Help! Help!
Little_Buffy Power Girl to the rescue!
Celia Help me! Help! Help! Please, help!
Celia You saved me! Thank you, Power Girl!
Little_Buffy You're safe now.
Dr._Wilkinson Good morning.
Buffy Could've fooled me.
Dr._Wilkinson How are you feeling? Looks like your fever's gone down.
Buffy Well, good! Thanks for having me. Let's try and keep in touch.
Dr._Wilkinson Not so fast. Hmm.
Buffy Good 'hmm' or bad 'hmm'?
Dr._Wilkinson Swelling's... gone! Does this hurt?
Buffy Nope.
Dr._Wilkinson Amazing.
Buffy Well, then I should probably go, right?
Dr._Wilkinson No. Soon. We have to make sure that fever is gone. That's a strong virus you have. Maybe not as strong as you, but...
Buffy I-is that the same virus the kids have?
Giles May we come in?
Dr._Wilkinson Please! Maybe you can keep our patient from bolting. Rest! Hmm?
Xander Flowers for milady.
Buffy I think they call those balloons.
Xander Yeah, stick 'em in water, maybe they'll grow.
Willow Not to be outdone...
Buffy Homework!
Willow It's my way of saying, 'get well soon'.
Buffy You know, chocolate says that even better.
Willow I did all your assignments. All you have to do is sign your name.
Buffy Chocolate means *nothing* to me.
Cordelia Nobody told me I was supposed to bring a gift. I was out of the loop on gifts.
Giles It's, it's tradition among, um... people. Um... Grapes. Well, did you, uh, pass the night well enough?
Buffy Not really. Something happened I thought you...
Buffy You know what? Let's take a walk.
Buffy Now, this part I could get used to.
Willow Do you want me to go real fast? Not that I would.
Giles We were discussing, um, stuff.
Buffy Yes, stuff. Um, you know, a girl died here last night.
Willow How?
Buffy Well, the flu.
Xander Flu doesn't exactly sound monsterrific.
Buffy I know. But there's this Dr. Backer, and he's been giving them these experimental treatments.
Buffy I-I'm not sure what he's up to, but he's a little creepy. A-and then there was this kid, Ryan. He said he saw something.
Giles Saw what?
Buffy Death.
Cordelia Death?
Willow *The* Death? As in, 'it is your time'?
Giles Buffy, a-a-a frightened child...
Buffy Yeah, but I thought I saw something. I'm not sure, I was really out of it, but...
Cordelia But you do know that you saw death.
Willow Did it have an hourglass?
Xander Ooo, if he asks you to play chess, don't even do it. The guy's, like, a whiz.
Buffy Maybe it wasn't death. Maybe it was something else.
Cordelia So this isn't about you being afraid of hospitals 'cause your friend died and you wanna conjure up a monster that you can fight so you can save everybody and not feel so helpless?
Giles Cordelia, have you actually ever heard of tact?
Cordelia Tact is just not saying true stuff. I'll pass.
Willow Your mom did tell us about your cousin.
Buffy This has nothing to do with that. This little boy Ryan is afraid of something, something real. As long as I'm forced to stay here, I'm gonna find out what.
Xander So, is this the part where we say, what can we do to help?
Cordelia You had to ask that, didn't you?
Xander Pft! It'll be cake. Just gotta figure out what killed this little girl Tina, we'll be out. Five minutes tops.
Cordelia This is what happens when you're compassionate towards sick people. They take advantage of you.
Xander Uh-huh. Buffy almost died just to put you out.
Cordelia I didn't wanna be the first one to say it.
Xander You there. Me here.
Cordelia Right.
Guard What are you doing here?
Willow So, where do we start?
Giles Hmm? Oh, I don't know. Maybe look into the history of the hospital, bizarre incidents, that sort of thing.
Willow I'm sensing a little less than full committal here.
Giles Oh, I-I suppose so. Cordelia may be homerically insensitive, but she may also be right. Death and disease are, are things, possibly the *only* things that, that Buffy cannot fight. It's only natural for her to try to create a-a defeatable opponent. Especially now, after... after Jenny.
Willow That's true. But on the 'we live on the Hellmouth' side, these kids may have seen a monster.
Giles What, a monster that grown-ups can't see? Doesn't ring a bell. Unless...
Willow Unless?
Giles Well, sometimes small children *do* see something we adults don't: us. Our true selves, our, our... our hidden faces.
Willow So the kids might be afraid of a regular person? Like the weird doctor!
Giles Stanley Backer was his name, no?
Willow Let's look him up.
Guard You know, most people think that security guards are just guys that failed the police exam. But that's not me. This is my career.
Cordelia Stereotypes are so unfair.
Guard I did take the fireman's exam, though. I didn't do so good.
Cordelia Oh, well, you know, I think that security guards are *way* sexier than firemen. They're all sooty.
Guard Well, this is where all the action is anyhow. I'm all the time restraining people.
Cordelia Mm, how thrilling. Do you ever get scared?
Guard 'Fear is for the weak.' That's my motto. Either that, or 'Live in the now.' I haven't decided yet.
Cordelia I bet you see a lot of tragedy. You know, like that little girl?
Guard Oh, one of Dr. Backer's patients. Dr. Backer's a great man. He understands...
Guard ...the real truth about children.
Cordelia What's that?
Guard Sometimes they die.
Guard What was that?
Cordelia Uh, you know, I didn't hear anything. You know, you have the most... perfect nose I've ever seen.
Cordelia You must work out.
Guard Yeah.
Cordelia Mm-hm.
Xander Could you make just a little more with the touchy-gropey?
Cordelia Jealous?
Xander Of Rogaine boy? I don't think so. Here, take this to Giles, okay?
Cordelia What about you?
Xander I'm gonna stay here.
Cordelia Oh, right. Your obsession with protecting Buffy. Have I told you how attractive that's not?
Xander Cordelia, someone's gotta watch her back.
Cordelia Yeah, well, I've seen you watch her back.
Xander What is that supposed to mean?
Cordelia Well, I was using the phrase 'watch her back' as a euphemism for 'looking at her butt.' You know, sort of a pun.
Xander Oh! Right. Hey!
Cordelia Well, you do.
Xander Jealous?
Cordelia Fine. Watch *my* back.
Buffy Hey. Remember me?
Ryan You shouldn't be here.
Buffy Why not?
Ryan Contagious.
Buffy Nah. I already got what you got.
Buffy Oh, what, you think because I'm a grown-up? Believe me, I'm not that grown up.
Ryan He'll come again tonight.
Buffy Ryan, listen to me. I'm not gonna let this thing hurt you. Any of you. Grown-ups don't believe you, right? Well, I do. We both know that there are real monsters. But there's also real heroes that fight monsters. And that's me.
Ryan Can't fight death.
Giles Our Dr. Backer has something of a rap sheet.
Willow Reprimands for controversial experiments, risky procedures, a malpractice suit. Looks like it was dropped suddenly.
Giles Factor in Buffy's observation that he gives her the, um, uh, wiggins...
Willow This may be our death guy?
Giles I just wish I knew what he was doing to these children.
Dr._Backer Yes. Yes.
Dr._Backer Uhh!
Giles Uh, well, it looks as if you, uh, were on to something.
Buffy I know.
Giles The, uh, the, the girl Tina, um, it's apparent that she, she died of the fever, simple enough, but, but her records show her improving and then suddenly deteriorating w-w-w-without any apparent cause.
Willow So we checked Dr. Backer out. This guy was *not* a solid citizen.
Buffy It wasn't Backer. He was clean.
Cordelia What do you mean 'clean'?
Xander What do you mean 'was'?
Buffy He's dead. This thing killed him, and not with kindness.
Willow You saw it?
Buffy No, it's invisible. I saw Backer nearly shredded and the thing knocked me down. But it's real. Which means I get to fight it.
Giles Um, this is your work?
Buffy No, one of the kids.
Giles Oh. Um... Well, it would help if-if we knew what it was. I-it's invisible to you, but the, the children can see it.
Cordelia But you said you did see something the other night.
Buffy Uh, yeah, but I was pretty delirious. I mean, it doesn't make any sense. Why would I see it then and not last night?
Joyce Good morning.
Joyce Ooo, looks like I interrupted a secret meeting.
Cordelia You sure didn't!
Joyce Honey, I, I just talked to the doctor, and she said I can take you home.
Buffy No. I should stay here.
Joyce But, honey, I thought you'd be raring...
Buffy I think my symptoms are flaring up.
Willow She doesn't look well.
Buffy 'Cause I'm not well. Uh, I feel all oogy.
Xander Increased ooginess. That's a danger signal.
Joyce Are you sure?
Buffy Oh, yeah, but just for a day... or s-so.
Joyce Okay, well, I'll, uh, I'll talk to the doctor.
Xander So what's the drill?
Buffy Giles, see if you can get a mug shot on that guy. I need to know what I'm fighting.
Giles Right. Yes.
Buffy I'll check Backer's office. See if I can find any post-its marked 'why a monster might want me dead.'
Xander Sounds like a plan.
Buffy Course, if I find anything, I won't know what it means, so, Will...
Willow Oh, yeah, I'm good at medical stuff since Xander and I used to play doctor all the time.
Xander No, she's being literal. She used to have all these medical volumes, uh, and diagnosed me with stuff. I didn't have the heart to tell her she was playing it wrong.
Willow Wrong? Why? How did *you* play doctor?
Buffy I never have.
Giles Um, fascinating though this is...
Buffy Yeah, right. Go!
Giles W-w-we'll call you if we... know something.
Buffy Know something soon.
Giles I'd best head for the library. Research beckons.
Xander I'm on sentry duty. Angel won't show till sundown if at all, but maybe I'll get lucky with this death guy.
Cordelia He's invisible.
Xander Yeah, but if I see a floating pipe and a smoking jacket, he's dropped.
Giles Well, you two, stay alert.
Xander Finding out who this thing is takes priority. Cordy, you should go with Giles.
Giles Why do I have to have... Uh, good thinking. I-I-I could do with a research assistant.
Cordelia Let's go, tact-guy.
Giles Yes.
Cordelia Be careful.
Willow It's weird going through his things. Look, he didn't finish his coffee. Guess he won't.
Buffy Yep, another person I wasn't in time to save. It's too bad Angel didn't put me in the hospital sooner. There's something I never thought I'd hear myself say.
Willow Hey, wait, I think I have something.
Buffy Hmm. Sherlock.
Willow Okay, this makes sense. Dr. Backer was trying to inoculate the kids with a controlled dosage of the same virus they already had. Oh, raising their temperatures to burn the fever out of them.
Buffy Would that work?
Willow According to this it was starting to. So he really was trying to help the kids.
Buffy Till that thing stopped him.
Cordelia Eww, what does this do?
Giles What?
Cordelia What does this do?
Giles Uh, it, uh, extracts vital organs to replenish its own mutating cells.
Cordelia Wow! What does this one do?
Giles Um, i-it elongates its mouth to, uh, engulf its victim's head with its incisors.
Cordelia Ouch. Wait, what does this one do?
Giles It asks endless questions of those with whom it's supposed to be working so that nothing is getting done.
Cordelia Boy, there's a demon for everything.
Giles I don't even know if we're on the right track. Since this, uh... miscreant has only been seen by select individuals, there's a chance we won't ever... find a picture of it.
Cordelia Well, it's not in here.
Cordelia It's called Der Kindestod.
Buffy Who is this?
Cordelia It's me. I've got your monster!
Buffy Where's Giles?
Cordelia Looking up stuff.
Buffy Well, can you put him on?
Cordelia Hey! I found your guy, okay? Just listen.
Buffy Right.
Cordelia The name means 'child death'. This book says that he feeds off of children by sucking the life out of them. Eew! But anyway, afterwards, it looks like they died because they were sick.
Buffy So it did kill Tina.
Cordelia Yeah, that's my take. 'Cause it would be looking at the children's ward as basically an all-you-can-eat kind of thing, y'know.
Buffy Backer was curing the kids and taking away the Kindestod's food.
Cordelia Hence, the slice-age.
Giles I found a picture of how it kills. Let me talk to her.
Cordelia Oh! Eww!
Buffy What?
Cordelia Oh! Uh, you should see this thing! The way it does its thing, I mean, eww! Why do I let you guys drag me into this stuff?
Giles Uh, uh, Buffy? Are you, are you still there?
Buffy Hanging on every eww.
Giles Uh, the, um, the Kindestod gorges by sitting atop his prey, pinning it down, uh, helplessly. Then he slowly draws out the life. I-it must be, uh, h-horrifying for the victim.
Giles Buffy? Hello?
Little_Buffy Celia?
Little_Buffy What's wrong?
Little_Buffy I don't know what to do, Celia!
Little_Buffy Help! Help! Help! Somebody help!
Celia Get it off of me!
Little_Buffy Come on, Celia!
Celia Get it off of me!
Giles Buffy, w-what is it?
Willow Thanks.
Buffy It killed Celia.
Willow Your cousin?
Buffy We have to get this thing, Willow, before it gets any more kids.
Willow You will. We will.
Buffy But how? I-I can't even see it.
Willow You saw it once.
Buffy Did I? Uh, maybe my mind was playing tricks on me. I mean, I was crazed with that fever. Who knows...
Willow Buffy, think about this.
Buffy I have. Lots of thoughts.
Willow It's crazy.
Buffy The fever. That's how you see the Kindestod. That's why Celia could see it. That's why Ryan still can. It's the only way.
Willow But how are you gonna fight this thing with 107 degree temperature?
Buffy I guess we'll find out.
Willow Buffy!
Buffy Willow, I'm going to do this.
Willow Buffy, that's 100% pure. It'll kill you in an instant.
Buffy Oh. They really should put that on the label.
Willow It needs to be diluted.
Buffy Okay, but this better work fast.
Buffy Faster than that.
Buffy Here's to my health.
Buffy Oh, God. I'm not sure this was such a good idea.
Willow Hang in there. You'll be okay.
Buffy Okay. I'm okay.
Buffy The kids. They're gone.
Ryan Come on!
Girl Hold me!
Ryan Keep quiet!
Willow What could have happened?
Buffy I don't know. Maybe we're too late. Maybe they moved. Maybe I don't... I'm burning up!
Buffy Will?
Willow What?
Buffy I think it's in there.
Buffy It's going after them! We gotta get 'em.
Dr._Wilkinson Buffy?
Buffy Okay, we'll get 'em in a second.
Dr._Wilkinson What's wrong?
Willow I, uh, she's not feeling well again.
Dr._Wilkinson You should be in bed.
Buffy No, no, it's not that bad.
Dr._Wilkinson No, you're coming with me.
Buffy No!
Willow She's sorry!
Dr._Wilkinson Security, come to the children's ward. We have a situation.
Guard Okay, come on now. We can do this the easy way.
Willow Frogs! Frogs! Get 'em off of me!
Willow Oh, my God, frogs! Get them off of me! Please, help!
Willow Get 'em off! FROGS! Frogs! Oh, my God, horrible frogs!
Willow Get 'em...
Dr._Wilkinson Not her, the other one!
Willow No more frogs!
Guard C'mon!
Xander Buffy, are you okay? Did Angel...
Buffy No. We need to get to the basement.
Ryan Shh!
Girl I'm cold.
Ryan Here.
Ryan Here. We're gonna be safe in here.
Boy Look!
Ryan What?
Ryan Whoa!
Xander You don't know how to kill this thing.
Buffy I thought I might try violence.
Xander Solid call.
Ryan Oof!
Buffy You make me sick.
Xander Up.
Xander C'mon, c'mon, c'mon! Hurry!
Xander Are you okay?
Buffy Actually, I think I'm starting to feel better. Let's...
Buffy Oh!
Xander He's dead right? I mean, I heard something snap.
Buffy That would be his neck.
Xander You're not gonna yak on me, are ya?
Joyce Here you go, honey. Peanut butter and jelly, without the crust, just the way you like it.
Buffy And the juice?
Joyce Two parts orange, one part grapefruit.
Buffy That's my drink.
Joyce I measured it exactly.
Buffy Oh, mom?
Joyce Mm-hm?
Buffy I wanted crunchy peanut butter.
Joyce Oh, sorry.
Buffy A-and I said extra jelly.
Joyce Anything to help my daughter get well.
Willow Oh, and while you're up, could I get a refill? It's just I'm so comfortable.
Joyce Of course.
Willow Thanks.
Xander Oh, oh, oh, and another bag of cheesy chips.
Joyce Uh, you ate the last one.
Xander No, there's another bag hidden behind the raisins.
Joyce I'm on it.
Xander Your mom's tryin' to Bogart the cheesy chips. What's that all about?
Joyce Oh, Buffy, here. Um, this came in the mail.
Buffy It's from Ryan.
Joyce The boy from the hospital?
Joyce Oh, he drew you a picture.
Joyce How... nice.
