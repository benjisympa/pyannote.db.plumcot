Xander All I'm saying is, it's a stupid idea to have a victory party at the beach. It's officially nippy. So say my nips.
Willow I think it's festive. A party with nature.
Cordelia Well, it's the team's choice. It was their victory.
Xander Team? Swim team. Hardly what I'd call a team. The Yankees. Abbott and Costello. The 'A'. Now, those were teams.
Cordelia Jealous?
Xander No. Y-yes, but 'no' more than 'yes'.
Xander I mean, look at that. Dodd McAlvy. Last month he's the freak with Jicama breath who waxes his back. He wins a few meets and suddenly inherits the cool gene?
Cordelia Well, all I know is, my cheerleading squad wasted a lot of pep on losers. It's about time our school excelled at something.
Willow Hmm. You're forgetting our high mortality rate.
Xander We're number one! Huh?
Cameron Beautiful. Isn't it?
Buffy Yeah. It's just so...
Cameron Eternal. A true mother, giving birth to new life and devouring old. Always adaptable and nurturing... yet... constant... and merciless.
Buffy Boy. I was just gonna go with big and wet.
Cameron Me and some of the other guys on the team, we come out here once a week to train in it. See, we swim against the current.
Buffy Funny. That's how I feel most of the time. So, Cameron Walker, you just won the state semifinals. What are you going to do next?
Cameron I'm going to hang out with Buffy Summers. Get to know her.
Buffy Hey, pause that tape for a second.
Cameron Hey. No pressure. I just like being around you. That's all.
Jonathon Somebody help me!
Dodd Come on, Jonny, you gotta hold your breath longer than that if you ever wanna make the team! Hey, somebody time him!
Dodd Hey!
Buffy Nice tat. What, they ran out of Tweety bird?
Dodd Hey, what's your problem?
Cameron You had it coming to you, bro.
Gage Chill, dude. A bunch of us are gonna take a little night dip down on the beach. You in?
Dodd Whatever.
Buffy Hey, let's, let's get you a towel.
Jonathon No. Why don't you mind your own business? I can handle this without your help.
Buffy See? It's fun to hang out with me.
Dodd I can't believe Buffy. Man, that girl gives me the creeps.
Gage Oh! Dude! What is that foulness?
Gage Hey, Dodd! Dude! Huh.
Willow Okay! Good pie charts, everyone. Good. All good.
Girl Thanks.
Willow Nice. Good. Gage. Your pie chart is looking a lot like solitaire... with naked ladies on the cards?
Gage What's your point?
Willow No point.
Snyder Nice work in yesterday's meet, son. Now, let's go for it.
Willow Uh, hi there, sir.
Snyder Rosenberg. How's the class? Everything in order?
Willow Well, actually...
Snyder Great. I've been talking to the board. We've been having trouble finding a competent teacher this late in the term. Do you think you could continue subbing through finals?
Willow Oh! Sure! I like teaching.
Snyder Isn't that nice. You're a team player, and I like that. A team player wants everyone on the team to succeed. Wants everyone to pass.
Willow Well, yeah. Sure.
Snyder I understand there's a problem with Gage Petronzi.
Willow Oh, good, then you know. Well, yeah. Besides the behavior problem, he won't do homework, and his test scores are...
Willow Well, actually, he doesn't have any test scores because he never shows up when we have...
Snyder I'm not interested in any of that. I'm interested in why, when this school is on the brink of winning its first state championship in fifteen years, you slap a crucial member of that team with a failing mark that would force his removal. Is that how you show your school spirit?
Willow Yes. Well, I mean... no. I'm just trying to grade fairly.
Snyder Gage is a champion. He's under more pressure than the other students. And I think we need to cut him some slack.
Willow You're asking me to change his grade?
Snyder I never said any such thing. All I'm suggesting is... that you recheck your figures, and I think we'll find a grade more fitting to an athlete of Gage's stature. Perhaps something in a 'D'.
Xander Just like that? He actually told you to alter his grade?
Willow Exactly. Except for actually telling me to. But he made it perfectly clear of what he wasn't telling me.
Xander That is wrong, a big, fat, spanking wrong. It's a slap in the face to every one of us who studied hard and worked long hours to *earn* our D's.
Cordelia Xander, I know you take pride in being the voice of the common wuss, but the truth is, certain people are entitled to special privileges. They're called winners. That's the way the world works.
Xander And what about that nutty 'all men are created equal' thing?
Cordelia Propaganda spouted out by the ugly and less deserving.
Xander I think that was Lincoln.
Cordelia Disgusting mole and stupid hat.
Willow Actually, it was Jefferson.
Cordelia Kept slaves. Remember?
Xander You know what really grates my cheese? That Buffy's not here to share my moral outrage about swim team perks.
Xander She's too busy being one of them.
Cameron I don't know, a dolphin. A dolphin in the ocean. Because, you know, when I'm in the vastness of the ocean, it's... it's like I'm never alone.
Cameron You ever hear of a woman named Gertrude Ederle?
Buffy No. No, I can't say that I have, Cam.
Cameron First woman to swim the English Channel. Same thing. I mean, she would talk to it. I mean, she'd carry on entire conversations with it. Sometimes I do that. I mean, once I was out in...
Buffy You know what, Cam? Thanks. I'd forgotten how nice it is to just talk, or, in my case, listen, without any romantic pressure.
Cameron Hey... I'm not about pressure. I just want you to be comfortable.
Buffy I'm comfy! I'm so comfy, I'm nodding off actually, which is why...
Cameron Are you wearing a bra?
Buffy What?
Cameron Come on. I mean, tell me you haven't been thinking about this ever since last night.
Buffy What I'm thinking about is that I should probably get out of this car...
Cameron Relax. I'm not gonna hurt you.
Buffy Oh, it's not me I'm worried about.
Cameron You like it rough!
Cameron Ow!
Cameron Oh!
Cameron Oh!
Cameron Ah!
Cameron Oh, you broke my nose!
Cameron Ah!
Cameron Ow!
Buffy I wasn't the attacker, Principal Snyder. I was the attacked.
Snyder That's not how it looked from where I was standing.
Cameron I don't know what happened. I mean, first she leads me on, then she goes schizo on me.
Buffy Lead you on? When did I lead you on?
Cameron Oh, come on. I mean, look at the way she dresses.
Snyder Coach.
Coach_Marin How we doing, Cameron?
Snyder Coach Marin, how bad does it look?
Coach_Marin Well, luckily, it's not broken, but sure as hell it's gonna sting for a few days.
Snyder I mean our chances of winning the state championship.
Coach_Marin Oh.
Snyder Can we still do it?
Coach_Marin I'm gonna need Cameron back at a hundred and ten percent. Uh, he's my best swimmer, now with Dodd, uh...
Buffy What happened to Dodd?
Snyder That's none of your concern. You'd better hope that boy's nose heals before the meet this Friday.
Coach_Marin Walker, I want you to hit the steam room as soon as you're done here and try to keep those sinuses clear. Take care of my boy, Ruthie.
Nurse_Greenleigh I always do.
Coach_Marin And you... try to dress more appropriately from now on. This isn't a dance club.
Buffy So I'm treated like the baddie just because he has a sprained wrist and a bloody nose. And I don't have a scratch on me, which, granted, hurts my case a little on the surface, but meanwhile he gets away with it because he's on the 'aren't we the most' swim team...
Buffy ...who, by the way, if no one's noticed, have been acting like real jerks lately...
Buffy So, anything new with you guys?
Giles Thank you for taking an interest. Apparently, some remains were found on the beach this morning. Some human remains.
Willow Dodd McAlvy's remains.
Buffy Vampire?
Giles No. No, he was eviscerated. Nothing left but skin and cartilage.
Xander In other words, this was no boating accident.
Buffy So something ripped him open and ate out his insides?
Willow Like an Oreo Cookie. Well, except for, you know, without the chocolatey *cookie* goodness.
Giles Yes. Um, Principal Snyder has, has asked the faculty to keep the news quiet for now, um, so as not to unduly upset the students.
Xander For 'students': read 'swim team'.
Willow So, we're looking for a beastie.
Giles That, uh, eats humans whole... except for the skin.
Buffy This doesn't make any sense.
Xander Yeah. The skin's the best part.
Buffy Any demons with high cholesterol?
Buffy You're gonna think about that later, mister, and you're gonna laugh.
Coach_Marin Okay, son, I think you've had enough. Time to hit the shower.
Xander Too much research. Need beverage.
Cameron Hey! Watch it.
Xander Oh, forgive me, your Swim Teamliness.
Cameron Loser.
Xander Likin' the nose, Cam. Good look for you.
Cameron Meaning what?
Xander Meaning Buffy must not be on your list of privileges after all. Man, I love it when you guys mess with her.
Cameron You're lucky I'm hungry.
Xander Oh, the cafeteria's closed.
Cameron Not to me.
Cameron God, what is that?
Xander Grape, orange. Orange, grape.
Xander Oh, my God.
Xander No, no, no! The mouth's a lot bigger! And downward. Like this.
Xander With more teeth!
Cordelia I'm doing the best I can.
Giles Is that what you saw, Xander?
Xander Y... yeah! I think so. Pretty much.
Giles Aaaaare you sure?
Xander Well, it was dark! And the thing went through the window so quick, and I was a... little shocked when I saw it, and...
Cordelia Go ahead. Say it. You ran like a woman.
Xander Hey, if you saw this thing, you'd run like a woman, too.
Willow Buffy was right. According to the statistics, Dodd and Cameron were the best swimmers on the team.
Buffy First and second, actually. Which means if my theory's correct, Gage Petronzi, the third-best swimmer on the team, would be the next item on the menu.
Cordelia God, this is so sad. We're never gonna win the state championship. I think I've lost all will to cheerlead.
Xander Raise your hand if you feel her pain.
Giles If you're saying these killings aren't random, it would suggest someone's out for revenge.
Buffy And raise the possibility that someone brought forth this sea monster from whence it came to exact that revenge. 'From whence it came'? I'm spending *way* too much time around you.
Xander Who would hate the swim team that much, though? Besides me, I mean.
Willow Ooo!
Buffy Willow?
Willow Jonathon! He was bullied by Dodd the other day on the beach, remember?
Buffy He did say he could take care of things himself. It's a good call. You should question him.
Willow Really? Me? I'll crack him like an egg.
Giles Meanwhile, I think, uh, swimmer number three might benefit from your... watchful eye and protection. Discreetly, of course.
Buffy I'm on it.
Xander What about me? What can I do?
Cordelia Well, you could go out to the parking lot and practice running like a man.
Willow So, Jonathon. You tried out for the swim team twice and never made it?
Jonathon I'm asthmatic. I couldn't keep up.
Willow You resented it, didn't you?
Jonathon Maybe.
Willow You hated being pushed around by Dodd and the others.
Jonathon So?
Willow So, you wanted revenge. Didn't you? Didn't you?!
Jonathon Yeah! Okay? I did!
Willow So... You delved into the black arts and conjured up a hellbeast from the ocean's depths to wreak your vengeance.
Jonathon Huh?
Willow Didn't you?
Jonathon What? No! I snuck in yesterday and... peed in the pool.
Willow Oh. Eww!
Coach_Marin This is such a blow. Sooner or later, the rest of my boys are gonna find out. How can I ask them to swim?
Snyder It's a terrible, terrible tragedy. We all feel your pain, coach. I don't know two finer boys than Cameron and... that other one. But I know they'd want their friends to go on and win that state championship. It's time to think about the team.
Coach_Marin Well, I don't have a complete team as it is. If we don't find someone by this afternoon's tryouts, we won't be eligible to compete.
Snyder You'll find someone. All he has to do is wear a bathing suit, right?
Lyrics If you'd listen, we wouldn't have to go through this
Lyrics If you'd just let me finish / Stop cuttin' and jumpin' ahead
Lyrics Yeah, if you'd just shut your pretty mouth / You'd save yourself some tears
Lyrics You came back from the bathroom
Lyrics With somethin' on your shoe
Lyrics Yeah, draggin' it behind you
Gage This me-and-my-shadow act? It's getting old. What do you want from me?
Lyrics Lookin' kinda foolish
Buffy Well, um... It's a little embarrassing. You see, I'm a swim groupie.
Gage Aha.
Buffy Oh, yeah. You know, there's just something about the smell of chlorine on a guy. Oh, baby.
Gage Hmm.
Buffy Uh, okay, okay, okay. Obviously, my sex appeal is on the fritz today, so I'll just give it to you straight. There's something lurking out there, and it's making fillets of the populace, and I think you might be next.
Gage Uh-huh. And you think that because?
Buffy Well, it's already attacked. It's already killed some people.
Gage You're one twisted sister, you know that? Cam told me about your games. Go find someone else to harass.
Gage What a psycho bitch, man.
Angelus Gotta be talking about Buffy.
Gage How'd you know?
Angelus Uh, she and I... had this thing once. Biggest mistake of my life.
Gage Yeah. My condolences, dude.
Angelus She's a real head-tripper.
Gage Tell me about it. Girl acts like she's God's gift or something.
Angelus Who is she? The Chosen One?
Gage Exactly.
Angelus You know, what she really needs is for someone to really knock her down off her notches.
Gage Yeah, that'd be sweet. Anyone in mind?
Angelus You're in luck, my friend.
Angelus Just so happens...
Angelus ...I'm recruiting.
Gage No!
Gage Ah! Somebody! Help! Ah! Help! Ah! Ah! Get him off me! Help! Ah!
Angelus Why, Miss Summers! You're beautiful!
Gage Oh. Was that the thing that killed Cameron?
Buffy No. That was something else.
Gage S-something else?
Buffy Yeah. Unfortunately, we have a lot of something elses in this town. Good night.
Gage Hey!
Gage Walk me home?
Coach_Marin Swimmers! Take position!
Coach_Marin Keep the stroking up. Alright. Keep it going, keep it going all the way to the end. All the way to the end. Breathe deep.
Coach_Marin Gage! You with us or not? C'mon, let's go!
Cordelia So he spit it out? I thought Angel liked blood.
Buffy He used to.
Willow Maybe his eyes were too big for his stomach.
Buffy Or maybe there was something in Gage's blood that Angel didn't like. Say, for example, steroids.
Willow That would explain all their behavioral changes.
Cordelia And their winning streak.
Willow So maybe whatever's in their blood is what's attracting this creature to them.
Buffy Any luck researching our fish monster?
Cordelia Zippo. We couldn't find any sea demon that matched the description that Xander gave us. Not that Chicken Little's much of a witness, but...
Cordelia Oh.
Cordelia Oh! Oh, my! Now, that, girls, is my kind of...
Willow Xander?
Cordelia Xander?!
Cordelia What the hell are you doing here?
Xander Shh! I'm undercover.
Buffy Not under much.
Cordelia Get out of here before someone sees you impersonating a member of the swim team!
Xander I don't do impersonations. I tried out for the team last night. I made it.
Cordelia Really?
Xander Yeah. I figured I can keep an eye on Gage and the others when Buffy can't.
Willow When you're nude? I-I meant to say 'changing'.
Coach_Marin Harris! You can flirt on your own time!
Xander Okey-dokey, coachie.
Cordelia I'm dating a swimmer from the Sunnydale swim team!
Buffy You can die happy.
Buffy What about Jonathon? Is he involved?
Willow Oh, no. He just... sort of... peed in the pool.
Buffy Oh.
Buffy Oh!
Xander Don't you guys get claustrophobic in here? I mean, what's the deal? You perspire a lot. You can't breathe. O-or read. I mean, I guess you could, but the pages would probably get all wet.
Xander You gotta love this undercover deal. Twenty minutes in a hot room with a bunch of sweaty guys...
Buffy Where's Gage?
Xander I don't know. He was right behind me, putting his sneakers on. But it's not the Velcro kind, so give him a couple of extra minutes. Tag. You're it.
Gage OH, MY GOD!
Gage Help me! Help me! Ah! Help me!
Buffy Gage?
Nurse_Greenleigh I don't think that this is going to need stitches, but you might wanna have your family physician take a look at it.
Giles How are you?
Buffy I'm definitely feeling the burn.
Giles Well, the, uh, good news is that it would appear that none of your team actually died.
Buffy But the bad news is... they're monsters.
Coach_Marin How could this happen?
Giles Are you saying you don't know?
Coach_Marin Well, you work so hard, you start to win suddenly. You think it's just you. You're inspiring the boys to greatness. But in the back of your mind, you start to wonder.
Giles You never asked any of the boys if they were taking anything?
Coach_Marin Maybe I was afraid to.
Buffy There.
Willow Dodd McAlvy: torn tendon. Gage Petronzi: fractured wrist, depression, headaches.
Buffy It's all there in the school medical records.
Willow All symptomatic of steroid abuse.
Xander But is steroid abuse usually linked with, 'hey, I'm a fish'?
Willow There must be something else in the mix. But the point is, these boys were obviously drugged.
Buffy And Nurse Greenleigh treated every one of them. She must have known.
Willow If steroids are that dangerous, why would they do that to themselves?
Buffy They needed to win. And winning equals trophies, which equals prestige for the school. You see how they're treated. It's been like that forever.
Xander Sure. The discus throwers got the best seats at all the crucifixions.
Buffy Meanwhile, I'm breaking my nails every day battling the forces of evil, and my French teacher can't even remember my name.
Xander So what's the drill? Get Nurse Greenleigh?
Willow Let's throw the book at her!
Buffy She probably went home for the day. I think it can wait. Xander, why don't you see if you can find out what these boys are taking, or at least how they're taking it? Powders, pills, syringe?
Xander I'm Lookin'-Around Guy.
Willow What about you?
Buffy Giles loaded up the tranquilizer gun. We're going fishing.
Xander I feel good! Lovin' the swimmin'. Had some carrot juice this morning... A little wheat germ mixed in with it. Woke me right up. Nothin' like it, huh? Breakfast of state champions. You betcha. Okay. So... when do we get our next dose?
Sean What do you mean?
Xander Who's carrying? I need a little something to improve my performance. Give me an edge. Rrr!
Xander The steroids. Where are they?
Sean You're soakin' in it, bud.
Xander Huh?
Sean Aromatherapy. It's in the steam.
Nurse_Greenleigh This has *got* to stop, Carl. Those poor children.
Coach_Marin What, are you a quitter? We got no room for quitters on *this* team.
Nurse_Greenleigh Do you even understand what's happening? Listen to yourself.
Coach_Marin I'm very close to perfecting this. We just need to adjust the mix.
Nurse_Greenleigh Carl. You can't be thinking of continuing to expose these boys.
Coach_Marin They're gonna be the best. I don't accept anything less.
Nurse_Greenleigh They're gonna be monsters. Carl, please. Don't make it any worse. You've already lost three.
Coach_Marin Lost? Why, they're not lost.
Nurse_Greenleigh Carl! What are you doing?!
Coach_Marin I'm just lookin' after my boys. They may be out of the game right now, but they're still a team. And a team's gotta eat.
Nurse_Greenleigh Carl!
Coach_Marin You quitter.
Giles They're absorbing the steroid mixture through the steam.
Xander Not they. We. Me! We have to find an antidote, don't you think? The clock is ticking, people!
Buffy I wouldn't break out the tartar sauce just yet. I mean, it's not like you were exposed more than once. Twice?
Xander Three times a Fish Guy.
Buffy_and_Willow Oh...
Cordelia Whoa.
Xander What am I gonna do?
Cordelia You, you, you. What about me? It's one thing to be dating the lame unpopular guy, but it's another to be dating the creature from the Blue Lagoon.
Xander Black Lagoon. The creature from the Blue Lagoon was Brooke Shields. And thank you *so* much for your support!
Buffy I think we'd better find the rest of the swim team and lock them up before they get in touch with their inner halibut.
Giles Yes. Yes, good. Uh, we also need to know exactly what's in this, this steroid gas so that the hospital's toxicology lab can develop an antidote.
Willow Well, I'll talk to Nurse Greenleigh.
Buffy You're really getting into this interrogation thing.
Willow The trick is not to leave any marks.
Buffy On that note, I think I'm gonna go have a little talk with our coach. Somehow, I doubt all he's been giving these boys is inspiration.
Coach_Marin You got some imagination, missy.
Buffy Oh, well right now, I'm imagining you in jail. You're wearing a big, orange suit, and, oh, look, the guards are beating you up.
Coach_Marin You don't have any proof.
Buffy Tell me what's in the steam.
Coach_Marin After the fall of the Soviet Union, documents came into light detailing experiments with fish DNA on their Olympic swimmers. Tarpon... mako, shark... But they couldn't crack it.
Buffy And you did... sort of. Why?
Coach_Marin What kind of question is that? For the win! To make my team the best they could be! Do you understand we have a shot at the state championship?
Buffy Do you understand that I don't care? It's over. There's not gonna be any swim team.
Coach_Marin Boy, when they were handin' out school spirit, you didn't even stand in line, did you?
Buffy No. I was in the line for shred of sanity.
Buffy Which you obviously skipped.
Coach_Marin Get in the hole!
Coach_Marin In! Now!
Buffy This isn't over.
Coach_Marin In!
Coach_Marin You think I don't care about my boys. But I do. They count on me.
Buffy So, what, you're just gonna feed me to 'em?
Coach_Marin Oh, they've already had their dinner. But boys have other needs.
Cordelia No one. Willow and Giles must've rounded up the rest of the swim team.
Xander Does my neck look scaly to you?
Cordelia Well, of course it looks scaly, the way you've been rubbing it dry like an idiot.
Xander I need to look in a mirror. Wait here. But feel free to come in if you hear me scream.
Cordelia Any gills yet?
Cordelia Xander, what are you doing? Xander?
Cordelia Oh, my God! Xander!
Cordelia It's me, Cordelia? I know you can't answer me, but... God, this is all my fault. You joined the swim team to impress me. You were so courageous. And you looked really hot in those Speedo's. And I want you to know that I still care about you, no matter what you look like. And... and we can still date. Or, or not. I mean... I understand if you wanna see other fish. I'll do everything I can to make your quality of life better. Whether that means little bath toys or whatever.
Xander Uh, Cordy?
Xander That's not me.
Cordelia Oh, my God!
Giles I-in you go.
Giles Stay calm, chaps. Either we'll find an effective antidote, or, or, uh... S-stay calm.
Willow Everyone's accounted for except Sean.
Cordelia I think we can safely say we've found Sean. He was in the pool skinless-dipping.
Xander Where's Buffy?
Willow She hasn't come back yet.
Buffy Great. This is just what my reputation needs: that I did it with the entire swim team.
Xander What's up, coach?
Coach_Marin Oh! Harris. Uh... how you feelin'?
Xander Little dry. Nothing a lemon butter sauce won't cure.
Xander Where's Buffy?
Xander Buffy, hurry! Your hand!
Xander Hold on!
Buffy Pull!
Xander Hold on!
Buffy Thanks.
Xander Just doin' my part for our team.
Buffy Oh!
Coach_Marin Don't let go! Don't let go of me! Hold me!
Buffy Grab my hand!
Coach_Marin Boys! Boys, uh, now, now, boys! No! I...
Coach_Marin No, boys!
Buffy Those boys really love their coach.
Xander Let's see. I gotta take a make-up chem test at three. And then I'm meetin' some of the guys for plasma transfusions at five. It's turned into quite the busy afternoon.
Buffy The fun never stops with you, does it?
Willow Giles seems pretty confident that the treatments are gonna work.
Xander Well, turning into a creepy-crawly wasn't on my top ten list of things to do before I turn twenty.
Cordelia I want you to know that you've really proven yourself to me. And you don't have to join the new team next year if you don't want. I'd be just as happy if you played football.
Giles The... people from animal control have just left. Our creatures have apparently made a, a dash for it. Um... so to speak.
Willow Does that mean we're gonna have to hunt them again?
Buffy No, I don't think so. I don't think we'll be seeing them anymore.
Giles Where do you think they'll go?
Buffy Home.
