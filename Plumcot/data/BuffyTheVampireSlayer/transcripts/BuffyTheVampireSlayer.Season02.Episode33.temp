Angelus There's moments in your life that make you, that set the course of who you're gonna be. Sometimes they're little, subtle moments. Sometimes... they're not. I'll show you what I mean.
Angel We'll be back when we've found a bit more cash money! Keep the girls warm!
Angel's_friend Let's go.
Angel Come on. We'll sneak in and take some of me father's silver. He'll never miss it. He eats with his hands, the pig.
Angel Ah. Why don't you rest right here.
Angel So, I'd ask myself... What's a lady of your station doing alone in an alley with the reputation that this one has?
Darla Maybe she's lonely.
Angel In that case, I'd offer myself as escort to protect you from harm and to while away the dull hours.
Darla You're very gracious.
Angel Hm. It's often been said.
Darla Are you certain you're up to the challenge?
Angel Milady, you'll find that with the exception of an honest day's work, there's no challenge I'm not prepared to face.
Angel Oh... But you're a pretty thing. Where are you from?
Darla Around. Everywhere.
Angel I never been anywhere myself. Always wanted to see the world, but...
Darla I could show you.
Angel Could you, then?
Darla Things you've never seen, never even heard of.
Angel Sounds exciting.
Darla It is. And frightening.
Angel I'm not afraid. Show me. Show me your world.
Darla Close your eyes.
Buffy Nice try.
Buffy I want you to get a message to Angel for me. Tell him I'm done waiting. I'm taking the fight to him.
Buffy You got that? Need me to write it down for you?
Buffy Alright, I'll tell him myself.
Xander I'm good. Don't worry about me.
Buffy You know, you don't have to patrol with me.
Xander I had that guy under control until he resorted to fisticuffs. Oh! What is that, um... five vampires in three nights?
Buffy Yep. But no Angel.
Xander Are you, uh, really that anxious to come up against him?
Buffy I want it over with.
Xander I hear that.
Buffy Oh, we better go. I haven't even started studying for finals yet.
Xander Oh, yeah, finals! Why didn't you let me die?
Buffy Ah, look on the bright side. It'll all be over soon.
Angelus Yes, my love. It will.
Doug Careful, now. Concentrate in this area. There you go.
Giles Hello?
Doug Rupert Giles?
Giles Yes.
Doug Doug Perren. Thanks for coming.
Giles Oh, not at all. It's... flattered to be asked.
Doug I spoke with Lou Tabor at the Washington Institute, and he told me we had the best authority on obscure relics right here in Sunnydale.
Giles Oh... He may have, uh, exaggerated a little. Ah, is this the...
Doug This is our baby. Construction workers dug it up outside of town. Don't have a clue what it is. Any ideas?
Giles A few. None I'd care to share until I can verify. You have, uh, carbon dated it?
Doug The results'll be back in a couple of days. I'll go out on a limb and say old.
Giles Um, yes, it, it certainly... predates any, uh... settlements we've read about. Um, may, may I?
Doug Yeah. Sure.
Giles I assume you've, uh, you haven't tried to open it.
Doug Open it?
Doug Ah, I'll be damned. I figured it was solid. What do you think is in there?
Giles I don't know.
Doug Well... I guess we won't know until we open it up.
Giles Yes, but could I ask, um... would you wait? I, uh... I'd like to work on translating the text. It-it-it might give us an indication of... what we'll find inside.
Doug You don't want to be surprised?
Giles A-as a rule, no.
Doug Alright. You're the expert. But I'm pretty damn curious, though.
Giles Yes. Yes, so am I.
Xander Tell Angel I'm gonna kill him! No, wait. I'm gonna kill you!
Xander Die! Die! Die!
Xander Aah! Mother!
Cordelia Is that it?
Xander Yeah. That's it. Scene!
Buffy That's exactly how it happened.
Oz Well, I thought it was riveting. Uh, I was a little unclear about some of the themes.
Buffy The theme is Angel's too much of a coward to take me on face-to-face.
Xander And the other theme was 'Buy American', but it, uh, got kind of buried.
Willow Do you think you're ready to fight Angel?
Buffy I wish people would stop asking me that. Yes, I'm ready. I'm also willing and able. Just the one test I might actually pass.
Willow Don't say that! You're gonna pass everything. I will get you through this semester if I have to sweat blood.
Xander Do you think you're likely to? 'Cause I'd like to be elsewhere.
Willow It was only metaphor blood.
Oz I think you'd sweat cute blood.
Willow Sixth period, after my computer class, we'll rock on chemistry.
Buffy Ready to rock.
Cordelia Boy, Willow, you've really got the teaching bug: taking over computer class, tutoring...
Willow I love it. I really do.
Cordelia I think it's great to do that before you go out and fail in the real world. That way you're not falling back on something. You're falling... well, forward.
Xander And almost sixty-five percent of that was actual compliment. Is that a personal best?
Cordelia Gee, Xander, what are you gonna teach when you fail in life? Advanced loser-being?
Xander I will teach... zee Language of Love!
Cordelia Don't touch me! You have fish hands!
Xander Come, let me caress you!
Cordelia Stop it!
Xander Let me in!
Cordelia No! Don't!
Snyder That's enough of that. And you! Are we having a chair shortage?
Willow I didn't read anything about... Oh. I get it.
Snyder These public displays of affection are not acceptable in my school. This isn't an orgy, people. It's a classroom.
Buffy Yeah! Where they teach lunch.
Snyder Just give me a reason to kick you out, Summers. Just give me a reason.
Cordelia How about because you're a tiny, impotent Nazi with a bug up his butt the size of an emu?
Buffy Sums it up.
Cordelia Don't you think?
Willow Do you wanna come by my house tonight and study, too?
Buffy Maybe. I-I do have to patrol.
Willow Again? Do you really expect Angel to turn up tonight?
Buffy No, I don't expect him to. But that's usually when he does.
Drusilla Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
Drusilla It's been two days since my last confession. Father?
Angelus That's not very long.
Drusilla Oh, Father, I'm so afraid.
Angelus The Lord is very forgiving. Tell me your sins.
Drusilla I had... I've been seeing again, Father. Yesterday, the men were going to work in the mine. I had... a terrible fright. My stomach all tied up, and I saw this horrible... crash. My mummy said to keep my peace, it didn't mean nothing. But this morning... they had a cave-in. Two men died.
Angelus Go on.
Drusilla Me mum says... I'm cursed. My seeing things is an affront to the Lord, that only he's supposed to see anything before it happens. But I don't mean to, Father, I swear! I swear! I try to be pure in his sight. I don't want to be an evil thing.
Angelus Oh, hush, child. The Lord has a plan for all creatures. Even a Devil child like you.
Drusilla A Devil?
Angelus Yes! You're a spawn of Satan. All the Hail Marys in the world aren't going to help. The Lord will use you and smite you down. He's like that.
Drusilla What can I do?
Angelus Fulfill his plan, child. Be evil. Just give in.
Drusilla No! I want to be good. I want to be pure.
Angelus We all do, at first. The world doesn't work that way.
Drusilla Father... I beg you... Please... Please, help me.
Angelus Very well. Ten Our Fathers and an Act of Contrition. Does that sound good?
Drusilla Yes. Yes, Father. Thank you.
Angelus The pleasure was mine. And my child...
Drusilla Yes?
Angelus God is watching you.
Spike Nice walk, pet?
Drusilla I met an old man. Didn't like him. He got stuck in my teeth. But then the Moon started whispering to me... All sorts of dreadful things.
Angelus Well, what did it say?
Spike Oh. Look who's awake.
Angelus What did the Moon tell you? Did you have a vision? Is something coming?
Drusilla Oh, yeah. Something terrible. Psst, psst, psst, psst, psst, psst...
Angelus Where?
Drusilla At the museum. A tomb... with a surprise inside.
Angelus You can see all that in your head?
Spike No, you ninny. She read it in the morning paper.
Angelus Oh, my.
Drusilla That's what's been whispering to me. Sh.
Angelus Oh, yeah. Don't worry, though. Soon it'll stop. Soon it'll scream.
Buffy Waah! This doesn't make any sense.
Willow Well, sure it does. See... Oh, no, this doesn't make any sense.
Buffy It's senseless.
Willow It is, but at least you know that, so you're learning.
Buffy Yay me. Well, it doesn't matter anyway. I mean, when in the real world am I ever gonna need chemistry or history or math or the English language?
Willow Okay. I see your problem.
Buffy I'm a moron?
Willow Will you stop that? You're not stupid! You've just had a lot on your mind. You can learn this real easily, but if you're just gonna give up, then don't waste my time.
Buffy Wow. You really *are* a good teacher.
Willow Okay. Look at this. A covalent bond, which means these two atoms are linked by this...
Buffy Ohh! Hold that thought.
Buffy Okay. I'm Learn Girl.
Willow Okay. So, see here...
Buffy Deja vu.
Willow Really?
Buffy Yeah. I have this perfect memory of the pencil and...
Buffy Oh, hey. You dropped this.
Willow It's not mine. It might be something of Ms. Calendar's.
Buffy This feels kinda morbid.
Willow I've gone through most of her files already.
Buffy Does that make it *less* morbid or you *really* morbid?
Willow I had to, to teach her class.
Buffy Relax, Will. I was making with the funny.
Buffy Does that say 'restoration'?
Willow It's one of her spells, I think. Ms. Calendar wasn't a practicing witch, but she did dabble...
Buffy Willow...
Willow Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
Elder_Woman Nici mort, nici de-al fiintei, Te invoc, spirit al trecerii. Reda trupului ce separa omul de animal!
Translation Neither dead, nor of the living, I invoke you, spirit of the passing. Return to the body what distinguishes Man from the beast!
Elder_Woman Asa sa fie.
Translation So it shall be.
Elder_Woman Utrespur aceastui.
Translation Restore this one.
Gypsy_Man It hurts, yes? Good. It will hurt more.
Angel Where am I?
Gypsy_Man You don't remember... everything you've done for a hundred years. In a moment, you will. The face of everyone you killed... our daughter's face... they will haunt you, and you will know what true suffering is.
Angel Killed? I, I don't...
Angel No...
Angel No... No... No...
Giles What are you saying?
Buffy The curse. This is it.
Willow Looks like Ms. Calendar was trying to replicate the original curse. To restore Angel's soul again.
Giles She said it couldn't be done.
Buffy Well, she tried anyway. And it looks like it might have worked.
Xander So he killed her... before she could tell anyone about it. What a prince, huh?
Cordelia This is good, right? I mean, we can curse him again.
Giles Um, well, this, um... certainly points the way, but... the ritual itself requires a greater knowledge of the black arts than I, I, I can claim.
Willow Well, I've been going through her files and, and researching the black arts, for fun, or educational fun, and I may be able to work this.
Giles W-Willow... channeling... such potent magicks through yourself, it could open a door that you may not be able to close.
Buffy I don't want you putting yourself in any danger, Will.
Willow And I don't want danger. Big 'no' to danger, but I may be the best person to do this.
Xander Hi! For those of you who have just tuned in, everyone here is a crazy person. So this spell might restore Angel's humanity? Well, here's an interesting angle. Who cares?
Buffy I care.
Xander Is that right.
Giles Let's not lose our perspective here, Xander.
Xander I'm Perspective Guy. Angel's a killer.
Willow Xander...
Buffy It's not that simple.
Xander What? All is forgiven? I can't believe you people!
Cordelia Xander has a point.
Xander You know, just for once, I wish you'd support me, and I realize right now that you were, and I'm embarrassed, so I'm gonna get back to the point, which is that Angel needs to die.
Giles Curing Angel seems to have been Jenny's last wish.
Xander Yeah? Well, Jenny's dead.
Giles Don't you *ever* speak of her in that tone again!
Xander Can't you hear what I'm saying?
Buffy Stop it! Stop it!
Willow What do you wanna do?
Buffy I-I don't know. What happened to Angel wasn't his fault.
Xander Yeah, but what happened to Ms. Calendar is.
Xander You can paint this any way you want. But the way I see it is that you wanna forget all about Ms. Calendar's murder so you can get your boyfriend back.
Doug Hello?
Angelus I'll have one of these to go.
Angelus Dru...
Angelus Save me some.
Buffy Well, I'll do a couple of sweeps, and then I'll stop by. Yeah, Xander was pretty much being a... Willow! Where did you learn that word? My God. You kiss your mother with that mouth?
Buffy I don't know. I don't know what I wanna do.
Buffy I'll, I'll see you in a little while, okay?
Buffy You know, polite people call before they jump out of the bushes and attack you.
Kendra Just wanted to test your reflexes.
Buffy How about testing my face-punching? 'Cause I think you'll find it's improved.
Kendra I was on my way to your house. Saw you walking. Couldn't help meself.
Buffy Which begs the question, and don't think I'm not glad to see you, but, why are you here? Oh, wait. No, let me guess. Your watcher informed you dat a very dark power is about to rise in Sunnydale.
Kendra Dat's about it.
Buffy Great. So, you have any idea what this dark power is?
Spike It's a big rock. I can't wait to tell my friends. They don't have a rock this big.
Angelus Spike, boy, you never did learn your history.
Spike Let's have a lesson, then.
Angelus Acathla the demon came forth to swallow the world. He was killed by a virtuous knight who pierced the demon's heart before he could draw a breath to perform the act. Acathla turned to stone, as demons sometimes do, and was buried where neither man nor demon would want to look. Unless of course they're putting up low-rent housing. Boys...
Drusilla He fills my head. I can't hear anything else.
Spike Let me guess. Someone pulls out the sword...
Angelus Someone worthy...
Spike Mm. The demon wakes up, and wackiness ensues.
Drusilla He will swallow the world.
Angelus And every creature living on this planet will go to Hell.
Angelus My friends... we're about to make history... end.
Giles I've been on the phone to the museum. The artifact in question is missing, and the curator has been murdered. Vampires.
Buffy And you're sure this was the tomb of Alfalfa?
Giles Acathla. And yes, the information provided by Kendra's Watcher seems conclusive.
Willow Okay, somebody explain the whole 'he will suck the world into Hell' thing, because that's the part I'm not loving.
Giles Well, the, uh, the Demon Universe exists in a dimension separate from our own. With one breath, Acathla will create a vortex, a-a kind of, um... whirlpool that will pull everything on Earth into that dimension, where any non-demon life will suffer horrible and... eternal torment.
Buffy So that would be the literal kind of 'sucked into Hell'. Neat. Willow, I think you should try the curse.
Kendra I tend to side with your friend Xander on this one. Angel should be eliminated.
Buffy Oh, I'll fight him. I'll kill him if I have to. But if I don't get there in time, or if I lose, then Willow might be our only hope.
Willow I don't *wanna* be our only hope! Uh, I crumble under pressure! Let's have another hope.
Kendra We have. Blessed by the knight who first slew the demon. If all else fails, this might stop it. I tink.
Giles Ooh. May I? May I? Thank you. Well, l-let's, uh, hope all else doesn't fail. Um, how close are you to f-figuring out the ritual of the curse?
Willow I need about a day, and... an 'Orb of Thesulah'? Whatever that is.
Giles Spirit vault for rituals of the undead. I've got one. I-I've been using it as a... paperweight.
Willow This means I can't help you study for tomorrow's final.
Buffy Ah, I'll wing it. Of course, if we go to Hell by then, I won't have to take 'em. Or maybe I'll be taking them forever.
Giles Angel has a ritual of his own to perform before he can remove the sword and awaken Acathla. With any luck, it should take some time.
Drusilla Spike?
Drusilla Spike, my sweet! The fun's about to begin.
Angelus I will drink... the blood will wash in me, over me, and I will be cleansed. I will be worthy to free Acathla. Bear witness... as I ascend... as I become.
Angelus Everything that I am, everything that I have done, has led me here.
Whistler God, are you disgusting.
Whistler This is really an unforgettable smell. This is the stench of death you're giving off here. And the look says, uh... Crazy Homeless Guy. It's not good.
Angel Get away from me.
Whistler What are you gonna do, bite me? Horrors! A vampire!
Whistler Ah, but you wouldn't bite me on account of your poor, tortured soul. It's so sad, a vampire with a soul. It's so poignant.
Angel Who are you?
Whistler Let's take a walk.
Whistler What are you eating? Like, a rat once a month?
Whistler Hey! Look, you're skin and bones here! Butcher shops are throwing away more blood in a day than you could stand. Good blood. You lived in the world a little bit, you'd know that.
Angel I wanna know who you are.
Whistler And I wanna know who *you* are.
Angel You already do.
Whistler Not yet. But I'm looking to find out. 'Cause you could go either way here.
Angel I don't understand you.
Whistler Nobody understands me. That's my curse.
Whistler Dog me. Mustard.
Whistler My name's Whistler.
Vendor Here you go.
Whistler Thanks. Anyway, lately it is. Mm.
Angel You're not a vampire.
Whistler A demon... technically. I mean, I'm not a bad guy. Not all demons are dedicated to the destruction of all life.
Angel Whadaya mean, I can go either way?
Whistler I mean that you can become an even more useless rodent than you already are, or you can become someone. A person. Someone to be counted.
Angel I just wanna be left alone.
Whistler Well, yeah, you've been left alone for, what, ninety years already. And what a package you are. The Stink Guy!
Angel What do you want from me?
Whistler I want you to see something.
Whistler We'd have to leave now. You see, and then you tell me what you wanna do.
Angel Where is it?
Buffy So I'm like, 'Dad, do you want me to go to the dance in an outfit I've already worn? Why do you hate me?'
Girl#1 Is Tyler taking you?
Buffy Where were you when I got over Tyler? He's of the past. Tyler would have to crawl on his hands and knees to get me to go to the dance with him. Which, actually, he's supposed to do after practice, so I'm gonna wait.
Girl#1 Okay. See ya later.
Girl#2 Bye!
Buffy Call me!
Girl#1 Okay!
Buffy Call me! Call me!
Girl#3 I will!
Watcher Buffy Summers?
Buffy Yeah? Hi! What?
Watcher I need to speak with you.
Buffy You're not from Bullock's, are you? 'Cause I-I meant to pay for that lipstick.
Watcher There isn't much time. You must come with me. Your destiny awaits.
Buffy I don't have a destiny. I'm destiny-free, really.
Watcher Yes, you have. You are the Chosen One. You alone can stop them.
Buffy Who?
Watcher The vampires.
Buffy Huh?
Buffy Oof!
Buffy Oh, God...
Buffy Oh, God... Oh... Oh, God... Unh!
Buffy Oh! Not the heart!
Watcher You see? You see your power?
Joyce Why didn't you call?
Buffy I'm sorry. I-I didn't know it was so late. Tyler and I were talking.
Joyce That boy is irresponsible.
Buffy No, mom. It's not his fault.
Joyce You know we worry, that's all.
Joyce Dinner's in ten minutes.
Buffy Yeah.
Hank Did she say where she was?
Joyce She was with Tyler.
Hank I don't want her seeing him anymore, period!
Joyce You're overreacting, dear.
Hank Don't do that! Don't talk to me like I'm a kid!
Joyce I don't! Just forget it!
Hank Just because you can't discipline her, I have to be the ogre!
Joyce I am not having this conversation again! Alright?
Whistler She's gonna have it tough, that Slayer. She's just a kid. The world's full of big, bad things.
Angel I wanna help her. I want... I wanna become someone.
Whistler God, jeez, look at you. She must be prettier than the last Slayer. This isn't gonna be easy. The more you live in this world, the more you see how apart from it you really are. And this is dangerous work. Right now, you couldn't go three rounds with a fruit fly!
Angel I wanna learn from you.
Whistler Alright.
Angel But I don't wanna dress like you.
Whistler Again, you're annoying me. You're lucky we need you on our side.
Angelus I have strayed, I have been lost. But Acathla redeems me. With this act, we will be free.
Spike Someone wasn't worthy.
Angelus Damn it!
Drusilla This is so... disappointing!
Angelus There must be something I missed. The incantations, the blood... I don't know!
Drusilla What are we going to do?
Angelus What we always do in a time of trouble: turn to an old friend.
Angelus We'll have our Armageddon. I swear!
Vampire Tonight... Sundown... At the graveyard...
Teacher Excuse me...
Vampire You will come to him. You will come to him or more will die.
Vampire Tonight!
Vampire His hour is at hand!
Buffy She said more would die. I have to go.
Kendra Den I should go wit you.
Buffy No. I need you here just in case. I can take care of myself. And look, as long as Angel's fighting me, then he can't do this end-of-the-world ritual thingy, and that's a good. Will, what do you think?
Willow I just want to cross-check...
Buffy We don't have time. If this is gonna work, it has to work now.
Willow Okay. Then I need maybe half an hour once we're all set up.
Giles Which means you just have to hold Angel off. Don't let him close on you. If the curse succeeds, you'll, you'll know.
Cordelia Why don't you just wait here to find out if it worked, see if he phones you?
Buffy I can't risk him killing any more people. I better go.
Xander Be careful.
Buffy I will.
Kendra Here...
Kendra In case de curse does not succeed, dis is my lucky stake. I have killed many vampires wit it. I call it Mr. Pointy.
Buffy You named your stake?
Kendra Yes.
Buffy Remind me to get you a stuffed animal.
Buffy Thanks.
Kendra Watch your back.
Angelus Hello, lover. I wasn't sure you'd come.
Buffy After your immolation-o-gram? Come on, I had to show. Shouldn't you be out destroying the world right now, pulling the sword out of Al Franken or whatever his name is?
Angelus There's time enough. I wanted to say goodbye first. You are the one thing in this dimension I will miss.
Buffy This is a beautiful moment we're having. Can we please fight?
Angelus I didn't come here to fight.
Buffy No?
Angelus Gosh, I was hoping we could get back together. What do you think? Do we have a shot? Alright. We'll fight.
Giles Quod perditum est, invenietur.
Translation What is lost, return.
Willow 'Not dead nor not of the living. Spirits of the interregnum I call...'
Buffy Come on, Willow.
Willow 'Let him know the pain of humanity, gods. Reach your wizened hands to me. Give me the sword...'
Giles Get out! Go!
Xander Go!
Angelus Jeez, is it me, or is your heart not in this?
Angelus Maybe I'll just go home, destroy the world.
Buffy Well, I think Mr. Pointy'll have something to say about that. Come on. Let's finish this. You and me.
Angelus Y-you never learn, do you? This wasn't about you. This was never about you.
Angelus And you fall for it every single time!
Drusilla Enough.
Drusilla Look at me, Dearie.
Drusilla Be... in my eyes. Be... in me.
Drusilla Night-night.
Drusilla Let's get what we came for, dears.
Whistler Bottom line is, even if you see 'em coming, you're not ready for the big moments.
Whistler No one asks for their life to change, not really. But it does.
Whistler So what are we, helpless? Puppets? No. The big moments are gonna come. You can't help that. It's what you do afterwards that counts. That's when you find out who you are.
Officer Freeze!
Whistler You'll see what I mean.
