Buffy Mom?
Joyce Oh! Buffy.
Joyce Um . . .
Buffy Sorry.
Joyce No, no. Don't worry about it. I-I guess I just got used to all the quiet while you were gone. But it's no problem.
Joyce Uh, look! It's, uh, Nigerian. We got a very exciting shipment in at the Gallery. I, um, thought I'd hang a few pieces in here. It cheers up the room.
Buffy It's angry at the room, Mom. It wants the room to suffer.
Joyce You have no appreciation of primitive art. You going out?
Buffy Oh. Um . . . well, i-if it's okay. I, um . . . I'd like to find Willow and Xander.
Joyce Will you be slaying?
Buffy Only if they give me lip.
Joyce Uh, can I make you a sandwich or something before you go? You must be starving.
Buffy I was un-until that four-course snack you served me after dinner.
Joyce Well, then, um . . . You know, w-why don't I drive you? Uh, I mean, they could be anywhere.
Buffy Mom . . . if you don't want me to go, just say so.
Joyce No, no. I-I just want to put this whole thing behind us, get back to normal. You go. Have a good time.
Buffy Okay.
Buffy Didn't anyone ever warn you about playing with pointy sticks? It's all fun and games until somebody loses an eye.
Xander You shouldn't sneak up on people like that!
Xander Jeez, Buff!
Cordelia Come in, Nighthawk! Everything okay?
Buffy Nighthawk?
Buffy Ooh!
Cordelia Oh, hey, Buffy.
Buffy Hey, guys.
Buffy You know, Imaybe it's too late. Maybe we should just come back tomorrow.
Buffy What if he's mad?
Xander Mad? Just because you ran away and abandoned your post and your friends and your mom and made him lay awake every night worrying about you? Maybe we should wait out here.
Xander Check it out. The Watcher is back on the clock. And just when you were thinking career change, maybe becoming a . . . a looker or a . . . a seer.
Giles Thank you, Xander.
Giles Welcome home, Buffy.
Buffy I got in a few hours ago, but I wanted to go see my mom first.
Giles Yes. Yes, of course. How, how did you find her?
Buffy Well, I pretty much remembered the address.
Giles Ah, eh, I mean, uh . . .
Giles How are things between you? Ah. Excuse me.
Oz Hey, so you're not wanted for murder anymore.
Buffy Good. That was such a drag.
Xander So where were you? Did you go to Belgium?
Buffy Why would I go to Belgium?
Xander I think the relevant question is why wouldn't you? Belgium!
Buffy What about you, Xander? What's up with you?
Xander Oh, you know, same old, same old.
Cordelia Hardly.
Xander Okay, I lied, a whole lot is new.
Buffy Well, that's good, isn't it? New is good.
Xander Oh, yeah, absolutely, except for the obvious. It's not too much . . .
Cordelia Yeah, 'cause you weren't at the hotel.
Xander Cordelia's parents dragged her onto a luxury vacation.
Buffy I feel for you.
Giles Here we are then. Cheer us up.
Cordelia So were you, like, living in a box, or what?
Buffy Well, it's a long story.
Xander So skip the heartwarming stuff about kindly old people and saving the farm and get right to the dirt.
Giles Perhaps Buffy could use a little time to adjust before we grill her on her summer activities.
Buffy What he said.
Xander Fair enough. In fact, you can leave the slaying to us while you settle in. We got you covered.
Buffy I noticed. You guys seem down with the slayage, all tricked out with your walkies and everything.
Cordelia Yeah, but the outfits suck. This whole Rambo thing is so over. I'm thinking more sporty, like Hilfiger maybe.
Willow Still, we were getting good. We dusted nine out of ten.
Oz Six out of ten.
Willow Six out of ten.
Xander Whatever, we were kicking a little undead booty.
Buffy Well, thank you for the offer, but I think I just wanna get back to my normal routine. You know, school, slaying . . . kid's stuff. In fact, I'm jonesing for a little brainless fun. What are you doing tomorrow?
Xander Oh, I would, but, uh, I'm kind of tied up.
Cordelia You wish.
Buffy Will?
Willow Um, tomorrow I
Buffy Oh, come on. Friends don't let friends browse alone.
Willow Okay. I had some schoolwork, but . . . I can change my plans.
Giles As for school, Buffy, uh, you know you'll have to talk to Principal Snyder before
Buffy On it. Mom is making an appointment with His Ugliness. I know she can break him.
Snyder Absolutely not. Under no circumstances.
Joyce But you can't keep her out of school. You don't have the right.
Snyder I have not only the right, but also a nearly physical sensation of pleasure at the thought of keeping her out of school. I'd describe myself as tingly.
Joyce Buffy was cleared of all those charges.
Snyder Yes. And while she may live up to the not-a-murderer requirement for enrollment, she is a troublemaker, destructive to school property and the occasional student. And her grade point average is enough to . . . I'm sorry. Another tingle moment.
Joyce I don't see how you can be so cavalier about a young girl's entire future!
Snyder I'm quite sure that a girl with the talents and abilities of Buffy will land on her feet. In fact, I noticed as I came in this morning that Hot Dog on a Stick is hiring. You will look so cute in that hat.
Buffy Let's go, Mom.
Joyce This isn't over. If I have to, I'll go all the way to the Mayor.
Snyder Wouldn't that be interesting.
Joyce Don't worry about school, honey. If we can't get you back into Sunnydale, maybe we can swing private school.
Buffy Private school? You mean, like jackets and kilts? You want me to get field hockey knees?
Joyce It's not that bad.
Buffy What about home schooling? You know, it's not just for scary religious people anymore.
Joyce We'll work something out. Okay?
Joyce Say hi to Willow?
Pat Oh, my word! Oh, you must be Buffy! Look at you. Aren't you a picture?
Buffy Thank you.
Pat Oh, I'm Pat, from your mom's book club. I'm sure she mentioned me.
Buffy Actually
Pat I, um, I sort of took it upon myself to look after her while you were, you know, off and away or what have you, and . . .
Pat Well, between, uh, your situation and reading 'Deep End of the Ocean', she was, uh, she was just a wreck. You can imagine.
Pat Anyway, I'm off. We're-we're making empanadas in my Spanish class tonight. You go be with your mom. You two need to rebond.
Buffy Pat wishes us quality time.
Joyce Oh. I met her in a
Buffy Book club.
Joyce Yeah.
Buffy Got it.
Joyce Oh, uh, before I forget, uh, Willow just called.
Buffy Where was she?
Joyce Uh, she, she got held up, but she said she tried to call.
Buffy Was there a message?
Joyce No. But I had a thought. What if I invited Willow and Mr. Giles and everybody over for dinner tomorrow night? Don't you think that would be nice?
Joyce Since I sort of already did, I was hoping for a yes.
Buffy It'll be fun.
Joyce Great. Uh, do me a favor? Run down and get the company plates.
Buffy Mom, Willow and everybody aren't company-plate people. They're normal-plate people.
Joyce We never have guests for dinner. Indulge your mother?
Buffy Oh!
Buffy Eww.
Buffy Next time, I get to pick the mother-daughter bonding activity.
Joyce Do you wanna say something?
Buffy Like what? Thanks for stopping by and dying?
Joyce How about, um . . . good-bye, stray cat, who lost its way. We hope you find it.
Buffy I thought they'd be here.
Angel They are. They're waiting for you.
Buffy Am I dreaming?
Angel I'm probably the wrong person to ask. You'd better go.
Buffy I'm afraid.
Angel You should be.
Joyce I've been on the phone with the, uh, Superintendent of Schools. At least he seems more reasonable than that nasty little horrid, bigoted, rodent-man.
Buffy Mom . . .
Joyce Anyway, um, I'm going in to speak with him this afternoon. Uh, as for private schools, uh, Miss Porter's accepts late admissions.
Joyce I, uh, I wrote the information down for you.
Buffy A girls' school? So now it's jackets, kilts, and no boys? Care to throw in a little foot-binding?
Joyce Buffy, you made some bad choices. You just might have to live with some consequences.
Joyce Nothing's settled yet. I just wish you didn't have to be so secretive about things. I mean, it's not your fault you have a special circumstance. They should make allowances for you.
Buffy Mom, I'm a slayer. It's not like I need to ride a little bus to school.
Joyce Couldn't you just tell a few people, like Principal Snyder . . . and maybe the police?
Joyce I mean, I would think they would be happy to have a . . . a superhero.
Joyce Is that the right term? I mean, it's not offensive, is it?
Buffy Welcome to the Hellmouth Petting Zoo.
Giles Oh, my God, what a stench!
Buffy You know, I wanted Forest Pine or April Fresh, but Mom wanted Dead Cat.
Giles I'll, uh . . .
Giles Ugh! I'll get it back to the library, see if we can determine its exact origins.
Giles It's, uh . . . striking and . . . Nigerian.
Joyce Oh. Yes. I-I-I have this wonderful dealer who specializes in ancient artifacts, I don't know if you
Buffy You know, I love art talk as much as the next very dull person, but we have work to do, Giles. Research mode.
Giles Sh-sh-shouldn't you stay with your mother, perhaps, Buffy? I mean, you must have
Joyce Please, no. I, it's fine. She can go with you.
Giles A-actually, she can't. Um . . . you're not allowed on school property.
Buffy Oh.
Giles I'm sorry. Um, uh . . . I'll, I'll call as, as soon as I know something.
Joyce Oh, we'll see you tonight?
Giles Tonight, then. Yes.
Oz It looks dead. It smells dead. Yet it's movin' around. That's interesting.
Cordelia Nice pet, Giles. Don't you like anything regular? Golf, USA Today, or anything?
Giles I'm trying to find out how and why it rose from the grave. It's not as if I'm going to take it home and offer it a saucer of warm milk.
Oz Well, I like it. I think you should call it Patches.
Willow What about Buffy's welcome home dinner tonight? I had told her mom we'd help out. Bring stuff.
Cordelia I'm the dip.
Xander Uh, you gotta admire the purity of it.
Cordelia What? Onion dip. Stirring, *not* cooking. It's what I bring.
Oz We should figure out what kinda deal this is. I mean, is it a-a gathering, a shindig or a hootenanny?
Cordelia What's the difference?
Oz Well, a gathering is brie, mellow song stylings; shindig, dip, less mellow song stylings, perhaps a large amount of malt beverage; and hootenanny, well, it's chock full of hoot, just a little bit of nanny.
Xander Well, I hate brie.
Cordelia I know. It smells like Giles's cat.
Giles It's not my
Xander And what'll we talk about at a gathering anyway? 'So, Buffy, did you meet any nice pimps on your travels? And oh, by the by, thanks for ruining our lives for the past three months.'
Willow Xander . . .
Xander You know what I mean. She doesn't want to talk about it, we don't want to talk about it, so why don't we just shut up and dance?
Willow Well, Buffy said she did want to loosen up, you know, have some kid time. Aren't you guys rehearsing tonight? Why don't you play at the party?
Oz Yeah, I think I could supply some Dingo action.
Giles Uh, I-I'm not sure that, a, a, um . . . shindig . . .
Oz Hootenanny.
Giles H-hootenanny i-i-is really the order of the day. Uh, uh, it should . . . maybe something a little more intimate. I-I-I mean, Buffy has just got home. I'm, I'm sure she's still feeling a little disoriented.
Willow All the more reason to make her feel welcome, a-and a big party says, 'Welcome, Buffy.'
Xander Okay, so one vote from the Old Guy for a Smelly Cheese Night, and how many votes for actual fun, huh?
Giles Alright, alright. Have it your way. I'm just glad to have her home.
Giles Now things can get back to normal.
Pat Hey, there you are! Not thinking about any more flights of fancy, I hope.
Pat Joyce said there was room for one more, so I said forget facial night and let's party! I bet you like empanadas.
Buffy Do you want to see my mom?
Pat Please.
Buffy MOM!
Joyce Oh, Pat! Good. Buffy, I hope you don't mind.
Pat Hi! You look great!
Devon Hey, Buffy. So where do you want the band to set up?
Buffy Wh-the band?
Buffy Hey!
Willow Hey!
Lyrics You can send me a savior
Buffy This is large!
Willow You like?
Lyrics That lives till the end of time
Buffy Yeah. It's great. I-I was just sort of hoping it would be . . . us.
Lyrics Time
Willow Sorry. What?
Lyrics The promise of heaven
Buffy This is amazing, but I was sort of hoping we could just hang together, the gang.
Lyrics But that only leaves me dry
Lyrics Dry
Lyrics Too many saviors / And I won't die
Lyrics I never cried, but I needed more from you
Lyrics I found my life without you now
Lyrics And I never mind / I'm only half as blind
Buffy Is everything okay?
Lyrics Cause I needed more from you
Buffy You . . . You seem to be avoiding me, i-in the one-on-one sense.
Willow What?
Lyrics And I never mind
Willow This isn't avoiding. See? Here you are, here I am.
Lyrics I'm only half as blind
Buffy So we're cool?
Lyrics Cause I needed more from you
Willow Way! That's why, with the party, 'cause we're all glad you're back.
Buffy Okay.
Willow Okay. Good.
Lyrics You say my reflection never fades from your eyes
Lyrics I got another rope over me / But I won't hang / I can feel you covet my faith
Lyrics I said another lie / I know why / I don't wanna sway
Xander Hey, Buff, uh . . . what are you doing?
Buffy I was just taking a break from all this wacky fun.
Lyrics I don't wanna sway
Xander Some kind of party, huh? I guess a lot of people are glad to have you back.
Buffy It seems like people I didn't even know missed me.
Buffy Did Giles say he was going to be late?
Lyrics Seize these worlds / Or never live again
Xander Uh, he was Library Man last time I saw him. But he'll be here. He wants to celebrate your homecoming. We all do. I mean, it's great to have the Buffster back.
Lyrics Seize these worlds
Xander Isn't it?
Cordelia Totally!
Lyrics Or never live again
Cordelia Except you were kinda turning me on with that whole Boy Slayer look.
Xander Was I now?
Cordelia You bet, Nighthawk.
Buffy Well, I'll just be, uh . . . oh, yeah.
Doctor Breathe. Breathe.
Doctor Alright, look. These burns are too extensive. It's 7:43. Let's call it.
Nurse Oh, my God!
Lyrics You know I roll it over in my head
Lyrics I won't feel you covet my faith
Party_dude Hey, what's the deal with this party anyway?
Lyrics You've said another lie / I know why
Stoner This party? Heard it was for some chick that just got out of rehab.
Lyrics I don't wanna sway
Lyrics I don't wanna sway
Joyce Whew!
Lyrics Seize these worlds
Pat Now, how you holding up, Joyce, hmm? Really.
Lyrics Or never live again
Joyce Really? I'm . . . I don't know.
Lyrics Seize these worlds
Joyce While Buffy was gone, all I could think about was getting her home.
Lyrics Or never live again
Joyce I just knew that if I could put my arms around her and tell her how much I loved her, everything would be okay.
Lyrics Seize these worlds
Pat But?
Lyrics Or never live again
Joyce Having Buffy home, I-I thought it was gonna make it all better, but in some ways, it's almost worse.
Lyrics Seize these worlds / Or never live again
Giles Oh, Lord!
Stoner Party Villa, can I rock you?
Giles I-I-I need to speak with Buffy. Um, immediately! I have some information that is extremely important.
Lyrics Feeling I've been lost for years
Lyrics You can never understand me
Stoner Yeah! Fiesta foul! You gotta do a shot!
Lyrics Unless you've seen those tears
Giles I need to speak to Buffy! Now!
Stoner Bunny?
Lyrics But you never get to sleep
Stoner See? That guy's gotta do a shot.
Lyrics When I'm away
Giles Buffy!
Stoner Hey! I need to talk to a Buddy!
Lyrics I don't mind
Stoner Is there a Buddy here?
Lyrics The deeper that you lay
Stoner Sorry. He's not here. You got the wrong casa, Mr. Belvedere.
Lyrics Out of time / Pain, I can't sleep
Giles H-hello? Hello?
Willow You're leaving again?
Willow What, you just stopped by for your lint brush and now you're ready to go?
Buffy It's not like anyone will mind.
Willow Oh, no. Have a great time. Oh, oh, and don't forget to *not* write.
Buffy Why are you attacking me? I'm trying.
Willow Wow, and it looks so much like giving up!
Buffy I'm just trying to make things easier.
Willow For who?
Buffy You guys were doing just fine without me.
Willow We were doing the best we could! It's not like we had a lot of choice in the matter.
Buffy Sorry that I had to leave, but you don't know what I was going through.
Willow Well, I'd like to.
Buffy You wouldn't understand.
Willow Well, maybe I don't need to understand. Maybe I . . . I just need you to talk to me.
Buffy How could I talk to you when you were avoiding me?
Willow This isn't easy, Buffy! I know you're going through stuff, but . . . so am I.
Buffy I know that you were worried about me, but
Willow No! I don't just mean that. I mean, my life! You know? I, um . . . I'm having all sorts ofI'm dating, I'm having serious dating with a *werewolf*, a-and I'm studying witchcraft and killing vampires, and I didn't have anyone to talk to about all this scary life stuff. And you were my best friend.
Giles Unbelievable. 'Do you like my mask? Isn't it pretty? It raises the *dead*!' Americans.
Giles Jesus!
Giles My God.
Giles Are you alright?
Giles Are you hurt?
Giles Good God.
Buffy You have no idea how much I missed you. Everyone. I wanted to call every day.
Willow That doesn't matter, Buffy. It doesn't make it okay that you didn't.
Joyce What is this? Is this some sort of a joke?
Buffy Mom, please, could you, could you just
Joyce No, I can't just! Buffy, what is this?
Willow She was running away again.
Buffy No, I wasn't. I'm not sure.
Joyce Well, you better *get* sure and explain yourself right away! If you think you can just-just take off any time you feel like it
Buffy Stop it! Please! I don't know. I don't know what I'm doing.
Joyce Don't you leave this house, young lady!
Joyce You know what? That's it.
Joyce You and I are going to have a talk.
Buffy Mom, please
Joyce You know what? I don't care. I don't care what your friends think of me, or you for that matter, because you put me through the wringer, Buffy. I mean it. And I've had schnapps. Do you have *any* idea what it's been like?
Buffy Mom, this isn't the time
Joyce You can't imagine *months* of not knowing. Not knowing whether you're lying dead in a ditch somewhere or, I don't know, living it up
Buffy But you told me! You're the one who said I should go. You said if I leave this house, don't come back. You found out who I really was, and you couldn't deal. Don't you remember?
Joyce Buffy, you didn't give me time. You just dumped this thing on me and you expected me to get it. Well, guess what? Mom's not perfect, okay? I handled it badly. But that doesn't give you the right to punish me by running away.
Buffy Punish you? I didn't do this to punish you!
Xander Well, you did. You should've seen what you put her through.
Buffy Great. Thanks. Anybody else want to weigh in here? How about you by the dip?
Jonathon No, thanks. I'm good.
Xander You know, maybe you don't want to hear it, Buffy, but taking off like you did was incredibly selfish and stupid.
Buffy Okay! Okay. I screwed up. I know this. But you have no idea! You have, you have no idea what happened to me or what I was feeling!
Xander Did you even try talking to anybody?
Buffy There was nothing that anybody could do. Okay? I just had to deal with this on my own.
Xander Yeah, and you see how well *that* one worked out. You can't just bury stuff, Buffy. It'll come right back up to get you.
Giles Oh, good show, Giles.
Giles Like riding a bloody bicycle!
Buffy As if I even could've gone to you, Xander. You made your feelings about Angel and I perfectly clear.
Xander Look. I'm sorry that your honey was a demon, but most girls don't hop a Greyhound over boy troubles.
Cordelia Time out, Xander. Put yourself in Buffy's shoes for just a minute. Okay? I'm Buffy, freak of nature, right? Naturally I pick a freak for a boyfriend, and then he turns into Mr. Killing Spree, which is pretty much my fault
Buffy Cordy! Get outta my shoes!
Cordelia I'm just trying to help, Buffy.
Willow Buffy, you never
Buffy Willow, please. I can't take this from you, too.
Xander Let her finish! You at least owe her that.
Buffy God, Xander! Do you think you could at least stick to annoying me on your own behalf?
Xander Fine! You stop acting like an idiot, I'll stop annoying you!
Buffy Oh, you wanna talk acting like an idiot, Nighthawk?
Oz Okay. I'm gonna step in now, being Referee Guy.
Willow No, let them go, Oz. Talking about it isn't helping. We might as well try some violence.
Willow I was being sarcastic!
Buffy Xander, kitchen!
Xander I got your back!
Joyce Are these vampires?
Buffy Uh, I don't think so.
Willow Buffy, heads up!
Buffy No, not vampires.
Xander Man, this sucker wobbles, but he won't fall down!
Buffy We got to get 'em back outside!
Joyce On three!
Joyce One . . . Two . . . Three!
Buffy Okay! We're gonna have to barricade this door!
Buffy We need some help out here!
Xander I got him. Go help Buffy.
Oz Grab that table!
Buffy Upstairs!
Joyce Oh, Pat!
Joyce Oh, God . . .
Buffy Careful!
Pat Oh . . .
Xander Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.
Joyce I got you. Okay.
Cordelia Oz!
Oz GO! GO!
Willow She's
Joyce Oh, God! Pat! She's dead!
Joyce What do we do if they get in?
Xander I kind of think we die.
Cordelia I don't hear anything. Should we check?
Oz Let's go for it.
Cordelia Here.
Oz Thanks.
Giles Cordelia, it's me! It's me!
Cordelia How do we know it's really you and not zombie Giles?
Giles Cordelia, do stop being tiresome.
Cordelia It's him.
Oz I think the Dead Man's Party's moved upstairs.
Giles That makes sense. It's the mask in Joyce's bedroom they're after.
Cordelia Mask?
Giles The mask holds the power of a . . . zombie demon, called Ovu MobaniEvil Eye. I don't think we can get past them.
Oz Well, what happens if they get the mask?
Giles If one of them puts it on, they become the demon incarnate.
Cordelia Worse than a zombie.
Giles Yes, worse.
Joyce Oh, God! We thought you were
Xander Generally speaking, when scary things get scared: not good.
Mobani I live, you die.
Buffy Willow, don't look!
Giles Out back!
Buffy Not looking.
Buffy Not looking!
Giles Tell Buffy Mobani's power lies in his eyes!
Giles She has to go for the eyes to defeat him!
Oz Buffy!
Buffy Hey, Pat!
Buffy Made you look.
Oz Never mind.
Joyce Honey!
Joyce Oh!
Joyce Are you all right?
Buffy Yeah.
Joyce So, is this a typical day at the office?
Buffy No. This was nothing.
Xander Nice moves.
Buffy You, too.
Snyder Do we have an appointment?
Giles I'd like to have a word with you.
Snyder If that word is Buffy, then I have two words for you: 'good' and 'riddance'. Now, if you don't mind, I have an appointment with the Mayor.
Giles You can't keep her out of this school.
Snyder I think you'll find I can.
Giles You had no grounds for expelling her.
Snyder I have grounds, I have precedent, and a tingly kind of feeling.
Giles Buffy Summers is a minor, and is entitled to a public education. Your personal dislike of the girl does not legally entitle you to
Snyder Why don't you take it up with the city council?
Giles I thought I'd start with the State Supreme Court.
Giles You're powerful in local circles, but I believe I can make life very difficult for you, professionally speaking. And Buffy will be allowed back in.
Snyder Sorry. I'm not convinced.
Giles Would you like me to convince you?
Willow I mean, I'm not a full-fledged witch. That takes years. I just did a couple pagan blessings and . . . a teeny glamour to hide a zit.
Buffy Does it scare you?
Willow It has. I tried to communicate with the spirit world, and I *so* wasn't ready for that. It's like being pulled apart inside. Plus I blew the power for our whole block. Big scare.
Buffy I wish I could've been there with you.
Willow Me, too. I really freaked out.
Buffy I am sorry.
Willow It's okay. I understand you having to bail. I can forgive that. Mm, I have to make allowances for what you're going through a-and be a grownup about it.
Buffy You're really enjoying this whole moral superiority thing, aren't you?
Willow It's like a drug!
Buffy Fine! Okay. I'm the bad. I can take my lumps . . . for a while.
Willow All right. I'll stop giving you a hard time. Runaway.
Buffy Will!
Willow I'm sorry! Quitter.
Buffy Whiner.
Willow Bailer.
Buffy Harpy.
Willow Delinquent.
Buffy Tramp.
Willow Bad seed.
Buffy Witch.
Willow Freak.
