Buffy 'One night after supper, the lead dog turned up a snowshoe rabbit. The dog lay down low to the race, his body flashing forward, leap by leap.'
Willow 'He was sounding the deeps of his nature and the parts of his nature that were deeper than he, going back into the wombs of time. The rabbit could not...'
Willow Okay. Uh, maybe we should try a less stimulating passage.
Xander Private Harris reporting for Oz watch.
Willow Xander! Oh, good.
Xander Oh! 'Call of the Wild.' Aren't we reading the Cliff Notes to this for English?
Willow Some of us are. Anyway, it'll help you stay awake. It's good and, and very wolfy. Seems to soothe the savage beast.
Willow Except for the parts about... rabbits.
Xander Rabbis?
Willow It... seems to make him a little overexcited. Okay. Now, he's had his 2:00 feeding, and, uh, after sunrise, if he forgets where his clothes are, they're on top of the file cabinet in his cage. I put those towels up for privacy.
Xander Uh, no worries. I can handle the Oz Full Monty. I mean, not 'handle' handle, like 'hands to flesh' handle.
Willow Mm, okay. Well, it's not for you. It's for me, 'cause I'm still getting used to half a Monty.
Xander Oh. Good. Half? You and Oz? Which half?
Willow Wouldn't *you* like to know? Anyway, he's more manageable tonight and on the third night. Tomorrow night, the total full moon, that's when he's a real wolfer. But in case there's trouble... there won't be, but if...
Xander Sleepy time. Gotcha.
Willow Thanks again for doing this. I wouldn't have asked, but I have this test.
Xander No big. You can count on me. I got my coffee, magazines. Figured I'd read, maybe run the stairs over there a little bit. I'm good.
Willow Bye.
Faith Nice place. Do you ever catch kids doing the diddy out here?
Buffy No. There's a smooch spot up by the woods. That's usually where kids go.
Faith Yeah? Bet you and Scott have been up there kicking the gearshift.
Buffy Hardly. Only been on a few dates.
Faith But you like him. And when you think about him, you get that good, down-low tickle, right?
Buffy Yeah, I guess, but... How low?
Faith You tell me.
Buffy How about not? But he is... nice, and he's funny.
Faith And quite a muffin.
Buffy Blueberry. That crunchy, munchy stuff on top. But my most favorite thing so far is that he doesn't seem to be any kind of Hell Beast.
Faith All men are beasts, Buffy.
Buffy Okay, I was hoping to not get that cynical till I was at least forty.
Faith It's not cynical. I mean, it's realistic. Every guy from... Manimal down to Mr. I-Love-The-English-Patient has beast in him. And I don't care how sensitive they act. They're all still just in it for the chase.
Willow I don't think that's true, that every guy is in it only for the chase.
Buffy I know. It is an awful generalization.
Scott Hey Buffy!
Scott That's what I stopped you for, basically. Hey.
Buffy Okay. Hey.
Oz How do, Debbie?
Debbie Hi, Oz. Hey, you're not doing jazz band this year?
Oz Oh, can't take the pressure. It's not the music that's hard, it's the marching.
Buffy We have a marching jazz band?
Oz Yeah, but, you know, since the best jazz is improvisational, we'd be going off in all directions, banging into floats... Scary.
Willow He's just being Oz.
Oz Pretty much full-time.
Buffy Those are pretty flowers.
Debbie Thanks. Pete brought them for me.
Pete Yeah. Well, I-I'm sure Scott does that kind of stuff for you, too, Buffy.
Scott Oh, well, we're not up to flowers. Are we? Up to flowers? Did I miss flowers?
Buffy No. We're pre-posy. Definitely.
Buffy What time is it? Oh, I have to go see Mr. Platt today.
Debbie Platt? The school counselor?
Buffy I get to convince him that I'm Little Miss Stable so I can stay in school.
Debbie Platt creeps me out. I would totally quit going, but I'm flunking senior bio, and my teacher says I have success issues.
Oz Senior bio? I kinda aced that final.
Willow And how did you do that? Oh, right. You showed up.
Oz If you want my notes, they're yours.
Debbie Thanks! That'd be great!
Buffy We'd better go. I'll see you.
Scott Yep.
Giles We need to recheck every possible exit avenue.
Xander I'm telling you, it's a waste of time. I was here all night.
Giles Right. It's good to see you. Um, no need to panic.
Oz Just a thought: poker: not your game.
Willow What's the deal, Giles?
Giles Now, uh, bear in mind, uh, most likely, there, there, there is no deal, but um, if, if, if there was a deal, then it, um, would concern murder... last night. A male student was, was found i-i-in the woods.
Willow Which student?
Giles Jeff Orkin.
Oz Jeff? He was...
Oz I knew him.
Giles I'm afraid he was, he was, um, terribly mauled. Now, uh, much as I hate to think it, i-i-it could be the handiwork of, of...
Oz Me.
Willow Wolf you, not you you.
Xander But it's not. Not wolf you, not you you. The room was secured, the gate was locked, and the window unbreakable, and... open!
Willow Oh, God.
Xander Not to freak. I rested my eyes now and then. That's all.
Giles How long... *exactly* did you... rest your eyes for?
Xander A little now, uh, a little then. But I never heard Oz leave, and he was here in the morning when I, um... when I...
Giles WOKE UP!
Xander You could put it that way if you want to, Mr. Technical.
Willow Oh, God.
Mr._Platt Two o'clock. Miss Summers.
Buffy Buffy Summers, reporting for sanity.
Buffy Look... I know that I have to do this, and I-I'll cooperate, and I'll look at your ink blots and everything, but... I don't wanna talk about my life or my childhood or... anything, for that matter, actually. And, uh... I don't wanna be friends here.
Mr._Platt We're not gonna be friends. You have friends already, I hope. Friends are a good thing. Mm-hm. They like you, agree with you, tell you what you wanna hear. That's not what you need right now. What you need is a trained, not... *too* crazy professional who will always give you his honest opinion.
Mr._Platt Which I offer.
Mr._Platt Have a seat.
Buffy Not too crazy? Those are your credentials?
Mr._Platt Look, Buffy, any person grownup, shrink, pope any person who claims to be *totally* sane is either lying or not very bright. I mean, everyone has problems. Everybody has demons, right?
Buffy Gotta say I'm with you on that.
Mr._Platt Excellent. So, the hope I bring you is: demons can be fought. People can change. *You* can change. Now. Your turn. Let's start with why you ran away.
Buffy That's a long story.
Mr._Platt Mm. Bore me.
Buffy You know, I'm, I'm really over it. I-I'm moving on, I feel good, I'm, I'm even dating someone new.
Mr._Platt All good things. But still, you're you're bringing me in at the end of the movie.
Buffy I was dating someone. Uh, it-it ended badly. My mom and I were fighting, and I... kinda freaked.
Mr._Platt Well, tell me more about this guy. The Bad Ending Guy.
Buffy He was my first... I loved him, and then he...
Mr._Platt ...changed.
Buffy Yeah.
Mr._Platt He got mean.
Buffy Yes.
Mr._Platt And you didn't stop loving him.
Mr._Platt Look, lots of people lose themselves in love. It's, it's no shame. They write songs about it. The hitch is, you can't stay lost. Sooner or later, you... you have to get back to yourself.
Buffy And if you can't?
Mr._Platt If you can't... Well, love becomes your master, and you're just its dog.
Buffy I'm afraid to ask.
Cordelia Oz ate someone last night.
Willow He did not!
Xander Oz does not eat people. It's more werewolf play. You know, I bat you around a little bit, like a cat toy. I have harmless, wolf fun. Is it Oz's fault that, you know, side effect, people get cut to ribbons, and maybe then he'll take a little nibble and... I'm not helping, am I?
Giles No. Oz may have got out of his cage last night.
Oz Or maybe there's a, another werewolf roaming the woods.
Giles Perhaps. Perhaps it's something else entirely.
Buffy It's okay. We'll work together, and we'll figure this out.
Giles Yes. Um... Buffy. Uh, you, uh, you patrol the woods. Uh, the others, um, check out the morgue.
Willow Right! We can see if it's a werewolf kill or not. But what about Oz?
Giles Um... Well, I have some research materials at home I need to look up. Uh... W-w-we could ask Faith to watch over him.
Oz What, you're having a Slayer watch me? Oh, good, we're not overreacting.
Oz Okay. Uh, you know that thing where you bail in the middle of an upsetting conversation? I have to do that. It's kinda dramatic, I know, but... sometimes, it's a necessary guy thing.
Willow And I want you to... do the guy thing, but...
Willow Oz?
Oz Get away from the cage.
Willow What?
Oz It's gonna happen soon.
Oz Get away from me.
Xander Oh, God.
Willow Here. Hold this.
Xander Aah!
Cordelia God!
Xander We're doing crime here. You don't sneak up during crime.
Cordelia God, have a... Okay! Scarred for life! Oh, God!
Cordelia Willow, how can you stand it?
Xander Yeah, Will. I mean, this guy *is* pretty barf-worthy. Can't we be elsewhere? Like, you know, is Oz cleared or what, huh?
Willow I'm not sure. I mean, there are a lot of incised wounds, but they could be from anything.
Cordelia Anything with big, sharp teeth and vicious...
Xander Do you wanna go back to the car and wait?
Cordelia No. God. I'm just saying...
Willow Almost done. Lemme just get a few stray hairs from the body. They could be from the attacker.
Xander Great. So we got everything we need?
Willow Yep. That's it.
Cordelia Oh!
Xander Okay. Uh... little too much excitement for the Wilster here.
Xander Doesn't look good for Oz, does it?
Cordelia It really doesn't. This guy was ripped apart by a big wild animal.
Buffy Oh!
Faith Oh! Uh, Buffy! Are you okay? What are you doing here?
Buffy Uh, bleeding internally, but I'll live.
Faith God, I'm sorry. I guess I didn't hear you.
Buffy Figured as much. Ow. Again. Uh... Actually, I-I-I came to give you the rest of the night off.
Faith Get out of jail free, huh? How come?
Buffy Couldn't sleep. Figured I'd, uh, cram for my French test.
Faith That's cool. I was going kinda crazy in here, but I can get in a few stakings before sunrise.
Buffy Knock yourself out. Not literally, though.
Faith Yeah. Later.
Buffy Hey.
Giles Hmm. Hello.
Buffy Oh. Boy. Faith and her nutty books.
Giles 'Exploring Demon Dimensions' and 'Mystery of Acathla'.
Buffy Yeah! And she still listens to heavy metal. Freaky deaky.
Giles Buffy...
Buffy What if... I told you that... I had a dream about Angel... and, um... it brought up some questions?
Giles I'd say it was to be expected. Must have been some dream. I didn't think you knew what a card index was for.
Buffy I dreamt that he came back.
Giles Of course. After Jenny was killed, I had dreams that she was s-still alive, that I saved her.
Buffy This was vivid. Really vivid. Three-dimensional, sensurround, the hills are alive...
Giles Do you believe it was a prophecy?
Buffy No. I-I don't know. I... I guess it just... it made me wonder.
Buffy Is there a chance even? Could it happen?
Giles Well, there's no record of anyone returning from a demon dimension once the... gate was closed. I-I-I can't imagine how it could happen or-or why.
Buffy Let's just pretend for a second that... Angel somehow found his way back to Sunnydale. What would he be like?
Giles I really can't say. From what is known about that dimension, i-it would suggest a world of... brutal torment. And time moves quite differently there, so...
Buffy I remember. So he would've been down there for hundreds of years.
Giles Yes.
Buffy Of torture.
Giles It would take someone of extraordinary... will and character to survive that and, uh, retain any semblance of self. Most likely, he'd be, be a monster.
Buffy A lost cause.
Giles Maybe. Maybe not. In my experience, there are... two types of monster. The first, uh, can be redeemed, or more importantly, wants to be redeemed.
Buffy And the second type?
Giles The second is void of humanity, cannot respond to reason... or love.
Willow I thought Faith was on duty.
Buffy Oh, hey. Change of plans.
Willow Glazed or cake? It's fun to watch them make them. They use this spritzy thing, and they drop the batter into this...
Buffy Couldn't sleep, huh?
Willow I've been at Mister Donut since the TV did that snowy thing.
Willow How come *you're* the Wakey Girl? I mean, this time, it's not your boyfriend who's the cold-blooded...
Willow Jelly doughnut?
Oz Everything all right?
Buffy Yeah. Uh, what happened with the inspection of the body?
Willow Anyone? They're yummy delicious!
Buffy Willow, come on. Was it werewolf?
Buffy Was it a vampire?
Willow I-it wasn't conclusive.
Buffy How could it not be conclusive? What did it look like? Was he bit?
Giles Let her finish, Buffy.
Buffy No, it's just...
Buffy I'm sorry.
Scott Buffy. Over here.
Buffy Hey.
Scott Hey. Uh... I can't, I can't back you on that lunch. Nutritional demerits.
Buffy Oh. My stomach doesn't want hard food today. But there's fruit in it.
Scott Those are marshmallows.
Buffy Oh.
Buffy I'm... I'm really out of it today. I didn't sleep well last night.
Debbie Just don't tell Mr. Platt you have insomnia. He'll make you start a dream journal.
Pete Oh, what's that, like, a Barbie thing? Dear Dream Journal, how come Ken hasn't come around since he got that earring?
Debbie I never did it. He's a quack.
Buffy I kinda liked him.
Debbie Really? I guess, I guess he's kinda funny and stuff. It's just... sometimes I just don't like the things he says.
Buffy Oh, he definitely... marches to the beat of his own drummer. A-actually, I think he makes his own drums.
Scott Well, my mom says that therapy can be completely helpful.
Pete Yeah, but your mom has the wattage of a Zippo lighter, Scott.
Scott I hope you realize I don't actually know these people. I just... I thought you would like me better if I had friends, so I hired them.
Scott So... I, uh, I wanted to tell you that you look great today. But now I wanna raise that to amazing because you didn't sleep well.
Buffy Uh... That's really sweet. Um... And I-I wish I didn't have to, but I just remembered that I do, so, uh, I'll see you later.
Scott Uh, yeah.
Pete Check out Scotty liking the manic-depressive chick.
Buffy Angel?
Buffy Do you understand me?
Pete Debbie, come on. Just for a minute.
Debbie No, I can't. I have to meet a friend.
Pete So you'll be late but happy.
Debbie No, no. Let's stay here.
Pete Relax, Debbie. What's wrong with you today?
Pete What is that?
Debbie Nothing. Kiss me.
Pete No. Debbie, you did not drink that, did you?
Debbie Drink it? You know I didn't.
Pete Debbie, what's going on?
Buffy Two o'clock. Buffy Summers, right?
Buffy Wait. Don't turn around. Okay? And don't say anything. Just listen. I mean, that's, that's your thing, right?
Buffy There's something going on. I mean, th-this whole entire story is probably gonna convince you that I'm loony-bin material, but... there's nobody else that I can talk to. Not Willow and... not Giles. Nobody. If they, if they found out, they'd freak on me or they'd do something, and... I need help. I just, I need to talk to someone. I'm so scared. It's this guy. H-h-he...
Buffy He's come back.
Pete So the bottle just jumped out of the cabinet and spilled on its own.
Debbie Of course not. I-I was trying to get rid of it.
Pete You were trying to get rid of it?
Debbie To help you. You know how you get.
Pete You think this has *anything* to do with how I get?
Debbie Well, when you drink it...
Pete When I drink it, nothing, Debbie. Nothing! I don't need this anymore, okay? I am way, *way* past that now.
Pete You see?
Pete You see?! No more. You could pour out everything I made, and it wouldn't help. And you wanna know why?
Pete You wanna know why?! Because all it takes now is you, Debbie. You and your STUPID, GRATING VOICE!
Pete *You're* the reason I started the formulas in the first place: to be the man you wanted! And you pay me back how? By whoring around with other guys and taunting me!
Debbie No! I don't! I don't even look!
Pete Is that something your shrink taught you, Debbie? Huh? Huh? To share? To communicate? To piss me off?!
Pete Well, guess what? Even *he's* not going to listen to your pathetic ramblings anymore. I'm all you've got now, Debbie! Do you hear me? I AM ALL YOU'VE GOT!
Pete Oh, my God.
Pete Hey, Debbie. Hey, listen. You know you shouldn't make me mad. Huh? You know what happens.
Pete Debbie, please. Are you all right?
Debbie It's okay.
Debbie It's okay.
Giles This creature is especially brutal. I believe the phrase coined by the coroner when describing Mr. Platt was 'pureed'. But he did confirm that Platt was killed shortly before Buffy found him.
Faith Which means that he was killed during the day.
Willow Yes!
Willow Sorry. I got... I've just been... it's horrible, horrible.
Buffy It's okay, Will. We're all glad Oz is off the hook.
Giles Indeed. Shouldn't he be here by now? The sun sets at 5:30.
Debbie Sorry I'm late. Did you bring the notes?
Oz Yeah. Um... You okay?
Debbie What? Oh, yeah! I'm such a klutz! I, um, oh...
Oz Fell down? Hit your... eye?
Debbie Doorknob. Um... Thanks.
Oz Hey, um... If you wanna talk...
Debbie Thanks again for the notes.
Oz Yeah...
Giles Our task now is to determine what sort of killer we *are* dealing with. Clearly, we're looking for a depraved, sadistic animal.
Oz Present.
Oz Hey, I may be a cold-blooded jelly doughnut, but my timing is impeccable.
Willow But you aren't! I-i-it's-it's a kill-in-the-day monster! A hundred percent for sure.
Oz Okay.
Giles Uh, I wish we had time to celebrate properly. However, we have two victims: Jeff Orkin and, uh, now Platt. Uh, maybe there's something they had in common.
Faith Missing internal organs.
Giles Besides that.
Oz Debbie. Well, victim number one, Jeff. He was in jazz band with us. They used to horse around.
Faith They were screwing?
Oz I don't think so, but he hid her music comp book once.
Buffy And we know that Debbie knew Platt. I mean, she was seeing him and way vocal about not having love for the guy.
Oz Add this and stir. I just saw Debbie a minute ago sporting a nasty black eye.
Willow Okay, so pretend Debbie wanted Platt dead. Maybe he fought back.
Buffy No. Platt was dead in an instant. He didn't even drop his cigarette. Now, what if boyfriend Pete's the one doling out the punishment?
Giles We should find them both immediately.
Oz Well, Debbie was in the quad a minute ago.
Giles All right. We'll split up. Um, Faith, you and I team. Willow, stick with Buffy.
Oz And I'll... go lock myself in the cage.
Buffy It's tricky, covering a fresh shiner like that. You know what works?
Debbie What?
Buffy Don't get hit.
Buffy What's going on, Debbie? I'll bet the farm you know.
Debbie You're wrong. I don't know anything.
Buffy Normally, I'd say, you wanna play 'I have a secret'? Fine. But people are dying here.
Debbie It... it's not his fault. I mean, he's not himself when he gets like this.
Buffy You mean Pete.
Debbie It's me. I make him crazy. He-he just does what he does because he loves me too much.
Willow But weren't Mr. Platt and Jeff murdered by an animal?
Buffy Pete's not like other guys, is he, Debbie?
Debbie I-I've gotta go.
Buffy You have to talk to us. We can't help you until you do.
Debbie I didn't ask for your help!
Willow Well, when are you going to? I mean, if Pete kills you, it'll pretty much be too late.
Buffy Debbie, we're running out of time.
Buffy Where can we find him?
Debbie I-I don't know.
Buffy You're lying.
Debbie What if I am? What are you gonna do about it?
Willow Wrong question.
Buffy Look at yourself. Why are you protecting him? Anybody who really loved you couldn't do this to you.
Debbie Would they take him someplace?
Buffy Probably.
Debbie I could never do that to him. I'm his everything.
Buffy Great. So what, you two live out your Grimm fairy tale? Two people are dead.
Buffy Who's gonna be next?
Pete Since when do you touch my girl?
Oz Hey, Pete. This is kind of a bad time.
Pete Well, I guess you didn't think about that when you put the moves on Debbie!
Oz We talked, yeah, but it was move-free.
Oz About this cage? When that sun sets...
Pete You won't be alive to see it!
Oz I'm serious. Something's gonna happen that you... probably won't believe.
Oz Or you might.
Debbie He does love me. He does love me.
Buffy This is useless. We have to go. I have to find Pete.
Debbie He does love me.
Willow Come on.
Debbie He does love me.
Willow I think we broke her.
Debbie He does love me. He does love me.
Buffy I think she was broken before this.
Pete Did you kiss that whore? Huh? Did she like it?
Oz Time's up. Rules change.
Giles What was that?
Giles Get the dart gun!
Buffy Got it!
Debbie Pete, watch out!
Giles Ow!
Buffy Oh! Sorry!
Giles Oh, right. Bloody priceless.
Buffy You get the wolf!
Faith Got it!
Debbie Pete! You're all right! God, you're all right.
Debbie She almost shot you. Did you see? I stopped her.
Debbie You have to leave, get out of Sunnydale. She knows.
Pete How did she know, Debbie? Did you run your big mouth?
Debbie No! She just knew. It seemed like she just knew.
Pete So you filled in the blanks!
Debbie NO! No!
Pete But what did I expect from a screw-up like you?
Debbie I-I didn't... Pete...
Pete You're nothing but a waste of space.
Debbie No!
Buffy Oh, God.
Faith Where's the gun? WHERE'S THE GUN?!
Willow Get off her!
Willow Get the gun! Get the gun!
Willow Hurry!
Pete All the same! You're all the same!
Angel Buffy?
Angel Buffy...
Willow It's all over school, what happened with Debbie and Pete. Except for the Pete-was-a-monster part.
Oz Yeah. A freshman told me that Pete had eight iced cafe' mochas and just lost it.
Buffy That's better than the estrogen theory. I heard he took all of his mother's birth control pills.
Cordelia He didn't? Pete was a monster? Where have I been?
Xander In your special place, Cor, which is why I adore you.
Cordelia So, what's the true story? What happened?
Willow Well, we got ahold of, uh, Pete's lab books and stuff, and Mr. Science was doing a Jekyll/Hyde deal. He was afraid Debbie was gonna leave him, so he mixed this potion to become super mas macho.
Buffy The only thing was, after a while, he didn't need the potion to turn into a bad guy. He did it just fine on his own.
Cordelia So it was like a real killing. He wasn't under the influence of anything?
Buffy Just himself.
Buffy Uh... I'll see you guys later.
Cordelia Great. Now I'm gonna be stuck with serious thoughts all day.
Buffy I don't know what to say that's not gonna sound stupid or obvious.
Scott I've been friends with them both since before we started school.
Buffy Is there anything I can do?
Scott Thanks. I'm gonna be okay. It's just that you never really know what's going on inside somebody. Do you? I mean, you think... if you care about them... But you never really do.
Buffy 'Night came on, and a full moon rose high over the trees...'
Buffy '...lighting the land till it lay bathed in ghostly day. And the strain of the primitive remained alive and active.'
Buffy 'Faithfulness and devotion, things born of fire and roof were his...'
Buffy '...yet he retained his wildness and wiliness.'
Buffy 'And from the depths of the forest, a call still sounded.'
