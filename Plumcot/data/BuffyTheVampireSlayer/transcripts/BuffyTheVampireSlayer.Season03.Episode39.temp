Cordelia I think we should get a limo.
Xander A limo?
Cordelia Yeah!
Xander A big, expensive limo?
Willow That sounds like fun! And it is our last Homecoming Dance, so maybe we should make a big deal of it.
Xander You wanna talk fun? Public bus. You meet the funnest people.
Xander Back me up here, Oz.
Oz Well, if it's a dollar issue, we could all take my van.
Cordelia Van? The Homecoming Queen doesn't go to the dance in a van. Use your head.
Xander Well, technically, you haven't been elected yet... Although you certainly and without a doubt will be. Who else likes a limo?
Willow A private limo! It, it is pretty... cuddlesome. And if we all split the cost...
Buffy Um... maybe. You know, if I go and all.
Willow Why wouldn't you go? You already have your tickets. I mean, unless you don't have a da... ...ay o-or two to think about it. We should all think about it.
Cordelia What's going on here? Did Scott not ask her to the Homecoming Dance yet?
Buffy Thanks, Cordelia. Humiliation's really good for my color.
Scott Oh, um... well, no. I just... I assumed that you would think it was corny or something, but I-I'm in... I mean, you know, if you are, if you want to.
Buffy Uh, sure... I do. You know, i-if you want to.
Scott Well, I do if you want to.
Oz The judges will accept that as a 'yes'.
Scott Do you want me to get you another drink?
Buffy Um... no, actually. Uh... I-I'm a little tired. I think I'm gonna call it a night. But I'm excited about the dance.
Scott Me, too.
Buffy I-it's just me. Here.
Buffy How are you feeling?
Angel It hurts... less.
Buffy Good.
Buffy I haven't... told Giles and the others that... you're back.
Angel Giles...
Buffy And I'm not going to. They wouldn't understand that you're... better. A-a-and I'm gonna keep helping you get better. It's just that everything's different now. I'm a senior. I'm really working harder in school. I'm even thinking about college. A-and I'm involved with someone.
Buffy His name is Scott. He's a nice, solid guy. He makes me happy... and that's what I need: someone I can count on.
Scott I don't think we should see each other anymore.
Buffy You don't? When did this happen? Where was I?
Scott Buffy, it's just... Before we were going out, you, you seemed so... full of life, like a force of nature. Now you just seem distracted all the time, and...
Buffy Yeah, I know, it's... I'm getting better. Honest. In fact, from here on, you are gonna see a drastic distraction reduction.
Buffy 'Drastic distraction reduction.' Try saying that ten times fast.
Scott I'm really sorry.
Boss Is that her?
Trick In the nubile flesh, my friend.
Trick That's the target.
Secretary The Mayor will see you now.
Allan I'm sorry to bother you, sir.
Mayor_Wilkins I'm not bothered, Allan.
Allan Well, I-I'm not sure how serious this is, but, uh, they were spotted in town three days ago. I've just been informed. Frederick and Hans Gruenstahler, uh, wanted in Germany for capital murder, terrorism, uh, the bombing of Flight 1402... Uh, I should have brought it to your attention sooner, but I'd, I'd wanted to... confirm...
Mayor_Wilkins Would you show me your hands, please?
Allan Sir?
Mayor_Wilkins Your hands.
Mayor_Wilkins I think they could be cleaner.
Allan Of course, sir. I-I mean, I, I washed them, but...
Mayor_Wilkins After every meal and under your fingernails. Dirt gets trapped there... and germs... and mayonnaise. My dear mother said, 'cleanliness is next to godliness', and I believed her. She never caught a cold. I'd like these two to be put under surveillance, and I'd like to know if... any other colorful characters have come to town.
Allan I'll take care of it.
Mayor_Wilkins You have all my faith.
Willow You have to help me pick an outfit. I wanna wear something that makes Oz go, 'Oh.'
Xander No problem. I got the tux goin' on. I'm gonna look hot if it even remotely fits.
Xander Whatcha doin'?
Cordelia Checking out the I-laughingly-use-the-phrase competition.
Cordelia Holly Charleston: nice girl, brain dead, doesn't have a prayer.
Cordelia Michelle Blake: open to all mankind, especially those with a letterman's jacket and a car. She could give me a run.
Willow Where's Buffy? She's gonna miss the yearbook pictures.
Xander Buffy and Faith are in the library getting all *sweaty*.
Cordelia They're training.
Xander I stand by my phrase.
Oz I don't think she was here the day they announced them. Did anybody tell her?
Cordelia Oh, I'll tell her now. I have to go to the nurse's office for an ice pack anyway.
Xander Did you hurt yourself?
Cordelia No, silly. It shrinks the pores!
Faith Oh, man! Guys should break up with you more often.
Buffy Gee, thank you.
Faith No, I mean it. You really got some quality rage going. Really gives you an edge.
Buffy Edge Girl. Just what I always wanted to be.
Faith Well, screw him, alright? You move on, and... you party heavily, and you'll be fine. I mean, you're still going to that dance, right?
Buffy Maybe.
Faith You got the tix already. Why don't we go together?
Buffy I don't know about that.
Faith Come on. We'll find a couple studs, we'll use 'em and... discard 'em. That's always fun.
Buffy Okay, I'm in. Not the stud-using part, though. Or... probably not.
Cordelia Uh, Bobby! Mashad! You don't phone, you don't write... Where's the love?
Buffy Ms. Moran? Hi! I'm so glad that I ran into you. Um, I had this little incident last year of getting kicked out of school. And I'm back now, though, I've done all of my makeup tests, but I still need one written recommendation from a teacher. I think the word that Principal Snyder used was 'glowing'. Uh, to put in my file so I can prove that I belong here.
Ms._Moran And, um, you are...?
Buffy Buffy. B-Buffy Summers. Third row. I sat by the window. Uh, your class: Contemporary American Heroes from Amelia Earhart to Maya Angelou. The class that changed my life?
Ms._Moran Were you absent a lot, um...
Buffy Buffy?
Cordelia Hi. I hope you'll consider me for Homecoming Queen.
Buffy I can't believe it. My favorite teacher, and she didn't even remember who I was. I'm like a non-person. Am I invisible? Can you see me?
Oz Big as life.
Buffy At Hemery, I was Prom Princess, I was Fiesta Queen, I was on the cheerleading squad. And the yearbook was, like, a story of me. Now it's senior year, and I'm going to be one crappy picture on one-eighth of one crappy page.
Xander Uh, no, actually, you're not.
Buffy What do you mean?
Xander Well, you, uh, missed the picture-taking.
Buffy When? Why?
Oz We did 'em yesterday.
Willow Didn't Cordelia tell you?
Cordelia Thanks for your support. Buffy, you look so cute in that outfit.
Buffy I'm not voting for you.
Cordelia Then make it snappy.
Buffy How come you didn't tell me they were doing the yearbook pictures?
Cordelia Didn't I? Oh, I guess I forgot. What's the big?
Buffy It's just... You could've thought about somebody else for thirty seconds, that's all.
Cordelia Hey, I am under a *lot* of pressure here.
Buffy Oh, yeah, campaigning. Rough gig.
Cordelia What would you know about it? Just because you were Guacamole Queen when you were three doesn't mean you understand how this works.
Buffy Obviously, it involves handing out entirely lame flyers.
Cordelia No. It involves being part of this school and having actual friends.
Cordelia Now, if it was about monsters, blood, and innards, then you'd be a shoo-in. I'd like to see *you* try to win the crown.
Buffy You would?
Buffy Then you will.
Cordelia What does that mean?
Buffy I'm gonna show you how it's done. I'm gonna run for Homecoming Queen, and I'm going to win.
Cordelia This is starting to be sad.
Buffy Sorry, Cordy, but you have no idea who you're messing with.
Cordelia What? The Slayer?
Buffy I'm not talking about the Slayer. I'm talking about Buffy. You've awakened the Prom Queen within. And that crown is going to be mine.
Trick Competition. Competition is a beautiful thing. It makes us strive. It... makes us accomplish. Occasionally, it makes us kill. We all have the desire to win. Whether we're human... vampire...
Trick ...and whatever the hell you are, my brother. You got them spiny-looking head things. I ain't never seen that before.
Kulak I am Kulak, of the Miquot Clan.
Trick Isn't that nice. Point is, you're all here for the same reason.
Lyle Well, it sure ain't no philosophy class, now, is it?
Trick Mr. Gorch, my account statement says that your deposit has not yet been made.
Lyle Well, me and Candy... we blowin' our whole honeymoon stash on this little game here.
Trick They're dirty.
Lyle They're nonconsecutive.
Trick The games will begin in a few days' time. The first target, Buffy, you've all seen. The second, Faith, is... a little more elusive. But they will both be together and ready for the killing, and that is a money-back guarantee.
Trick Ladies, gentlemen, spiny-headed looking creatures, welcome to SlayerFest '98!
Willow What do you think of this?
Xander Nice.
Willow It's my first big dance, you know? Where there's a boy and a band... and not just me alone in my room pretending that there's a boy and a band.
Lyrics I didn't come this far
Willow I just want it to be...
Xander Special. That's why I spared no expense on the tux.
Willow The tux? I thought you, uh, borrowed it from your cousin Rigby.
Lyrics For you to make this hard for me.
Xander Expense to my pride, Will. They're our only relations with money, and they shun us... as they should.
Lyrics And now you want to ask me 'how'?
Willow What do you think about this?
Lyrics It's like / How does your heart beat?
Xander Nice.
Lyrics Why do you breathe?
Lyrics How does your heart beat?
Xander What?
Lyrics And why do you breathe?
Willow I was just...
Lyrics Why did you come here?
Willow Remember the eighth-grade cotillion? You had that clip-on?
Lyrics You weren't invited
Xander Hey, I was pretty stylin' with a clip-on.
Lyrics And you're on the outside
Willow And now here we are, and it's... Homecoming.
Xander Yeah, we should face it, Will.
Lyrics Stay on the outside.
Xander You and I are gonna be in neighboring rest homes while I come over so you can adjust my, um...
Lyrics And now you want to ask me 'why'?
Xander My, uh... Well, I can't think of anything that's not really gross.
Lyrics It's like / How does your heart beat?
Lyrics And how do you cry?
Xander So, uh... you and Oz.
Lyrics How does your heart beat?
Xander How do I put this? Are we on first, second, or, uh... ye gods?
Willow That's none of your business, Alexander Harris.
Lyrics And there are some things that I like to figure out
Xander Ooo, rounding second.
Willow You don't know that. What about you and Cordelia?
Lyrics There are some things that I can do without
Xander Oh, a gentleman never talks about his conquests.
Willow Oh, yeah? Well, since when did you become a...
Lyrics You and your letters are gone forever
Willow ...gentleman?
Willow Uh, I know. 'Nice.'
Xander I was gonna go with 'gorgeous'.
Willow Really? You, too. I-in a guy way.
Lyrics With all the things that you could be
Xander Oz is very lucky.
Willow So is Cordelia... i-in a girl way.
Lyrics You never could learn how to be me.
Willow I don't know if I can dance in this. I don't know if I can dance!
Xander Come on. Piece of cake.
Xander Here.
Lyrics And now you want to ask me 'how'?
Xander Well, that seems to, um...
Lyrics It's like / How does your heart beat? / Why do you breathe?
Willow Yeah. This shouldn't be a... problem.
Lyrics How does your heart beat?
Xander No.
Lyrics Why do you breathe?
Xander No problem.
Lyrics How does your heart beat? / Why do you breathe?
Lyrics How do you breathe?
Xander That didn't just happen!
Willow No! I mean, it did, but it didn't!
Xander Because I respect you. And Oz. And I would never...
Willow I would never, either! I-it must be the clothes. I-it's a fluke.
Xander It's a clothes fluke, that's what it is. And there'll be no more fluking.
Willow Not ever.
Xander We gotta get out of these clothes!
Willow Right now!
Xander Oh, I didn't mean...
Willow I didn't... me, either!
Buffy A campaign is like a war. It's won or lost in the trenches.
Buffy Holly, Michelle, and our real competition, Cordelia, all have big head starts. Speaking of big heads, if I had a watermelon as big as Cordelia's, I'd be rich.
Buffy Waits for laugh...
Buffy Okay, you're right. Making fun of the competition only makes me seem petty. Now, this is just like any other popularity contest. I've done this before. The only difference being this time, I'm not actually popular. Although, I'm not exactly unpopular. A lot of people came to my welcome home party.
Willow But they were killed by zombies.
Buffy Good point. Okay, here's the plan. Willow, I need you to make a database. See who's for us, who's on the fence and where our real crisis areas are. Oz, you take the fringe: musicians, those not normally inclined to vote. Xander, what...
Buffy Uh, Cordelia... Okay, look. I know this is a little awkward, but I don't see any reason why we all can't get along during this campaign time. I mean, we're... almost friends, and... we are all riding together in the limo.
Cordelia Yeah, great. Willow, how's that database coming?
Willow Uh, it's... just about done.
Cordelia Xander?
Xander I got your new flyers.
Cordelia Let's get cracking.
Xander She's my girlfriend.
Willow It's just that... she needs it so much more than you do.
Oz As Willow goes, so goes my nation.
Cordelia Thanks for what you said, Buffy. I think we're getting along great. Don't you?
Giles Seems like a lot of fuss for... one little title.
Buffy Well, you know, it's no fun if you don't try your best.
Giles As long as fun is still in the mix.
Buffy Sure! It's not like anyone takes it that seriously.
Lyrics Well, I don't wanna be president
Lyrics Superman or Clark Kent
Lyrics I don't wanna walk 'round in their shoes
Lyrics 'Cause I don't know whose side I'm on
Lyrics I don't know my right from wrong
Lyrics I don't know where I'm going to
Lyrics I don't know about you
Lyrics I'll be the rain falling on your fire escape
Buffy Sorry.
Scott Here.
Lyrics And I may not be the man you want me to
Scott I heard you were doing this.
Buffy Uh... yeah. It's just something to pass the time.
Lyrics I can be myself
Buffy It's silly, really.
Lyrics How 'bout you?
Scott I don't think so. For what it's worth, you have my vote.
Buffy No, I don't want you to feel... Thank you.
Lyrics I don't wanna make you mad
Lyrics I don't wanna meet your dad
Lyrics I don't wanna be your dream come true
Lyrics 'Cause I don't know just what I've found
Lyrics I don't know my sky from ground
Lyrics I don't know where I'm going to
Lyrics I don't know about you
Buffy Hey.
Willow Hi! How are you? You good? You look good. Anything new? Hey, did I mention you look good?
Buffy Willow, it's okay that you're helping Cordelia. We're best friends. I'm not gonna hold it against you.
Willow No, I'm not a friend. I'm a rabid dog who should be shot! But there're forces at work here! Dark, incomprehensible forces.
Buffy And I'm sure they're more important than all we've been through together, or... the number of times that I've saved your life.
Willow What do you want?
Buffy Fifteen minutes alone on your computer with Cordelia's database.
Willow 'Kay.
Buffy Good! Oh!
Buffy So, I spoke to the limo people, and we're all set.
Buffy They'll pick up Faith, then me, then swing by and get you guys. Now, what's your database tell you about *my* weaknesses?
Buffy You know, Jonathon, I've always felt a special bond between you and me.
Jonathon Cordelia gave me six bucks. That buys a *whole* lotta cupcakes.
Cordelia Are you kidding?
Cordelia I've been doing the Vulcan death grip since I was four.
Buffy So you really are giving out money, huh?
Cordelia Is that any more tacky than your faux 'I'm shy but deep' campaign posters?
Buffy Yes.
Cordelia This whole trying to be like me really isn't funny anymore.
Buffy I was *never* trying to be like you, and when was it funny?
Cordelia I don't see why your pathetic need to recapture your glory days gives you the right to splinter my vote.
Buffy How can you think it's okay to talk to people like this? Do you have parents?
Cordelia Yeah. Two of them... unlike some people.
Buffy Your brain isn't even connected to your mouth, is it?
Cordelia Why don't you do us both a favor and stay out of my way?
Buffy Don't *ever* do that again.
Cordelia You're sick, you know that?
Xander Okay, let's not say something we'll, uh, regret later...
Cordelia You crazy freak!
Buffy Vapid whore!
Xander ...like that!
Cordelia What did you call me?!
Willow This is just...
Willow ...the worst thing that's ever happened. Ever!
Xander I know. I know. It's just... when I look at you now, it's like I'm seeing you for the first time.
Willow I'm talking about Buffy and Cordelia.
Xander Me, too.
Willow What are we gonna do? I mean, we have to do something. This is all our fault.
Xander How do you get from 'chick fight' to 'our fault'?
Willow Because: we felt so guilty about the fluke, we overcompensated helping Cordelia, and we spun the whole group dynamic out of orbit, and we're just a big meteor shower heading for Earth...
Xander Okay, calm down. Let's just put our heads together and think of something. Okay, one of us here is pretty darn smart, and I am...
Xander ...just in Hell. I-I mean, I-I thought being a senior *at last* and, and having a girlfriend *at last* would, would be a *good* thing. Now, why wouldn't that be a good thing?
Xander What?
Willow Sometimes when you're falling to pieces, your mouth, it just does the sweetest thing.
Willow What are we gonna do?
Xander We just have to get the two of them communicating.
Willow I'm talking about us.
Buffy What's going on here? Where's Faith?
Buffy Well...
Buffy They bought us corsages?
Cordelia I took the orchid.
Buffy Okay.
Cordelia I don't see what the big deal is.
Buffy I'm not making a big deal. You wanted the orchid, you got the orchid.
Cordelia It goes with my complexion better.
Buffy It does have that sallow tint.
Buffy Finally we're here.
Cordelia What is this? Okay, guys, we've had enough of your stupid little game!
Buffy What's massively wrong with this picture?
Trick Hello, ladies. Welcome to SlayerFest '98.
Trick What is a SlayerFest, you ask? Well, as in most of life, there's the hunters and the hunted. Can you guess where you two fall? From the beginning of this tape, you have exactly thirty secondsno, that's seventeen nowto run for your lives.
Trick Faith...
Trick Buffy...
Trick Have a nice death.
Cordelia Hello! How stupid are you people? She's a Slayer. I'm a Homecoming Queen!
Lyrics She flies from a blinding light / And spirals to my heart
Faith What are you two so mopey about?
Lyrics I try to find my mind to go / don't know where to start
Xander Oh, we're not mopey. We're groovin'. On Oz's band. He's a great guy, Oz.
Lyrics Won't ever, can't ever find my sanity
Willow He wrote this song for me.
Lyrics Won't ever...
Faith Sleazebag!
Lyrics ...can't ever till I hear her calling for me
Giles We have to find Buffy. Something terrible's happened.
Lyrics She knows that, she knows that
Giles Just kidding. Thought I'd give you a scare.
Lyrics She knows that side of me
Giles Are those finger sandwiches?
Lyrics I can't help it, can't help it
Cordelia I have an idea. We talk to these people, we explain that I'm not a Slayer, and they let me go.
Cordelia Look out!
Buffy Get down!
Buffy That's gotta smart.
Buffy Now, I can let you out of that, or I can put a bullet in your head. How many are there in this little game, and what are they packing?
Jungle_Bob There's me, two Germans with AR-15s and grenade launcher... yellow-skinned demon with long knives... Vampire couple from Texas named Gorch.
Buffy That everybody?
Jungle_Bob Everybody who's out here. Germans are wired. Their boss is tracking them on computer. Now get me out of this!
Cordelia Could I just ask you an *eensy* favor? Could you just tell your friends that I'm not a Sl...
Lyrics Just a little more, just a little more
Lyrics Just until I know what I'm feeling
Faith Scott? There you are, honey!
Lyrics Just a little more
Faith Hey, good news.
Lyrics Just a little more / To find my sanity
Faith The doctor says that the itching and the swelling and the burning should clear up, but we gotta keep using the ointment.
Faith Hi.
Lyrics She knows that side is calling back for me
Scott Uh...
Lyrics I've lost my mind / I never believe
Giles I suspect the, uh, finger food contains... actual fingers.
Lyrics She knows that side...
Giles I-I-I think I'll retreat to the library until the coronation.
Lyrics ...is calling back for me
Giles I wanna be here when, when, when Buffy... Well, uh, however the thing turns out for her.
Lyrics I lost my mind til she's calling for me
Giles A-and that was a very fine thing you two did, putting Buffy and Cordelia together.
Lyrics She's calling for me / She's calling for me
Lyrics She knows that, she knows that
Willow We did one fine thing.
Lyrics She knows that side of me
Xander Yeah. They've been gone for a while. They must really be getting' into it.
Lyrics I can't help it
Buffy We should be safe in here for a while. You need to find a weapon.
Cordelia Safe? I'm not safe. I'm gonna die!
Buffy Yeah, you are if you just stand there.
Cordelia I'm never gonna be crowned Homecoming Queen. I'm never gonna graduate from high school. I'm never gonna know if it's real between me and Xander, or if it's just... some temporary insanity that made me think... I loved him. And now I'm never gonna get the chance to tell him.
Buffy Yes, you are. We are gonna get out of here, and we are gonna head back to the library, where Giles and the rest of the weapons live. Then I'm gonna take out the rest of these guys just in time for you to congratulate me on my *sweeping* victory as Homecoming Queen.
Cordelia I know what you're up to. You think if you get me mad enough, I won't be so scared. And, hey! It's working! Where's a damn weapon?
Buffy You really love Xander?
Cordelia Well, he kinda grows on you, like... a Chia Pet.
Buffy That's it?
Cordelia Just this and a telephone.
Buffy A telephone. And you didn't think that'd be helpful?
Cordelia No, this is better for...
Cordelia Oh.
Boss You're about to see why Daniel Boone and that idiot demon are creatures of the past... and why I am the future. I'm picking up a signal.
Boss They've got a phone!
Buffy If you get this message, Giles, get help and get out here...
Buffy Hello?
Cordelia What happened?
Buffy It went dead.
Kulak Want me to cut that leg off?
Jungle_Bob No, thanks.
Boss Continue proceeding south ninety meters to vector three.
Buffy Giles, it's me... and Cordelia. We're in a cabin in Miller's Woods, and we're in big trouble.
Cordelia Why is it every time I go somewhere with you, it always ends in violence and terror?
Buffy Welcome to my life.
Cordelia I don't wanna be in your life. I wanna be in my life.
Buffy Well, there's the door. Please feel free to walk out at any time and live your life.
Cordelia All I wanted was to be Homecoming Queen.
Buffy And that's all I wanted, too, Cordelia.
Buffy I spent a year's allowance on this dress.
Cordelia I don't even get why you care about Homecoming when you're doing stuff like this.
Buffy Because this is all I do. This is what my life is. You couldn't understand. I just thought... Homecoming Queen. I could pick up a yearbook someday and say, I was there. I went to high school, I had friends, and... for one moment, I got to live in the world. And there'd be proof. Proof that I was chosen for something other than this.
Buffy Besides... I look cute in a tiara.
Cordelia Do you hear...
Buffy Cor, the gun!
Buffy Ooh!
Buffy Cordelia, the spatula.
Boss Prepare to launch.
Boss Target's in range, ready your weapons. Y-axis fifty-three degrees west by eight degrees south.
Cordelia Buffy!
Boss Launch!
Buffy We gotta get back to the library.
Lyle Easy, darlin'. These things go through you faster than Grandpa Pete's chili.
Candy I want to do Buffy: my weddin' present for what happened to your poor brother.
Lyle Tector.
Candy When's she comin'?
Lyle Well, he's her Watcher. She'll show... just as soon as she gets rid of some of our competition.
Boss They're heading west, back into town.
Trick They got away?
Boss Temporarily.
Trick Well, give it up for the Slayers. They got character.
Trick I'll take care of it.
Trick Evening, gentlemen. How may I help you?
Trick Excuse me! Anybody got a warrant here?
Buffy Jungle Bob and spike-head are down and out. We've lost the Germans twice, but they seem to keep finding us. If we take them out and the Gorches, we can still make Homecoming.
Cordelia Those animals! Hunting us down like poor defenseless... well, animals.
Buffy We just need to find Giles...
Cordelia Buffy!
Lyle Candy!
Lyle Oh, Candy...
Lyle I'm gonna kill both you Slayers for this! You hear me?
Cordelia I hear you, you redneck moron. You got a dress that goes with that hat?
Lyle I'm gonna...
Cordelia Rip out my innards, play with my eyeballs, boil my brain and eat it for brunch? Listen up, needle-brain. Buffy and I have taken out four of your cronies, not to mention your girlfriend.
Lyle WIFE!
Cordelia Whatever. The point is, I haven't even broken a sweat. See, in the end, Buffy's just the runner-up. *I'm* the Queen. You get me mad, what do you think I'm gonna do to you?
Lyle Later.
Buffy That should teach him to mistake you for a Slayer.
Giles Yes, I must admit I do feel partly responsible. I did give your friends tacit approval to make the switch in the limousine.
Buffy Aw, it's okay. It gave Cor and I a chance to spend some quality death time.
Cordelia And we got these free corsages.
Giles Oh, that's nice. Although I don't recall them mentioning corsages.
Buffy Jungle Bob... said that the Germans were hooked into a computer system.
Buffy And they're hooked into us.
Cordelia Oh, God, get rid of these things!
Buffy I need some wet toilet paper.
Cordelia Yeah! That'll help.
Boss Transmitting coordinates now.
Boss They're fifty feet away.
Boss Axis six degrees by forty-three.
Boss I have them both in range.
Boss I have the targets together, twenty feet north and stationary. Final position is locked. Fire when ready.
Boss Both targets seven degrees by thirty-five.
Boss Adjust! Right ten degrees! Fire!
Boss I won!
Mayor_Wilkins Hello! Nice to meet you.
Trick Yeah, hi, it's a pleasure. Where am I?
Mayor_Wilkins In my office. I'm Richard Wilkins. I'm the Mayor of Sunnydale. And you're... Mr. Trick. Please, sit down.
Mayor_Wilkins That's an exciting suit.
Trick Well, clothes make the man.
Mayor_Wilkins Well, as I understand it, you're not a man... exactly. Mr. Trick, I've been the Mayor for quite some time. I like things to run smoothly. This is a very important year for me.
Trick Election year.
Mayor_Wilkins Something like that.
Trick If this is the part where you tell me that I don't fit in here in your quiet little neighborhood, you can just skip it 'cause, see, that all got old long before I became a vampire. Do you know what I'm saying?
Mayor_Wilkins Do you have children? Children are the heart of a community. They need to be looked after. Controlled. The more rebellious element needs to be dealt with. The children are our future. We need them. *I* need them.
Trick If this rebellious element means who I think it does, then that problem may be taken care of this very night.
Mayor_Wilkins So I've heard. That's a very enterprising idea you have: SlayerFest. I love that name, by the way. You see, *that's* the kind of initiative I need on my team.
Trick What if I don't wanna be a part of the team?
Mayor_Wilkins Oh, no, that won't be an issue.
Mayor_Wilkins See, you and I are gonna get along very well. Moist towelette?
Devon Hey, guys, the moment we've all been waiting for.
Willow They're gonna announce the Queen. Where are they? What's keeping them?
Oz I'm gonna go with mud wrestling.
Xander Oh, God! What did you two do to each other?
Buffy Long story.
Cordelia Got hunted.
Buffy Apparently not that long.
Buffy Tell you one thing, though: you don't wanna mess with Cordelia.
