Willow Obscurate nos non diutius.
Translation Do not conceal any longer.
Buffy Now!
Giles I think that was the last.
Buffy Willow, you okay?
Willow Yeah, I'm fine. Th-the shaking is, is a side effect of the fear.
Giles Thank you.
Buffy Well, if it wasn't for that clouding spell...
Willow Yeah, it went good! Nothing melted like last time.
Faith These babes were wicked rowdy. What's their deal?
Giles I wish I knew.
Giles Most of my sources have dried up since the, uh, Council has relieved me of my duties. I was aware there was a nest here, but quite frankly, I expected it to be vampires. These, these are new.
Buffy And improved.
Giles Yes. I'm sorry. I should've had you better prepared, and I should never have allowed Willow and, uh... And, uh...
Xander I'm good. We're fine. Just a little bit dirty. Good show, everyone. Just great. I think we have a hit.
Willow Are you okay?
Xander Tip-top, really. If anyone sees my spine laying around, just try not to step on it.
Buffy Xander, one of these days, you're gonna get yourself hurt.
Faith Or killed.
Buffy Or both. A-and, you know, with the pain and the death, maybe you shouldn't be leaping into the fray like that. M-maybe you should be... fray-adjacent.
Xander Excuse me? Who, at a crucial moment, distracted the lead demon by allowing her to pummel him about the head?
Faith Yeah. That was real manly how you shrieked and all.
Xander I think you'll find that was more of a bellow.
Buffy Uh, what do we do with the trio here? Should we burn them?
Willow I brought marshmallows.
Willow Occasionally, I'm callous and strange.
Giles I expect we can leave them. I'm more interested in finding out what they are, and whether we can expect more of their kind.
Buffy I hope not. They're *way* too fit.
Xander I say bring 'em on!
Giles Uh, Xander, I think in the future perhaps it would be best if you, you, uh, h-hung back to the rear of the battle, you know, for your own sake.
Xander But, gee, Mr. White, if Clark and Lois get all the good stories, I'll *never* be a good reporter.
Giles Hmm?
Xander Jimmy Olsen joke, sir. Pretty much gonna be lost on you, huh?
Giles Sorry.
Xander Hey, it's okay.
Xander Hey, Doug, pass me one!
Xander Les-man, I'm open!
Xander Les, buddy!
Xander Doug, right here, man. Right here.
Xander Doug, please!
Xander Alright! It's all me!
Xander Boy, I am *so* sorry. Doug's arm is kinda like spaghetti. We're all so very sad for him. Is your lunch okay?
Jack What are you, retarded?
Xander No! No, I had to take that test when I was seven. A little slow in some stuff, mostly math and spatial relations, but certainly not challenged or anything. Can I get you another soda?
Jack I oughtta cut your face open.
Xander Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa... It was an accident. Cool down.
Jack You wanna be startin' somethin'?
Xander What? Starting something? Like that Michael Jackson song, right? That was a lot of fun. 'Too high to get over, yeah, yeah...' Remember that fun song?
Jack I get my buddies together, we're gonna kick your ass till it's a brand-new shape.
Jack Now get outta here.
Doug Yo, man, the ball!
Cordelia Boy, of all the humiliations you've had I've witnessed, that was the latest.
Xander I could've taken him.
Cordelia Oh, please. O'Toole would macrame' your face. He is a psycho. Which is still a lot cooler than being a wuss.
Xander Why is it that I've come face-to-face with vampires, demons, the most hideous creatures Hell ever spit out, and I'm still afraid of a little bully like Jack O'Toole?
Cordelia Because, unlike all those creatures that you've come face-to-face with, Jack actually noticed you were there.
Xander Why am I surprised by how comforting you're not?
Cordelia It must be really hard when all your friends have, like, superpowers Slayer, werewolf, witches, vampires and you're, like, this little nothing. You must feel like Jimmy Olsen.
Xander I was just talking to... Hey, mind your own business!
Cordelia Ooo, I struck a nerve. The boy that had no cool.
Xander I happen to be an integral part of that group. I happen to have a *lot* to offer.
Cordelia Oh, please.
Xander I do!
Cordelia 'Integral part' of the group? Xander, you're the, the *useless* part of the group. You're the Zeppo. 'Cool.' Look it up. It's something that a sub-literate that's repeated twelfth grade three times has, and you don't.
Cordelia There was no part of that that wasn't fun.
Xander But... It's just that it's buggin' me, this 'cool' thing. I mean, what is it? How do you get it? Who doesn't have it? And who decides who doesn't have it? What is the essence of cool?
Oz Not sure.
Xander I mean, you yourself, Oz, are considered more or less cool. Why is that?
Oz Am I?
Xander Is it about the talking? You know, the way you tend to express yourself in short, noncommittal phrases?
Oz Could be.
Xander I know! You're in a band! That's like a business-class ticket to cool with complementary mojo after takeoff! I gotta learn an instrument. Is it hard to play guitar?
Oz Not the way I play it.
Xander Okay, but on the other hand: eighth grade. I'm taking the fl√ºgelhorn and gettin' *zero* trim. So the whole instrument thing could be a mislead. But you need a thing, one thing nobody else has. What do I have?
Oz An exciting new obsession. Which I feel makes you very special.
Xander Now with the mocking. Which I can handle because I know I'm right about this. I'm on the track. I just need to find my thing.
Oz It seems like you're over-thinking it. I mean, you got some identity issues. It's not...
Giles The end of the world?
Buffy Can they do that?
Giles They seem fairly committed. The Sisterhood of Jhe is an Apocalypse cult. They exist solely to bring about the world's destruction, and we've not seen the last of them. More will follow.
Buffy And they're here in Sunnydale for what? Demon Expo?
Giles Buffy, this is no laughing matter.
Buffy Hence my no laughing.
Giles I'm sorry. I know I'm no longer your official Watcher, but...
Oz Hey.
Buffy Hey.
Giles Um, y-you're cutting it a bit close.
Oz Well, you know me.
Buffy Well, do we know why they're here?
Giles I think so. Based on some artifacts I, I found with them, and, um, taking into account the current astral cycle...
Buffy Giles, I don't need to see the math.
Giles They intend to open the Hellmouth.
Buffy The Hellmouth. The one that opens...
Giles About twenty feet from where you're standing.
Willow And if it opens?
Buffy Do you remember the demon that almost got out the night I died?
Willow Every nightmare I have that doesn't revolve around academic failure or public nudity is about that thing. In fact, once I dreamt that it attacked me while I was late for a test and naked.
Buffy Well, it'll be the first to come out, and Giles says it won't be the worst by a long shot. The world will be overrun with demons if we don't stop it.
Willow Do we know when this is supposed to happen?
Buffy Giles is trying to narrow it down. I-if you're up for it, we're heading into deep research mode.
Willow I'd be offended if you haven't already counted me in.
Buffy Thanks, Will. There's something about this one that... scares me. I need my Willow.
Willow Oh, you don't have to be afraid...
Xander You girls need a lift?
Buffy What is this?
Xander What do you mean, what is it? It's my *thing*.
Willow Your thing?
Xander My *thing*!
Buffy Is this a penis metaphor?
Xander It's my thing that makes me cool. You know, that makes me unique. I'm Car Guy. Guy with the car.
Willow How can you afford it?
Xander Uncle Roary stacked up the DUIs, let me rent this bad boy till he's mobile again.
Buffy Well, i-it's nice.
Xander Could you sound a little less enthused?
Buffy Sorry.
Willow Evil.
Xander Big?
Buffy Biggest. Maybe more than I can handle.
Xander Then we'll handle it together. You know I'm here for you. Just tell me what I can do.
Xander I'll take two glazed, two cinnamon, couple cream-filled, and a jelly. No, no, let's round that out to four jellies.
Cordelia Ooo, is some evil going on? Must be big for them to entrust you with this daredevil mission.
Xander Cordelia. Feel free to drop dead of a wasting disease in the next twenty seconds.
Cordelia Ooo, again, I strike the nerve. I am the surgeon of mean.
Xander I'm kinda busy right now, okay?
Cordelia Right. Buffy needs your help. Can you say 'expendable'?
Xander You think you know everything.
Cordelia I think I know you.
Xander That's a laugh.
Cordelia Oh, what, you got a shiny car, and now you're someone new? Like anybody even cares about...
Lysette Is that your car?
Xander Why, uh... Yes! It is!
Lysette '57 Chevy Bel Air... 283 CID... Solid lifter... Fuel-injected V-8...
Xander Uh... very possibly.
Lysette How does she handle?
Xander Like a dream about warm, sticky things.
Xander Would you like to go for a little drive?
Lysette You busy?
Xander Just gotta drop this stuff off, and then I would describe myself as... expendable.
Lysette ...and then I started seeing Dave Peck. Had a Thunderbird, engine completely tricked out, but the upholstery was kind of shot. So then I started seeing his friend Mike. Not the Mike with the Mercedes. The Mike with the Mustang. An '82 V-6. You know the look.
Xander Angel!
Xander Buddy! Friend-buddy. You wanna sit and talk?
Angel I'm looking for Buffy.
Xander Library, last I saw.
Angel Something's happening. I've seen portents.
Xander The Apocalypse. They're on top of it.
Angel I don't think they know what they're dealing with.
Xander Let's go there... and tell them that.
Angel No. It's best you stay out of harm's way.
Xander But I can help!
Lysette Hey, you wanna go for another drive?
Xander Y'know, it's not like I haven't helped before. Y'know, I've done some quality violence for those people. Do they even think about that?
Xander I mean... they act like I'm, like I'm some sorta klutz.
Xander Oh, God! Are you alright?
Xander Oh, God! Stay calm. Little fender bender. It's not...
Xander ...the end of the world.
Willow He's cranky.
Buffy It's a good night for it.
Willow Can't dogs sense when there's an earthquake, a-a-and they bark? Or cows lie down or something?
Buffy 'Sisterhood of Jhe. Race of female demons, fierce warriors...' Eww. '...celebrate victory in battle by eating their foes.' They couldn't just pour Gatorade on each other?
Giles The Council wouldn't even take my calls. Idiots. Anything useful in the books?
Buffy Not wildly.
Willow We still have the Books of Pherion to go through.
Buffy I'm getting itchy feet, Giles. We don't turn up something soon, I'm gonna hit the streets. Maybe check out Willy's.
Giles Fine.
Willow Where are you going?
Giles Um, to try and contact the Spirit Guides. They exist out of time, but have knowledge of the future. I have no idea if they will respond to my efforts, but I have to try. All we know is that the fate of the entire world rests on it. Did you eat all the jellies?
Buffy Did you want a jelly?
Giles I always have a jelly. I'm always the one that says 'let's have a jelly in the mix.'
Willow We're sorry. Buffy had three.
Giles No matter. If Xander makes another run...
Buffy No. Xander's out of this. He nearly got killed last time we fought. This whole thing will be easier if we know he's safe.
Xander Oh, gosh, Jack, man, are, are you okay? I am really sorry about that. But your car came out of nowhere.
Jack I was parked.
Xander Exactly. Look, I can cover the damages. I don't have insurance in the strictest sense of the word, but I have a little money. The important thing is that we're alright and we can work this out like two reasonable...
Xander ...frontiersmen.
Jack Where do you want it?
Xander What?
Jack Where do you want it?
Xander I'm fairly certain I don't want it at all, but, uh, thank you.
Lysette Wow. Cool knife.
Xander Yeah. Great knife. Although I think, uh, it may technically be a, a sword.
Jack She's called 'Katie'.
Xander You gave it a girl's name. How very serial killer of you. Listen, I think we should be going.
Jack Are you scared?
Xander Would that make you happy?
Jack Your woman looking on, you can't stand up to me? Don't you feel pathetic?
Xander Mostly I feel Katie.
Jack You know what the difference between you and me is?
Xander Again... Katie's springing to mind.
Jack Fear. Who has the least fear.
Xander And it has nothing to do with who has the big, sharp...
Jack Come on.
Lysette I wanna go for a drive. I'm bored.
Xander Oh, gee, I'm really sorry my life-and-death situation isn't *exciting* enough for you...
Police_Officer Hey!
Police_Officer What's goin' on?
Jack Nothing. Just rasslin'.
Police_Officer O'Toole. What a surprise. He attack you?
Xander No. Just blowing off steam. Two guys rasslin'. But not in a gay way.
Police_Officer Do it somewhere else, huh?
Xander What?
Jack That was alright. Could've narc'd on me. Didn't do it. That's decent of you. I like you.
Xander Yay?
Jack You two wanna have some fun?
Lysette Like, with driving?
Jack Yeah.
Xander What do you have in mind?
Jack Well, I was on my way to get the boys. Gonna cruise around. We'll take your wheels.
Xander What about your car?
Jack It ain't mine.
Xander Great. Where to?
Jack Gonna get the boys!
Xander Yeah. So, where're the boys?
Jack He calls forth the Spirit of Uurthu, the restless. No one shall speak. He shall arise! Hear me...
Jack The blood of the Earth shall restore him...
Jack And he shall arise.
Jack Shall arise!
Bob Buddy.
Jack Bob.
Jack You big, hideous corpse... Come here!
Xander I'll call ya!
Bob Man! You *raised* me!
Jack I *told* you grandpappy could work that mojo. Big Bob is back in action!
Bob Yes!
Bob Oh, man, I can't believe you raised me! That is so awesome! You are the coolest.
Xander Maybe I should just let you guys catch up.
Jack Bob, this is Xander. He's our wheel man.
Bob Hey.
Xander Howdy.
Bob Dude, where are the other guys? We gotta go get 'em.
Jack Absolutely.
Bob Alright.
Xander Are, um... Are all your friends dead?
Jack Xander, let's roll.
Bob How long I been down?
Jack Eight months. I had to wait till the stars aligned.
Bob Oh, eight months. I got some catching up to do.
Bob Whoa! Walker, Texas Ranger. You been taping 'em?
Jack Every ep.
Bob Alright. We're gonna get the guys together, and we're gonna PARTY, man! It's gonna be a night to remember! Yeah!
Xander I'm sensing that.
Jack The blood of the Earth shall restore him, and he shall arise.
Dickie Dudes!
Giles Noli me renuere, umbra ducens. Sapienta manium super me effundatur.
Translation Do not deny me, Spirit Guide. Let the wisdom of those who have passed be showered upon me.
Spirit_Guides Illae res occultae sunt tempoti et locis obscuris. Enuntiare illas Chaos super orbem vivum terrarum ferat.
Translation These secrets belong to time and the dark regions. To reveal them would bring Chaos down upon the living Earth.
Giles Belua propulsanda est! Invenire vitium suum noster spes sola est!
Translation The Beast must be fought! Our only hope lies in finding its weakness!
Spirit_Guides Noli petere! Perturba nos non diutius!
Translation Seek not! Disturb us no longer!
Xander Giles, hey... What's goin' on?
Giles Oh, uh, I was just trying to, uh, gain access to the, um, Spirit Guides. Not going very well, I'm afraid. Uh, what are you doing here?
Xander Oh, we were just raising, um... some heck.
Jack Xander! Let's go!
Xander Listen, do you guys need any help?
Giles Hmm? Oh, no. Thank you. Uh, probably best if you, you stay out of trouble.
Xander No chance of that.
Jack Xander! Motor!
Giles There's something... different about this... menace, something in the air... The stench of death.
Xander Yeah, I think it's Bob.
Giles We may all be called upon to fight when it happens.
Xander When what happens, exactly?
Jack Come on!
Giles I better go. Um, hopefully, we shall have time to prepare. All we need is a few weeks.
Buffy Tonight?
Willy Before sunrise. That's what they said.
Buffy Why did they do this?
Willy They were looking for Angel.
Buffy Angel? Why?
Willy Said they were coming after you, too, and nothing could stand in their way because tonight was the night...
Willy Oh, man...
Buffy The ambulance is on its way.
Willy Look, kid, my clientele ain't exactly nuns and orphans, but I... I never seen anything like these demons.
Buffy I'm gonna stop them.
Willy That Hellmouth opens they're gonna be the least of your problems is my train of thought.
Willy If I were you... I'd go find Angel... go somewhere quiet together. I'd be thinking about how I wanna spend my last night on Earth.
Bob LET'S GET SOME BEER! YEAH!
Parker Dude! Let's go pick up some girls, man. We'll hang out at Taco Bell, get some girls, go cruise around...
Dickie I wanna bake a cake.
Bob Hey, we need some beers, though.
Parker I can't believe you got shot, man. Was it them Jackals?
Jack Are you kidding? We wiped them out after they threw you off the bridge.
Parker Oh, man. You guys, you guys are the best, man. The best! I mean that.
Bob There's a liquor store. Little Armenian guy runs the place? He had a gun behind the counter.
Bob Hey... We should go kick his ASS!
Parker Yeah!
Bob YEAAAAAH!
Xander If you guys want me to drop you off somewhere, that's...
Jack Nah. You're with us now.
Parker Oh yeah, man, you on the team now, baby. Whoo-hoo!
Bob What're we gonna do?
Jack Well, I've heard some interesting suggestions, but I'm gonna have to go with Dickie's. Let's bake a cake.
Dickie Yeaaaaah!
Bob_and_Parker Yeaaaaah!
Jack Alright.
Jack You stay here and keep the motor running.
Xander Uh, this time of night, I'm pretty sure nothing's open.
Xander But they're always open for *crime*.
Xander Okay. Now I'm involved in crime. I'm the criminal element. Having a car sure is cool!
Willow Thank you. Sorry to wake you.
Shopkeeper No problem.
Xander Will!
Willow Xander, what are you doing here?
Xander Nothing. Certainly not crime. Wh-what about you?
Willow I-I needed supplies for a protection spell. Buffy called from Angel's. I-it's happening tonight.
Xander And that thing that's happening would be...?
Willow I-I can't stay. Buffy'll needs this.
Willow I love you, Xander.
Xander Okay, that's it. I'm gonna...
Jack Where you going?
Xander Look, something's just come up.
Jack You gonna bail on me? Is that it?
Dickie We got the cake mix!
Parker Where you wanna bake it?
Jack Xander's looking to leave.
Bob No way. We need a wheel man.
Jack Xander doesn't feel like he's part of the group.
Xander No. It's just I'm kinda busy!
Bob He doesn't feel like part of the group because he hasn't been initiated.
Jack Do you think he's ready?
Parker Oh, I think he's earned his stripes. I say we let him in, boys. Huh?
Dickie Woo-hoo!
Xander Great! I wanna be in the gang, sure!
Parker Alright! Yeah.
Jack That's the spirit.
Parker Yeah.
Xander What do I gotta do?
Jack You gotta die.
Xander Alright, guys, what... Let's just talk about this.
Parker Aw, you wanna be part of the gang now, don't you?
Xander Yes, yes, but I'm not *dying* to be in the gang, if you get the, um... the pun there.
Bob What? You're, you're too good to be dead?
Bob You got a problem with dead people?
Xander What about Jack? Jack's not dead.
Jack Drive-by three weeks ago.
Xander Oh, boy.
Jack Grandpappy found my body. I wasn't gone but ten minutes before he raised me. It's a rush, man.
Dickie Let's kill Xander. It'll be fun!
Parker Yeah, man, you could be a full-fledged member.
Jack Come on, Xander. Take it like a man.
Xander Alright, enough! You guys have had your fun, but you forgot about *one* thing.
Jack Get him!
Bob Damn him! There goes the wheels.
Parker He took all our stuff, man.
Dickie I wanna bake a cake.
Jack It's alright. We'll get more. The night is young.
Xander I'd say that's pretty much enough excitement for one evening.
Xander Get in!
Xander You think Demon Mama followed us?
Faith No, we're cool. The bitch dislocated my shoulder, though.
Faith Hold me.
Faith That's better. She got me really wound up.
Faith A fight like that and... no kill... I'm about ready to pop.
Xander Really? Pop?!
Faith You up for it?
Xander Oh, I'm up.
Xander I'm suddenly *very* up. It's just, um... I've never been up with people before.
Faith Just relax... And take your pants off.
Xander Those two concepts are antithetical.
Faith Don't worry. I'll steer you around the curves.
Xander Did I mention that I'm having a very strange night?
Faith That was great. I gotta shower.
Willow I've never seen him like this.
Giles It's the Hellmouth. He can sense it's going to open. Be ready just in case.
Giles Now don't hesitate.
Willow Do it.
Giles Now Oz...
Giles AGAIN!
Giles We've got to move him before he wakes up.
Willow Sorry. I hope you're not mad at me in the morning.
Xander Hey! They're not baking any cake.
Xander Long gone. Probably loaded with supplies. Gotta think.
Xander I can't believe I had sex. Okay, bombs. Already-dead guys with bombs. Oh, man, I'm outta my league! Buffy'll know what to do.
Buffy I don't know what to do.
Angel Then let me decide for you. I can face this thing.
Buffy You can't.
Angel Look, I, I can at least buy you enough time for Willow's spell to bind it.
Angel Buffy, this is worse than anything we've ever faced. It's the only way.
Buffy I can't watch you die again.
Angel I love you.
Buffy I love you.
Angel Nothing can change that. Not even death.
Buffy Don't talk to me like that! *You* may be ready to go, but *I* am not ready to lose you. Okay, this is my fight, and if you won't do it my way, then you're...
Xander Hey. I've got this, um... There's this, uh...
Xander It's probably a bad time.
Xander Can I help?
Xander Okay.
Xander Okay, I can work this out. I just got to figure out what they'd be likely to bomb.
Giles Terra, vente, ignis et pluvia. Cuncta quattuor numina, vos obsecro. Defendete nos a recente malo resoluto.
Translation Earth, wind, fire and rain. Linger four gods, we implore you. Defend us, immediately after I will release you.
Willow Okay. Oz is moved. He could barely walk after that mickey I gave him, but we made it. Is he gonna be alright there?
Giles Anywhere is safer than here. Um, help me with the candles.
Willow We're doing the binding spell from the Hebron's Almanac?
Giles Yes, but once it's ready, you're to stay back and let me finish the recitation. Don't argue. I want you safe. Who knows what's going to come up from beneath us.
Parker Whoo!
Jack This is gonna be large!
Parker Oh, yeah!
Xander Giles will know what to do. He's *way* more calm than Buffy.
Xander Okay, I got a plan.
Bob Hey, our wheels.
Parker Hey!
Parker Stop! C'mon, man! Stop!
Xander Where's the bomb?!
Parker It's in, it's in the high school!
Xander In the school where?!
Parker Oh, God, this really, really hurts!
Parker Stop!
Parker It's in the, it's in the boiler room.
Xander Alright. Now I'm gonna ask you this once, and you better pray you get the answer right.
Parker Okay, okay.
Xander How do I defuse...
Xander I probably should've left out that whole middle part.
Dickie He's headed for the school!
Jack There he is!
Xander Where's a Slayer when you need one?
Giles Oh, my God. It's grown.
Dickie Wow.
Jack C'mon, man!
Bob Which way?
Jack He couldn't have gotten far. Let's split up.
Bob Good for chopping.
Bob Now this is what I call fun.
Xander Should've learned by now. If you're gonna play with fire, you gotta expect sooner or later...
Xander I wasn't finished!
Xander Note to self: less talk.
Buffy Faith! Go for the heart!
Xander Okay, boiler room.
Xander Other way.
Xander Hello, nasty.
Xander Less than two minutes. Dumb guy. Little bomb. How hard can it be?
Jack And it just got harder.
Xander I'm not leaving till that thing's disarmed.
Jack Then I guess you're not leaving.
Jack I'm gonna carve you up and serve you with gravy. You piss me off, boy. Now you pay the price. First the eyes, then the tongue. I'm gonna break every one of your fingers.
Xander You gonna do all that in forty-nine seconds?
Xander I know what you're thinkin'. Can I get by him? Get up the stairs, out of the building, seconds ticking away... I don't love your chances.
Jack Then you'll die, too.
Xander Yeah, looks like. So I guess the question really is... who has less fear?
Jack I'm not afraid to die. I'm already dead.
Xander Yeah, but this is different. Being blowed up isn't walking around and drinking with your buddies dead. It's little bits being swept up by a janitor dead, and I don't think you're ready for that.
Jack Are you?
Xander I like the quiet.
Giles Omnia... vasa... veritatis!
Translation All things... the vessel... of truth!
Giles Now, Buffy!
00 12, 00:11, 00:10, 00:09...
00 08, 00:07, 00:06...
00 05, 00:04...
00 03, 00:02...
Xander Good boy.
Xander I don't think I wanna be seeing you on campus anymore, Jack.
Jack I'm not going anywhere, Harris. The first time you turn your back...
Willow Even after the Hellmouth was closed, you could still hear it screaming.
Oz But Angel's gonna be okay?
Buffy He was only out for a few minutes. Longest of my life.
Willow I will never forget that thing's face. Its *real* face, I mean.
Giles Yes.
Buffy I don't know how you managed. It was the bravest thing I've ever seen.
Giles Stupidest.
Giles But the world continues to turn.
Willow No one will ever know how close it came to stopping. Never know what we did.
Xander Guys...
Willow Xander. Boy, you're lucky you weren't at school last night. It was crazed.
Xander Well, uh, gimme the quiet life. I'm gonna grab a snack. Anyone want?
Giles No, thank you.
Xander Oz?
Oz No. I'm oddly full today.
Xander Okay.
Cordelia Ooo, look, it's Mr. Excitement. On another life-or-death doughnut mission, or are we just cruising for bimbos again, giving them lessons in lack of cool?
Cordelia What?
Cordelia What?
Cordelia What?!
