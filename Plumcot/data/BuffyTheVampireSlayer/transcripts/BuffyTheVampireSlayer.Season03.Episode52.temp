BUFFY You demons can't resist a run and stumble, can you?
BUFFY One down, one... gone.
WILLOW So scabby demon got away?
BUFFY Scabby demon number two got away. Scabby demon number one, bigcheck in the slay column.
WILLOW I don't like this whole no mouth thing. It's disquieting.
BUFFY Well, no mouth means no teeth. Unless they have them somewhereelse...
GILES Here we go, we've been researching the, uh, mayor's forthcomingascension.
OZ It's pretty riveting stuff.
BUFFY What do we know?
XANDER What don't we know. Tell her Giles.
GILES Based upon the supposed date, graduation day, and the mayor beingimpervious to harm, I've cross referenced-
XANDER He's a cross-referencing fool.
GILES And I've eliminated several possibilities. It's not the ritualflaying of the demon Azarath nor the, uh ... I don't know what's goingto happen.
OZ That was kind of an anti-climax.
BUFFY We don't know anything? The whole fake Angel thing was for nothing?
GILES No, no, no. If nothing else Angel's charade has brought Faith'streachery to the open and this information on the ascension will proveuseful eventually, I just need to put it together. We see Buffy scratchingat her hand as Wesley enters, looking dapper as ever.
WESLEY Terribly sorry, I was detained. Official counsel business. Mr.Giles, you were speaking?
GILES I was just filling Buffy in on my progress regarding the researchon the acension.
WESLEY Oh, and what took up the rest of the minute?
GILES Touche. Of course, my work is un- official. I'm sure, however,with the resources of the council at your disposal, you will have somethingto add.
WESLEY Well, I am pleased to state, with certainty, that the demonAzarath will not in any way be involved... The whole gang, minus Gilesgets up and heads out of the library, leaving Wesley standing at the headof the table.
WESLEY I'm sure we'll find out more soon.
GILES Demon Azarath?
WILLOW So have you talked to Angel lately?
BUFFY Not really. Seeing him bad, even pretend bad, and with Faith...
WILLOW He only kissed her for the greater good.
BUFFY I don't know. To the naked eye it looked like fun. Or maybe itwasn't. Maybe he wasn't even tempted. I just wish I could be sure.
WILLOW As always, I advise you to ask.
BUFFY Think he'd tell me?
RANDOM STUDENT Hogan! Cut to Percy walking towards Willow and Buffywith Hogan, who, like Percy is wearing a letterman's jacket. Student goesup to Hogan and shakes his hand.
RANDOM STUDENT Great game man. Xander joins Buffy and Willow.
XANDER Hogan Martin thinks he's sooooo hot. Like we should all be awedby him cuz he can put a ball in the net.
HOGAN Hey Xander.
XANDER He said my name! He knows my name!
PERCY Hey Will. Hogan and Percy stop at the Scooby Gang.
WILLOW Hi.
PERCY Um, look, I can't make the study session after school. Ummmm,can we do it 5th period?
WILLOW Ok. Did you finish the reading?
PERCY Most of it.
WILLOW Percy.
PERCY I'll finish it at lunch.
WILLOW That's my litttle trooper
HOGAN I don't know what you're doing to him. I actually heard him completea sentence. It had a clause and everything.
PERCY You're watching the game, right?
WILLOW Wouldn't miss it!
XANDER See ya Hogan. The basketball guys leave. Xander leaves too,heading down the hall the opposite way. Buffy and Willow walk together.
BUFFY You're going to the game? I didn't know you liked basketball.
WILLOW I didn't either. But I really started getting into it. Especiallynow that we're in the championship. It's so exciting. Too bad you're patrolling,we're all going. Oz, Xander, everybody. Willow turns and heads off to class.
BUFFY Great, everybody who isn't currently Buffy. Buffy scratches herhand again.
GILES You touched one of the demons? Buffy examines her hand undera magnifying lamp.
BUFFY A good touch, not a bad touch. Anyway, it's been itching likecrazy. No big, just anotherproblem for the good people at Lubriderm, right? Giles finds a pictureof the demon. He set the book down in front of Buffy.
GILES That's the demon in question?
BUFFY In the disgusting flesh.
GILES Hmm. He picks the book back up and steps away from her, readingit.
BUFFY What?
GILES It says they can infect the host.
BUFFY Infect? Infect? Giles is still reading.
BUFFY GILES! INFECT?!
GILES Oh um, infect the host with an aspect of the demon. That's allit says. BUFFY An aspect of the demon?
GILES It's rather terse isn't it?
BUFFY You mean like a part of it?
GILES There could be any number of explainations for your hand. A newfabric softner can cause irritation. In any case, I would advise not toattempt to track the one that got away. Let's minimize your exposure.
BUFFY Part of the demon? I hope it's not the outside part.
CHEERLEADERS H. O. G. A. N. It's Hogan. Goooo, Hogan. Everyone clapsand cheers as Hogan steps out.
BUFFY Is it me or is this really lame?
OZ I don't know. I usually enjoy lameness, and this is leaving me kindacold.
WILLOW Well, according to Freddy's latesteditorial, 'the pep rally is a place for psuedo-prostitues to provoke meninto a sexual frenzy which, when thwarted, results in pointless athleticcompetition.'
XANDER And the downside being?
WILLOW The school paper is edging on depressing lately. You guys noticethat?
OZ I don't know. I always go straight to the obits.
WILLOW What are you doing Buffy?
BUFFY Nothing... Checking for horns. Buffy hops off the bench awayfrom them. Willow quickly goes after her and they stop to talk a shortdistance away from Oz and Xander who still watch the rally.
WILLOW Ah, you know, Buffy, I don't even think Giles is right aboutyou becoming like a demon. I mean he's totally burnt. You know, dealingwith faith and this ascension thing. Between you and me, he's not doinghis best work.
BUFFY What if he is right? I'm suddenly going to grow this demon partand we don't even know what it is. It could be claws or scales... Willow'sexpression turns shocked.
BUFFY What?
WILLOW Was it a boy demon?
CHEERLEADERS T. O. M. It's Tom. Goooo Tom.
XANDER They really are very good!
OZ Their spelling's improved.
XANDER You know Oz, I look at all this beauty, all these healthy youngwoman and I wonder why I ever wasted my time on Cordelia. I mean, lookat her. She's no better looking than the rest of them. OZ None of themare really my-
XANDER Oh my God, he's looking at her! Xander sees Wesley a distanceaway on the stairs, staring at Cordelia in awe.
XANDER He's got his filthy adult Pierce Brosny eyes all over my Cordy.Wesley shakes his head and continues up the stairs.
OZ You're a very complex man, aren't you? Back to Will and Buffy....
BUFFY It's just I'm scared Will. There's this thing in me and I can'tfind it. I can't stop it. What if it changes me. Not just the way I look.All of a sudden I could be something that's not me anymore.
CHEERLEADERS 7. 8. P. E. R. C. Y. It's Percy. Gooo Percy.
WILLOW Yeah, woohoo!...sorry, they spelled Percy, and, and, I have to show support-he'sneedy. But I heard what you were saying, really. And I would be frightenedtoo, but I'm sure you're gonna be okay.
BUFFY Still gotta mouth. She turns and is startled by Angel standingright behind her.
ANGEL Sorry.
BUFFY It's okay. I didn't see you so I should have known you were there.What are you doing here? A
NGEL It's a dangerous time. You know, with Faith.
BUFFY Yeah....Faith. She...well... Faith, what can ya say about her?They walk together.
ANGEL I just wanna make sure you're, you know, ok. That you're, safe.She stops and faces him.
BUFFY And the fact that you're right here, does that mean Faith's around?Are you keeping me safe by tracking me, or are you tracking her?
ANGEL I'm tracking you. Something's bothering you.
BUFFY A lot of things. They start walking again.
BUFFY The most recent being this demon. Actually, two. I touched oneof them and now I'm gonna get a big case of the bumpies, or a tail, orsomething.
ANGEL An aspect of the demon.
BUFFY You know the drill.
ANGEL By rumor. That doesn't mean anything. I mean, sometimes demons,they just exagerate their power.
BUFFY Demon hype. Maybe not. I spend all my time in the dark here anyway.It's not like I'd be at a gain you know with my friends where someone couldsee me and my new monster part. Angel grabs her arm and pulls her aroundto face him.
ANGEL Hey, I won't let anything happen to you if I can help it. Nomatter what, I'll always be with you. Hey, I'll love you even if you'recovered with slime.
BUFFY I liked everything until that part.
WILLOW Could you believe it? Right at the buzzer. Three points forthe win. They all sit down.
OZ It was intense.
XANDER Yeah, for a minute there I thought you're gonna make an expression.OZ Well, I felt one coming on. I won't lie.
WILLOW Man, I've never seen anyone jump like Hogan Martin. They shouldcall him the jumper.
XANDER Or a name that isn't an article of women's clothing. Hey, rememberwhen-
WILLOW Shhh.... Xander shuts up as Buffy approaches the group.
BUFFY Hmmm... quietness. We either lost, or we won and you don'twant me to feel bad.
WILLOW Well, yeah it wasn't a really good game.
XANDER Yeah tall hoops, with thin tall guys. What's the point? Cordeliawalks up to get something off a table nearby.
OZ Pretty dull.
CORDELIA Are you guys crazy? That was an incredible game! I've nevercheered so hard in my life. I still have knee marks on my back. From the pyramid.
WILLOW Yeah, well, I still bet patrolling was way better cause, wow,important.
BUFFY Well I thought I saw a four legged demon. But it was just a dog.
OZ A weredog?
BUFFY Regular
XANDER Tough luck. Xander looks at Cordy talking with her friends.
XANDER I wonder if she and Wesley have kissed.
BUFFY It really bugs you huh?
XANDER What? BUFFY Cordelia and Wesley, smooching.
XANDER Man, you read my mind. Slow zoom in on Buffy as she realizeswhat just happened.
MR. BEECH Ooo, whoa there. You watch where you're going now.
BUFFY I'm sorry Mr. Beech, I will.
MR. BEECH Students. If we could just getrid of all the students.
GEEKY MALE STUDENT When I'm a sophomore jillionaire and you'reall flipping burgers. Who's the loser then...
FEMALE STUDENT 'Maybe I'll take french, I said. How hard canit be, french babies learn it.' IDIOT!
SOME STUDENT WITH BAGGY PANTS I swear, someday my pants aregonna fall right off.
ANOTHER MALE STUDENT Buffy is so beautiful. She stops, givesa furtive glance at the guy.
ANOTHER MALE STUDENT I mean, look at that body. She raises herarm to shield a blush.
ANOTHER MALE STUDENT God, I would love to shove her againstthat locker right now and just oooh. She mentally freaks and hurries past.She almost bumps into another guy who looks at her. We don't hear his thoughtbut she breaks into a run.
BUFFY Is this the thing? The aspect thing? Because I gotta say, ifit is, it is way better than a tail. I mean, I have a hard enough timefinding jeans that fit right.
GILES Buffy, slow down. I'm not even convinced that this is genuinemind reading. You're most likely projecting your-
BUFFY When I walked in a few minutes ago, you thought 'Look at hershoes. If a fashion magazine told her to, she'd wear cats strapped to herfeet.
GILES I...um... GILES The demons are telepathic. I should haveknown. That's why they didn't need mouths.
GILES Of course, demons are telepathic!
BUFFY I know, you just told me. That's why they dont need mouths. Andyou should have known.
GILES This is astounding.
BUFFY It was happening out in the hallway. Principal Snyder has WalkLike an Egyption stuck in his head. And the boys at this school are seriouslydisturbed. It's wierd, but Giles, think about it. Think about what I coulddo.
GILES It could be very useful. You could anticipate your opponent'severy move. Turn his plans against him.
BUFFY Oh, way better than that. Cut to Buffy in literature class.
BUFFY Jealousy! Willow is seated to her right, with Xander behind her.Nancy, annoying miss-know-it-all is to Buffy's left. The teacher walksaround the room.
TEACHER Buffy. Right. Very good.
NANCY I knew that.
TEACHER Jealousy clearly is the tool that Iago uses to undo Othello.But what's his motivation? What reason does Iago give for destroying hissuperior officer?
NANCY Cassio has my place. Twix my sheets, he's done my office.
BUFFY Well, he was passed over for promotion. Cassio was picked insteadand people were saying that Othello slept with his wife.
WILLOW Buffy did the reading? Buffy understood the reading?
XANDER When did she study? Was I supposed to study? Ms. Murray'skinda hot.
NANCY I was gonna say Cassio. Uh, I hate her.
TEACHER Any other reason.
NANCY Race!
TEACHER Uh... good Nancy. Can't overlook that. Boy sitting at Willow'sright,
FREDDY Look at them, scrambling for the teacher's praise likepigeons for thrown bread crust Buffy turns.
BUFFY Will, who's that guy.
WILLOW That's Freddy Iverson. He writes those editorials for the schoolpaper. He's sardonic.
FREDDY Bread crusts. That's deep. I should write thatdown. Buffy turns and looks back at the teacher, now at the front of theroom.
TEACHER There's something else at work here.
BUFFY Well, he, um, he sort of admits himself that his motive are...spurious! He, um, he does things because he, he enjoys them. It's likehe's not, he's not really a person. He's a, the dark half of Othello himself.
WILLOW Huh...
XANDER Woah! The teacher steps out from behind her desk andapproaches Buffy.
TEACHER Buffy. Really. Very astute. I said something quite like thatin my dissertation.
BUFFY I know. Uh, I mean... I agree. With that.
TEACHER Yes, and doesn't that also explain Othello's readiness to believeIago. Within seconds he turns on Desdomona. Camera moves in on Buffy asthe teacher speaks.
TEACHER He believes that she's been unfaithful. And we're all likethat. We all have our little internal Iagos, that tell us our husbandsor our girlfriends or whatever, don't really love us. But you never reallysee what's in someone's heart.
BUFFY Oooh sorry. Sorry about the daytime. I just ducked out of schooland that's when they have it. They head into the main room.
BUFFY Um...you look good. I mean, I, I know I saw you last night, butsometimes things can change really quick. They sit down on the couch
BUFFY I mean really quick. Listen to me. I'm talking like Faith Hiseyes snap to hers, then he looks down again.
BUFFY You know, not that she was so bad to have around... You know,before the evil... You know, I think she was hurting a lot. And some people,protective type people, might be drawn to that I guess... Well, the thingabout Faith-
ANGEL You can't get into my mind.
BUFFY How did you...why not?
ANGEL It's like the mirror. The thoughts are there, but they createno reflection in you. You got the aspect of the demon.
BUFFY Yeah, Giles doesn't know how long it's gonna last. It's OK, alittle headachy, but...
ANGEL You don't have to play games with me Buffy. Ever.
BUFFY Well, you're not exactly Joe-here's- what-I'm-thinking.
ANGEL So ask me.
BUFFY Oh, but that woulda made sense.
ANGEL What do you wanna know about? Faith? How I felt kissing her,pretending to have no soul? Watching you suffer?
BUFFY Well, since you bring it up...
ANGEL I hated hurting you, more than I could stand.
BUFFY Look, the thing about Faith, I'd understand. You know, she has,you know, that whole bad girl thing working for her.
ANGEL Kissing her meant nothing. I don't want a bad girl. I've donethat before. I've lived a long time Buffy, and I'm past that. I've beenwith dozens of girls like her. More.
BUFFY Oh this honesty stuff is funnn.
ANGEL I mean, there's no comparison. In two-hundred-forty-three years,I've loved exactly one person.
BUFFY Ohh...it is me right?
ANGEL Next time, just ask.
BUFFY Ok.
ANGEL And Buffy, be careful with this gift. A lot of things that seemstrong and good and powerful, they can be painful.
BUFFY Like say, immortality?
ANGEL Exactly, I'm dying to get rid of that.
BUFFY Funny.
ANGEL I'm a funny guy.
XANDER She can read our minds? Our every impulse and fantasy.
BUFFY Every one.
XANDER Oh god.
CORDELIA I don't see what this has to do with me.
CORDELIA I don't see what this has to do with me.
WILLOW Well, I think it's great. Right? I mean, you enjoy your otherslayer powers.
BUFFY Yeah, and it'll be fun. Did you see Nancy Doyle's face in EnglishClass today?
WILLOW Yeah, she's supercompetitive, and you really showed her.
WILLOW She's hardly even human anymore. How can I be her friendnow? She doesn't need me.
BUFFY No! I do need you.
CORDY Ok, what are you talking about? Because you are soooo creepyright now.
GILES Um...I think there must be some precedence for occurrences suchas this. Uh, I'll research it. Wesley, can you give me a hand?
WESLEY Of course. Where do you think we should start?
OZ I am my thoughts. If they exist in her, Buffy contains everythingthat is me and she becomes me. I cease to exist.
OZ Hmm...
XANDER What am I gonna do? I think about sex all the time! Sex!Help! 4 times 5 is thirty. 5 times 6 is 32. Naked girls. Naked Women! NakedBuffy! Oh stop me!
BUFFY God Xander! Is that all you think about?
XANDER Actually... bye. Xander runs from the library.
WESLEY Xander has just illustrated something. Chances are, you're allgoing to be thinking whatever you least want Buffy to hear. It's a question,of course, of mental discipline.
GILES He's right. There are...
WESLEY Look at Cordelia. No! Don't look at Cordelia! She'sa student! Oh I am a bad man. I'm a bad, bad man! Buffy gazes intentlyat him.
WESLEY Excuse me. Wesley exits into Giles' office.
WILLOW What's it like Buffy?
BUFFY I don't know. It's a little wierd. But... Look, please, don'tfor a second think that I don't need you, because I do. I want to sharethis with you. It's like all these doors are opening to all these littleworlds, and I can just walk right inside.
OZ No one else exists either. Buffy is all of us. We think.Therefore, she is.
WILLOW She knows so much. She knows what Oz is thinking. I neverknow that. Before long, she'll know him better than I do.
BUFFY No, don't think that.
WILLOW I can't help it Buffy. I'm sorry, I just can't. Willow getsup and runs from the library.
OZ If you don't need me, I'm gonna follow the red-head. Oz leaves also.
BUFFY Guess I won't be writing that book, 'GainingFriends through Telepathy.'
CORDELIA Whatever. I wonder when I can go.
CORDELIA Whatever. Can I go?
WESLEY Excuse me. Can you hearme thinking in here? I could go out into the hall.
BUFFY You know what? You stay. I'm getting a headache. I'll go.Buffy grabs her stuff and exits. Dissolve from concerned Giles to Buffywalking down the crowded hallway. She hears numerous thoughts all run together.
THOUGHTS She is so hot! I hate my body. No one is ever gonnalove me. What if I never get breasts? I can't beleive the test is today.He has the cutest butt. She passes Nancy.
NANCY Hmph, I hate her.
GILES Here. It's happened before. A man in Ecudaor. Quite recently.
WESLEY Can we contact him?
GILES I'd say not. He can't communicate with anyone.
WESLEY Dead?
GILES No, he's in complete isolation. The power he can't shut itoff.
THOUGHTS It's gotta get better. Please tell me it gets better.I hate school.
JONATHAN Am I normal?
JONATHAN Are you through with the mashed potatoes? Buffy looks at him.
JONATHAN She doesn't even know I'm here. Look at everybody,none of this matters. Buffy steps away from him to walk into the cafeteria.
THOUGHTS Come on! Come on! She's a loser. She has the sweetestface I've ever seen. Oh my god, quiet down. If I stand just in the rightspot, I can probably see into the arm hole of her top.
EVIL VOICE This time tomorrow, I'll kill you all!
STUDENT She's gone nuts. She turns and grabs another girl walkingby.
GIRL I hate being here. She grabs and looks at more people asthe thoughts blare. She grabs and looks at Jonathan. J
ONATHAN She touched me.
WILLOW I think she's waking up now.
OZ She's ok.
GILES Oh thank god!
XANDER Her eyes are opening.
CORDELIA I'm cold.
GILES You alright?
CORDELIA I told them not to move you. They probably severed your spinalcord.
BUFFY I'm ok. Buffy sits up.
GILES Buffy... Giles holds onto her.
BUFFY No really. I'm OK. Listen, there's a killer in the cafeteria.
XANDER See, I've been saying for years that the lunch lady's gonnado us all in with that Mulligan Stew.
CORDELIA Xander.
XANDER I mean, what the hell's a Mulligan?
BUFFY Someone was thinking about it. They thought 'This time tomorrow,I'll kill you all.' I have to find them. Giles helps her up.
GILES Well, did you, uh, recognize a voice?
BUFFY No. WILLOW Boy or girl?
BUFFY I don't know. I mean, it was hardly human. It was full of somuch anger and pain. She starts to walk away from them. The cacophony oftheir thoughts intrudes.
THOUGHTS Annoying. It builds and she stumbles back. Giles keepsher from falling.
GILES Buffy, count.
BUFFY No, I have to find them.
XANDER Yeah, I mean, who hasn't just idly thought about taking outthe whole place with a semi-automatic? Everyone stares at Xander.
XANDER I said idly.
BUFFY I know the difference. He... she... whoever, they meant it. They'regonna do it.
GILES She looks so tired.
WILLOW How horrible.
CORDELIA I'm not getting any warmer.
XANDER I bet it was Hogan.
OZ Who could it be?
BUFFY Shut up!... Uh, I'm sorry. I, it's just,can you guys not think so loud? Or, so much...
GILES Buffy, you should go home. I, I'll take you home.
BUFFY Yeah, ok, wha-No! Look, I need you guys to go back to the cafeteria.Make a list of everyone who's there. We have to find the killer beforelunch tomorrow.
WILLOW We'll do it Buffy. A list of all the students.
BUFFY Yeah. Nancy was there. She's scary. And, uh, oh teachers too.Mr. Beech, he thought something about getting rid of all the students.
GILES Come on. Giles helps her away and the group walks the other way.
BUFFY I can't shut it out Giles. It's like this invasion of my head.It's like there's these strangers walking around in there. It's just a...Look at this, I can't even be around people anymore. Not that they're reallyclamboring to be near me anyway. Even you.
GILES I'm sorry Buffy. It's hard for all of us. Wesley and I are, arelooking for a way to help.
BUFFY I'll be okay right? I mean, even if you can't get rid of it?They reach the passenger side of Giles' car.
GILES You'll be fine. I promise. He steps away from her.
GILES If it doesn't go away she'll go insane. Buffy stops deadin her tracks, shocked at Giles' thoughts.
WILLOW I think we have everyone that was in the cafeteria. I'll dosome computer work. Match it against the FBI mass- murderer profiles. Seeif maybe we can rule some people out.
XANDER I'm still having trouble with the fact that one of us is justgonna gun everybody down for no reason.
CORDY Yeah, because that never happens in American High Schools.
OZ It's bordering on trendy at this point.
WILLOW Besides which, Sunnydale High, center of evil and all that.Let's get to work. We have till lunch time tomorrow. We hope.
JOYCE There, you look better already.
BUFFY Thanks mom. Joyce speeds out into the hallway.
JOYCE I'm uh, I'm just going to get you another pillow.
BUFFY I really don't need one. Joyce comes back in with the pillow.
JOYCE But you need another blanket.
BUFFY Uh, mom, I'm fine. Joyce grabs the blanket, comes backin.
JOYCE How about, some soup? Chicken and stars. She sets the blanketon the bed.
BUFFY Mom, please, just come sit with me. Joyce fidgets and steps backfrom the bed. J
OYCE I've uh, I've got laundry.
BUFFY Why are you...? You had sex with Giles?!
JOYCE 
BUFFY YOU HAD SEX WITH GILES?!
JOYCE It was the candy! We were teenagers!
BUFFY On the hood of a police car?!?
JOYCE I'll be downstairs.You feel better.
BUFFY TWICE!!!!
WILLOW Okay, I've taken our list and narrowed it down to a dozen strongsuspects. Here are your personalized assignments. She starts handing outworksheets.
XANDER Ooo, I was hoping there'd be assignments.
CORDY I think I should work with Wesley.
XANDER You have no shame.
CORDY Oh please, like shame has something to be proud of
WILLOW Today people! The three go to exit the library.
WILLOW Oh! Write neatly. And, and label your worksheets. Time
WILLOW Fantasy's are fun, aren't they Jonathan?
JONATHAN Uh... I guess.
WILLOW We all have fantasies that we're powerful, more respected. Wherepeople pay attention to us.
JONATHAN Uh... maybe.
WILLOW But sometimes the fantasy isn't enough, is it Jonathan? Sometimeswe have to make it so people don't ignore us. Make them pay attention.You know what I'm talking about, don't you?
JONATHAN Em, you... Want me to pay attention? Willow looks a littleflustered.
HOGAN This is for the yearbook?
OZ Yeah. Personality profile.
HOGAN Can you ask it again?
OZ Sure. Do you ever feel that you've created a false persona for yourself,'the guy who does everything right,' - and how much of a strain does itput on you to maintain it?
HOGAN Uh, wow, I guess... Moderate strain. Is that a good answer? Iwant to get this right.
OZ Yeah, that's good.
CORDELIA Hi Mr. Beech! I was just wondering, were you planning on killinga bunch of people tomorrow? Oh, it's for the yearbook!
XANDER Okay, so turnoff's include smoking, insensitive men, and burkenstocks.Now, your idea of a perfect evening? Katie, let's start with you.
OZ Uh, Freddy?
THOUGHTS I should have just quit, no job is worth it. Look athim smiling, like he thinks I don't know about her. I'm going to tell himwe're going to have a baby, Oh, I'm so happy! I can't beleive we're gettingaway with this. One more drink then I'll...
WESLEY Well, it seems to be coming along all right.
GILES Yes, Buffy's being driven mad, we have no proof that this isgoing to work, and it still requires the heart of the second demon, whichwe have no idea how to get without the slayer.
WESLEY Negative thinking doesn't solve problems.
GILES Who is going to get the demon heart? Burke.
NANCY Do I often imagine classmates are spying on me, or otherwiseacting suspiciously?
WILLOW Right.
NANCY Not until just now.
LARRY What? Talk louder dude.
XANDER I'm just saying, it's gotta be frustrating, having the secret.You gotta be kinda filling up with resentment, unexpressed rage, just waitingto burst out. Today at lunch...?
LARRY What secret? Being gay? Man, I'm out! I'm so outI got my grandma fixing me up with guys.
XANDER That's uh, nice.
LARRY But it sounds like, uh, you're having a rough time with it.
LARRY Look, just do it. That weird Freddy Iverson guy that does theschool paper-
XANDER He's gay?
LARRY No dude, but I bet he'd put in like a coming out announcementfor you. Something tasteful.
OZ Freddy.
WILLOW He's the only one we couldn't find?
OZ Yeah. Freddy Iverson.
CORDELIA The newspaper guy? But we can't figure out if it's him withoutthe worksheet, right?
XANDER We do have this people. Today's editorialtitled 'Big Game Draws Mindless Brain Dead Mob'
CORDELIA Does he mention the cheerleaders? Because we were on.
JOYCE I can't stand this. I keep wondering if I'm hurting her withmy thoughts.
GILES You're not. Not anymore. She can't pick one thought out of the...out of the din.
A knock comes from downstairs. They turn and bolt for downstairs. Wesleybeats them to door below. He opens it and a smoking figure covered in ablanket steps inside. The figure pulls off the blanket and we see it'sAngel. He holds a vial of glowing blue liquid.
ANGEL I got it.
BUFFY Uh, no.
ANGEL I'm gonna help you.
ANGEL Giles!
BUFFY Angel.
JOYCE Thank god! Are you all right? Do you hear thoughts?
BUFFY No. Did you find the killer?
FREDDY Ok Oz, you got me. What are you're friends gonna do? Hold me down?
WILLOW You better believe it buster! You can't threaten a big murderwithout getting us pretty darn ticked!
FREDDY Murder? What murder? You're not here about the review?
OZ The review?
FREDDY Yeah. Last Thursday. Freddy leafs through a paper on his desk,hands it to Oz.
OZ Dingoes Ate My Baby play their instruments as if theyhave plump polish sausages taped to their fingers.
FREDDY Sorry man.
OZ No, it's fair.
FREDDY I just get a lot of hate mail and I thought you were gonna comeand deliver some personaly.
XANDER Hey, if you find any tasteful announcement about me from Larry-
WILLOW Xander, we have to figure this out.
CORDELIA We have no shot. The killer could be anyone. We lose. Buffyenters behind the gang
BUFFY We still have a few minutes.
WILLOW Buffy!
XANDER You're okay. Can you hear thoughts?
BUFFY 
XANDER Just when I wasn't thinking about sex.
BUFFY Okay, here's the new plan. We're going to get Snyder to evacuatethe school. I just hope the killer's not waiting outside.
CORDELIA By this timetomorrow, you'll all know what I've done. I'm sure you understand thatI had to do it, and that although death is never easy, it's the only way.'God! Doesn't anyone write in to praise the Cheerleaders! We areso unsung.
WILLOW Jonathan! Oh, I had him in my grasp. Slippery weasel.
BUFFY Split up. Find him.
WILLOW Jonathan! Are you in here? Nope. She turns to run out.
XANDER Jonathan! Jonathan! He skids to a halt in the center of thecaf. Looks around. Sees something.
XANDER Ooo, Jello.
NANCY I could have done that.
JONATHAN Get away from me! Buffy slowly stands up.
BUFFY Ok Jonathan, you wanna point that somewhere else? He points therifle slightly to the side.
JONATHAN Don't you try and stop me!
BUFFY No, no no stopping.Just here for view. Hey, look, City Hall.
JONATHAN Go away!
BUFFY Never gonna happen.
JONATHAN You think I won't use this? BUFFY I don't know Jonathan. I just- JONATHAN Stop doing that!
BUFFY Doing what? J
ONATHAN Stop saying my name like we're friends! We're not friends!You all think I'm an idiot! A short idiot!
BUFFY I don't. I don't think about you much at all.Nobody here really does. Bugs you, doesn't it. You have all this pain,and all these feelings and nobody's really paying attention.
JONATHAN You think I just want attention?
BUFFY No. I think you're up in the clock tower with a high-poweredrifle because you wanna blend in. Believe it or not, Jonathan, I understandabout the pain.
JONATHAN Oh right. Cuz the burden of being beautiful and athletic,that's a crippler.
BUFFY You know what? I was wrong. You are an idiot. My life happensto, on occasion, suck beyond the telling of it. Sometimes more than I canhandle. And it's not just mine. Every single person down there is ignoringyour pain because they're too busy with their own.
BUFFY The beautiful ones. The popular ones. The guys that pick on you.Everyone.
BUFFY If you could hear what they were feeling. The loneliness. Theconfusion. It looks quiet down there. It's not. It's deafening. She turnsto face him.
BUFFY You know, I could've taken that by now.
JONATHAN I know.
BUFFY I'd rather do it this way. He thinks a moment,then hands her the rifle. She turns and pulls the bolt back, ejecting thebullet. She sets the gun down, then turns back to him.
JONATHAN I just wanted it to stop.
BUFFY Yeah, well, mass-murder, not really doctor recomended for thattype of pain. Besides, prison, you know, it's a lot like high school, onlyinstead of noogies- JONATHAN What are you talking about?
BUFFY Actions having consequences. You know, stuff like that.
JONATHAN I, I, I wouldn't ever hurt anybody.
BUFFY 
JONATHAN I came up here to kill myself.
XANDER RAT POISON! RAT POISON!
BUFFY Okay, let's calm down.
LUNCHLADY Vermin! You're all vermin. You come in here and you eat,and you eat. Filth!
BUFFY I don't see this being settled with logic.
WILLOW So you're feeling better about Angel?
BUFFY: Well, we talked, and then he ripped out the heart of a demonand fed it to me, and then we talked some more.
WILLOW See! That's how it should work! Giles walks up to them.
GILES Morning.
WILLOW & BUFFY Hi, Giles. WI
LL Oh! I should get to the yearbook office. I'm gonna give 'em themurderer profiles. They're really a good read.
GILES Bye.
WILLOW Cya. Buffy and Giles continue on together. GILES How are you?
BUFFY Loving the quiet. Nobody in here but me.
GILES Jonathan? How's he?
BUFFY Pretty crappy. His parents are freaking. He got suspended. Andtoting a piece to school, not exactly winning him a place with the in-crowd.But, I think he's dealing.
GILES Well, it's good of you to check on him.
BUFFY Well, it's nice to be able to help someone in a non-slaying capacity.Except, he's starting to get that look, you know, like he's gonna ask meto Prom.
GILES Well, it would probably be good for his self-esteem, if you...
BUFFY Oh come on! What am I, Saint Buffy? He's like three feet tall!
GILES I'm glad to see you've recovered from your psychic encountermore or less intact. Feel up to some training?
BUFFY Sure. We can work out after school. You know, if you're not toobusy having sex with my MOTHER!
