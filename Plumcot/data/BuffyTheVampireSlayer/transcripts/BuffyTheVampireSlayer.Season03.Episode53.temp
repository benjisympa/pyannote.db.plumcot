Mayor Alright, you can open them up now.
Faith Fab. What's the occasion?
Mayor Faith! As if I need a reason to show you my affection. Or appreciationfor running a small errand at the airport.
Faith Airport? What's next? Gonna want me to help a buddy of yoursmove a sofa?
Mayor This isn't a free ride, young lady. You know, I'm beginningto think that somebody's getting a little spoiled. Maybe I should takethis back.
Faith Sorry... Sir.
Mayor That's my girl. Another cookie? Openyour present. There. That look on your face is my reward.
Faith This is a thing of beauty, boss.
Mayor Well, it cost a pretty penny. So, you just take good care ofit. And you be careful not to put somebody's eye out with that thing, untilI tell you to.
Faith Any particular eyes in mind?
Buffy Sorry, honey!
Angel That's okay.
Buffy Well, there's something you don't see every day. Unless, ofcourse, you're me.
Angel That was bracing. Want to do another sweep?
Buffy It's what I live for. Sad to say.
Angel You too tired?
Buffy No. It's just... Do you get the feeling that we're kind of ina rut?
Angel A rut?
Buffy You never take me any place new.
Angel What about that fire demon nest in the cave by the beach? I felt that was a nice change of pace.
Buffy So this is our future? This is how we're going to spend ournights when I'm fifty and you're ... the same age you are now.
Angel Let's just get you to fifty.
Buffy Liking that plan.
Joyce Buffy? When were you going to tell me?
Buffy Alright, busted. I didn't think you'd miss them.
Joyce You were accepted to Northwestern University. Honey, I'm soproud of you! That's wonderful!
Buffy Right! It's wonderful.
Joyce I mean, it's not cheap, but, uh, I know we can make it workif your father pitches in. Not that Northwestern is your only option. It'sa great school, though. I am so proud of you.
Buffy You said that before.
Joyce And will again soon.
Buffy Mom, you know that I can't ... I-I just can't decide on a schoolright now. I mean I want to sleep on it, you know, mull it over. Raisethem up my inner flagpole, see which one I salute.
Joyce I know, sweetheart. I'm just so pleased that you have so manychoices. Ooh, you know what? Your aunt Arleen and her family are in Illinois.I've got to call and tell them. Oh, Buffy?
Buffy I know, you're proud of me.
Joyce Ah, don't forget to put my earrings back in my dresser beforeyou go out. Arleen? Hi! It's Joyce. How you doing? Listen, you are nevergoing to believe where Buffy got accepted to school!
Guy_#2 Here you go.
Guy_#1 Thanks.
Snyder Okay, what's in the bag?
Guy_#1 My lunch.
Snyder Is that the new drug lingo?
Guy_#1 No, it's my lunch.
Snyder Sit up straight.
Willow Sounds like your mom's in a state of denial.
Buffy More like a continent. She just has to realize that I can'tgo away.
Willow Well, maybe not now, but soon, maybe. Or maybe I too hail fromDenial Land.
Buffy Faith's turn to the dark side of the Force pretty much put theproverbial kibosh on any away plans for me. UC Sunnydale â€“ at least I gotin. You! I mean I can't believe you got into Oxford!
Willow It's pretty exciting.
Oz That's some deep academia there.
Buffy That's where they make Gileses.
Willow I know! I could learn and, and have scones. Although I-I don'tknow how I feel about going to school in a foreign country.
Xander Everything in life is foreign territory. Kerouac. He's my teacher.The open road is my school.
Buffy Making the open dumpster your cafeteria?
Xander Go ahead, mock me.
Oz I think she just did.
Xander We Bohemian anti-establishment types have always been persecuted.
Oz Well, sure. You're all so weird.
Willow I think it's neat, you doing the backpack, trail mix, happywanderer thing.
Xander I'm aware it scores kinda high on the hokey-meter, but I thinkit will be good for me. You know, help me to find myself.
Cordelia And help us to lose you. Everyone's a winner.
Xander Well, look who just popped open a fresh can ofvenom. Hey, did you hear about Willow getting into Oxnard?
Willow Oxford.
Xander Oxford. And M.I.T. and Yale and every other college on theface of the planet. As in your face I rub it.
Cordelia Oxford? Whoopee! Four years in tea-bag central. Sounds thrilling.And M.I.T. is a Clearasil ad with housing. And Yale is a dumping groundfor those who didn't get into Harvard.
Willow I got into Harvard.
Xander Any clue on what college you might be attending so we can startcalculating minimum safe distance?
Cordelia None of your business. Certainly nowhere near you losers!
Buffy Okay, you guys, don't forget to breathe between insults.
Cordelia I'm sorry Buffy. This conversation is reserved for peoplewho actually have a future.
Oz An angry young woman.
Willow Oh Buffy, she was just being Cordelia, only more so. Don'tpay any attention to her.
Xander She's definitely got a chip going.
Willow Maybe if you didn't goad her so much?
Xander I can't help it. It's my nature.
Willow Maybe you need a better nature.
Wesley I don't understand.
Buffy Well, I don't think I can talk any slower, Wes. I want to leave.
Wesley What? Now?
Buffy No, not now. After I graduate, you know, college?
Wesley But, you're a Slayer.
Buffy Yeah, I'm also a person. You can't just define me by my Slayer-ness.That's ... something-ism.
Giles Buffy, I know we've talked about you going away...
Buffy I got into Northwestern.
Giles That's wonderful news. Good for you.
Wesley Alright, everyone. Monsters, demons, world in peril?
Buffy I bet you they have all that stuff in Illinois.
Wesley You cannot leave Sunnydale. By the power invested in me bythe Council, I forbid it.
Giles Ah yes, that should settle it.
Wesley Faith gone bad, and the Mayor's Ascensioncoming up, ...
Buffy I know it's complicated. I'm aware that my graduation may be,among other things, posthumous, but... What if I stop the Ascension? What if I capture Faith?
Giles I very much hope you will.
Buffy If I do that, then all you guys have to do is keep the run ofthe mill unholy forces at bay through mid-terms and I'll be back in timefor Homecoming, and every school break after that. Can we at least thinkabout it?
Wesley Perhaps if circumstances were different.
Buffy I'll make them different.
Wesley What?
Buffy I'm tired of waiting for Mayor McSleaze to make his move whilewe sit on our hands counting down to Ascension Day. I mean, let's takethe fight to him.
Wesley No. No! Much too reckless. We're at a distinct disadvantage. We don't know anything about the Mayor's Ascension...
Giles She's right. Time's running out. We need to take the offensive. What's your plan?
Buffy I gotta have a plan? Really? I can't just be proactive withpep?
Giles No. You want to take the fight to them? I suggest the firststep would be to find out exactly what they're up to.
Buffy Oh. I actually knew that. I thought you meant a more specificplan, you know, like with maps and stuff. Great. We'll find out what they'reup to.
Box_man Is he in the car?
Vampire No, I'll take you to him.
Box_man The Mayor was supposed to be here in person with the money. Well, the price just went up. I don't like surprises.
Faith Surprise.
Vampire You killed him.
Faith What are you, the narrator? Keys to the cuffs?
Vampire Nothing.
Vampire That won't cut through steel.
Faith No, but it will cut through bone.
Mayor Hey ho! There it is! Hahahaha! Ah, what happened to the courier?I was supposed to pay him.
Faith Hunh. Made him an offer he couldn't survive.
Mayor You are one heck of a girl, you know that? I meangeez, the initiative, the - the skill.
Faith Go on, go on.
Mayor I will. You know, I'll tell you, if Buffy ... Hey hey hey hey. If Buffy Summers walked in here and said she wanted to switch toour side, I'd say no thanks, sister, I've got all theSlayer one man could ever need.
Mayor What?
Faith Nothing.
Mayor Oh, it's cause I used the B-word, huh? Don't tell me you'restill sore about that whole Angel-Buffy thing.
Faith No, I'm over it. She can have him.
Mayor Better believe she can. She deserves that poor excuse for acreature of the night. You, on the other hand, can do better.
Mayor Don't do that.
Buffy So, what's in the box?
Buffy The Box of Gavrock. It houses some great demonic energy or somethingwhich His Honor needs to chow down on come A-Day.
Wesley What's that?
Giles Maps. And stuff.
Willow Plans for City Hall. They were in the Water and Power mainframe.
Buffy The box is being kept under guard in a conference room on thetop floor. There. Unfortunately, that's all I couldget out of my informant before his aggressive tendencies forced me to introducehim to Mr. Pointy.
Wesley Well, now, here's what I think we should do...
Buffy I figure we can enter through the skylight. I'll take Angelwith me.
Giles Agreed.
Xander And there's a fire ladder on the east side of the building,here.
Wesley Yes, yes, fine, but we still need to consider whether the Mayor...
Giles It won't be enough to simply have possession of the box.
Willow Right, we have to destroy it. Not just physically - ritually,with some down and dirty black magic.
Wesley Hang on. We don't know what such a ritual would require.
Giles I think the Breath of the Atropyxis standard for this sort of thing. Fairly simple recipe. Xander?
Xander I know. I'm ingredient getting guy.
Wesley Alright, stop! I demand everyone STOP this instant! I'm in charge here and I say this is all moving much toofast. We need time to fully analyze the situation and devise a proper andstrategic strategem.
Buffy Wes, hop on the train or get off the tracks.
Wesley The Mayor will most assuredly have supernatural safeguardsprotecting the box. Oh, we all forgot about that, did we?
Buffy Looks like a job for Wiccan girl. What do you say, Will? Bigtime danger.
Willow Hey, I eat danger for breakfast.
Xander But oddly enough, she panics in the face of breakfast foods.
Buffy Let's get to work.
Xander I have a theory. Your snide remarks earlier? I'm guessing grapesa little on the sour side. Didn't get into any schools, did you? The gradeswere there, but ooh, if it weren't for that pesky interview. Ten minuteswith you and the Admissions Department decided that they'd already reachedtheir mean-spirited superficial princess quotas.
Cordelia And once again, the gold medal in the Being Wrong event goesto Xander I'm as stupid as I look Harris.Read 'em and weep, creep. USC, Colorado State, Duke, and Columbia.
Xander Wow! These are great colleges. I'm guessing they must haveseen a different side of your father's money.
Cordelia Go away.
Xander Sure! If you'll excuse me, I have to go back to helping tosave some lives. Carry on. I know that you have some important accessorizingto do.
Giles Now remember, if anything should go awry, Wesley and I willcreate a diversion.
Wesley Let's synchronize our watches. I have twenty-one four...
Wesley Yes, typical.
Willow Maybe we could just count. One one thousand, two one thousand,...
Giles Be careful, all of you.
Giles Tea?
Oz You got the goods?
Xander Yeah. Essence of toad,twice-blessed sage, maybe that's the toad?
Oz Well, we better be sure. Destroying this box is supposed to bea pretty delicate operation.
Xander Well, then, they shouldn't leave it in the hands of the laypeople.
Oz Oh, Willow laid it out for us pretty well.
Xander Wow! She even drew helpful diagrams. That's the pedestal.
Oz And the ingredients. And us. See, there's you and there's me.
Xander Well, how can you tell which is which? I mean, they both lookkinda stick-figurey to me.
Oz Well, this one's me. See the little guitar.
Xander Oh, gotcha.
Oz Nobody like my Willow.
Xander No sir, there is not.
Oz Okay, toad me.
Willow Oh yeah, I'm bad.
Buffy Four stars, Will. Now get going.
Willow I'm gone.
Buffy Got it!
Buffy Angel!
Angel It's jammed.
Buffy I'd like very much to come up now, please. Angel!
Angel I know!
Buffy Don't suppose you want to help me get down. Didn'tthink so.
Mayor Well, this is very unfortunate. I just had this conference roomredecorated, for Pete's sake. At taxpayers' expense. And, oh yeah ... They'vegot my box.
Faith Yeah they do, but looky what we got.
Buffy How did you guys let ... How did this happen?
Giles We thought she stayed with you.
Angel They must have grabbed her when she hit the ground. Buffy, I'msorry.
Buffy Look, it's nobody's fault, okay. We just need to focus and deal.Oz, I swear I won't let them hurt her.
Xander We go back. Full-on assault.
Giles They'll kill her.
Wesley We're assuming they haven't already.
Buffy No. No, they know what she means to us. She's too valuable aslong as we still have the box. We trade.
Wesley We can't.
Buffy No, it's the safest plan. It's the only way, right?
Giles It might well be.
Buffy Look, we call the Mayor and arrange a meeting.
Wesley This box must be destroyed.
Xander I need a volunteer to hit Wesley.
Wesley Giles, you know I'm right about this.
Buffy Wes, you want to duck and cover at this point?
Wesley Damn it, you listen to me! This box is the key to the Mayor'sAscension. Thousands of lives depend on our getting rid of it. Now I wantto help Willow as much as the rest of you, but we will find another way.
Buffy There is no other way.
Wesley You're the one who said take the fight to the Mayor. You wereright. This is the town's best hope of survival. It's your chance to getout.
Buffy You think I care about that? Are you made of human parts?
Giles Alright! Let's deal with this rationally.
Buffy Why are you taking his side?
Wesley You'd sacrifice thousands of lives? Your families, your friends?
Wesley It can all end right here. We have the means to destroy thisbox.
Buffy Giles, make the phone call.
Guard What are you doing?
Willow Oh, uh, I'm looking for a sucking candy, cause my mouth getsdry when I'm nervous, or held prisoner against my will.
Willow And suddenly I'm thinking sucking isn't a good word to usearound vampires. Hey! Did you get permission to eat the hostage? I don'tthink so. You're going to be in some trouble when the Mayor ...Ow!
Guard Just a little taste.
Faith She's not gonna be brain-dead but she'd be to come back heretonight.
Mayor Ever had a dog?
Faith What?
Mayor I did. Rusty. Irish setter. A dog's friendship is stronger thanreason, stronger than it's own sense of self-preservation. Buffy's likea dog, and hey, before you can say Jack Robinson, you'll get to see mekill her like one.
Faith Check out the bookworm.
Willow Faith!
Faith Anyone with brains, anyone who knew what was going to happento her, would try to claw her way out of this place. But you, you justcan't stop Nancy Drew-ing, can you? Guess now you know too much and thatkinda just naturally leads to killing.
Willow Faith, wait. I want to talk to you.
Faith Oh yeah? Give me the speech again, please. Faith, we're stillyour friends. We can help you. It's not too late.
Willow It's way too late. You know, it didn't have to be this way. But you made your choice. I know you had a tough life. I know that somepeople think you had a lot of bad breaks. Well, boo hoo! Poor you. Youknow, you had a lot more in your life than some people. I mean, youhad friends in your life like Buffy. Now you have no one. You were a Slayerand now you're nothing. You're just a big selfish, worthless waste.
Faith You hurt me, I hurt you. I'm just a little more efficient.
Willow Aw, here I just thought you didn't have a come-back.
Faith You're begging for some deep pain.
Willow I'm not afraid of you.
Faith Let's see what we can do about that.
Mayor Girls, I hope I don't have to separate you two. Faith, you canplay with your new toy later. Something's come up.
Mayor Faith! You know I don't like repeating myself.
Faith I got someone. I got him.
Mayor I just received a heck of an interesting phone call.
Oz The whole place is locked down, except for the front.
Xander Yeah, it gives me that comforting trapped feeling.
Buffy One way out means one way in. I want to see them coming.
Xander Guess they're shy.
Angel I can see alright.
Mayor Well, this is exciting, isn't it? Clandestine meetingsby dark of night. Exchange of prisoners. I just, I, I feel like we shouldall be wearing trench coats.
Buffy Let her go.
Mayor No. Not until the box is in my hands. So you're the little girlthat's been causing me all this trouble. She's pretty, Angel. A littleskinny. Still don't understand why it couldn't work out with you and my Faith. Guess you kind of just have strange taste in women.
Angel Well, what can I say? I like them sane.
Oz Angel.
Mayor Well, I wish you kids the best, I really do. But if you don'tmind a bit of fatherly advice, I, uh, I-I just don't see much of a futurefor you two. I don't sense a lasting relationship. And not just becauseI plan to kill you. You two have a bumpy road ahead.
Buffy I don't think we need to talk about this.
Mayor God, you kids, you know. You don't like to think about the future.You don't like to make plans. Unless you want Faith to gut your friendlike a sea bass, show a little respect for your elders.
Angel You're not my elder. I've got a lotta years on you.
Mayor Yeah, and that's just one of the things you're going to haveto deal with. You're immortal, she's not. It's not. I married my Edna Mayin ought-three and I was with her right until the end. Not a pretty picture.Wrinkled and senile and cursing me for my youth. Wasn't our happiesttime. And let's not forget the fact that any moment of true happiness willturn you evil. I mean, come on. What kind of a life can you offer her?I don't see a lot of Sunday picnics in the offing. I see skulking in theshadows, hiding from the sun. She's a blossoming young girl and you wantto keep her from the life she should have until it has passed her by. MyGod! I think that's a little selfish. Is that what you came backfrom Hell for? Is that your greater purpose? Make the trade.
Mayor Well, that went smooth.
Snyder Nobody moves!
Snyder I knew you kids were up to something.
Buffy Snyder, get out of here.
Snyder You're not giving orders, young lady. I suppose you're goingto tell me I won't find drugs in this box.
Buffy Wait!
Mayor Principal Snyder.
Mayor I think we have a problem.
Snyder Mr. Mayor, I had no idea you ... I'm terribly sorry.
Mayor No, it's I who should apologize. Coming down here at night. What must you be thinking? But you see, I just needed to ...
Mayor No! Don't do that!
Wesley Oh god.
Xander Where did it go?
Snyder Get that door open!
Giles No! You can't let that thing out of here!
Xander I still want to know where it went.
Buffy Listen.
Faith Boss!
Mayor Wouldn't leave that open.
Wesley No! Wesley ducks. Faith snaps the knife into the spider,killing it.
Oz Is that all of them?
Mayor Ah, not really. You see, there's about fifty... billion of thesehappy little critters in here. Would you like to see?
Mayor Raise your hand if you're invulnerable. Faith,let's go.
Mayor Faith.
Buffy Snyder, you alive in there?
Snyder You. All of you. Why couldn't you be dealing drugs like normalpeople?
Wesley Well, that went swimmingly.
Buffy We did alright.
Willow So Faith was like I'm going to beat you up and I'm all I'mnot afraid of you and then she had the knife which was less fun a-andthen, oh! I-I told her you made your choice, Buffy was your friend...
Giles This is fascinating, but let's get back to the point. You actuallyhad your hands on the Books of Ascension?
Willow Volumes One through Five.
Giles Is there anything you can remember that could be of use to us? Anything at all?
Willow Well, I was in a hurry, and what I did read was kind of over-involved.If you ask me, way over-written. Actually, there were a few pages thatlooked kind of interesting but I didn't have a chance to read them fully.
Willow See what you can make of them?
Buffy This is your night for suave, Will. You should get capturedmore often.
Willow No, thank you.
Wesley Well, let's hope there is something useful in those pages. The Mayor has the Box of Gavrock. As of now, we are right back where westarted. Wouldn't you say?
Willow Deep thoughts?
Buffy Deep and meaningful.
Willow As in?
Buffy As in, I'm never getting out of here. I kept thinking if I stoppedthe Mayor or ... but I was kidding myself. I mean, there is always goingto be something. I'm a Sunnydale girl, no other choice.
Willow Must be tough. I mean, here I am, I can do anything I want. I can go to any college in the country, four or five in Europe if Iwant.
Buffy Please tell me you're going somewhere with this?
Willow No. I'm not going anywhere.
Buffy UC Sunnydale?
Willow I will be matriculating with Class of 2003.
Buffy Are you serious?
Willow Say, isn't that where you're going?
Buffy I can't believe it! Are you serious? Ah, wait, what am I saying?You can't.
Willow What do you mean, I can't?
Buffy I won't let you.
Willow Of the two people here, which is the boss of me?
Buffy There are better schools.
Willow Sunnydale's not bad. A-And I can design my own curriculum.
Buffy Okay, well, there are safer schools. There are safer prisons. I can't let you stay because of me.
Willow Actually, this isn't about you. Although I'm fond, don't getme wrong, of you. The other night, you know, being captured and all, facingoff with Faith. Things just, kind of, got clear. I mean, you've been fightingevil here for three years, and I've helped some, and now we're supposedto decide what we want to do with our lives. And I just realized that that'swhat I want to do. Fight evil, help people. I mean, I-I think it's worthdoing. And I don't think you do it because you have to. It's a good fight,Buffy, and I want in.
Buffy I kind of love you.
Willow And, besides, I have a shot at being a bad ass Wiccan, andwhat better place to learn?
Buffy I feel the need for more sugar than the human body can handle.
Willow Mochas?
Buffy Yes, please. It's weird. You look at something and you thinkyou know exactly what you're seeing, and then you find out it's somethingelse entirely.
Willow Neat, huh?
Buffy Sometimes it is.
Woman Chase! What are you doing? Your break's been over for ten minutes.I still need you to re-stock the shelves and clean out the storage room.Let's go.
Buffy It's gonna be fun. Will and I are going to go on Saturday tocheck out the campus. I'm hoping Mom will let me live there. It's too farto come home every night. Plus the whole lack of cool factor. Eitherway, I'll be close to your place. I don't know what the Mayor was talkingabout. How could he know anything about us?
Angel Well, he's evil.
Buffy Big time. He doesn't even know what a lasting relationship is.
Angel No.
Buffy Probably the only lasting relationship he's ever had is with evil.
Angel Yeah.
Buffy Big, stupid, evil guy. We'll be okay.
Angel We will.
