Buffy What? Do I have funny bed hair or something?
Angel Or something?
Buffy I guess we got a little carried away with the whole post-slayagenap thing. Ohhh, not good.
Angel Where you going?
Buffy To go kill a cat on my head.
Angel No mirrors.
Buffy You know, this place really isn't girl-friendly. No mirrors,no natural light.
Angel I think you look perfect.
Buffy Oh yeah, I really like... Okay! Maybe we shouldthink about getting a few mirrors. And maybe a drawer, you know, for someof my stuff. Because that's what couples do, they have drawers.
Angel Mmmm, that's right.
Buffy You know, I-I figure, that way sometimes I could spend the night.Like, after the prom, it would be nice to be able to just come back hereand spend some time together.
Angel The prom?
Buffy End of high school rite of passage thingy. Think cotillion withspiked punch and electric slide.
Angel Right.
Buffy Oh, don't worry, it's at night. And lots of girls have oldergirlfriends. You'll blend.
Angel I think maybe you should go, hunh?
Buffy Noo.. must be a few more hours before sunrise.
Buffy Ooh, sorry. I guess it's later than we thought.
Anya Xander!
Xander Well, hey, it's demon Anya, punisher of evil males. Still haven'tgot your powers back? You haven't right?
Anya No. I will, though. It's just a matter of time.
Xander So now, how did that work? Women would wish horrible thingsupon their ex-boyfriends. You'd show up and make it happen.
Anya That's right. The power of the Wish made me a righteous swordto smite the unfaithful.
Xander Well, hey! Good luck with that. Hope it works out for you.
Anya You know, you can laugh, but I have witnessed a millenium oftreachery and oppression from the males of the species and I have nothingbut contempt for the whole libidinous lot of them.
Xander Then why you talking to me?
Anya I don't have a date for the prom.
Xander Well gosh. I wonder why not. It couldn't possibly have anythingto do with your sales pitch?
Anya Men are evil. Will you go with me?
Xander One of us is very confused, and I honestly don't know which.
Anya You know, this happens to be all your fault.
Xander My fault?
Anya You were unfaithful to Cordelia so I took on the guise of a twelfth-graderto tempt her with the Wish. When I lost my powers I got stuck in this persona,and now I have all these feelings. I don't understand it. I don't likeit. All I know is I really want to go to this dance and I want someoneto go with me.
Xander Be still my heart. Oh wait, it is. How come I got the shortstraw?
Anya You're not quite as obnoxious as most of the alpha males aroundhere. Plus I know you don't have a date.
Xander I haven't settled on anyone yet.
Anya Fine. Look, I know you find me attractive. I've seen you lookingat my breasts.
Xander Nothing personal, but when a guy does that, it just means hiseyes are open.
Anya Whatever. Look, do you wanna go with me or not?
Oz Anya, huh? Interesting choice.
Xander Choice is kind of a broad term for my situation. See, it'seither Anya or the sock puppet of love for this boy. I love you, Xander. I'll neverleave you.
Willow Well, if Anya tries to get you killed, put me down for a big'I told you so.'
Xander Who's this Anya? Is she prettier than me?
Willow She just better not try to cross me. That's all I'm saying.
Buffy Well, at least we all have someone to go with now. Some of usare going with demons, but I think that's a valid lifestyle choice. Moreimportantly, I have the kick dress.
Willow Ooh, the pink one?
Buffy Angel's gonna lose it. But not his soul. He's gonna lose it. His it.
Angel Mrs. Summers.
Joyce I'm sorry to, uh... Well, I would have called, but, you know.
Angel Please, you're always welcome.
Joyce My goodness, your place is amazing.
Angel Yeah, I like a lot of space. I don't get out much during theday.
Joyce No, you wouldn't.
Angel Can I get you something? I don't have any coffee.
Joyce Oh, no thank you, I, uh... You don't drink? Beverages, I mean?
Angel No, I do. It's just the caffeine. It makes me jittery.
Joyce Oh. I understand Buffy spent the night.
Angel I'm sorry about that. We came back after patrol.
Joyce I, I'm not interested in the details. That's not why I'm here.
Angel Okay.
Joyce I'm here because I'm worried about you two. In general.
Angel What happened before, when I changed, it won't happen again.
Joyce That's not all I'm concerned about. I don't have to tell youthat you and Buffy are from different worlds.
Angel No, you don't.
Joyce She's had to deal with a lot. Grew up fast. Sometimes even Iforget that she's still just a girl.
Angel I'm old enough to be her ancestor.
Joyce She's just starting out in life.
Angel I know. I think about it more now that she's staying in Sunnydale.
Joyce Good. Because when it comes to you, Angel, she's just like anyother young woman in love. You're all she can see of tomorrow. ButI think we both know that there are some hard choices ahead. If shecan't make them, you're gonna have to. I know you care about her. I justhope you care enough.
Buffy So it was blue and sorta short.
Willow Not too shore, medium. And it had this weird, sorta fringeystuff on its arms.
Giles What's that, a demon?
Buffy A prom dress that Will was thinking of getting. Can't you everget your mind out of the hellmouth?
Giles I'd be delighted to. However, the day of the Mayor's Ascensionis fast approaching and we don't know what to expect.
Xander Well, what about the pages that Will stole from the Mayor'sbook? Look, she put her life on the line there, pal. Don't tell me they'reuseless.
Giles On the contrary, no, we, uh, we know the Ascension refers toa human transforming into a demon, the living embodiment of an immortal.And Graduation Day, our Mayor Wilkins is scheduled to do just that.
Wesley Trouble is, we don't know which demon he is goingto become.
Giles There are thousands of species.
Wesley So, it's safe to say we shouldn't waste any time of such triflingmatters as a school dance.
Cordelia Well, that's too bad, because I bet you would look way 007in a tux.
Wesley Except, of course, on the actual night, I will be aiding Mr.Giles in his chaperoning duties.
Giles What? Excuse me? Fine, fine, fine.
Buffy We'll get you a dress. You know, we should checkApril Fools.
Cordelia Don't go there! I shop there.
Xander I myself am dipping into my road trip fund to procure a shinynew tux, so look for me to dazzle.
Giles And I myself will be wearing pink taffeta as chenille wouldnot go with my complexion. Can we *please* talk about the Ascension?
Buffy Giles, we get it. Miles to go before we sleep. But especiallyif we're all gonna vaporize or something on Graduation Day, we deservea little prommy fun. One night of glory, not to much to ask.
Priest Into this holy estate, these two persons present now come tobe joined. If any man can show just cause why they should not be lawfullyjoined together, let him speak now, or else, hereinafter, hold his peace.
Buffy Angel?
Buffy I always say patrol's not complete without a trip to the stinkysewers.
Angel I'm sure I saw him come down here.
Buffy Couldn't we just let this be the vamp that got away? We couldsay he was this big.
Angel What can I say? I need closure.
Buffy You need clothes. You don't have a tux, do you?
Angel Since when did patrolling go black tie?
Buffy For the prom, silly.
Angel We have more important things to think about right now thana dance, Buffy.
Buffy Sorry, Giles. I'll just be quiet.
Angel Come on, don't be that way.
Buffy Not now.
Buffy I'm not being that way. Every time I say the word 'prom', youget grouchy.
Angel I'm sorry. I'm just worried that you're getting too...investedin this whole thing.
Buffy What whole thing? Isn't this the stuff that I'm supposed toget invested in? Going to a formal, graduating, growing up.
Angel I know.
Buffy Then what? What's with the dire?
Angel It's uh, it's nothing.
Buffy No, you have 'something' face.
Angel I think we need to talk, but not now and not here.
Buffy No. No, if you have something to say, then say it.Angel, drop the cryptic. You're scaring me.
Angel I've been thinking... about our future. And the more I do, themore I feel like us, you and me being together, is unfair to you.
Buffy Is this about what the Mayor said? Because he was just tryingto shake us up.
Angel He was right.
Buffy No. No, he wasn't. He's the bad guy.
Angel You deserve more. You deserve something outside of demons anddarkness. You should be with someone who can take you into the light. Someone who can make love to you.
Buffy I don't care about that.
Angel You will. And children.
Buffy Children? Can you say jumping the gun? I kill my goldfish.
Angel Today. But you have no idea how fast it goes, Buffy. Beforeyou know it, you'll want it all, a normal life.
Buffy I'll never have a normal life.
Angel Right, you'll always be a Slayer. But that's all the more reasonwhy you should have a real relationship instead of this, this freak show.I didn't mean that.
Buffy I'm gonna go.
Angel I'm sorry. Buffy, you know how much I love you.It kills me to say this.
Buffy Then don't. Who are you to tell me what's right for me? Youthink I haven't thought about this?
Angel Have you, rationally?
Buffy No. No, of course not. I'm just some swoony little schoolgirl,right?
Angel I'm trying to do what's right here, okay? I'm trying to thinkwith my head instead of my heart.
Buffy Heart? You have a heart? It isn't even beating!
Angel Don't.
Buffy Don't what? Don't love you? I'm sorry. You know what? I didn'tknow that I got a choice in that. I'm never gonna change. I can't change.I want my life to be with you.
Angel I don't.
Buffy You don't want to be with me? I can't believe you're breakingup with me.
Angel It doesn't mean that I don't ...
Buffy How am I supposed to stay away from you?
Angel I'm leaving. After the Ascension, after it's finished with theMayor and Faith. If we survive, I'll go.
Buffy Where?
Angel I don't know.
Buffy Is this really happening?
Willow So, that's it?
Buffy That's it. Assuming we survive this Ascension thing, he's gonnaleave town.
Willow Well, he's a fool. He's just a big, dumb, jerk person if youask me. And he's a super-maxi-jerk for doing it right before the prom.
Buffy It's not his fault. He's 243 years old. He doesn't exactly getthe prom.
Willow But he should, if ...
Buffy Will, it's okay. You don't have to make him the bad guy.
Willow But that's the best friend's job, vilifying and grousing.
Buffy Usually, yeah. But he's right. I mean, I think, maybe in thelong run, that he's right.
Willow Yeah, I think he is. I mean, I tried to hope for the best,but... I'm sorry. It must be horrible.
Buffy I think horrible is still coming. Right now, it's worse. Rightnow, I'm just trying to keep from dying.
Willow Oh Buffy.
Buffy I can't breathe, Will. I feel like I can't breathe.
Xander Okay, how long does it take you to buy a damn dress?
Cordelia Xander! I, uh, I'm considering things a little more carefullynowadays. I don't want to get stuck with another dud.
Xander Well this should work for you. It positively screams nympho.
Salesgirl Is this a customer or a friend?
Xander Neither. Just stopped by for my daily helping of bile.
Salesgirl So you better get back to work and quit goofing. Mrs. Finkelso has it in for you.
Xander You work here?
Cordelia Yes. Yes, I work here.
Xander But, uh, why?
Cordelia I'm trying to buy a dress.
Xander But don't you already have all the dresses?
Cordelia I have nothing, okay? No dresses. No cell phone. No car. Everything's been taken away because Daddy made a little mistake on histaxes. For the last twelve years. Satisfied? Are you a happy Xander now?I'm broke. I can't go to any of the colleges that accepted me. And I can'tstay home because we no longer have one.
Xander Uh, wow.
Cordelia Yeah, neato. Now you can run along and tell all of your friendshow Cordy finally got hers. How she has to work part time just to get alousy prom dress on layaway. And how she has to wear a name tag. Oh, I'ma name tag person. Don't leave that out. The story just wouldn't have thesame punch.
Xander Right there. See, it's, it's like he just realized he forgotto put money in the meter or something.
Cordelia You know the part that totally weirded me out? That thinghad good taste. I mean, he chucks Xander and went right for the formalwear.
Xander That's right. He left behind his copy of Monsters Wear Daily.
Cordelia I'm serious. Look at the outfit that Xander's wearing. Nowlook at the kid that the monster went after. Very smooth lines, 'til hewas shredded.
Buffy I don't want to see it again. Giles: Buffy, I know it's horrible,but if you're going to hunt this
Buffy Think I got it.
Willow She's right. I mean, you've seen one big hairy bringer of death,you've seen 'em all.
Wesley If I'm not mistaken, this is a hellhound.
Giles Yes. It's particularly vicious. It's sort of a demon foot soldierbred during the Machash Wars. Trained solely to kill. They feed off thebrains of their foes.
Cordelia Look! Right there, zoom in on that.
Xander It's a videotape.
Cordelia So? They do it on television all the time.
Xander Not with a regular VCR they don't.
Wesley Perhaps we could stay on the topic for once. What were youdoing this afternoon?
Cordelia What? Um, I was...
Xander Burning a hole in daddy's wallet, as usual. I just bumped intoher during my tuxedo hunt.
Oz What's that? Pause it.
Xander Guys! It's just a normal VCR. It doesn't... Oh wait, uh, itcan do pause.
Xander Hello, hellhound raiser.
Oz Tucker Wells. He's in my chem lab.
Wesley Let me guess. He was quiet, kept to himself, but always seemedlike a nice young man.
Oz He didn't seem the murderous type anyway. Something must have happenedto him.
Xander How's it going over there, Buff?
Buffy Fine.
Xander Well, I just wanted to say that your impersonation of an inanimateobject is really coming along.
Buffy Thanks.
Willow Ooooh! I got into Tucker's e-mail account. Listen to this messageTucker sent to this kid David Metz at school last week. The Sunnydale Highlemmings have no idea what awaits them. Their big night will be their lastnight.
Giles So, we have a threat against the students on their big night,a hellhound trained to attack people in formal wear...
Cordelia Oh, are we all catching up now?
Giles Tucker is planning to attack the prom tonight.
Oz Once again, the Hellmouth puts the special in special occasion.
Xander Why do I even buy tickets for these things, I ask you?
Willow Wonder if I can take my dress back?
Buffy Don't you dare.
Willow But Tucker is going to...
Buffy No! You guys are going to have a prom. The kind of prom thateveryone should have. I'm going to give you all a nice, fun, normal eveningif I have to kill every single person on the face of the earth to do it.
Xander Yay?
Buffy Okay, Wes, why don't you go to Tucker's house. He's probablynot there, but it's worth a shot.
Wesley Alright. Perhaps strength in numbers would be ...
Buffy You can take Cordy.
Wesley If that's your plan, alright, alright. What about the others?
Buffy Oz, you said you know this David kid that Tucker e-mailed? Why don't you and Will track him down? See what he knows, if he's involved?
Willow We're on it.
Buffy And you know what? Could you two check the magicshop?
Wesley Magic shop?
Buffy Yeah. It's right next to the dress store on Main.
Xander I can swing that one. What's the mission?
Buffy See if anyone's been in, buying supplies to raise a hellhound.
Xander Gotcha. Or check and see who's been stocking up on hellhoundsnausages. I hear those pups will do anything for a tasty treat.
Buffy Giles, you said this thing eats brains. Any brains?
Giles Um, I suppose.
Buffy Then Tucker must be feeding it, right?
Packer Yeah, yeah. This kid orders cow brains a couple of times aweek. Goes to this address. Good luck. He's a weirdkid.
Buffy Thanks. Thanks a lot.
Angel What are you doing here?
Buffy Hello to you too.
Angel Sorry. I'm just surprised.
Buffy Me too. I don't know why though. Where did I think you get yourblood, McPlasma's?
Angel How are you?
Buffy Right as rain, whatever that means. Don't look at me like that.I can lie to you if I want to now. We're ex, remember?
Angel If it means anything, I miss you.
Buffy Could we not, please? When I think about us, I have this tendencyto sort of go catatonic. And I really can't afford to do that right now.Gotta stop a crazy from pulling a Carrie at the prom.
Angel You still planning to go?
Buffy Strictly in the chaperon capacity. But it's fine. I mean, the...I'm cool with going stag. I'm over the whole Buffy gets one perfect highschool moment thing. But I'm certainly not going to let some subhuman ruinit for the rest of the senior class.
Angel Let me help you.
Buffy I'm okay.
Angel If you ever need my help...
Buffy Look, I got it! Thanks.
Salesgirl Hey! Don't forget your dress. Aren't you wearing it tonight?
Cordelia As much as I hate to admit it, I haven't finished payingfor it yet.
Salesgirl Well somebody did.
Cordelia What? Who?
Xander Zeroes all around, Buff.
Willow Sorry.
Buffy Make not with the long faces. I got the address. Now the promstarts in a little while. I want you guys to go on and I'll catch up withyou as soon as I put a lid on this jerk.
Xander What? No way.
Willow We can't just leave you, Buff.
Giles Buffy, they're right. You need...
Buffy To see taillights. Hit the door. I have everything under control.
Oz Buffy, it makes sense to ...
Buffy Have. A. Nice. Time.
Willow Okay then.
Xander See ya.
Buffy I want you at the gym. Keep an eye on them untilI get there.
Giles I don't have to tell you that you're being rather rash. Findingan address hardly adds up to case closed.
Buffy Look, it's done. You want to go after them and tell them thatthey can't go? That all of their planning and dreaming was for nothing?That they can't spend tonight with their honeys of all nights?
Giles Angel's not taking you, is he?
Buffy Angel's leaving me. He's leaving town.
Giles Oh, Buffy, I'm sorry. I don't really know what to say. Um, Iunderstand that this sort of thing requires ice cream of some kind?
Buffy Ice cream will come. First, I want to take out psycho boy.
Giles You sure?
Buffy The great thing about being a Slayer, kicking ass is comfortfood.
Anya So she wished her husband's head would explode, which was greatexcept we were standing three feet from him at the time. What a mess. Of course, you know, during the plague it was always parts falling off.Well, that got old since pretty much they were anyway. The Renaissance,that was ...
Wesley Well, I must say this is all rather odd to me.
Giles Oh yes. At an all-male preparatory they didn't go in for thissort of thing.
Wesley No, of course not. Unless you count the nights you made thelower classmen get up as girls and watched them ...Dip is tasty, isn't it?
Wesley Sauce is hot. Very hot.
Willow We got in. Maybe we should dance before we get besieged, bedeviled,or beheaded or something.
Oz It's not gonna happen.
Willow You're not even a little nervous?
Oz You think Buffy is going to let us down?
Willow Want to share some punch?
Wesley May I say, you look smashing.
Cordelia It's a start.
Anya So then this one time, this girl wished her ex would cannibalizehimself. Even I had a hard time watching that, let me tell you.
Xander Cordelia! Wesley! My god in heaven, it's good to see you. How are you both? And details, please.
Wesley Very well, thank you.
Cordelia Yes, thank you.
Xander It looks good on you.
Cordelia Well, duh.
Tucker You're ready to go.
Buffy Sorry, new plan.
Buffy The prom's a go and you're pathetic.
Tucker Maybe. Maybe not.
Buffy So that's how you did it? That's how you brainwashed the houndsto go psycho on prom?
Tucker Neat, huh?
Buffy I don't get it. What kind of sicko wants to destroy the happiestnight of a senior's life?
Tucker I have my reasons.
Tucker Do you want to go to the prom with me?
Girl No.
Buffy Whatever. Every maladjust has his reasons. Luckily for me, you'rean incompetent maladjust.
Buffy Now I'm gonna lock you in here and then I'm gonna party likeit's ...
Tucker Gotta have a redundancy system. Any incompetent knows that. My three fiercest babies are on their way to the dance right now. You think formal wear makes them crazy, wait 'til they see the mirror ball.
Buffy That's right. Follow Buffy. Good dogs.
Buffy Oh, come on. That song sucks.
Buffy Get back!
Student Bathroom?
Student Th-th-tha...
Buffy You're welcome.
Willow Buffy, you look awesome.
Buffy So do you.
Oz Everything cool?
Buffy Coolest. Devil dogs are history. How's the prom?
Oz Strangely affecting. I got all teared up when they played 'We AreFamily'.
Willow Everything's perfect.
Announcer And the award for Sunnydale High's Class Clown for 1999goes to Jack Mayhew.
Xander Please! Anybody can be a prop class clown. You know, none ofthe people who vote for these things are even funny.
Jonathan We have one more award to give out. Is Buffy Summers heretonight? Did she, um...
Jonathan This is actually a new category. First time ever. I guessthere were a lot of write-in ballots, and, um, the prom committee askedme to read this. We're not good friends. Most of us never found the timeto get to know you, but that doesn't mean we haven't noticed you. We don'ttalk about it much, but it's no secret that Sunnydale High isn't reallylike other high schools. A lot of weird stuff happens here.
Crowd_outbursts Zombies! Hyena people! Snyder!
Jonathan But, whenever there was a problem or something creepy happened,you seemed to show up and stop it. Most of the people here have been savedby you, or helped by you at one time or another. We're proud to say thatthe Class of '99 has the lowest mortality rate of any graduating classin Sunnydale history. And we know at leastpart of that is because of you. So the senior class, offers its thanks,and gives you, uh, this.
Jonathan It's from all of us, and it has written here, Buffy Summers,Class Protector.
Wesley Mr. Giles. I'd like your opinion. While the last thing I wantto do is muddle bad behavior in front of impressionable youth, I wonderif asking Miss Chase to dance would...
Giles For God's sake, man, she's eighteen. And you have the emotionalmaturity of a blueberry scone. Just have at it, would you, and stop flutteringabout.
Wesley Right, then. Thanks for that.
Anya This isn't bad.
Giles You did good work tonight, Buffy.
Buffy And I got a little toy surprise.
Giles I had no idea that children en masse could be gracious.
Buffy Every now and then, people surprise you.
Giles Every now and then. Giles takes her umbrellaand leaves. Buffy turns to see Angel at the door. They meet.
Buffy I never thought you'd come.
Angel It's a big night. I didn't want to miss it. It's just tonight. It doesn't mean that I ...
Buffy I know. I mean, I understand.
Angel Dance with me?
