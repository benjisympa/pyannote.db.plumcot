Buffy Anything?
Willow Ah! 'Introduction to the Modern Novel.' A surveystudy of twentieth century novelists. Open to freshmen, you mightlike that.
Buffy 'Introduction to the Modern Novel?' I'm guessing I'd probablyhave to read the modern novel.
Willow Maybe more than one.
Buffy I like books. I just don't want to take on too much. Do they have an introduction to the modern blurb?
Willow Oh! Short story.
Buffy Well, that's good.
Willow Oh, no. It conflicts with Psych.
Buffy Maybe I shouldn't take Psych.
Willow You gotta. I-It's fun, a-and you can use it as your sciencerequirement. Anyway, Professor Walsh is supposed to be great. She's like, world-renowned.
Buffy How do you get to be renowned? I mean, like, do you haveto be 'nowned' first?
Willow Yes, first there's the painful 'nowning' process. Wait! 'Images of Pop Culture.' This is good. T-They watch movies,T-TV shows, even commercials.
Buffy For credit?
Willow Heh. Isn't college cool?
Buffy How'd I miss that one?
Willow Well, you did sort of wait till the last minute with your courseselection.
Buffy Sorry, 'Miss I-chose-my-major-in-playgroup.'
Willow That's an exaggeration. I just, you know, think it'sgood to be prepared. Don't want to be caught unawares.
Buffy Well I've been busy! It's been a very slay-heavy summer. I just haven't had a whole lot of time to think about life at UC Sunnydale.
Willow It's exciting, though, isn't it?
Buffy Yeah! It's gonna be an adjustment.
Willow Yeah, it's like, five miles away. It's uncharted territory.
Buffy Giles said I have to be secret-identity gal again.
Willow That makes sense.
Buffy It's gonna be tough, though... with a roommate.
Willow Yeah.
Buffy I'm psyched about college.
Buffy Definitely.
Buffy I just need to figure out how it's going to work with my extra-curricularactivities.
Buffy I just can't let it take the edge off my slaying.
Buffy I gotta stay sharp. Is this guy ever gonna wake up?
Student_Volunteer FRESHMEN! WE'RE DOING THIS BY FOLDER COLOR! IF YOU'RE NOT HOLDING ON TO A YELLOW FOLDER, YOU'RE IN THE WRONG GROUP.YOU BELONG UP BY WIESMAN HALL.
Girl Not gonna take it!
Crowd No!
Girl Don't take it lying down!
Crowd No!
Girl What do we want?
Girl When do we want it?
Crowd Now!
Boy Rally, tomorrow night. We have to let the administrationknow how we feel.
Buffy Yeah, right.
Girl Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?
Buffy Uh, you know I meant to and then I just got really busy.
Boy Party, Thursday at Alpha Delt, you gotta be there. FreeJello shots for freshman women.
Buffy Hey, you guys know where Wiesman hall is?
Willow Buffy, Hey!
Buffy Oh, boy am I glad to see you.
Willow Isn't this cool? There's so much going on.
Buffy Yeah. Almost, one might say, too much.
Willow I got all my courses... except for 'Modern Poetry', I had toswitch to 'Ethno-musicology.' But that's cool, West-African drumming,I think it's going to change everything. Have you met your roommateyet?
Buffy No.
Willow Me neither. I hope she's cool.
Buffy I see you got ticketedtoo.
Willow Yes! I've heard about five different issues and I'm angryabout each and every one of them. What'd you get?
Buffy 'Jello shots.'
Willow I didn't get 'Jello shots!' I-I'll trade you for a-a 'Take Back the Night.'
Buffy Are we heading anywhere near Wiesman Hall? I still needto get my I.D. card.
Willow Oh, I got mine this morning. The lines are really longnow, you should have gone early.
Buffy Well, I hope that I learn from this experience, and that I grow.
Willow I'm being annoying, aren't I?
Buffy No, it's nice that you're excited.
Willow It's just in High School, knowledge was pretty much frownedupon. You really had to work to learn anything. But here, theenergy, the collective intelligence, it's like this force, this penetratingforce, and I can just feel my mind opening upyou know?and letting thisplace thrust into and spurt knowledge into... That sentence endedup in a different place than it started out in.
Buffy I'm with you, though, I'm all for spurty knowledge. It'sjust, a little overwhelming. Don't you feel it?
Willow Well, I'm... Ooh, boyfriend! My on-campus boyfriend.
Buffy Oh no, I forgot to pick mine up. Line's probably reallylong there, too.
Willow How are you?
Oz Good. It's pretty much a madhouse, a madhouse.
Buffy I know, I was just saying that to Willow. I mean it'sjust so overwhelming. Don't you feel completely disoriented?
Paul Oz!
Oz Hey, Paul.
Paul Finally matriculating with us, very cool! Tell me you'replaying this week!
Oz Thursday night, Alpha Delta.
Willow Ooh! I have that one!
Paul I'm bringing the wrecking crew. Jello shots? Hmm? Do you know where they're distributing the work study applications?
Oz Back of Richmond Hall, next to the auditorium.
Paul Thanks. Seeya bro.
Oz Go get'em. My band'splayed here a lot. It's still all new. I don't know what thehell's going on. Hey, Doug!
Willow Library... ooh! Library. C'mon.
Buffy It's too bad Giles can't be librarian here. Be convenient.
Willow Well, he says that he's enjoying being a gentleman of leisure.
Buffy Gentleman of leisure? Isn't that just british for unemployed?
Willow Uh-huh, he's a slacker now.
Buffy Speaking of slack, have you heard anything from Xander?
Willow Not for awhile, he's still on his cross-country-see-Americathing.He said he wasn't coming back until he had driven to all fifty states.
Buffy Did you explain about Hawaii?
Willow Oh, he seemed so determined.
Buffy I hope he gets back soon. It'd be fun to have the wholegang back togetheryou know?hanging out in the... library. Wow!
Willow Oh my gosh! Isn't this amazing?
Buffy It's... cozy.
Willow You know I never wanted to hurt Giles' feelings, but occultbooks aside, our old library just didn't have the greatest selection. Butthis!
Buffy Yeah, this is great, you know, if we ever need a place for theNuremberg rallies.
Willow This is a real library. See we evenhave to whisper. It's like a whole new world.
Willow Here.
Buffy Thanks. Can't wait tillmom gets the bill for these books, I hope it's a funny aneurysm.
Willow 'Introduction to Psychology.' Oh, up there.
Buffy I'll get'em. You know, this store discriminates againstshort people.
Willow Oh, I think there's a protest next week.
Buffy Woah, oh. Oh, ahh. Oh god, I'm so sorry.
Riley I'm okay. It's okay. Well, that was bracing.
Buffy I'm so... the books were just too high, and then everythingwas bad.
Riley Let me give you a hand. So,uh, are you girls taking Intro Psych, or do you just want me dead?
Buffy Uh-huh. I mean the first one.
Riley Well, you'll have a lot of fun. Professor Walshshe'squite a character.
Willow You've taken it?
Riley I'm a TA, I'll be helping the Professor out. I'm sorry,I've forgotten my manners in all the concussion... I'm Riley.
Willow Willow, and this is my friend Buffy.
Riley It's nice to meet you both.
Buffy I'm nice to meet.
Willow Hey, do you know if we're going to be studying 'Operant Conditioning'in the first semester? 'Cause I hear that's kinda Professor Walsh'sspecialty.
Riley Absolutely. Do you know her treatise on Dietrichs work?
Willow I know of it.
Riley It's not in the syllabus, but it's a fascinating read... ifyou're in to that sort of thing. They have it here.
Willow Oh, where?
Riley I'll show you. I don't meet that many freshmen that knowthat much about psychology.
Willow Well, it's fascinating.
Buffy Yeah, you know, 'cause everyone's got a brain. Or, almost everyone.
Buffy Hi.
Kathy Oh, hi! Are you Buffy?
Buffy Yeah.
Kathy Kathy.
Buffy Hi, it's nice to meet you.
Kathy Yeah!
Buffy So, it's, ah... it's a pretty nice room.
Kathy Hmm! I was surprised, 'cause you hear horror stories aboutfreshmen housing. You took the right side?
Buffy Yeah, umm, but if you want it...
Kathy No, no. I just wanted to make sure that's what you wanted.Exited for classes tomorrow?
Buffy Painfully.
Kathy I bet there's going to be a lot of parties to go tothis week, too. Not that I'm a crazy partier. Oh, and I'm notalways this hyper, either. I'm just excited.
Buffy Yeah, me too.
Kathy I am really glad they put me with somebody cool... I can tellthat you're cool. I just know that this whole year is going to besuper fun!
Professor_Reegert The point of this course is not to critique popularAmerican culture. It is not to pick at it, or look down upon it.And it is not to watch videos for credit.The point is to examine...
Buffy Do you know if this class isfull yet?
Professor_Reegert And there are two people talking at once, and Iknow that one of them is me. And the other is... a blonde girl. You,blonde girl. Stand up. I'm very excited to hear what you haveto say that's worth interrupting my lecture for.
Buffy I was just asking if the class was still open, if I could stillsign up.
Professor_Reegert If your name isn't on thissheet then you are wasting everyone's time. Are you on the sheet?
Buffy They told me that if I just...
Professor_Reegert Do you understand? You are sucking energyfrom everyone in this room. They came here to learn. Get out!
Buffy I didn't mean to... suck.
Professor_Reegert Leave! Thankyou.
Riley If, uh, you're looking for Psych, it's through here.
Buffy Oh, thanks. How's your head?
Riley Sorry?
Buffy Yesterday. In the bookstore. You don't remember.
Riley Oh no, sure, I remember you. You're Willow's friend.
Buffy Yeah.
Riley My head is fine, it just stung for a bit and I lost most ofmy basic motor functions. It's no biggie. We're here. I'm sorry, I'm trying to remember you.
Buffy Buffy.
Riley Buffy, right. Have fun tonight, ok?
Buffy Thanks.
Buffy You know, I was just wondering. Professor Walsh isn'tplanning on yelling at me and kicking me out of the class, is she?
Riley It's not in her lesson plan.
Buffy Great.
Willow How was pop culture?
Buffy I decided not to take it. It seemed dull.
Professor_Walsh Ok. This is Psych 105, 'Introduction toPsychology', I'm Professor Walsh. Those of you who fall under mygood graces will come to know me as Maggie. Those of you who don'twill come to know me by the name my TAs use, and think I don't know about,'The Evil Bitch Monster of Death.' Make no mistake, I run a hardclass, I assign a lot of work, I talk fast and I expect you to keep up. If you're looking to coast I recommend 'Geology 101,' that's where thefootball players are.
Buffy Ooh!
Eddie Wow, sorry.
Buffy No, I-I wasn't looking.
Eddie Did you, uh, lose your way?
Buffy Me? Oh, no, no, I'm just going to Fischer Hall. WhichI know is on the Earth planet. Recently voted 'Most Pathetic.' Uh-huh.
Eddie Hmm, well, I'm lost and I have a map. So...
Buffy Ooh, I come in second. I'm Buffy, by the way.
Eddie Eddie.
Buffy Ok, so... That's Fischer Hall,right?
Eddie Ok, and this is Dunwirth Building, that's my dorm... it's just...it's us I can't find.
Buffy Are we the blue part?
Eddie No... yes!
Buffy Ok, right, so I-I came from there, then we just wanna go thatway to the bike path.
Eddie You sound very certain, I'm in. You're taking 'Psych 105' withProfessor Walsh.
Buffy Yeah, I mean, I'm gonna try. She's not afraid of the longwords, huh?
Eddie Yeah, she's pretty intense. A lot of the courses are reallytough.
Buffy I'm a little upset. I had it on good authority that thiswas a party school.
Eddie I think it's supposed to get easier.
Buffy I still feel like carrying around a security blanket.
Eddie 'Of Human Bondage.' Have you ever read it?
Buffy Oh, I'm not really into porn... I mean I'm just... I'm tryingto cut way back.
Eddie No, there's no actual bondage, it's just a novel.I've read it, like, ten times. I always keep it by my bed... securityblanket.
Buffy I don't really have a security blanket... unless you count Mr.Pointy.
Eddie Mr. Pointy?
Buffy Oh, bike path. So it's nice to know that I'm not the onlyentirelyconfused person on this campus.
Eddie I suspect there's a lot of us.
Buffy Well, I'll look for you in Psych.
Eddie Yeah, maybe we can help each other figure out what the hellthey're talking about.
Buffy Ok.
Eddie Maybe even make it through the year.
Buffy Goodnight.
Eddie Night.
Sunday I'm sorry... did you lose your way?
Oz You looking for someone?
Buffy Yeah.
Willow You made a friend? Good for you.
Buffy Thanks, mom.
RA Yeah, Eddie just took off, packed his stuff, left a note. Happenssometimes. People just can't handle it. There's always a fewkids who lose it early in the first semester and just bail.
RA Weak ones, I guess.
Sunday Boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, astonishinglyboring... we... we have to kill some cooler people. Will somebody remindme?
FatVamp You were the one who said pickon the weak ones, thin the herd and all that. Does this sweater makeme look fat?
Sunday No, the fact that you're fat makes you look fat. Thatsweater just makes you look purple.
FatVamp You're such a loser.
Sunday Hey, words can hurt like a fist.
SpicoliVamp Hey, check it out.
Sunday Well? Do we have a Klimt? Yes!
SpicoliVamp Big score for Klimt! Monet still well in the lead, but look out for teamKlimt, coming from behind.
Sunday Freshmen! Man, they're so predictable.
SpicoliVamp And you can never eat just one.
FatVamp Yeah, I'm hungry!
Sunday What a shock. We eat when I say we eat.
FatVamp Well, we could hit the tunnels...
Sunday We eat when I say we eat.
FatVamp God, lighten up.
SpicoliVamp I think it's funny when you scream... it's like... whoa!
Sunday I got ta get me some better lackeys. I swear, you guysare useless. I shouldn't eventake you on the hunt.
FatVamp Great! Why don't you let dead Eddie get your dinner.
Sunday That's pretty much the plan.
Buffy Giles?
Olivine Rupert, is this Bleu cheese or is it just cheese that's goneblue? You're not Giles.
Buffy Uhm... you know the door was open, so I just... uh, Giles doesstill live here, right?
Olivia He does.
Olivia He appears. Rupert, you have a guest.
Giles Buffy! Hello.
Buffy Is this a bad time?
Giles No! Oh, uh, forgive me. This, uh... this is, uh,Olivia. She's, uh, an old friend, she's staying here for a few days.
Olivia Couldn't pass through sunny Cal without looking up ol' Ripper.
Buffy Uh huh.
Giles Buffy's a, uh, was a student of mine. How's, uh, how isuniversity?
Buffy Pretty much the same as high school, in the sense that I needhelp.
Giles Ahh... help... yes.
Buffy But, this just looks like a bad time.
Olivia No, you guys talk. I'll just go slip into something alittle less comfortable.
Giles So, uh, trouble with, uh, studies?
Buffy This is a bad time.
Giles You keep saying that.
Buffy Well it looks pretty bad! I think someone had just a littletoo much free time on their hands.
Giles I'm not supposed to have a private life?
Buffy No! 'Cause you're very, very old,and it's gross.
Giles Well, before I succumb to the ravages of age, why don't youtell me what brings you here.
Buffy There's this student missing.
Giles Yes?
Buffy Eddie. He's supposed to have left school but... I justdon't think he did. I met him outside last night, and then I wentback where we met, and it looked there had been a struggle.
Giles And?
Buffy And we need to stop this! And Eddie's RA said kids disappeara lot. There could be a gang of vampires working the campus. We need research, an-an-and charts and stuff.
Giles I-I still don't see where I fit in. You haven't describedanything that you can't do yourself.
Buffy Ok, remember before you became Hugh Hefner when you used tobe a watcher?
Giles Officially you know longer have a watcher. Buffy, youknow I'll always be hear when you need me. Y-your safety is moreimportant to me than anything but, you're going to have to take care ofyourself. You're out of school and I can't always be there to guideyou.
Buffy I'm sorry to bug you.
Giles Buffy, I...
Buffy Oh! No! I mean yeah, you're... you're right. I can handle it. It's just that... I'm on it.
Giles I-I'm here if you need me.
Olivia She's gone?
Giles Yes.
Olivia So, did you help her?
Giles I'm not sure.
Buffy How am I supposed to hunt in this mob? Don't you peoplehave homes?
Buffy Eddie?
Buffy Eddie! Eddie, hey, wait up!
Buffy God I was worried that something had happened to you...
Buffy ...and of course it has, 'cause you're a vampire. I'msorry.
Eddie I'm not.
Sunday Slayer! This is, I mean, what a challenge! The slayer!
Buffy And you are?
Sunday I'm... I'm Sunday, I'll be killing you here in a minute orso.
Buffy You know that threat gets more frightening every time I hearit.
SpicoliVamp Uhh... are we gonna fight? Or is there just gonnabe a monster sarcasm rally?
FatVamp I'm in for a piece.
Buffy Everybody gets to play.
Sunday Guys, this is totally mine.
SpicoliVamp Ok, but you gotta share the eatin'. 'Cause I'm thinkin'slayer's blood's gotta beWhoa!like Thai Stick.
Buffy I thought people were suppose to get smarter in college?
Sunday Yeah, I think you had a lot of misconceptions about college.Like that anyone would be caught dead wearing that.
Sunday Don't take this the wrong way, but... You fight like a girl.
Sunday Freshmen!
SpicoliVamp N-n-n-n-no! The best part was when you ragged onher clothes. She was like, 'No! Not the ensemble!'
Sunday Those Jeans? With the little patches? She has noone to blame but herself.
FatVamp I heard they're coming back.
Sunday Not if I kill every single person who wears them.
FatVamp I still think you should've let us have a piece, we could'vefinished here off.
Sunday She's not gonna last the night, she's a done deal. In fact,guys, you're gonna hit the tunnels.
Buffy Mom?
Joyce Buffy.
Buffy Hi.
Joyce Honey, how are you?
Buffy I'm ok.
Joyce How's college? You've been fighting.
Buffy Oh, uh, they started it.
Joyce Just as long as you're being careful. I-I really didn'tthink you'd show up here for a while.
Buffy Oh, I didn't have classes today, and everything's just beenso hectic I figured it'd be nice to come and crash for...
Joyce Oh, well yeah. You know, I-I didn't think you'd be backfor a couple of weeks. Uh, but I didn't move anything, it's stillyour room.
Buffy You filled it with packing crates.
Joyce Yeah, but I didn't move anything.
Buffy If it's still my room, shoudn't I still be able to fit in it?
Joyce Well it's just for a couple of weeks while we do inventory atthe gallery. I just really didn't think you'd be back so soon.
Buffy Neither did I.
Buffy Hello? Hello?
Xander The whole world in front of her, and she comes back to thisdive.
Buffy Xander!
Xander Hey, Buff.
Buffy Oh, when did you get back?
Xander Couple days ago.
Buffy You freak of nature. Why didn't you call me?
Xander Well I knew you guys were starting the whole college adventureand I didn't want to, um, you know... help you move.
Buffy I missed you. How was your trip? Is America nice? I hear it's nice.
Xander There's some purple mountains majesty, I'm gonna have to say.
Buffy What'd you do? What'd you see?
Xander Well...
Buffy Tell me!
Xander 'Grand Canyon!'
Buffy You saw the Grand Canyon!
Xander Well, I saw the movie 'Grand Canyon,' on cable. Reallylame.
Buffy Hunh?
Xander Basically, I got as far as Oxnard and the engine fell out ofmy car, and that was literally. So, I ended up washing dishes at'The Fabulous Ladies Night Club' for about a month and a half while I triedto pay for the repairs. No one really bothered me or even spoke tome until one night when one of the male strippers called in sick and nopower on this earth will make me tell you the rest of that story. Suffice to say I traded my car in for one that wasn't entirely made ofrust, came trundling back home to the arms of my loving parents, whereeverything was exactly as it was except I sleep in the basement and I haveto pay rent. How's college?
Buffy Male strippers?
Xander No power on this earth!
Buffy Ok. College is good.
Xander Ok, uh, once more with even less feeling.
Buffy No, really! I-I mean, Willow's in heaven and Oz has thisreally cool house off campus with the band.
Xander And you're sitting here alone at the Bronze looking like youjust got diagnosed with cancer of the puppy.
Buffy It's just... there was this vampire, and she took me down, andI just... I don't know how to stop her.
Xander Then where's the gang? Avengers assemble! Let'sget it going!
Buffy No, I don't want to bug them. I mean they're just startingschool, and they don't need this.
Xander Ok Buff, what's the 'what' here?
Buffy It's just, what if I can't cut it?
Xander Can't cut what? Slaying?
Buffy Slaying, everything.
Xander Buffy, this is all about fear. It's understandable, butyou can't let it control you. 'Fear leads to anger. Anger leadsto hate. Hate leads to anger.' No wait, hold on. 'Fearleads to hate. Hate leads to the dark side.' Hold on, no, umm, 'Firstyou get the women, then you get the money, then you...' okay, can we forgetthat?
Buffy Thanks for the Dadaist pep talk, I feel much more abstract now.
Xander The point is, you're Buffy.
Buffy Yeah, maybe in high school I was Buffy.
Xander And now in college you're Betty Louise?
Buffy Yeah, I'm Betty Louise Plotnick of East Cupcake, Illinois. OrI might as well be.
Xander Buffy, I've gone through some fairly dark times in my life,faced some scary things, among them the kitchen at 'The Fabulous LadiesNight Club.' Let me tell you something, when it's dark and I'm allalone and I'm scared or freaked out or whatever, I always think, 'Whatwould Buffy do?' You're my hero. Ok, sometimes when it's darkand I'm all alone I think, 'What is Buffy wearing?'
Buffy Can that be one of those things you never, ever, tell me about?
Xander It's a deal. Let's put this bitch in the ground! What do you say?
Buffy I think I say thank you.
Xander And nothing says thank you like dollars in the waistband. Ok,what do we do first?
Buffy Kids disappearing every year. Not too many, just enoughso that everyone thinks they up and left.
Xander I can't believe the vampires took your stuff. MurderI expect, but petty larceny seems so... petty.
Buffy They have to be keeping it somewhere, on campus or at leastnear by.
Xander Hey, how far back do the disappearances go?
Buffy Uhh... they weren't too common before '82.
Xander Match number! Check this out.
Buffy 'Psi Theta loses it's charter. Building to be closed forrenovation.'
Xander 1982. Look at this.'Former Psi Theta fraternity house lies dormant while zoning issues dragon before the city council.' We have a winner.
Buffy Looks pretty cherry.
Xander You up for a little reconnaissance?
Buffy You mean where we all sculpt and paint and stuff?
Xander No, that was the renaissance.
Buffy Oh. I've had a really long week. Let's go look atthe house.
Buffy Score!
Sunday Look how tough I am.
Buffy Oh! That's my skirt! You're never going to fit init with those hips! We have to kill them!
Xander We need weapons.
Buffy I don't see my weapons trunk down there. It was rightby my bed. Mr. Gordo? Go to my room. If it's not there try Willow's. I'll keep an eye... my diary?!?
SpicoliVamp Uh-oh, score!
Xander I'll hurry!
Buffy Laugh all you want, this time we play it my way. And the rules are just going to be a little bit...
Buffy Unh! Ahh. Ah. Oh.
Sunday Say, don't I know you from... beating the crap out of you?
Buffy I just thought I'd drop in. Get it? Drop in? Boy, tough room.
Sunday I must say, you've really got me now. I mean, it's adiabolical plan, throw yourself at my feet with a broken arm and no weaponsof any kind. How'm I going to get out of this one?
Buffy You got a nice set-up here, but you made one mistake.
Sunday Yeah? What was that?
Buffy Well, I'm not actually positive, but statistically speakingpeople usually make at least...
Kathy It seems kind of weird.
Oz Yeah, weird's a pretty good word for it.
Willow Buffy wouldn't just take off, th-that's just not in her nature. Except for that one time she disappeared for several months and changedhe name, but there were circumstances then. There's no circumstances.
Kathy Does Buffy have a history of emotional problems? 'Causeon my request form I was pretty specific about a stable non-smoker.
Oz I don't think this is her handwriting.
Willow I bet there were circumstances! We've probably been sowrapped up in our own petty lives that... that we totally missed the circumstances. We're bad friends!
Oz Let's think this through.
Willow How can you be so calm?
Oz Long, arduous hours of practice. Now either Buffy took off,or she was robbed, or...
Xander It's a prank!
Willow Xander!
Xander How are my guys? I don'tknow you, do I?
Kathy No.
Xander This is very intrusive, isn't it?
Kathy Little bit.
Xander Xander.
Kathy Kathy.
Xander Do we hug?
Oz I think we're too manly.
Willow What's the prank?
Xander Prank? Oh, the room. Well some friends of Buffy'splayed a funny joke, and they took her stuff. And now she wants usto help get it back from her friends who sleep all day and have no tans.
Willow Oh! Those friends!
Oz Funny guys.
Xander They took the chest. Well, let's go! Let's go toour friend. It's nice meeting you Kathy.
Kathy You too!
Xander Let's go to Will's, get supplies.
Willow Is Buffy in danger?
Xander She's in a holding pattern, we've got some time.
Sunday Oh, and this. This is my favorite item.
Buffy You don't want to touch that.
Sunday You know this arm's not looking so good. It might haveto come off.
Buffy You want to know the truth? I only need one.
SpicoliVamp This is startin' to suck.
SpicoliVamp Woah!
Sunday What about breaking your arm,how'd that feel.
Buffy Let me answer that with a head butt.
Buffy And for the record,the arm is hurt, notbroken.
Oz Hey, Buff. Need a hand?
Buffy No thanks, I'm good.
Xander So, all that other stuff in there? That's just gonnasit in there, right? Uh, I mean, no one owns it in the strictestsense.
Oz It seems wrong, somehow.
Xander Dibs on the rowing machine.
Giles Buffy!
Willow Hi, Giles.
Xander What's with the arsenal?
Giles I've been awake all night. I know I'm supposed to teachyou self-reliance, but I can't leave you out there to fight alone. To hell with what's right, I'm ready to back you up. Let's find theevil a-and fight it together.
Buffy Great! Thanks! We'll get right on that.
Giles The evil is this way?
Buffy My room is.
Willow Hey Giles, could you get this box on top?
Xander So, college not so scary after all, hunh?
Buffy It's turning out to be a lot like high school, which I can handle. At least I know what to expect.
