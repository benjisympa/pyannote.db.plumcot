Willow Hey look. Parker's here. You're not looking? He looks really cute in green.
Buffy Teal. He's reflected in the mirror.
Willow You know when you spend all week with a boy you are allowed to look at himdirectly.
Buffy Not all week. We hung out. Moderately incessantly. But we're not here togethertonight. You know, I don't want to crowd him.
Oz Hey. You guys ready to load up and go?
Willow Almost. Buffy's looking at Parker. Who it turns out has a reflection, so big plus there.Buffy's having lusty wrong feelings.
Buffy No I'm not.
Willow No, you're not.
Buffy Oh, I so am.
Willow No, uh, they're not wrong feelings cause you're free, you're both grown-ups.You are free, right?
Parker Hi.
Buffy Hi.
Parker I just wanted to let you know I'm headed out. And it's not real safe here, soif you want to walk back to your dorm.
Buffy How silly of me not to have planned ahead.
Willow Bye.
Parker See you guys.
Devon That was like the best set ever. We'll do great in LA. We're gonna have themglued to their seats.
Willow Uh, Devon. Aren't they supposed to dance?
Oz Well, we can glue them to the dance floor.
Devon I didn't mean with real glue. You got that right?
Harmony Willow, hi.
Willow Harmony, hey. I haven't seen you since -
Harmony Since graduation. Big snake huh?
Willow Yeah. So, how was your summer vacation?
Harmony Well I was gonna go to France. But I didn't. I was dying to see the stores.
Willow Yeah, and the museums.
Harmony Museums?
Willow Yeah, I heard they have them. You know, just a rumor you pick up on thestreets.
Harmony You were always so funny Willow. You haven't changed a bit.
Willow No, you neither.
Harmony Oh, maybe a little.
Willow Back off Harmony.
Harmony Okay, fine. Hide behind your boyfriend. But I have a boyfriend too. And he'sgonna be mad that you were mean to me.
Parker Uh, hobbies. Interests. I feel like there's so much I don't know about you.What do you like to do?
Buffy Mostly I hang out. And do ... stuff.
Parker Yeah, I was into that for a while. Hey, what's that.
Buffy What's what?
Parker You have a scar.
Buffy Yeah ... right ... angry puppy. So, I get to see any of your scars?
Parker Oh, mine are all psychological.
Buffy Please, those are the best kind.
Parker Well my father died last year.
Buffy Oh, God. Parker, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring it up, that stuff. Oh, bad,bad Buffy.
Parker No, I'm okay to talk about it now. And I'm not doing to deep, get sympathyroutine. I mean don't you just hate guys that are all 'I'm dark and brooding so give melove?'
Buffy I don't think I've ever met that type.
Parker I just wanted to say that it was so sad cause there was well, a lot of stuffthat he didn't finish. It make me think about, you know, living for now.
Buffy I think about that sometimes. I sort of drowned a couple years ago. But I cameback. Obviously. But I don't, I don't put stuff off anymore. Like you were saying.
Parker That's great. I mean, everybody says they get it. 'Oh, man. Me too. Live fortoday.' But what they really what is a reason to goof off. Not study for finals.
Buffy Also a valid life choice.
Parker It's cool to find someone else who understands.
Buffy So Parker Abrams. When you go to sleep tonight, what are you going to regretnot doing today?
Parker I'm going to regret ... being too nervous to ask you to go to the party atWolfhouse tomorrow night. Do you want to go to the party -
Buffy Yes.
Xander I am not enjoying this.
Giles Well shelve them correctly and we can finish.
Xander I don't get your crazy system.
Giles System? It's called the alphabet.
Xander Huh. Would you look at that.
Anya You should lock your door.
Giles Believe me, I'm kicking myself.
Xander Anya? Last time I saw you fleeing in terror. So how'd that work out for you?
Anya I need to talk to Xander. Go away.Xander come with me.
Anya Your mother said you were working here.
Xander Yeah I need some money.
Anya Where is our relationship going?
Xander Our what? Our who?
Anya Relationship. What kind do we have. And what is itprogressing toward?
Xander I ... Uh ... We have a relationship?
Anya Yeah. We went to the prom.
Xander Yeah, On our one and only date. Second date called on account of snake,remember? And the whole, you used to be a man killing demon thing. Which to be fair, is asmuch my issue as it is yours.
Anya I can't stop thinking about you. Sometimes in my dreams, you're all naked.
Xander Really. You know if I'm in the checkout line at the Wal-Mart I've had the sameone.
Anya So I can assume a standing Friday night date and a mutual recognition as Promnight as our dating anniversary.
Xander Anya. Slow down there. In fact, come to a screeching halt. See these thingskind of have to develop on their own.
Anya Okay. How?
Xander I don't know. I just - happens.
Buffy This is it. The door. Wood. Maybe some kind of wood veneer.
Parker It's nice.
Oz Hey. Hi, hi. Remember Harmony.
Willow She's back from her summer vacation. And she's a little bit different.
Buffy Different?
Willow Paler.
Parker Is yourneck okay?
Buffy Neck. Paler. The puppy. The angry puppy.
Oz Yeah, we came to warn you about the - angry puppy.
Buffy I um, should really take care of this now.
Parker I'll pick you up tomorrow night for the party.
Buffy I can't wait.
Willow Get in now?
Buffy Harmony. A vampire? She must be dying without a reflection.
Willow She just made me so mad. 'My boyfriends gonna beat you up.'
Buffy 'My boyfriend.'
Willow Well, if you believe her. She always lied about stuff like that. 'Oh, he goes to another school. You wouldn't know him.'
Oz Well, Devon dated her for a while, but she was too flaky for him. Which, stop andmarvel at the concept.
Buffy Guy dating Harmony dead. Must be like, the most tolerant guy in the world.
Harmony Hi baby. I'm back.
Spike It's definitely the crypt right. I'm not keen on tunneling into someone'sseptic tank.
Vampire It's the crypt. The radar soundings are clear. The walls are thinnest here atthe bottom. We'll have to tunnel underneath. More work but I'm sure -
Spike You'd better be more than sure. Cause I'd hate to have to hurt you.
Vampire I swear, I swear.
Harmony How's my little Blondie bear?
Spike Harm, does this look like a good time?
Harmony Are you gonna kill Willow tonight? Cause I want you to say, 'This is formessing with my sweet girl.' And then, you know.
Spike Nobody knows I'm here. And I'm not killing the slayer's best friend becausethat would tend to announce my presence. Andwe're too bloody close.
Harmony But you almost killed her last year. Suddenly it's a big deal.?
Spike SOD OFF! Now go eat something, I've got work to do.
Harmony This one tastes funny. Take me out to eat.
Spike He's perfectly fresh.
Harmony I think I had a math class with him last year and I didn't like him that muchthen either.
Spike Harm!
Harmony I want to go to a party.
Harmony Oh. Right here baby. In front of Bernie.
Spike You'd like that wouldn't you.
Harmony Maybe I would. After a party.
Spike Tonight. I'll take you somewhere nice.
Parker Some party huh? Last day in Rome.
Buffy Better. No old Romans.
Parker You want to dance?
Buffy No. Let's have a meaningful talk instead.
Buffy Spike. And Harmony.
Harmony Buffy. Hi. What a cute outfit. Last year.
Spike Well this is interesting. Sort of a double date.
Parker Looks like your friend started the party a little early, huh?
Spike So, let's have a look at the new boy.
Parker Hi, I'm Parker.
Spike He's got. What's the word? Vulnerability.
Buffy And you with Harmony. What'd you do? Loose a bet?
Harmony Hey.
Spike Actually, how we met. It's a funny story.
Buffy Stay here.
Buffy What's the matter Spike? Dru dump you again.
Spike Maybe I left her.
Harmony She left him for a fungus demon. That's all he talks about most days.
Spike Harm! We are going. It isn't time yet.
Harmony Yeah, but as soon as we have the gem of amara, you're gonna be sorr-
Spike Argh!
Harmony What? Ow!
Xander Come in.
Xander Anya. Hi again.
Anya You're mother sent me around from the front of the house. She said to ask you toadd fabric softener when the timer goes off. Can we talk some more?
Xander Yeah I suppose. Would you like something? I have cran-apple?
Anya Yeah, alright.
Xander You know it is customary to call before you show up. Not that -
Buffy Yeah, Spike with Harmony. If you can believe it. I couldn't figure out why heran away but Harmony said something. Why they were here. They were looking for the gem ofsomething... Amara.
Giles The gem of amara. Are you sure?
Buffy Yeah, what's up?
Buffy Uh, oh, it's just, uh, it's not real.
Giles It's uh, the vampire equivalent of the Holy Grail. The source of some enormouspower, was convienetly vague. Oh, here it is, yes. There was a great deal of vampiricinterest in locating it during the, uh, oh the 10th century. Questing vampires combed theearth, but no one ever found anything.. It was concluded that it never existed.
Buffy Well, Spike seems to think it exists. And he's looking in Sunnydale.
Giles Yes, well I'll research it as best I can. You've done all you can for tonight.Why don't you go to bed.
Buffy Uh, huh. Sleepy. Yawn. Bye.
Harmony Is Antonio Banderas a vampire?
Spike No.
Harmony Can I make him a vampire?
Spike No. On second thought, yes. Go do that. Take your time. Do Melanie and the kidsas well.
Harmony Hey, I don't have a pulse. Cool. Hey, can we eat a doctor so we can get astethoscope and hear my heart not beating?
Spike Harm. Will you shut the hell up?!
Harmony And if my hearts no beating, what are these blue veins for. I'm simplycovered in these blue veins.
Harmony See.
Spike I've got an extra set of chains.
Harmony Just because Dorkus went in for that -
Spike Dru-scilla. Say her name.
Harmony Dorkus.
Spike Bite your tongue.
Harmony Do it for me.
Anya At point the matter is brought to a conclusion with both parties satisfied andable to move on with their separate lives and interests. To sum up, I think it's aworkable plan.
Xander So, the crux of this plan is -
Anya Sexual intercourse. I've said it like a dozen times.
Xander Uh, huh. Just working through a little hysterical deafness here.
Anya I think it's the secret to getting you out of my mind. Putting you behind me.Behind me figuratively. I'm thinking face to face for the actual event itself.
Xander Ah, right. It's just we hardly know each other. I mean I like you. And youhave a certain directness that I admire. But sexual interc What you're talking about,welland I'm actually turning into a woman as I say thisbut it's about
Anya Oh, I have condoms. Some are black.
Xander That's... that's very considerate.
Anya I like you. You're funny, and you're nicely shaped. And frankly, it's ludicrousto have these interlocking bodies and not... interlock. Please remove your clothing now.
Xander And the amazing thing... still more romantic than Faith.
Anya Fabric softener.
Buffy Parker. I was afraid I wouldn't be able to find you.
Parker I was getting a little worried.
Buffy I'm so sorry. It's just that - the English guy is an old friend. And he's notsupposed to drink. And I saw him here in the land of the beer -
Parker It's okay. You did a good thing for your friend. Did uh, you and he used to goout.
Buffy Um, no. No we really, really didn't.
Parker Good. Now we have time to make up for. Think I could get a dance with theprettiest girl at the party.
Buffy What am I supposed to do? Stand over here and watch?
Parker Well, I declared premed. But I hated it. So I switched to history.
Buffy History? Fascinating dates and compelling faces.
Parker But there something amazing about these huge events that when you dig downinto them they're just about regular people trying to make choices. When you look back atit seems like people were swept up in events they couldn't control. But I don't believethat. I believe you have a choice in everything you do.
Parker Is this okay? Because I can stop if you wanna. It's your choice. What are you doing?
Buffy Making a choice.
Giles Buffy are you there? Call me, I need to talk to you right away.
Buffy Parker?
Buffy Just shirt. Pants. Everybody needs pants.
Parker Hey, you're up.
Buffy You're here.
Parker I live here.
Buffy Oh, I just, didn't know where you were.
Parker It looked like you were going to be out for a while. So I ran for coffee.Better than what I got around here. Warm soda and breath mints.
Buffy Breath mints. Wouldn't be turning them down right now. So, do you have anyplans for today?
Parker Actually my mom's coming to visit.
Buffy Oh, well I'll just clear out then. But maybe we could um, talk or somethinglater.
Parker Absolutely, I'll give you a call.
Buffy Great. Oh, uh, one more thing before I go.
Parker A kiss.
Buffy Well I was going to go with pants, but a kiss is good too.
Anya So, I'm over you now.
Xander Um, Ok.
Anya Okay?!
Xander Yeah...
Spike Harm, what are you doing.
Harmony I'm writing Spike loves Harmony on your back.
Spike Why?
Harmony I don't know, it's fun. I'm bored. You can write on me.
Spike I've got to get back to work.
Harmony You love that tunnel more than me.
Spike I love syphilis more than you.
Giles Oh, good morning.
Buffy Giles, I didn't know you were here.
Giles Uh really.
Buffy I was studying at the library. All Saturday night.Uh, you know what. I'm an adult now and it's none of your business what I do.
Giles I'm sincerely relieved to hear that. Now can we discuss the impending disaster.
Willow Giles found something.
Giles A text. It refers to the gem of amara as residing in the valley of the sun.
Willow Demon fancy talk for Sunnydale.
Giles It seems that Spike may know what it's about. The gem may exist after all, inSunnydale in a sealed underground crypt.
Buffy Why don't you guys try and locate the crypt and I'll try to find Spike beforehe gets there.
Giles I'll get started.
Willow I'll go call Xander and have him meet at your place.
Giles Right.
Willow It happened right? Did ithappen? With Parker?
Buffy Yeah, it happened.
Willow Well, and details. I mean not details. I don't need a diagram. But, you know.Like maybe a blurry watercolor.
Buffy It was nice. It was really nice. He's going to call.
Willow I love this part. Don't you love this part. Like when it's all new andeverything's a discovery.
Buffy I don't know. I guess I do.
Spike It's here.
Vampire I knew it was here.
Spike We're close now. No one leaves the layer till we're in. I don't want the slayertracking anyone to the tunnel. And that means you too Harmony. You're an indoor kitty now.
Harmony But Spike, you said you'd take me places. You said we'd go to France and nowI can't even leave the lair.
Spike Listen to me, you stupid bint. This gem is everything I came back to Sunnydalefor, which has witnessed some truly spectacular kickings of my ass. Now, when I have thegem, they'll all die, don't worry. But until then, stay inside. And by the way, I would beinsanely happy if I heard bugger all, about sodding France.
Harmony I don't know why I let you be so mean to me.
Spike Love hurts baby.
Phone You've got one new message at 9:05 p.m. Hi, It's me. I'm at Giles. Did Parkercall yet?
Spike It's real.
Harmony Ooh, pretty. Can I take stuff?
Spike Take whatever you want I don't care.
Harmony Eww. Like you're too good to work a clasp.
Harmony So is it doing it? Do you feel it. I mean, you don't look different, if youwere wondering. I thought maybe you'd look taller or glow or something. Hmm.
Harmony You should put some butter on that. But, hey, maybe it's worth money, anyway.That would be something. Then we couldgo to France, I always wanted to go to France and stay in a chateau and you could take meshopping -
Harmony I can't believe you just did that.
Spike Hold on.
Harmony What are you doing you big freak?
Spike That's my gem.
Harmony Fine if that's all that matters to you. Then take it, take it, take it and get out.
Spike That's a good idea. I think I'll go wait outside.
Oz Okay, either I'm borrowing all your albums or I'm moving in.
Giles Oz there are more important things than records right now.
Oz More important than this one?
Giles Well I suppose an argument could be made for -
Xander Whoa, Giles has a TV. Everybody, Giles has a TV. He's shallow like us.
Oz I got to admit, I'm a little disappointed.
Giles I, ah, uh, uh.
Willow Well maybe it doesn't work. Like a piece of art.
Giles Public television. Come on everyone we have vital work to do. Watchingtelevision is not going to help us right now.
TV - near the UC Sunnydale campus. Officials attribute the unusual occurrence toweakening of the supporting topsoil nearby. City work crews denied any tunneling has beendone in the area.
Giles Tunneling. Spike. Xander, find Buffy and meet us there.
Parker You know it hit me hard, my dad. Since then I just don't put stuff offanymore. It's about living for now.
Buffy Parker?
Parker Buffy. Buffy Summers, this is Katie Loomis.
Buffy What's going on?
Parker Hey, Katie, you're going to be late for class. I'll catch up later, okay.
Buffy She's a friend of yours.
Parker Yeah, you'd like her a bunch. So, what's up?
Buffy Well, um you didn't call. I'd, uh I understand if you were busy or sick orsomething.
Parker It's only been a few days. You need to talk to me about something.
Buffy Is everything okay?
Parker Sure it is.
Buffy It is?
Parker Sure.
Parker Sure, we could do that absolutely.
Buffy So what about tonight.
Parker Oh... Uh... I think I'm supposed to get together with some people later ...
Buffy Parker did I do something wrong?
Parker Something wrong? No, of course not. It was fun didn't you have fun. Watch outhow you answer that. My ego is fragile.
Buffy You had fun? Was that all it was?
Parker What else was it supposed to be?
Buffy It seemed like you liked me.
Parker I do. But I'm starting to feel like you felt what? Some kind of commitment?Are you sure that's what you want right now?
Buffy I just thought...
Parker I'm sorry if you missed something. I thought things were pretty clear.
Buffy I'm sorry if I miss. I'm sorry.
Parker Look, I really have to go now.
Buffy Parker wait. I did this all wrong.
Parker No, it's cool. We'll hook up later.
Spike Wow. That was pathetic.
Spike Birds singing, squirrels making lots of rotten little squirrels. Sun beamingdown in a nice, non-fatal way. It's very exciting, I can't wait to see if I freckle.
Spike Oh, do it again. It tickels. You know, in a good way.
Spike The gem of amara.
Spike Official sponsor, of my killing you.
Harmony Being a vampire sucks.
Xander Buffy. Buffy.
Anya Xander. I was looking for you. You weren't in your musty basement.
Xander Have you seen Buffy.
Anya No. About what happened. I said I was over you -
Xander Anya, I don't have time.
Giles Harmony, where's Spike? Has he had the gem.
Harmony He staked me, then he took it. He tried to take it right off my finger. LikeI wouldn't have just given it to him. I would have given him anything he wanted. He was myplatinum baby and I loved him.
Giles Where did Spike go?
Spike Getting tired Slayer?
Buffy Xander, get out of here.
Spike So, you let Parker take a poke, eh? Didn't seem like you know each other thatwell. What did it take to pry apart the Slayer's dimpled knees?
Buffy You're a pig Spike.
Spike Did he play the sensitive lad and get you to seduce him? That's a good trick ifthe girls thick enough to buy it.
Spike I wonder what went wrong. Were you too strong? Did you bruise the boy? Come tothink of it seems like someone told me that. Who was it? Oh, yeah. Angel.
Spike Take it off me this way, we both burn.
Buffy Really? Let's see.
Willow I like it.
Oz It's small.
Xander Really worth getting my ribs bashed in.
Giles It's also very dangerous. And we're destroying it.
Buffy We don't destroy it.
Giles Well, Buffy, any vampire that gets his hand on this is going to be essentiallyunlikable. Oh.
Oz I have that gig in LA. I could swing by.
Buffy Thanks Oz.
Xander What's going on. What's in LA?
Willow She's giving the ring to Angel. Don't make a fuss.
Giles Buffy are you sure.
Buffy He should have it.
Buffy So what I'm wondering is, does this always happen? Sleep with a guy and he goesall evil. God, I'm such a fool.
Willow Well maybe you made a mistake. But that's okay. Next time - what?
Buffy Parker said it's okay to make mistakes. It was sweet.
Willow No it wasn't. He was saying that so you would take a chance and sleep withhim. He's a poop head.
Buffy You're right. He's manipulative and shallow. And why doesn't he want me. Am Irepulsive? If there was something repulsive about me you would tell me, right?
Willow I'm your friend. I would call you repulsive in a second.
Buffy Maybe Parker and I could still work it out. Do you think we could still work itout?
Willow I think you're missing something about this whole poop head principal.
Buffy I think I'm gonna take a walk. You go on ahead.
Willow You sure?
Buffy Yeah.
