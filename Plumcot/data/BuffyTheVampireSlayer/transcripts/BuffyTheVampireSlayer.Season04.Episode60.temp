Buffy “Parker, did I do something wrong?”
Parker “Didn’t you have fun?”
Buffy “Is that all it was?”
Parker “What else was it supposed to be?”
Buffy “He’s manipulative and shallow, and why doesn’t he wantme?”
Willow “I think you’re missing something about the whole poop-headprinciple.”
Xander “Hi again.”
Xander “So, college not so scary after all, huh?”
Buffy “It’s turning out a lot like high school,which I can handle.”
Xander “I don’t know, I was going for ferocious, scary, butit’s coming out more dryly sardonic.”
Willow “It does appear to be mocking you with its eye holes.”
Oz “The nose hole seems sad and full of self-loathing.”
Buffy “I was just thinking about the life of a pumpkin. Grow up in the sun - happily entwined with others, then someone comes along,cuts you open and - rips your guts out.”
Xander “Okay, and on that happy note, I’ve got a treat for tomorrownights second annual Halloween screening. People - prepare to haveyour spines tingled, your gooses bumped by the terrifying Fantasia. Fantasia?”
Oz “Maybe it’s because of all the - horrific things we’ve seen,but hippos wearing tutus just don’t unnerve me the way they used to.”
Xander “Phantasm. It was supposed to be ‘Phantasm”. Stupid video store!”
Willow “I thought we were doing the alph delt thing.”
Xander “What thing?”
Buffy “The scary house? Sounds kinda lame.”
Oz “It actually borders on fun. You have to go throughthe scary house maze to get to the party. Which is usually worthgetting to. Those guys go all out.”
Willow “As witnessed last Friday.”
Oz “Very true.”
Xander “There is a party?”
Willow “We didn’t tell you?”
Xander “No, it’s cool. You guys got your little collegething. I’m fine. I mean, I got better things to do than tagalong to some Fraternity.”
Willow “You can come.”
Xander “Okay. But only because I lied about having betterthings to do.”
Oz “A blast will be had by all.”
Buffy_gets_up “I’m gonna get going.”
Xander “Now? Tonight’s still...okay,it’s a little mature, but still.”
Buffy “I’m sleepy. You guys have fun.”
Willow “You want me to come with?”
Buffy_leaves “No I’m fine.”
Willow “She didn’t even touch her pumpkin. It’s a freakwith no face.”
Oz “She’s still suffering a little post-Parker depression.”
Xander “Bailing on the Buff. Does anyone else want tosmack that guy?”
Kid “Jeez, that hurt! What the hell is wrong with you,lady?”
Buffy “That’s what I’d like to know.”
Willow “I’ve got the basics down – levitation, charms, glamours. I just feel like I’ve plateaued wicca-wise.”
Buffy “What’s the next level?”
Willow “Transmutation, conjuring, bringing forth something fromnothing. Gets pretty close to the primal forces. A little scary.”
Buffy “Well, no one’s pushing. You know, if it’s too muchdon’t do it.”
Willow “Don’t do it? What kind of encouragement is *that*?”
Buffy “This is an ‘encouragement’ talk? I thought it was‘share my pain’.”
Willow “I don’t know. Then again, what is college forif not experimenting? You know, maybe I can handle it. I’llknow when I’ve reached my limit.”
Buffy “Magic.”
Oz “Ooh, you didn’t encourage her, did you?”
Willow “Where is supportive boyfriend guy?”
Oz “He’s picking up your dry cleaning, but he told me to tellyou that he’s afraid you’re gonna get hurt.”
Oz “Oh, I’m with you on the reference, but – I won’t lie aboutthe fact that I worry? I know what it’s like to have power you can’tcontrol. I mean, every time I start to wold out, I touch something–deep – dark. It’s not fun. But just know that what ever youdecide, I back your play.”
Buffy “See? Concerned boy, sweet boy.”
Willow “I kinda like him - worrying anyway.”
Buffy “You know I, uhm, I forgot – to be hungry.”
Buffy “He didn’t. I just don’t want to deal with thisright now. I’m taking a holiday from dealing, happily vacationingin the land of not coping.”
Willow “You know what, you’ll feel better at the party tonight. Maybe you’ll even meet someone.”
Buffy “Willow, I don’t want to meet someone. I’ve reachedmy quota on someones. Besides, I think I’m gonna have to patrol anyway.”
Willow “Tonight, but – it’s Halloween!”
Buffy “I’ll double check with Giles, but I’m sure he’s goingto think I should be on active Slayer duty. He doesn’t care aboutHalloween.”
Giles “Happy Hallow - Hello, Buffy?”
Giles “It’s a sombrero.”
Buffy “And it’s on your head.”
Giles “It seemed festive. Uhm, come in.Candy?”
Giles “I never said any such a thing. As my Watcher’sduties took precedence, I simply haven’t taken time to – well, to embraceits inherent charms – until now. Look, look! It’s alive! See – how he shakes? - Is– is there something you wanted?”
Buffy “I was thinking that I should patrol tonight. Youknow, possibly the cemetery or if you had a better su... could you pleasetake that off?”
Buffy “No. But then you know we were all caught of guardwhen Ethan turned everyone into their costumes.
Giles “True, but what happened then was anomalous. Creaturesof the night shy away form Halloween. They find it all much too crass.”
Buffy “Hard to believe.”
Giles “Well, I-I promise you - there is little likelihood ofany supernatural activity tonight. Yousure you don’t want one?”
2.Guy “The sound system is not going to cut it. Nothingbut lame.”
1.Guy “You want me to call Oz? He can probably hook usup.”
2.Guy “Do it. If we not scare the young women, they willnot fall into our arms. - We’ll have woman-less arms. Halloween isn’tabout thrills, chills and funny costumes, it’s about getting laid.”
1.Guy “Is there any holiday that’s not about getting laid?”
2.Guy “Arborday. Call Oz, dude.”
1.Guy “Done. And oh, you wanted a symbol to paint upstairs,something mystical? Checkthis out.”
Xander “Anya? You really have to get this knocking thingdown. - How did you...?”
Anya “You’re uncle Rory let me in. Does he always smelllike peppermint?”
Xander “The man likes his schnapps. What are you doinghere?”
Anya “You haven’t called. Not once.”
Xander “You said you were over me.”
Anya “And you just accepted that? I only said that becauseI thought that’s what you wanted to hear.”
Xander “That’s the funny thing about me, I tend to hear theactual words people say and accept them at face value.”
Anya “That’s stupid.”
Xander “I accept that. - I can’t say seeing youfalls into the realm of a bad thing.”
Anya_smiles “Really? - I thought - maybe we couldgo out tonight, for our anniversary.”
Xander “Anniversary?”
Anya “It’s been exactly one week since we copulated. - Did youforget?”
Xander “Oh, no, of course not. It’s just I already haveplans with Buffy, Willow and Oz. It’s Halloween, you know.”
Anya “I don’t understand.”
Xander “Well, every October 31st, we mortals dress up in masks...”
Anya “No, no, I understand that inane ritual. It’s thosepeople. You continue to associate with them though you share littlein common.”
Xander “What are you talking about?”
Anya “I mean they go to college, you don’t. They no longerlive at home, - you do.”
Xander “Oh, hey, those things... The bonds of true friendshiptranscends... Could we just change the subject?”
Anya “Okay, okay. Don’t get upset with me. I justwondered.”
Xander “If you want you can come with me tonight to this party.”
Anya “You mean like a date? - Is that what this is? Are we dating?”
Xander “There are definitely date-like qualities at work here.– Oh, you’ll need a costume.”
Anya “A costume?”
Xander “Dress up, you know, something - scary.”
Anya “Scary. Scary how?”
Xander “Anya, you ex-demon, terrorized mankind for centuries. I’m sure you’ll come up with something.”
Buffy “Excuse me, Professor Walsh? I came to get today’sassignments. I, uh, couldn’t make it to class for personal reasons.”
Walsh “Right. I count four limbs, a head no visible scarring,so I assume your personal issue wasn’t a life threatening accident of anykind, I’m therefore uninterested. You got problems, solve them onyour own time. Miss another class and you’re out.”
Riley “She means it, you know.”
Buffy “Yeah. I got the impression she wasn’t saying itto make me laugh.”
Riley “You’ve got to be aware your work’s taken a little downturn lately. I can’t remember the last time I’ve seen your hand up.”
Buffy “Does stretching count?”
Riley “Look, things get pretty intense Freshmen year, - as Idimly recall. Too much fun or not enough?”
Buffy “Thanks, I’ll get this done tonight.”
Riley “Tonight. It’s Halloween! What, your not goingto dress up and go party?”
Buffy “I have a lot of work to do.”
Riley “I may be out of line here, and it’s not really my business,but - you seem like the kind of person that makes things really hard onthemselves. Halloween isn’t a night for responsibility. It’swhen the ghosts and goblins come out.”
Buffy “That’s actually a misnomer.”
Riley “Well, I didn’t mean real ones. But, hey, there is some good scary fun to be had on campustonight.”
Buffy “Yeah? What are you doing?”
Riley “Well, I’m going to sit here and grade papers.”
Riley “Very.”
Buffy “Well, thanks for the pep talk, coach.”
Riley “Don’t make fun. I worked long and hard to get thispompous.”
Buffy “No, I mean it.”
3.Guy “Okay, watch your step, boys. Paint’s still wetin a few spots.”
2.Guy “Thanks for the loan, man. Our sound system sucks.”
Oz “Mi casio es su casio.”
3.Guy “No - clue. I got it out of this book. Thereis a lot of really cool stuff about...”
2.Guy “Eyeballs, man. Blindfold chicks and have them sticktheir hands in the bowl and tell them it’s eyeballs. They love that.”
Xander “And here I was wasting time buying them flowers andcomplimenting them on their shoes. So, you go through the whole houseof horrors downstairs and it ends up here. Sweet. You fratlyguys have a nice setup.”
2.Guy “Hey, mighty, mighty Alpha Delts. You should thinkabout pledging.”
Oz “Oh, Xander is a civilian.”
2.Guy “Ah! Townie, huh? Didn’t know. He lookedso normal. You sure we should let him come to the party, Oz?”
Xander “Hey, standing right here.”
2.Guy “Cranking.”
Xander “And you feel stabbing it is the proper solution?”
Oz “I’m just going to trim the wire. It might be a short.”
Oz_straightens_up “Ah!”
Xander “Oz?”
Oz “Cut myself. It’s okay.”
Xander “Playing with knives, fun, yes, but not safe. Andwhen you bleed to death I’ve got dibs on your equipment.”
Buffy “Thanks again for doing this at the last minute.”
Joyce “I’m just glad I could find it. There. Try it now. I let down the hem and loosened it a little around the hood.”
Joyce “I’m sorry. I’m thinking about the little girl whowore that. What is it? Five? Six years ago.”
Buffy “Yeah, little red riding hood was the cutting edge incostumes.”
Joyce_laughs “Your father *loved* to take you out.”
Buffy “He was such a pain! 12 years old and I can’t gotrick-or-treating by myself?”
Joyce “He just wanted to keep you safe.”
Buffy “No, he wanted the candy. I was just the beard.”
Joyce “Oh, that’s not true actually. The candy was forme. - Your father loved spending time with you.”
Buffy_looks_down “Not enough, I guess.”
Joyce “Buffy.”
Buffy “Oh, that just paved right over memory lane, huh?”
Joyce “Our divorce had nothing to do with you.”
Buffy_swallows “I don’t know. – I’m starting to feel like thereis a pattern here. – Open your heart to someone, and he bails on you. Maybe it’s easier to just not let anyone in.”
Joyce_gets_up “I thought it might be easier. You musthave noticed that I am not exactly the social butterfly I was when I waswith your dad. I don’t think I made a single new friend the yearwe moved to Sunnydale.”
Buffy “Why not?”
Joyce “Fear. I didn’t believe I could trust anyone again. It’s taken time and a lot of effort, but I’ve got a nice circle of friendsnow. - I mean, don’t get me wrong. I – I’m still a littlegun shy. It certainly didn’t help that my last boyfriend turned outto be a homicidal robot. I will *always*be here for you. And you got Mr. Giles and your friends. Believe me, there is nothing to be afraid of.”
Willow “I’m late for a battle or I would. I love youroutfit though.”
Lobster “There is nothing going on here.”
Present “I saw you flirting with her!”
Lobster “Do we have to do this every time? I love you,you know that!”
Rachel “You guys are sick!”
2.Guy “Here, give me your hand.”
2.Guy “Eyeballs, Rachel, they’re eyeballs! Muahaha!”
Xander “Hey, Red. What you got in the basket, little girl?”
Buffy “Weapons.’
Xander “Oh.”
Buffy “Just in case. Like the tux, Xander.”
Xander “Bond. James Bond. Insurance, you know, incase we get turned into our costumes again. I’m going for cool, secretagent guy.”
Buffy “I hate to break it to you, but you’ll probably end upcool head waiter guy.”
Xander “As long as I’m cool and wield some kind of power.”
Buffy “Will. Medieval Will.”
Xander “Hail, ye olde – vareletty – thou.”
Willow “I’m Joan of Arc. I figured we had a lot in common,seeing as how - I was almost burned at the stake, and plus she had - thatclose relationship with God.”
Xander_to_Oz “And you are?”
Oz “Blasphemer.”
Buffy “Nice costumes. Very stealthy.”
Willow “What are they supposed to be?”
Oz “NATO?”
Xander “Oh, yeah, I, ah, invited Anya to join us, but she’shaving some trouble finding a scary costume, so she’s just going to meetus there.”
Buffy “Perfect, everybody’s got a date but third-wheel Buffy.”
Willow “You’re not a third wheel.”
Xander “Technically speaking you’re a fifth wheel.”
Voice_rumbles “Release me!”
Xander “The joint’s not jumping. Where is everybody?”
Oz “Follow the signs.”
Oz “Frat boys aren’t too obsessive with their cleaning. Might not be decoration per se.”
Xander_panting “I wasn’t scared, I was in the spirit.”
Willow “And we back you up on that. Even if they questionus separately.”
Willow “Okay, that is not sanitary!”
Buffy “Yeah, lets get to the party part of the – party.”
Willow_to_Oz “Are you sure it’s off?”
Oz “I thought this led to...”
Xander_to_Buffy “What is it?”
Xander “Okay, actual creeps have been given. Bravo,frat boys!”
Buffy_stands_up “Shh! Do you hear something? Likea - squeaking noise?”
Xander “Oh, it’s these rented shoes, patent leather. Iasked the guy to...”
Willow “No, no, I – wait. It’s something else. Ihear it, too. Something like...”
Willow “No, Oz, don’t it might be...”
Oz “Rubber. It’s made of rubber.”
Buffy_looks_around “What the hell is going on here?”
Xander “Look, maybe it’s nothing. Maybe it’s just a neattrick. You know, something done with wires or...”
Rumbling_voice “Release me!”
Xander “Or it might be something else.”
Anya “Where is the door? Hey! Hello!”
Girl “Help me! Help me!”
Xander “Where is the stairs?”
Willow “Where is the door?”
Buffy “This is the way we came in, right? We just wentin a circle? Thankthe lord!”
Oz “You’re welcome.”
Willow “Hey, I have a neat idea: lets get out of here!”
Buffy “And you were so anxious for me to come.”
Willow “I’m serious, Buffy. We don’t know what we’re dealingwith.”
Xander “My turn. Does anyone hear that?”
Buffy “As soon as we start dealing with it I’ll know what itis we’re dealing with. Do you hear something?”
Xander “Like I said. Sounds like a hissing.”
Xander “I thought the word hissing kind of covered that nicely.”
Chaz “I’m sorry. I didn’t know. I’m sorry.”
Chaz “I didn’t know.”
Oz “What’s happening?”
Chaz_rocking_harder “It ah...”
Buffy_impatiently “What is it?”
Chaz “It’s alive. It’s alive.”
Xander “He’s in shock.”
Buffy “Chaz, what happened here?”
Buffy “I think the cape took most of it.’
Xander “Let me see.”
Oz “Could need stitches. You should at least get a bandageor something.”
Oz “Cowering in a closet is starting to seem like a reasonableplan.”
Willow “You’re telling us to run away and leave you behind?”
Anya “Are you listening? Xander is trapped!”
Giles “Uh, ah, where is Buffy and the others?”
Anya “They’re trapped, too, but we’ve got to save Xander!”
Anya “Uhm, ah, we were supposed to meet at this house, and Igot there and there was no door where a door should be. And thenI see this girl standing in a window, and then poof! She’s gone.’
Giles “She vanished from the window?”
Anya “No, the window vanished from the house.”
Giles “Hmm. Matter and reality distortion. Like a summoning spell’s temporal flux.”
Anya “What?”
Giles “Hmm? Oh, never mind. I just need to get some- supplies together. I wouldn’t worryabout Xander. At least he’s amongst friends.”
Willow “You’re telling me? You’re telling me?!?”
Buffy “I can’t do my job if I have to worry about each of yoursafety.”
Willow “It’s not your decision!”
Buffy “Got to disagree with you there.”
Willow “Oh, of course you do.”
Xander “Let’s all take a breath. Buffy, maybe...”
Willow “Being the Slayer doesn’t automatically make you boss. You’re as lost as the rest of us.”
Oz “What are we talking about?”
Willow “It’s a simple incantation, a guiding spell for travelerswhen they become lost or disoriented.”
Buffy “And how does it work?”
Willow “It conjures an emissary from the beyond that – lightsthe way.”
Buffy “Conjuring. Will, let’s be realistic here. Okay, your basic spells are usually only fifty-fifty.”
Willow_upset “Oh yeah? Well, - so is your face!”
Willow_turns_around “I’m not your sidekick!”
Xander “Well, that was a bunch of laughs. Look, Buffy, we are all tired and a*little* edgy. Maybe Willow is over reacting. I’m sure partof it is because of how you’ve been ‘pushing away’ girl lately. But now is not the timeto let that stuff tear us apart. What I’msaying is, I’m right with ya. I’m right by your side. I’m...”
Buffy_looks_around “Xander?”
Xander “Funny how you still haven’t lost your sense of inappropriatehumor.”
Xander “Buffy, knock it off. Skit’s over. I’m right here.”
Xander “Typical?”
Xander “Buff?”
Willow “She thinks I’m not ready to be a full blown witch! I can handle the dark forces as good as anyone else. It’s not thathard. I-It’s just a guiding spell and I’m careful and all.”
Willow “Look. We found the stairs. Buffy didn’t find the stairs, no sir!”
Oz “Willow, something is happening.”
Oz “I’m changing.”
Willow “But – but you can’t! There is no moon tonight.”
Oz “I have to get away.”
Willow “No, we need to find something to restrain you, likea rope or chains, or something.”
Oz “There is no time!”
Willow “I can do the guiding spell. I know I can makeit work!”
Oz “Will, please.”
Willow “Oz! – Oz, don’t leave me!”
Head “I can see you.”
Buffy “Willow.”
Buffy “Basement. - I must be in the basement.”
Hollow_voice “All alone.”
Guy “They all ran away from you. They always will. Open your heart to someone and – But don’t fret,little girl, you’re not alone anymore.”
Giles “We’re gonna have to create a door.”
Anya “Create a door. You can do that?”
Broken_neck_guy “No matter how hard you fight, you just endup in the same place. I don’t see why you bother.”
Buffy “I’m upstairs. The goat room.”
Willow “Couldn’t get them off..”
Oz “It’s okay. It’s okay. We’re okay.”
Xander “I’d offer *my* opinion but you jerks aren’t gonna hearit anyway. Not that ‘didn’t go to college’ boy has anything importantto say. I might as well hang out my new best friend, bleeding dummyhead, for all you dorks care.”
Buffy_yells “What is wrong with you?”
Xander_gets_up “You – you heard that? You – you can seeme? Good. Oh, God, good!”
Oz “The house separated us. It wanted to scare us.”
Willow “But - we got away.”
Buffy “No. We were brought here. We all got so scaredthat we ended up here. – Why?”
Buffy “Can you translate?”
Rumbling_voice “Release me! Release me!”
Buffy “Will, give me something.”
Willow “Okay, uhm, uhm, the icon’s called the-the Mark of Gachnar. I-I think this is a summoning spell for something called..”
Xander “Gachnar?”
Willow “Well, yes. Somehow the beginning of the spellmust have been triggered. Uhm, Gachnar is trying to manifest itself,to-to come into being.”
Buffy “How?”
Willow “I-it feeds on fear.”
Buffy “Our fears are manifesting it. We’re feeding it. We need to stop.”
Xander “If we’re close our eyes and say it’s a dream it’ll stabus to death! These things are real.”
Rumbling_voice “Release me!”
Buffy “Okay, so our fears are feeding it, if we get everyoneout of here..”
Xander “Good plan. Lets go!”
Xander “Giles? Everyone, it’s Giles! With a *chainsaw*.Glad you could make it.”
Giles “The walls closed up behind us. Gachnar, of course. It’s presenceinfects the reality of the house, but it’s not managed to achieve fullmanifestation. We can not allow this to come into being.”
Buffy “But if it does I can fight it, right?”
Buffy “I *don’t* want to fight that. So, we break thespell.”
Xander “What ever we do, lets do it fast.”
Giles_flipping_pages “I have it, I have it. Uhm, ‘The summoningspell for Gachnar can be shut down in one of two ways. Destroyingthe mark of Gachnar – Is *not* one of them and will in fact immediatelybring forth the fear demon itself.”
Willow “Look!”
Buffy “This is Gachnar?”
Xander “Big overture. Little show.”
Gachnar “I am the dark lord of nightmares! The bringer of terror! Tremble before me. Fearme!”
Willow_laughing “He – he’s no cute!”
Gachnar “Tremble!”
Xander_bends_down “Who’s a little fear demon? Come on! Who’s a little fear demon!”
Giles “Don’t taunt the fear demon.”
Xander “Why, can he hurt me?”
Giles “No, it’s just – tacky. Be that as it may, Buffy,when it comes to slaying...”
Buffy “Size doesn’t matter?”
Gachnar “They’re all going to abandon you, you know.”
Buffy “Yeah, Yeah.”
Oz “Some quality treats here, Giles.”
Giles “*Please*, finish them.”
Buffy “Uhm, this is much better. There is no problem thatcan not be solved with chocolate.”
Buffy “Except that.”
Anya “What?”
Xander “That’s your scary costume?”
Anya “Bunnies frighten me.”
Giles “Oh, bloody hell. The inscription!”
Buffy “What’s the matter?”
Giles “Actual size.”
