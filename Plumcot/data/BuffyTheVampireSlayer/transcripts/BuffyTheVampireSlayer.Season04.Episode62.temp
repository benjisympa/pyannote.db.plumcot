Buffy Thanks for the relocate. I perform better without an audience. You're gonna get heartburn. Getit? Heartburn? That's it? That's all I get? One lame-assvamp with no appreciation for my painstakingly thought-out puns. I don't think the forcesof darkness are even trying. I mean, you could make a little effort here, you know? Giveme something to work with.
Spike Watch your mouth, little girl. You should know better than to tempt the fatesthat way. 'Cause the big bad is back, And this time, it's... Urrgh! Aaaahhh!
Willow The bronze is more fun this year, isn't it?
Buffy 'Cause of the gloating factor alone, you know? We're all about college now.We've got heady discourse.
Oz Yeah. Curfew-free nights of mom and popless hootenanny.
Xander Coed dating prospects who find townies sexy and dangerous. What, I can dream.
Buffy Right. So if college is so great, what are we doing here and why is it morefun?
Willow Because the bronze is nice and familiar. It's like a big comfy blanky.
Oz I was under the impression that I was your big comfy blanky.
Willow Aw, you're my my person blanky. This is my place blanky. You know, with allthe shock of the new, it's nice to have one place that you can come back to whereeverything's predictable.
Giles Hello.
Buffy Giles, trouble?
Giles Oh, no, Buffy. Don't get up. No. Nothing like that. No, I just, you know, Ithought I'd drop by. Uh, latte anyone? On me?
Buffy So much for your predictable blanky theory, Will.
Giles Splendid. Well, it's ages since I've been to a gig. Well, don't look that way.
Buffy Yes, but it's your cutting edge 8-tracks that keep you ahead of the scene.
Oz Don't scoff, gang. I've seen Giles' collection. He was an animal in his day.
Giles Thank you.
Buffy Hey, why not? If the stones can still keep rolling, why can't Giles?
Giles Exactly.
Willow I think it's brave that you're here.
Giles Well, thank you, all. You've made me feel right at home.
Xander Isn't home that empty place you're trying to escape?
Giles Oh, yeah.
Willow Veruca's playing tonight.
Oz Yeah. Every Wednesday. I told you.
Buffy So, Oz, what about dingoes? When are you guys here again?
Oz Oh, we're up next friday.
Willow They're good, aren't they?
Oz Nothing special.
Willow Yeah. She's quell fiona. Color me bored.
Giles Really? I think she's rather remarkable. Such presence for someone her age.
Oz What's in the sandblaster, Will? It'sa dream. Come back to me.
Willow Mmm...Hmm... All geminis tothe raspberry hats.
Oz Now you're faking.
Willow Am not. Just a little. (She turns to face Oz.
Oz Morning.
Willow Morning.
Oz Bad dream?
Willow I guess. But the waking up part makes up for it.
Oz It's always so busy in there.
Willow Not always. A few things shut my brain up completely.
Oz Anything I can help you with?
Willow I gotta get to class right now, but tonight for sure.
Oz I don't know about tonight, unless the extreme jerry garcia look turns you on.
Willow Huh?
Oz Night before the full moon.
Willow Oh, that's right. And I have a thing. There's this wicca group on campus Iwanted to check out. They have orientation on the 3 nights you're wolfy. And it's probablytotally silly, but
Oz No. Go. Show 'em how it's done.
Willow Are you sure? You can lock yourself up? It's only this one month.
Oz I'll be fine.
Willow Ok. As long as you don't mind.
Oz The only thing I mind is being away from you for 3 nights.
Walsh Ms. Summers... I want you to prepare to lead a discussion group next class
Buffy What do I have to do?
Walsh If you have any questions, bring them up with one of the T.A.S.
Willow Are you ok? How'd you do? This is good. I mean, this is excellent. You did better than me. This is so unfair! You made me jealous of you academically. Buffy!
Buffy I know. Can you believe it?
Willow Wow. I guess professor Walsh isn't so ogrey after all.
Buffy And she wants me to lead a discussion group next class. That means more work,right? Shouldn't she have a better reward system? You know, like acookie or a toy surprise like at the dentist?
Willow She wants you to lead a discussion group? Ok. Jealous again. Jealous, jealous ok. I'm back. Hey, I'm meeting Oz at thecafe. You wanna come? I'll buy you that celebratory cookie.
Buffy Great. I'm T.A. Bound right now, and then I will catch up with you guys.
Willow Cool.
Veruca What are you gonna do, sit on the ground?
Oz My girlfriend's coming.
Veruca There's room.
Oz Big lunch?
Veruca I like to eat. I hate chicks who are like, does it have dressing onit?
Oz Agreed. You guys were tight last night.
Veruca I guess. The set's starting to come together, but the amps still sound dirtyto me.
Oz What are you using? 50 Or 120?
Willow Hey.
Oz Hey.
Veruca Hey.
Oz You wanna sit down? So you should be using a 50. And blue voodoo,not your best bet, unless you dig the distort.
Willow Music talk, huh? Cool. I love to listen to oz talk about the biz.
Veruca What do you like again? I know you told me.
Oz There's a couple good ones. The johnson mil... The number one is redbone.
Veruca Number one? No. I gotta go with hound dog.
Willow Me, too. That's a great song. I mean, elvis, what a guy.
Veruca You a big elvis fan?
Willow The biggest. Well, I mean, after dingoes, of course.
Oz We're actually talking amps. But it's easy to get confused, The names they give'em.
Willow Oh. Ha ha.
Oz You know, I gotta bail. Um, I'll call you later.
Veruca I should go, too. Good shirt.
Buffy Check out the rapid exits. Was it me?
Willow Me. I don't speak musicianese. How come you didn'ttell me
Buffy I thought that was the point. He thinks she's sexy. He gets this blushy thinggoing on behind his ears. That's for me only.
Buffy It doesn't mean anything. So Oz checks out another girl. He loves you.
Willow I know. II know. And I don't wanna be the kind of girl who freaks every timemy boyfriend notices somebody else. I mean, I have wrong feelings about other guyssometimes, but I feel guilty, and I flog and punish.
Buffy Exactly. I'm sure Oz is flogging and punishing himself. This is sounding wrongbefore I even finish. Look, I promise you, in a couple of days, it's gonna be likeveruca who?
Willow You think?
Buffy Absolutely. Oz just isn't the type to stray. Not tonight anyways. He'll belocked in a cage.
Oz That was, um...
Veruca Some night.
Oz So it appears.
Veruca Right. You don't remember. It's like that at first, but then little bits andpieces will start coming back to you.
Oz So you're A...
Veruca Werewolf groupie. Nobody else gets it done for me.
Oz What?
Veruca Kidding. You know what I am. You've known since the first time you saw me.Now, you... Need...To relax.
Oz Not a possibility.
Veruca So what do you want to do?
Veruca God! The kids in the dorm need fashion 101 in a big way. Or we could start right here at home.
Oz Not making a statement. Just wanna get back to my place, figure out why we got outof our cages.
Veruca You have a cage?
Oz Don't you?
Veruca Uh, yeah. Has a little wheel with a plastic ball And a cute little bell in it.God! Somebody's domesticated the hell out of you.
Oz It's my choice. I don't wanna hurt anybody.
Veruca Maybe. Or maybe you just don't wanna admit what happened to you. Maybe youjust wanna pretend like you're a regular guy.
Oz Well, I am. I'm only a wolf 3 nights a month.
Veruca Or you're a wolf all the time and this human face is just your disguise. Youever think about that, Oz?
Oz I'm going. I gotta check the paper, see if we did any damage last night.
Veruca Oh, we did. But only to each other. I know some part of you remembers that. Itdoesn't take a full moon. We could...Do it again right here. (She's gettingcuddly with him.
Oz We aren't going to. This ends... Right now.
Veruca I can help you, Oz.You're scared. I was, too. Butthen I accepted it. The animal, it's powerful, inside me all the time. Soon, you juststart to feel sorry for everybody else because they don't know what it's like to be asalive as we are. As free.
Oz Free to kill people? I won't do that. You shouldn't.
Veruca You don't understand. But you will. You'll see that we belong together.
Oz No. I know where I belong.
Veruca See ya tonight.
Walsh 2 Of them. It was unbelievable. The fact that I survived at all is a miracle.
Buffy Excuse me. Ms. Walsh?
Walsh I hope you're careful when you walk around campus after dark. I was attacked bywild dogs last night.
Buffy Wild dogs?
Walsh 2 Of them. Biggest things I've ever seen. The first one was Well, for amoment, I thought it was a gorilla. Did you have a question, Buffy?
Buffy No. No, I was just... Sayin' howdy.
Walsh Fine. See you in class.
Oz Yeah?
Willow Hey.
Oz Hey. New look.
Willow You, too.
Oz Oh. Uh... Laundry day kinda came and went.
Willow Hey... I'm sorry if I was weird yesterday with you and Veruca.
Oz I didn't notice anything.
Willow Really? 'Cause I felt all spazzy.
Oz No.
Willow Oh. Good. So it was just me worrying for nothing again. Me and my busy headalways thinking, thinking, thinking.
Oz Well, now you can stop everything's fine.
Willow Maybe you could help me...Stop. I'd really, really appreciateanything you could do.
Oz What?
Willow What's wrong?
Oz Uh...Sorry. I...
Willow You don't want to?
Oz It's not that. I do. I just... I didn't get any sleep, I guess. I'm really beat.
Willow Right. Busy wolf night. I get it. It's totally ok.
Oz Willow, you don't have to
Willow No. II should. I don't have much time. See you later.
Giles Peace of westphalia.
Contestant Uh, yalta?
Giles Oh, you moron. That dinette set should be mine.
Giles Buffy. Excellent. Uh, come in.
Buffy Hi.
Giles Can I get you anything? Tea? I made a very interesting mousaka last night, ifyou're hungry.
Buffy Pass on the tea. And the moose, thank you.
Giles You come on business, I hope?
Buffy Yes. Lucky for you, people may be in danger.
Giles I only meant, uh, that I'm at the ready.
Buffy Here's the deal. One of my professors said that she was almost attacked by twowild dogs last night... Under the light of a nearly full moon.
Giles Werewolves. Two Of them?
Buffy Could be. Well, I've not seen anything about the attacks in the newspapers oron the news.
Giles Have you spoken with Oz?
Buffy My next stop.
Giles Right. Get right on it.
Buffy And I'll see what I can find out.
Giles And you report back to me...
Buffy Asap. Promise.
Xander Hey, Will. Mom let you in?
Willow She seemed cranky.
Xander Yeah. We're having a little landlord-tenant dispute, So I'm withholding rent.An effective, and might I add, thrifty tactic.
Willow How come?
Xander She won't let me put a lock on my door. I suspect she's afraid I'll starthaving the sex.
Willow Yeah. Parents usually wait till you're out of the house. Or under it.
Xander Or under it...
Willow To start worrying about stuff like that.
Xander It's mostly too late. So, I know why I'm sitting in a dank, sunless littleroom. But why are you?
Willow Well, things with Oz are weird. And I talked to Buffy about it, but I thinkwe're in guyville here. I need a translator from the y side of things.
Xander Well, last time I checked, I had the creds. Hit me.
Willow What does it mean when a girl wants to... You know.
Xander If you're doin' it, I think you should be able to say it.
Willow Make love.
Xander Wild monkey love or tender Sarah Mclachlan love?
Willow Any kind. But what if the girl wants to and the guy doesn't? That's a badsign, right?
Xander Could be. Or the girl caught the guy in one of the 7 annual minutes he'slegitimately too preoccupied to do it.
Willow Well, say the girl's been noticing
Xander Will, I've deciphered your ingenious code.
Willow Ok. Say I've been noticing Oz notice someone else. A woman.
Xander And is this chick noticing back?
Willow Most definitely.
Xander Well... Have you asked Oz about it?
Willow Well, I thought about it, but then he'll think I'm all jealous and worry.
Xander But you are. And odds are, he feels it. I'll bet that's all there is to theweird you're feeling. You guys should talk things out, Wll. You'll both feel better.
Buffy Got out, huh?
Oz Yeah.
Buffy Any news about attacks?
Oz No.
Buffy But I did hear about a woman being chased by two wild dogs.
Oz Two? Really?
Buffy You don't remember anything like that, do you? Another wolf?
Oz No. When the change comes, it's like...I'm gone. Total blackout.
Buffy You know, I find wolf number two out on patrol tonight, and you might have aroomie in there. Oz... Youok? And if it's possible, you seem more monosyllabic than usual.
Oz I'm ok. Thanks.
Veruca So this is why you called me here? To see your habittrail? Right before sunset, I get a little buzzed, you know?
Oz Come here.
Veruca I'm not getting in that stupid cage with you, if that's what this is allabout. We belong outside.
Oz You can't run loose tonight. And not just because you might hurt somebody. I knowpeople that'll be out there... Hunting for us.
Veruca So you're saying I should spend the whole night with you...Alone... Locked in a cage.
Oz You'll be safe.
Veruca Not from you. Isn't that the point of this cozy little arrangement? It'scoming. Do you feel it? It's like blood boiling.
Oz I feel it.
Veruca I've wanted you evenbefore I ever saw you. I sensed you. Did you sense me?
Oz Come in here.
Veruca Did you?
Oz Willow...
Willow Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
Oz I know what you saw. It wasn't I had to.
Willow I bet.
Oz She's like me. A wolf.
Willow Well, I knew you two had a lot in common, but...Don'ttouch me!
Oz She was gonna hurt somebody. I didn't have a choice.
Willow But you did. You could've told somebody. Your solution... Just put you twotogether in a room all night?
Veruca Girl's got a point.
Oz Leave.
Veruca I'm just saying
Oz Now! I'm sorry. I know.
Willow I knew, you jerk. And you sat there, and you told me everything was fine? Andthat's as bad as... As...
Oz I know how it feels. I remember.
Willow Oh. So what, this is payback? I had this coming?
Oz No. It's not
Willow Because I thought that was behind us. And you know, what happened with Xander,it doesn't compare. Not with what you and I had. Not with whatever you've been doing withher.
Oz I don't know what Veruca and I have done. When I change, it's like, it's like I'mgone and the wolf takes over.
Willow But before this, when you were regular Oz, you had feelings for her, didn'tyou?
Oz No. I could sense something, but...
Willow But you wanted her... Like in an animal way? Like...More than you wanted me?
Oz Willow!
Buffy Willow, are you ok? Thank you. I was too far away.
Riley It was lucky. She almost got hit.
Buffy Willow, what's the matter?
Riley Maybe you should take her home. Whatever it is, it's not worth hurting yourselfover.
Buffy Thank you.
Buffy I have to go. I have to find Veruca before the sun sets. I will, though.
Willow No.
Buffy I'll come back as soon as this is finished. I just want you to take it easy,ok?
Willow Uh-huh. Ok.
Buffy You're ok?
Willow I'm fine. I promise.
Buffy I love you.
Willow Put the blame where it belongs.
Oz So you haven't seen her around? Ok. Thanks, man.
Buffy Where is she?
Oz I don't know. I already checked all the usual haunts. But I know the areas we'redrawn to. I'm pretty sure I can follow her scent.
Buffy We'll try that, then.
Oz Look, buffy, you should know that
Buffy Oz... Now might be a good time for your trademark stoicism.
Willow I conjure thee by barabbas, by satanas, and the devil. As thou art burning,
Oz She's near here. I can smell her.
Buffy Or the dirty pile of clothing she left on the ground.
Oz Well, they could be from the other night when she Turned into a werewolf. U
Buffy Unless she wanted to throw you off the scent.
Oz Willow.
Willow Let this image seal his fate, not to love, only hate.
Veruca Wow. For a minute there, I thought you might actually playrough. Sometimes you have to, you know? To keep what's yours, sometimes you have to kill.How 'bout that? The sun's almost down.
Veruca Can't say I'm surprised you didn't go through with your little hex. You don'thave the teeth.
Willow You don't know what I have. You don't know anything about me.
Veruca I know what you love. I have his scent on me right now.
Oz Don't touch her again.
Veruca Come stop me. I like it rough, remember?
Oz You wanna hurt me, hurt me. You leave her out of this.
Veruca How can I? She's the reason you're living in cages. She's blinding you. Whenshe's gone, you'll be able to admit what you are.
Oz You don't wanna find out what I am.
Veruca You're an animal. Animals kill.
Oz You're right. We kill.
Willow Oz?
Giles I'm not quite sure I understand.
Buffy There was just so much going on with oz and willow. And there still is. But Ijust thought you should know.
Giles Well, this fellow in the woods, he was in military garb?
Buffy And he was toting some serious weaponry. The thing is, I saw some guys dressedexactly like him on halloween night. I just assumed they were in costume.
Giles You saved Willow.
Buffy Right now she wishes I hadn't. Giles, I've never seen her like this. It's likeit hurts too much to form words.
Giles You've... You've felt that way yourself, And you got through it.
Buffy Yeah. I ran away and went to hell and then got through it. I'm kind of hopingshe doesn't use me as a model.
Giles Fair enough.
Buffy I just don't know how they're gonna deal with this.
Willow Hello.
Oz Hi.
Willow What are you doing?
Oz I'm going.
Willow Now?
Oz Mm-hmm.
Willow That's your solution?
Oz That's my decision.
Willow Don't I get any say in this?
Oz No. Veruca was right about something. The wolf is inside me all the time, and Idon't know where that line is anymore between me and it. And until I figure out what thatmeans, I shouldn't be around you... Or anybody.
Willow Well, that could be a problem 'cause people... Kind of a planetaryepidemic.
Oz I'll find someplace.
Willow Well, how long?
Oz I don't know.
Willow Oz... Don't you love me?
Oz My whole life... I'venever loved anything else.
Willow Oz... Oh, god. Oz...
