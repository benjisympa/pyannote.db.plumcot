Forrest Women. Young, nubile, exciting. Each one a mystery, waiting to be unlocked.Think any of them are gonna show? 'Cause the party will be lame if we lack for hotties.Professor? You with me?
Riley No. I'm with this large pile of ungraded papers, due at 3:00.
Forrest How are you gonna learn anything if you keep doing schoolwork? Oh...Check herout. Is she hot, or is she hot?
Riley She's buffy.
Forrest Buffy? I like that. That girl's so hot, she's buffy.
Riley It's her name, Forrest.
Forrest You've established first contact? Excellent. What do you think of her?
Riely I haven't really thought about what I think of her.
Forrest A girl that cute in the face, and you form no opinion?
Riley No, I mean, She's all right, I guess. She's just kind of... I don't know.
Forrest Peculiar? Hi. Hey, graham, what do you think of the blonde chick?
Riley I don't dislike her. She just she never feels like she's really there whenyou talk to her. I like girls I can get a grip on.
Forrest I bet you do.
Riley Not that way. Just a little less ready for takeoff all the time. There'sdefinitely something off about her.
Graham Maybe she's canadian.
Forrest Didn't she go out with parker abrams for about 30 seconds?
Riley Abrams? Yeah, there's a sign of good taste.
Forrest Ok, but you've got to admit she's a major league hottie.
Riley Well, I'm not denying she's easy on the eyes.
Forrest Hell, yes. I bet a lot of guys would like to get their hands on her.
Spike Slayer... I'll kill you. Not so tough. I... Kill slayer.
Giles Well, based on buffy's description, I believe the men that we're after
Xander The latest in fall fascism. I like it. A bit full in the hips for my taste,but
Giles Oh, I think we can safely assume they're human, So, um, no research needed.
Xander No studying? Damn! Next thing they'll tell me is I'll have to eat jellydoughnuts or sleep with a supermodel to get things done around here. I ask you, how muchcan one man give?
Giles Not too much, I'm afraid. Um... Once again I'd say that you and I will not beneeded to help buffy.
Xander Really?
Giles Really.
Xander Well, how about this? We whip out the ouija board, light a few candles,
Giles Wee bit unethical.
Buffy Hello, people. Hey. Mmm. It's my late night stormtrooper pal.
Giles It'sit's just for reference, you know, But fairly accurate you'd say?
Buffy That's your man.
Giles Your man, actually. Uh...You are patrolling tonight?
Buffy Nope, I am going to a party tonight. Hopefully, a no fighting, nobiting kind of deal.
Giles Look, buffy, somebody's got to find out who these people are.
Buiffy Giles, I live in a dorm now. The girls in my hall want to party,
Xander How's will dealing
Buffy With the black hole of despair she's been living in sinceOz left? She's dealing. I'm helping. It's hard. Ergo, party. You two can take patrol.
Vampire Don't drink it. It's drugged.
Spike Uh-huh. And who are you, mate?
Vampire I'm a rat. I'm a lab rat, just like the others. They're gonna kill us, youknow.
Spike And how are they gonna do that?
Vampire They starve you. When you're ready to bite your own arm, they shoot out oneof those packets. You drink, and the next thing, you're gone. And that's when they do theexperiments.
Spike And, uh, they are? The government? Nazis? A major cosmetics company?
Vampire Who cares? All I know is, one minute I'm running from the slayer,
Spike The slayer! I knew it! I knew it!
Vamire Yeah, she took apart my crew, and led me straight to these guys.
Spike She set me up, too. I always worried what would happen
Buffy Stupid pen. My notes!
Wilow Ballpoints can be tricky.
Walsh I'll see you all tomorrow.
Willow Riley. I notice you left off a name today in roll call. Osbourne, DanielOsbourne, Oz?
Riley He's not in this class anymore. I hear he dropped out.
Willow Oh, well you heard way wrong then. I mean, he's notgone. Hehe left temporarily to work out a few things. I know that sounds lame in itsvagueness, but I assure you, Oz will be back.
Walsh Not to my class, he won't. An educatedguess. You know the rules, you know I hate exceptions,
Willow Oh, but
Walsh It is. To you. But since I'm neither a freshman nor anarcissist, I have to consider the whole class. If your friend can't respect my schedule,I think it's best he not come back.
Buffy You know, for someone who teaches human behavior, you might try showing some.
Walsh It's not my job to coddle my students.
Buffy You're right. A human being in pain has nothing to do with your job.
Walsh I like her.
Rirley Really? You don't think she's a little peculiar?
Xander Here we go. Gear for tonight. If some commando squads are out there, fullyloaded, these babies might give us the edge we'll need.
Giles That's a very impressive array. Where'd it all come from?
Xander Uh, requisitioned it. Back when I was a military guy.
Giles That was 2 years ago. You still 100%?
Xander Are you kidding? I put the semper in semper fi. I might not be able toassemble an m-16 blindfolded like I used to or pass weapons drill from the mobileinfantry... Might as well face it. Right now, I don't have the technical skillsto join the swiss army. And all those guys ask you to do
Giles Well, I'm sure you'll be ready when the time comes.
Xander Oh, fear not. Hand to hand? I'm still the man. Whoever these guys trainedwith, I'm sure they're not ready to deal with
Xander's_Mother Xander!
Xander Yes, mom!
Xander's_Mother I made up a nice fruit punch for you and your friend. Would you boyslike some?
Giles Is it, uh, raspberry fruit punch?
Riley So she says, you teach human behavior. Maybe you ought to showsome.
Forrest Oh, you're lying. She says that to Walsh?
Riley Hope to die.
Forrest Doesn't lack for guts. You've got to give her that.
Riley Yeah, but she's nuts.
Forrest Oh, come on. Like you never wanted to tell the professor off? Hey, Parker!
Parker Forrest. What's up, man?
Forrest What's the scoop on Buffy Summers? Is she cool?
Parker Buffy? Yeah, she's all right, I guess. I mean, kind of whiney.
Forrest How's that?
Parker Well, you know, clingy. I mean, we got a little physical Uh, well, fullyphysical, and then she's all over me, you know, like we're betrothed or something.
Forrest No, but fun was had, yeah?
Parker oh, yeah. The word is stamina. I mean, definitely a bunny in thesack, but later on, well. You know the difference between a freshman girl and a toiletseat? A toilet seat doesn't follow you around after you use it.
Riley I can't believe that I did that.
Forrest Welcome to the club. Do you have any idea how much trouble
Graham He won't, he's too embarrassed.
Riley I hit him.
Forrest What the hell for?
Riley Hehe was just being so crude.
Forrest Please. You've heard me say much grosser things than that.
Riley And most of those are about your own mother.
Forrest What is it?
Riley I just didn't like hearing him talk about buffy thatway. I think I... Well, I guess I like her.
Forrest You're kind of like a moron.
Riley So, you... You knew that I had feelings for her.
Forrest Everybody knows, man. Oh, she's peculiar? Dead giveaway, buddy.
Riley I'm always the last to know.
Forrest So, whatcha gonna do?
Riley Well, I guess I'm gonna go see a girl.
Spike Sorry, can't stay. Got to go see a girl.
Vampire Let me out!
Spike Bit busy right now.
Vampire Look, I know where the exit is. You spring me, you're free. You don't, you'redead.
Vampire Hurry! Hurry!
Vampire This way!
Spike New plan! We split up. You go that way. He shoves the vampire into the ops guysand flees.
Willow Come in. Oh, Riley. Hi.
Riley Hi. Gee, I hope I'm not interrupting anything really depressing.
Willow What's up?
Riley Right to the point, ok. I was thinking of asking out Buffy.
Willow She's not here.
Riely I know. See, I don't know that much about Buffy. But I'm interested in what shelikes, and so far, well, the only thing that I know she likes is you.
Willow Whatwhat do you want me to do?
Riely Just tell me something. Anything. Just give me a clue to Here, let me help you withthat. Just something that will start us talking, youknow? I'm thinking that how'bout them broncos won't really cut it.
Willow Ok, say that I help, and you start a conversation. It goes great.
Riley Yep, that's the plan.
Willow I figured it was.
Riley Oh. Look, if you want to tell me to go to hell, that's ok. Maybe this is thelast thing you want to talk about. I just feel that, well, I've never courted anyone likeBuffy before. I don't think I've ever met anyone like Buffy before.
Willow Why should I trust you?
Riley Just sort of hoping you'd think I have an honest face.
Willow I've seen host faces before. They usually come attached to liars.
Riley All right. I guess I'm not gonna win, here. And I appreciate you wanting toprotect your friend. I guess, uh, she kind of brings that out inpeople.
Willow She likes cheese.
Riley What? Well, I'm not saying it's the key to her heart, but Buffy... She likescheese.
Riley That's a start.
Willow She has a stuffed piggy named Mr. Gordo, loves ice capades without the irony,and she's dragging me to this party tonight at lowell house.
Riley Oh, you're going? That's my house. I live there.
Willow Well, it'll give you a chance to interact, but don't get fresh.
Riely Fresh? I don't even know if we like each other yet. Hey, does she ever talkabout me? Like, has she ever said...
Willow Sorry.
Riley That's discouraging. Still, I feel like I have a fighting chance with my newaccomplice.
Willow I'm not your accomplice.
Riley No, no. Of course not.
Willow I'm not.
Riley You're not.
Willow We're clear.
Riley We're clear.
Harmony Spike? Spike, is that really you?
Spike It's me, baby.
Harmony Bastard. You dumped me and staked me and hurt me and left me
Spike I know, sugar, but you're forgetting one other thing I did. I missed you.
Harmony Really?Oh! Just don't ever do that to me again.
Spike Oh, never, my little foam latte. Your blondie bear is here to stay.
Harmony Well, where have you been? No, wait. Don't tell me.
Spike Oh, forever and ever, mon petite creme brulee.
Harmony Ooh. Italian.
Spike Uh, yeah, and get used to it. Big daddy's home. We're gonna go wherever youwant, do whatever you want, kill whoever you want. Starting with the slayer. And after that, it's all youand me, my little mentholated pack of smokes.
Harmony Spikey. Let's leave the slayer alone. You know she'llonly slap you around, and I can do that.
Spike Ow! Uh, no, see, ow.
Xander Every man faces this moment. Here. Now. Watching. Waiting
Giles Oh, shut up.
Buffy Looks cool.
Willow Uh-huh.
Buffy Look, we could go.
Willow No-no, we're here for fun.
Buffy Oh, look. Some of the guys are here already.
Willow I'm gonna grab a soda. I'llI'll find you guys.
Buffy Ok.
Willow Ok, she's wearing the halter top with sensible shoes. That means mostlydancing, light contact, But don't push your luck. Heavy conversation's out of thequestion.
Riley So what do I do?
Willow Ask her to dance.
Riley Right. Dance. Wait. No.
Willow What's the matter?
Riley I can't dance.
Williow Then talk. Keep eye contact. Funny is good, but don't be glib. And remember,if you hurt her, I will beat you to death with a shovel. A vague disclaimer is nobody'sfriend. Have fun.
Riely Excuse me. Hi.
Buffy Hi.
Riley Um...Buffy... You do the reading on chapter 9?
Buffy Uh-huh.
Riley Wow. Some theories, huh? Cheese?
Xander Harmony.
Harmony Xander?
Xander That's close enough. I'm warning you: I've been highly trained toput this through your heart. No mercy, no warning.
Harmony I can kill you where you stand.
Xander Bring it on, then.
Xander Ow!
Harmony Ow! You sissy kicker!
Xander Get away! Aah! Cut it out!
Harmony Ow, I'm so gonna bite you!
Xander Ow... Ok, stop, stop! We should stop, ok?
Harmony Ok, I will if you will.
Xander Uh-huh. Uh-huh. 1...2...3!
Harmony Right, ok.
Xander Harmony, it's been great catching up. Really, I'm just gonna pick up thetattered shreds of my dignity and go home... Leaving you with your fire.
Harmony My fire? Yeah, right. Like I listen to the sex pistols. Eww. This crapbelongs to Spike.
Xander Spike?
Harmony Can you believe him? He comes back with all these big promises, not that Ibelieved him, you know. But he could have spent one night, but, no. Everything wasslayer this and slayer that. I mean, he probably already killedher. I'm not taking him back, I just...I just want to know why it is that men always...Leave.
Riley I can't believe it. I choked.
Willow You really, really did.
Riley You don't understand. I'm good at things. That's what I do. Work hard, applymyself, get it done.
Willow Well, you failed extremely well.
Riley That's a great comfort to me.
Willow You need to relax. I mean, you're not proposing. You're just making contact,getting a reaction. Any reaction is ok, except projectile vomiting.
Riley Are you ok?
Willow This song...
Riley Oh, yeah, it's a tape of some bands from last year's party. Associations?
Willow Big.
Riley Bad? A.J.!
Willow Thank you. Now go find Buffy.
Riley There's no hurry. I mean, if you want to talk.
Willow No, I... I want you to find Buffy and tell her that I went home and not toworry about me. Which at least will give you something to say.
Riley Thanks.
Willow You'll do fine.
Buffy Hey.
Riley Um, Willow said to say that she took off. Oh, no, she'sok. Kind of blue, but she said not to worry.
Buffy Thank you.
Riley You know... I wanted to ask you something.
Buffy Ask away.
Xander Buffy! I've been looking all over for you. We need... Need to talk, uh, nothere. It's sort of... Unfinished business.
Buffy Business? Right. Uh, excuse us?
Riley No problem.
Forrest Denied.
Riley It's not like she blew me off. She just left with another guy, that's all.
Forrest We need you downstairs, anyway. You know, I hate tosay it, but they're probably on their way to make crazy naked sex.
Riley Is that necessary?
Forrest I'm protecting you, buddy. I don't want to see you mooning over some freshmanfor the next 3 months.
Computer Retinal scan accepted.
Riley I like her.
Graham I'm on your side, here.
Riley I know you are, Graham. That's what gives me the strength to put up with thiscomedian.
Forrest Dude, straight tip: I know girls.
Riley Exactly! Girls, plural. I'm talkin' about one girl. One girl.
Computer Initiative vocal code match complete. Special agent Finn, Riley. Identitynumber 75329.
Riley The problem is, what kind of girl is gonna go out with a guy who's acting alljoe regular by day and then turns all demon-hunter by night?
Graham Maybe a peculiar one.
Riley Thank you, Graham. You see, forrest? You don't have to be so negative all thetime. Hold up. Situation?
Walsh Gentlemen, suit up. We have a code red. Hostile 17 has escaped.
Walsh Here's what we know, and it isn't much: Hostile 17 broke restraints at exactly2:47 P.M.
Forrest That's a big head start.
Walsh Gets bigger every time you interrupt me. It was bagged and tagged locally, soassume it knows the area. The creature has every advantage right now. Fail to recaptureit, and everything we've worked for The initiative itself could end tonight.
Riely Nobody's failin' on my watch.
Walsh Glad to hear it. Gentlemen, agent Finn is now in charge of this operation. I'mcounting on you, Riley.
Riley We start with the basic mobilization pattern. 3 Teams. Sweep and search, justlike practice. Thorough but fast. C-team: Take the campus perimeter. Make sure it can'tleave. Stake it if you gotta, but only as a last resort. B-team: You're going down.Tunnels, sewers, cemeteries. Gates and miller are with me. We take the heart of campus andwork our way out. All units, maintain radio contact early and often. Who's got questions?Move!
Buffy What is wrong with him? Doesn't spike get that this is my town?
Giles He's resilient.
Buffy And it's my night off.
Xander I'm sure he'd pick another night if he knew you were busy with teutonic boytoy.
Buffy What is that supposed to mean?
Xander Nothing.
Buffy Riley's a doof. He's not teutonic.
Giles We have to assume that Spike's main target is you, Buffy.
Buffy Fine. You know what? He's worn out his welcome. Tonight, I kill him.
Giles You have a plan?
Buffy I am the plan. If spike wants me, I go alone... No arguments.
Xander Oh, wait, wait! Take this.
Buffy A flare gun? Xander, if I find spike, I'm staking him, not signalling ships atsea.
Xander You get into trouble...
Buffy Ok. I'll flare.
Xander And we'll come a-runnin'. Do you think Spike'll find her?
Giles I'm sure of it.
Spike Hello, gorgeous.
Riley What've we got?
Graham Civilian, sir.
Riley Ah, damn.
Forrest She's compromising the area. At least she's not making crazy, naked sex.
Riely Told you. We gotta clear her outta there... Fast.
Forrest Maybe not. Just thinking. If you were hostile 17, living off the crap we feed'em, what would you rather eat than that?
Riley You wanna use the girl I got a crush on as bait?
Forrest I can tag a hostile at 50 yards.
Riley Denied.
Forrest She'd be safe the entire
Riley I said denied, agent.
Forrest Did you just pull rank on me?
Riley Do you have a problem with that?
Forrest No, sir. So, how're we gonna get her out of there?
Buffy Riley! What are you doing here?
Riley Well, I didn't get a chance to say goodbye to you after the party. You left sofast. You know, with your friend... Who's a boy.
Buffy Uh, xander? He's not anyone that I... Want to talk about, right now. Um... Youknow, I don't want you taking this the wrong way... It's just, um... I need a little alonetime now... Alone.
Riley Why?
Buffy I need space.
Riley We're outdoors.
Buffy Emotionally.Imean, emotionally...
Riley You know, there's plenty of space back in your room why don't I take you? Youwouldn't believe the weirdos out at this hour.
Buffy Whoa! Ok... It's a free campus. Who died and made you John Wayne?
Riley I'm just trying to help.
Buffy You think I need help? Believe me, I don't. You know, if you were a realgentleman, then you would just leave. You would go far, far away, now! Shoo!
Riley Are you drunk?
Buffy Yes! Go and report me.
Riley I'm taking you home. Come on.
Buffy Oh, did you ever think maybe I'm gonna take you home, huh? What? You think thatboys can take care of themselves and girls need help?
Riley Yeah.
Buffy That is so teutonic.
Riley Look, Buffy, as long as you're out here, I'm staying.
Buffy Well, as long as you're out here, I'm staying.
Riley Gotta go.
Buffy See ya!
Riley Tell me we're tracking.
Graham Honing a signal. Got it... Heading west. Better be the hostile.
Forrest All units converge, all units converge. Hard target sighted. Heading 1-2 alphaniner. Let's bag it before this gets ugly.
Willow Come in. Spike!Wh-what do you want? Uh, a spell? I can do that.
Spike I'll give you a choice. Now I'm gonna kill you. Nochoice in that. But... I can let you stay dead... Or... Bring you back, to be like me.
Willow II'll scream.
Spike Bonus.
Willow No!
Spike I don't understand. This sort of thing's never happened to me before.
Willow Maybe you were nervous.
Spike I felt all right when I started. Let's try again. Ow! Oh! Ow! Damn it!
Willow Maybe you're trying too hard. Doesn't this happen to every vampire?
Spike Not to me, it doesn't!
Willow It's me, isn't it?
Spike What are you talking about?
Willow Well, you came looking for Buffy, then settled. II... You didn't want tobite me. I just happened to be around.
Spike Piffle!
Willow I know I'm not the kind of girl vamps like to sink their teeth into. It'salways like, ooh, you're like a sister to me, or, oh, you're such a goodfriend.
Spike Don't be ridiculous. I'd bite you in a heartbeat.
Willow Really?
Spike Thought about it.
Willow When?
Spike Remember last year, you had on that... Fuzzy pink number with the lilacunderneath?
Willow I never would have guessed. You played the blood-lust kinda cool.
Spike Mmm. I hate being obvious. All fang-y and rrrr! Takes the mysteryout.
Willow But if you could...
Spike If I could, yeah.
Willow You know, this doesn't make you any less terrifying.
Spike Don't patronize me.
Graham I'm getting a picture... Signature's locked.
Riely What've we got?
Graham Humans of the freshman variety. 98.6, 98.6... Bingo! Got a cold one.
Riley We're going in. I need a lockdown on grid 6.
Spike I'm only 126.
Willow You're being too hard on yourself. Why don't we wait a half an hour and tryagain? Or...
Riley No, hold your fire!
Graham It's on me!
Spike Aah!
Commando Move!
Commando Bag it, tag it. We're gone. Sir... Civilian. Could have turned.
Riely Leave her.
Commando We can't neglect quarantine, sir!
Commando Stop her!
Commando She's contained.
Buffy Contain this!
All Aah! Ow! I'm blind! What the hell was that?
Riley Abort!
Walsh I'm sure you'll understand if I seem far from happy.
Riley Yes, ma'am. If you read my report you'll see
Walsh Hostile 17's found an accomplice who's smart, aggressive, and somehow escapesdescription.
Forrest Whoever he was, the guy was big.
Graham Strong, too.
Riley Whoever... Or whatever.
Walsh I'm not interested in guess work, gentlemen. Call me old-fashioned. I likeresults. This report reads like a child's riddle book. Agent Finn, tell me something good.My implant?
Riley The implant works. Hostile 17 can't harm any living creature, In any way,without intense neurological pain. We'll bag it.
Walsh Yes, you will. Dismissed.
Riley Hey.
Buffy Hi.
Riley Listen, sorry about last night.
Buffy No, no... I was rude. I just felt like being alone. Sometimes it's nice to beout by yourself at night.
Riely I hear that. Gotta be careful, though. Lotta strange... People out there.
Buffy Oh, yeah.
Riley How's willow doing?
Buffy Ok. 'Course, that stupid fraternity prank on our dorm didn't help any.
Riley That's right. I forgot you guys live in stevenson.
Buffy You knew that?
Riley Well, Willow and I were... I thought she might be able to help me on a project.
Buffy Really? That work out for you?
Riley Don't know yet.
Buffy Uh, last night... At the party, You wanted to tell me something?
Riley Oh, yeah. Very important stuff. I don't remember any of it now. But you wouldhave been fascinated, possibly even moved. Did Willow tell you I like cheese?
Buffy You're a little peculiar.
Riley I can live with that.
