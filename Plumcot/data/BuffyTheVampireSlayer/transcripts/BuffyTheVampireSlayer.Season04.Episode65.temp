Girl Hey, thanks Riley.
Riley Looks good. Oh, hey Buffy.
Buffy Is there something you want to tell me?
Riley What?
Riley Oh, yes — I am a lesbian.
Buffy Well, it's good that you're so open about it.
Riley Oh, hey, you know how we were talking about having a picnic? I was thinkin' — do you ever hang out at Rhode's field? It's beautiful there. Usually not that crowded, either. I thought maybe we could have a little spread — sandwiches, maybe some ants? It'll be fun.
Buffy We were talking about having a picnic?
Riley So, was that a conversation I actually had, or one I was just practicing?
Buffy Practicing?
Riley Okay, yes — I have been known to do a little prep work before our conversations. It's not easy, you know, talking to you sometimes. It's like an oral exam.
Buffy Boy.. that's just what every girl longs to hear.
Riley Well, you're tricky!
Buffy Like an exam?
Riley I never know how you're going to react to something. That's why I like you so much. You're a mystery. Probably every beautiful girl in the world has some jerk telling her she's a mystery, but.. I swear. You really are. There's a lot about you that needs puzzling out.
Riley I loose you somewhere?
Buffy Right around.. beautiful.
Riley Hey — don't you just love a picnic?
Buffy It's just, different, you know? A picnic. First of all, daylight — kind of a new venue, Buffywise. And the best part — he said he would bring all the food, so all I have to do was to show up and eat. Those are two things I'm really good at.
Willow So he's nice?
Buffy Very, very.
Willow And there's sparkage?
Buffy Yeah. He's— have you seen his arms? Those are good arms to have. I really like him. I do.
Willow But..?
Buffy I don't know. I really like being around him, you know? And I think he cares about me.. but.. I just.. feel like something's missing.
Willow He's not making you miserable?
Buffy Exactly. Riley seems so solid. Like he wouldn't cause me heartache.
Willow Get out. Get out while there's still time.
Buffy I know.. I have to get away from that bad boy thing. There's no good there. Seeing Angel in LA.. even for five minutes.. hello to the pain.
Willow The pain is not a friend.
Buffy But I can't help thinking — isn't that where the fire comes from? Can a nice, safe relationship be that intense? I know it's nuts, but.. part of me believes that real love and passion have to go hand in hand with pain and fighting.
Buffy I wonder where I get that from.
Buffy So..you saw their faces but you can't describe them.
Spike Well, they were human. Two eyes each, kind of in the middle.
Buffy Uh huh. And the lab?
Spike Underground. I came out through an air vent. I don't know exactly where. I'm done. Put the telly on.
Spike It's about time. Hope you got it warm enough.
Spike I don't know why you're so dainty all of a sudden. You've done this for Angel — you must have.
Spike Hey! Give it!
Buffy Okay, that's it. The invalid amnesiac routine is over. The kitchen is closed until you can tell me something useful about the commandos.
Spike I'm tryin' to remember. It was very traumatic.
Buffy How long are you going to pull this crap?
Spike How long am I going to live once I tell you?
Giles Look, look, Spike — we have no intention of killing a harmless.. uh, creature.. but we have to know what's been done to you. We can't let you go until we're sure that you're .. impotent —
Spike Hey!
Giles Sorry, poor choice of words. Until we're sure you're, you're..
Buffy Flaccid?
Spike You are one step away, missy.
Buffy Giles, help! He's going to scold me.
Buffy You know what? I don't think you want us to let you go. Maybe we made it a little too comfy in here for ya.
Spike Comfy? I'm chained in a bathtub drinkin' pig's blood from a novelty mug. Doesn't rank huge in the Zagut's Guide.
Buffy You want something nicer? A look at my.. poor neck? All bare and tender and exposed.. all that blood just .. pumping away..
Giles Oh, please.
Spike Giles, make her stop.
Giles If those two don't kill eachother, I might lend a hand.
Willow What about a truth spell? I'm not positive it would work on a vampire, but we could try. Make him fess up?
Giles A truth spell, of course. Why didn't I think of that?
Willow ‘Cause you had your hands full with the undead English Patient?
Giles Yes.. We'll have a go.
Willow Looks pretty simple. I'll stop by the magick shop tomorrow.
Giles Excellent.
Willow Alright. I'll be back in the morning with donuts and motherwort. Bye, Buffy! I'll see you at home.
Buffy Bye!
Giles Great. Thank you, Willow.
Giles Um, Willow may have had a very helpful idea. She seems to be coping better with Oz's departure, don't you think?
Buffy She still has a way to go, but yeah — I think she's dealing.
Spike What, are you people blind? She's hangin' on by a thread. Any ninny can see that.
Willow Devon said that he sent for his stuff. I guess that means he's planning on settling down somewhere.. else. Not here.
Buffy I guess so..
Willow I feel like I've been split down the center and half of me is lost.
Buffy I know. It feels like that now..
Willow Oz is gone.
Spike Come on, now! It's telly time!
Machine This is Buffy and Willow. We're not in right now, so please leave a message.
Giles Oh, uh, Willow.. It's Giles. Um.. I thought you were bringing the ingredients for that spell? I really have to—
Spike Passions is on! Timmy's down the bloody well, and if you make me miss it, I'll—
Giles You'll do what? Lick me to death?
Giles Look, uh.. Willow.. I think we ought to try the spell. Among other things, I'd like to shower sometime today. Alone.
Buffy Driving.
Riley Yeah.
Buffy You seriously drive for fun.
Riley Well, not four-wheeling or anything, but yeah. Don't you?
Buffy Actually, no-wheeling is more my specialty. I'm an avid pedestrian.
Riley You're kidding, right? I mean, you know how to drive..
Buffy Well, I took the class.. Cars and Buffy are, like .. un-mixy things.
Riley It's just because you haven't had a good experience yet. You can have the best time in a car. It's not about getting somewhere. You have to take your time. Forget about everything. Just.. relax. Let it wash over you. The air.. motion.. Just, let it roll.
Buffy We are talking about driving, right?
Riley Thought I was.
Riley I'm taking you. Some night when it's warm. Up past the vineyards — it's going to change everything for you.
Buffy I'm in.
Riley Hey, Willow.
Buffy Hey.
Willow I interrupted. You've got apples. My mist.
Riley Wait. Sit. There's plenty to go around.
Buffy Did something happen? Is something wrong?
Willow No.. Everything's fine. Same.
Buffy Oh.
Willow Your apples are turning brown, the way they do.
Riley Yeah, I guess they do that.
Buffy Yeah.
Willow Yeah.
Xander Geez, you mean Oz just sent for his stuff and didn't even call her? That's pretty harsh.
Anya I only wish I had my powers back. I'd liquify his entrails for her.
Xander That's sweet. God, poor Will. No wonder she's—
Xander —having a wonderful time.
Buffy Wow. Way to re-bound.
Xander I believe that's the dance of a brave little toaster.
Willow Hey, guys! C'mon! This music's great!
Xander It's nice to see you brought your boogie shoes tonight, Will.
Willow Yeah.. I-I know I've been sort of a party-poop lately, so I said to myself, Self! I said, It's time to shake and shimmy it off.
Buffy Sounds like a good policy.
Willow Yeah! And it works, too. You know, I figure, in the grand scheme of things, we're all just—
Buffy Drunk..?
Willow Drunk.. I mean, that's such a-a strong word. Kind of a guttural Anglo-Saxon word. Drunk.
Xander Will, not loving the drowning of the sorrows.
Willow Not drowning — wading. A-a-and.. See? Light. No big.
Buffy No big? Anyone remember when Buffy had the fun beer-fest and went one-million years B.C.?
Xander Sadly without the fuzzy bikini..
Anya Off topic, Xander.
Xander Right. Topic now. Will, how about you give me that beer?
Willow No! Why should I? I've got pain, here — big-time legitimate pain.
Xander We all have pain, Will.
Willow Oh, like what? Oh, poor me.. I live in a basement. Yeah, that's dire.
Buffy Okay, you know what? That's it — I'm taking you home.
Willow No, I don't want to.
Buffy Well, you'll thank me when you still have a friend in the morning.
Willow I just can't stand feeling this way. I want it to be over.
Buffy It will. I promise. But it's gonna take time.
Willow Well, that's not good enough.
Buffy I know. It's just how it is. You have to go through the pain.
Willow Well, isn't there someway I can just make it go away? Just ‘cause I say so? Can't I just make it go ‘poof'?
Willow Harken all ye elements, I summon thee now. Control the outside, control within. Land and sea, fire and wind. Out of my passions, a web be spun. From this eve forth, my will be done. So mote it be.
Willow It is my will that my heart be healed. Now. I will that this book speak it's words to me. I will that this Q-Tip gets.. unbendy..?
Willow Come in.
Willow Giles, what are you doing here?
Giles I'm.. a bit concerned about you, actually.
Willow Did Buffy tell you about the beer, 'cause..
Giles Uh, Buffy didn't tell me anything..
Willow Oh, well.. forget the beer part, then.
Giles Happily. I came because we had an appointment the other day..
Willow Oh.. Right, right.. The truth spell.
Giles Yes, um.. Willow.. I know that you're going through a very difficult time.. But, sherking your responsibilities—
Willow But.. I didn't — sherk. I.. Did the research, and I picked up the motherwort, I just forgot the doing the spell part.
Giles Well, that isn't like you at all.
Willow I know. I-I've been off. I-I even tried to do a spell last night. To have my will done? I was hoping it would make me feel better. But it just went ka-blooey.
Giles A spell? I don't think it's wise for you to be doing that alone right now. Your energy's too unfocused.
Willow Well, that's not true. I said I was off, not incompetent.
Giles I only meant that you're grieving, and it might be wise if you took a break from doing spells without supervision.
Willow So I get punished ‘cause I'm in pain?
Giles It's not punishment. I'm only saying this because I—
Willow Oh, you care. Yeah. Everybody cares. Nobody wants to be inconvenienced. You all want me to take the time and go through the pain, as long as you don't have to hear about it anymore.
Giles No, that's not fair.
Willow Isn't it? ‘Cause I'm doing the best I can and it doesn't seem to be enough for you guys.
Giles And I see how you could feel that way, I do—
Willow No, you don't. You say that you do, but you don't see anything.
Giles Um.. Oh, sorry.. Um, sorry. P-perhaps I'd better be going. Let's um, let's talk about this later.
Giles Oh! I'm sorry.. So sorry.
Giles Elobe, enemy, be now, quiet.
Spike You know.. not too keen about this spell stuff. Tends to be a bit unpredictable.
Giles Yes, well, you might have thought about that sooner. Um.. Let your decietful tongue be.. Be.. Uh.. Let no.. Untruths.. Be spoken..
Spike Hey, what's that all about?
Giles Hm? Oh, nothing. I just got ash in my eye.
Spike Well, I won't have you doin' mojo on me if you can't read properly. You might turn me into a stink beetle or what all.
Giles T'would be a generous ending for you, Spike.
Willow I mean, I'm going through something. I just don't see why he was getting down on me.
Buffy Giles just worries. Spells can be dangerous. It doesn't mean he thinks you're a bad witch.
Willow I am a bad witch.
Buffy No, you're a good witch.
Willow I'm not kidding anyone. If I had any real power, I could have made Oz stay with me.
Buffy Will, you wouldn't have wanted him to have stayed—
Willow And I didn't have the guts to do the spell on Veruca, and my I Will it So spell went nowhere. The only real witch here is fuzzy little Amy.
Buffy I think you're being a too hard on yourself.
Willow She's got access to powers I can't even invoke. I mean, first — she's a perfectly normal girl..
Willow Then poof — she's a rat.
Willow I could never do something like that.
Buffy Hello? Uhh.. I'll be right there. Spike escaped.
Willow A-and you're going? Now?
Buffy Sorry — duty thing.
Willow Well, I mean, what's the rush? Spike can't hurt anyone, right? And I figured since I'm kinda grievey, would could, uh..you know, have a girl's night. We could eat sundaes and watch Steel Magnolias and you can tell me how, at least I don't have diabetes.
Buffy Will, I can't hang out with you until I get Spike back to Giles, you know that. Okay, I'll be back as soon as I can. I promise.
Willow I don't see the big. He's probably just standing out there. You could find him in two seconds..
Buffy Thought that was gonna take longer.
Spike Me too. Musta got.. turned around..
Spike Hang.. hang on, this— this is it. Wait.. no.. yes.
Buffy What are you talking about?
Spike The lab. Commando lab. The door was right here where I escaped.
Buffy I don't think so.
Spike Open up! I'm gonna kill you!
Buffy Spike, there's nothing there.
Spike Let me in! Fix me..
Buffy Okay, drop the act..
Spike Get off!
Buffy Okay, that's it— I'm gonna gag you.
Spike Hey! Watch it!
Buffy One more word out of you, and I swear..
Spike Swear, what? You're not gonna do anything to me. You don't got the stones.
Buffy Oh, I got the stones. I got a whole bunch of .. stones.
Spike Yeah? You're all talk.
Buffy GILES! I accidentally killed Spike. That's okay, right?
Giles Uh..uh..um.. Just a minute..
Willow I mean, I'm going through something. You'd think every once in awhile Buffy would make best friends a priority.
Xander You know, Will, it's not like she could just let Spike go.
Spike I get this spell reversed, they'll be finding your body for weeks.
Buffy Oh, make a move — please. I'm dying for a good slay.
Willow Spike's more important than me. I get it.
Xander Buffy's gotta find out what's up with those commandos. Right now she needs Spike.
Willow Well, fine. Why doesn't so just go marry him?
Giles If the two of you could remain civil long enough to—
Buffy It's just so sudden. I don't know what to say.
Spike Just say yes, and make me the happiest man on earth.
Buffy Oh, Spike! Of course it's yes!
Buffy Giles! You'll never believe what's happened!
Willow It's just not fair.
Xander Willow, I know it's hard to see it right now, but everything you're feeling is because of you and Oz. Not because of Buffy and me or anybody. But eventually you'll meet somebody else, and it'll be better.
Willow Yeah, ‘cause most relationships are great and trouble-free. I don't think so. I think we're all doomed to badness.
Xander We're not doomed.
Willow Oh, yeah? Let's-let's look at your bio. Insect Lady, Mummy Girl, Anya.. You're a demon magnet.
Xander I was just trying to help.
Giles Willow, it's-it's me. Something's happened. I need your help. I can't see very well. Everything's blurred. I'm certain it's a spell of some kind, because.. well..it seems something else is going wrong..
Buffy Here you go .. 98.6.
Giles .. horribly wrong.
Buffy There's so much to decide. Ceremony, guests, reception..
Spike Well, first thing I'd say, we're not having a church wedding.
Buffy How 'bout a daytime ceremony. In the park.
Spike Fabulous. Enjoy your honeymoon with the big pile of dust.
Buffy Under the trees. Indirect sunlight, only.
Spike Warm breeze tosses the leaves aside, and again — you're registering as Mr and Mrs Big-Pile-of-Dust.
Buffy Stop it! This is our wedding and you're treating it like a big joke!
Spike Oh, pouty! Look at that lip.. gonna get it.. gonna get it..
Buffy Oh.. stop..
Giles Yes, please stop.
Buffy Giles, did you see my ring?
Giles Thankfully, not very well.
Buffy I'm not crazy, and I know that you probably don't approve, and my father's not that far away, I mean, he could— but this day is about family — my real family — and I would like you to be the one to give me away.
Giles Oh, Buffy! That's.. that's so.. Oh! For God's sake! This is nonsense. Something is making you act this way. Don't you realize what you're doing?
Buffy Living a dream.
Giles He's gonna have to take a bit of time to get used to it, pet.
Buffy they all will. But you guys wern't crazy about Angel at first, either.
Spike You wern't gonna say that name.
Buffy Sorry. Why don't we talk about where we're going to register.
Spike Well, where would Angel like to register? And can we have the photographer Angel would've wanted? And, flowers Angel would have liked?
Buffy Hey! You think I don't live with the shadow of Drusilla over my head? That I'm not wondering if you're going to be thinking of her on our honeymoon when you're making.. sweet love to me..?
Buffy Giles are you okay?
Giles I rather think not. I seem to be rather.. rather.. blind. Completely, in fact.
Buffy What? How could this happen?
Giles A spell, I believe.
Buffy Well, we'll fix it. Don't worry.
Spike What you want is a general reversal spell. Gonna need supplies.
Giles Are you.. helping me?
Spike Well, it's almost like you're my father-in-law, in'nt?
Buffy See? This is how it's gonna be. Spike'll even take care of you while I'm at the magick shop.
Buffy From now on, we're a family.
Giles That's alright. I have more scotch.
Riley Hey, Buffy. What's up?
Buffy Riley, look — aren't they beautiful?
Riley Um, yeah.. they're nice. A little dressy, maybe.. for school, but..
Buffy Riley..
Riley Buffy?
Buffy I really like you. I hope you know that you mean a lot to me, and if things were different—
Riley Different than what?
Buffy I want you to promise me that we can always be friends, and I'd really like you to be there on The Day.
Riley The day when..
Buffy The wedding!
Riley The wedding. What wedding?
Buffy My wedding! I'm getting married — can you believe it?
Riley I don't think no is a strong enough word.
Buffy I know! It's crazy! I mean, we fought for all these years, and then.. Sometimes you just look at someone, and you know.. You know?
Riley No..
Buffy I think maybe we fought because we couldn't admit how we really felt about eachother.
Riley Can we start again?
Buffy You'll really like him. Well, nobody really likes him..
Riley I just need to clear a few things up..
Buffy I don't even really like him..
Riley Buffy..
Buffy But.. I love him. I do.
Riley Who?
Buffy What?
Riley What's his name?
Buffy Who?
Riley The groom.
Buffy Spike!
Riley That's a name?
Buffy Don't be mad.
Riley I'm not mad!
Buffy No, you are mad!
Riley No, I am! Er.. I really.. Wow. Who is this guy? Does he go here?
Buffy Spike? Oh, no.. He's totally old.
Riley Old.
Buffy Well, not as old as my last boyfriend was.
Riley Okay.. It's late.. and I'm, I'm very tired now. So, I'm just gonna go far away and be.. away.
Buff But—
Riley No, stay.
Buffy You're ruining my happy day.
Xander That's okay, mom — we don't need anymore snacks.
Anya I liked those fruit roll-ups.
Xander Shush, I thought she'd never clear out. Besides, just think of my lips as, the fruit roll-ups of love. Okay, that was gross. I'm a little distracted. Willow was really upset. I shouldn't have let her go away mad.
Xander Regaining focus.
Anya We just got rid of your mom. Let's not bring Willow into this. It's time for just the two of us.
Anya No, no, it's a Pargo demon! Drowning it's the only way to kill it!
Xander What the hell is going on?!
Buffy Duh dum, da-da.. Duh dum, da-da, duh dum da da dum da da dum da da..
Giles So the plan is to cure my total, incapacitating blindness .. tomorrow.
Buffy They were all out of Tagas Root at the magick shop. They'll have more tomorrow. I'm completely on top of it.
Buffy Aren't they a perfect little us?
Spike I don't like him. He's insipid. Clearly human.
Buffy Oo, red paint. We could smear a little on his mouth — blood of the innocent..
Spike That's my girl..
Giles Stop that right now! I can hear the smacking.
Buffy Honey, we need to talk about the invitations. Now, do you wanna be William the Bloody, or just Spike? ‘Cause, either way, it's gonna look majorly weird.
Spike Where as the name Buffy gives it that touch of classic elegance.
Buffy What's wrong with Buffy?
Giles Huh.. such a good question.
Spike Well, it's a terrible name.
Buffy My mother gave me that name.
Spike Your mother, yeah, she's a genius.
Buffy Don't you start in on my mother.
Xander Board up the windows, and barricade the doors.
Giles What's going on?
Anya Demons. They keep coming and coming.
Xander I think we lost them, but I couldn't see. Spike! He's all untied! Which you probably noticed..
Buffy Xander, calm down, okay? If you lost them, that'll give us some time to figure this out. Maybe the demons have something to do with Giles being blind.
Anya Giles is blind?
Giles Please stop whatever you're doing. You smell like fruit roll-ups.
Spike This is the crack team that foils my every plan? I am deeply shamed.
Buffy Spike's right. We really should get organized.
Anya Why are you holding hands?
Spike They have to hear it sooner or later..
Buffy Spike and I are getting married!
Xander How? What? How?
Giles Three excellent questions.
Spike What are you lookin' at?
Buffy The man I love.
Xander Can I be blind, too?
Xander Wait.. married.. I know something.. what is it..? Everything's so familiar.. Work, brain — work! Oh! Oh oh! Willow!
Buffy Mm..what about Will.. Mmm, honey, get off.
Xander Something about Willow and her griefy-poor-me mood swings — so, so tired of it.
Anya You mean I don't have to be nice about her anymore?
Buffy Well, we're all tired of it, but what does it have to do with what's going on?
Xander She told me I was a demon magnet, a-and you two should get married.
Giles And.. that I didn't see anything.
Buffy She did a spell.
Giles Yes.. to have her will done. Whatever she says is coming true.
Buffy And you both were effected. I probably only escaped because I'm the Slayer. Some kind of natural immunity.
Xander Yeah. Right. You're marrying Spike because you're so right for eachother.
Buffy Xander.
Spike That's it — you're off the usher list.
Giles People, Willow is out there and she probably doesn't know what she's doing.
Xander We gotta find her.
Buffy Before somebody gets really hurt.
Xander Why does he have to come?
Buffy Xander, Spike is going to be my husband. I want him included.
Spike I agree with Xander here. Seems like a lot of work for people who hunt us.
Buffy Spike, these are my friends. Besides, it's kinda my job.
Spike For now.
Buffy What? You want me to stop working?
Spike Let's see — do I want you to give up killing all my friends? Yeah, I've given it some thought.
Buffy This is burned.
Anya Ta'hoffren. Bastard, he's opened a portal here.
Buffy Who?
Spike Oh, fluffy.
Spike Wear this to the rehearsal dinner and the whole thing's off.
Buffy Shut-up, honey.
Anya Ta'hoffren. He made me a demon 1120 years ago.
Buffy Why would he attack Willow?
Anya I don't believe he did.
Ta'hoffren You have much anger and pain. Your magic is strong, but your pain — it's like a scream that pierces dimensional walls. We heard your call.
Willow I-I'm sorry. I'll try for a quiet rage. Bye.
Ta'hoffren Our intention is not to quash your potential — quite the contrary.
Anya I'd been dumped, I was miserable, doing a few vengeance spells — boils on the penis, nothing fancy.
Xander Please skip ahead.
Anya Ta'hoffren got wind of me, he offered to elevate me.
Buffy Meaning?
Anya He made me a demon.
Buffy Oh God, Willow. But, you can summon this guy from this crypt, right? You can make him stop .. oh my God! Wouldn't this be a perfect place for pictures?
Spike I'm not posing for chattal.
Xander Hey.. demon.
Buffy Okay, listen — now we're gonna do this without ruining the foliage.
Buffy Let's go!
Anya Blesséd be, the name of Ta'hoffren. Let this space be now a gateway to the world of Arash Ma'har, where demons are spawned.
Ta'hoffren The pain and suffering you brought upon those you love is inspiring. You are ready to join us here in Arash Ma'har.
Willow Pain.. What pain?
Spike Buffy!
Xander Not doin' well here.
Anya We come in supplication. We bend as the reed.. in the flow of the, uh.. No, wait.. we-we come in the flow of the, uh.. Ugh! Blesséd be, the name of Ta'hoffren..
Spike They're strong, and I can't fight. If they get in, I don't know if I can protect you.
Buffy You think you have to protect me?
Spike Oh, not with the Girl-Power bit!
Willow Oh, God. But I didn't mean to!
Ta'hoffren But you did. This is the result of your power. You will make a fine vengeance demon.
Willow No, please! You have to help them!
Ta'hoffren It is not my concern. You are my interest in this matter.
Willow Really.. no offense intended.. I mean, you've been super-nice and everything, but.. I don't want to be a demon. I just wanna go back and help my friends.
Ta'hoffren That is your answer?
Willow It-it is.
Buffy Oh, Spike.. are you okay?
Spike Slayer..
Willow Let the healing power begin. Let my will be safe again. As these words of peace are spoken, let this harmful spell be broken.
Buffy Oh, ugh..
Spike Oh, bloody hell!
Buffy Spike lips! Lips of Spike!
Willow Hi, guys.
Anya How long are you going to keep making these?
Willow Oh, until I don't feel so horribly guilty. I figure about a million chips from now. Also, I have to detail Giles' car.
Xander Time.
Giles A-ha.. Five past two. Thursday.
Willow Look, cookies. A very not-evil thing I did. Oatmeal?
Giles Yes, very funny, they're chocolate chip. I can see them. I still need my glasses, though. You could be more specific and give me 20/20.
Willow Eat a cookie; ease my pain?
Buffy Mm. Better?
Willow Well, baking lifts about 30% of my guilt, but only 7% of my inner turmoil. Guess that'll just take awhile.
Buffy It'll happen.
Spike Don't I get a cookie?
Buffy No.
Spike Well, I gotta have something. I still have Buffy taste in my mouth.
Buffy You're a pig, Spike.
Spike Yeah.. well I'm not the one who wanted, Wind Beneath My Wings for the first dance.
Buffy That was the spell.
Willow Did I mention about the sorry part?
Buffy We may be into a forgetting spell later. I loved him. He were betrothed.
Willow Well, at-at least you were getting along.
Buffy But we wern't. I mean, I wasn't even nice. And the bad-boy thing — over it. Okay, I totally get it. I'd be really happy to be in a nice relationship with a decent, reliable.. Oh my God! Riley thinks I'm engaged.
Willow What?
Buffy Riley. He-he-he saw me. What the hell am I going to say?!
Buffy You thought I was serious?
Riley Well, no.. um.. you wern't serious?
Buffy Oh, God.. please. I marry a guy named Spike?
Riley Maybe. We haven't known eachother that long.
Buffy No, it's just.. I saw that fear in your eyes when you caught me looking at wedding dresses, and I had to give you a hard time.
Riley I did not have fear in my eyes.
Buffy Yes you did. You were looking at me like I was a cartoon ball and chain.
Riley So you decided to tell me you're getting married.
Buffy Uh-huh.
Riley So, you're insane.
Buffy Uh-huh!
Riley But you're still single.
Buffy Yes.
Riley Okay, then. Just another little piece of the Buffy puzzle.
Buffy You really have a lot to learn about women, Riley.
Riley You're gonna teach me.
