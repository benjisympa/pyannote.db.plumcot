Riley We're not expecting anyone, are we?
Buffy Willow said she was going to be at the science library allnight.
Riley Is that right?
Buffy Uh, apparently not.
Willow We got trouble.
Buffy What is it?
Willow I was in the rec room. It came through the window.
Riley Vampire?
Willow Vampires don't breathe fire.
Riley I should call for backup.
Buffy No time.
Buffy We have to make this fast. I have better things to do tonight than kill.
Everybody SURPRISE!!!
Willow Guess you won't be killing anything tonight,after all.
Buffy Don't be so sure.
Giles Yeah, this is a lively space. It's like the activity room we had at public school.
Giles Sorry I,uh, one time I, uh, I was up to a little bit of a prank with the dart board
Anya I'm bored. Let's eat.
Xander Anya, we've talked about this.
Anya I'm sorry, that was rude. Please continue your story.
Giles Go and eat.
Willow Giles! Hi. Are you having a goodtime?
Giles Yes. Yes. There's, uh, a lot of new faces here, aren't there?
Willow Yeah. Mostly kidsfrom the dorm. A couple of Riley's friends.
Buffy Hi, Giles.
Giles Buffy. HappyBirthday.
Buffy Thank you.
Giles Nineteen. It's hard to believe, isn't it?
Buffy There's somebody here I want you to meet. Uh, this is Riley Finn . . .. my boyfriend.
Riley It's very nice tomeet you, Mr. Giles. Did you help planthis? It was quite a surprise.
Giles The first of many. Uh, been . . . dating long?
Buffy Giles was the librarian at my high school.
Riley Ah, I've seen the library. It's gone down hill since you left.
Giles Yes. I-I-I'm embarrassed to say that I actually miss it at times.
Riley So, you're retired?
Giles I'm sorry?
Riley Or . . . you're working somewhere else now?
Giles Well, not, uh . . . sort of betweenprojects, uh, right now, uh, it's apersonal
Buffy Oh! Oh, look. Gileshas no cake.
Riley Oh, here. Here, I'llget you a piece.
Buffy Oh, he's just nervous. But this is so nice. Having everyone together for my birthday. Ofcourse, you could smash in all my toes with a hammer and it will still be thebestest Buffy Birthday Bash in a big long while.
Giles Right. A-a-actually,Willow a-a-and Xander did all the planning. I'm not sure I would have gone withthe surprise party. You know,you have enough things jumping out at you in the dark.
Buffy Professor Walsh says that adrenaline is like exercise butwithout the exorbitant gym fees.
Giles Very whitty.
Buffy You should meet her. She's absolutely the smartest person I've ever met.
Giles Perhaps we should have invitedProfessor Walsh to the party?
Buffy Oh, no. I mean,she's like forty. She's got better things to do than hang out with a bunch ofkids.
Riley Here you go, sir.
Xander You own nothing. This shouldn't be taking solong.
Spike Hang on. Let a fella get organized.
Xander That's my radio!
Spike And you're what? Shocked and disappointed? I'm evil!
Anya So, what kind of place are you lookingfor?
Spike I don't know. Maybea crypt. Some place, you know, dark and dank. But not as dark and dank as this.
Anya Heh. It's prettydepressing, isn't it?
Spike I've known corpses with a fresher smell. In fact, I've beenone.
Xander That's it! Let'sgo.
Anya Wait. I want to give you something for your new place.
Xander That's my lamp.
Anya A gift is traditional. I've read about it.
Xander That's among friends. With bitter enemies we don't give them my lamp.
Spike It's not gonna have electricity anyway. It's a crypt, remember?
Anya What about running water? A fridge to keep your blood fresh?
Spike No.
Anya Well, that's gotta suck. You should just get a hotel room or something.
Spike Demon girl's got a point. I need fresh blood. If I had a few bob for a room with an honorbar
Xander Out! Before I getthe Slayer over here to kick your ass out!
Spike Don't know why she didn'tcome. Say good-bye, shed a few tears.
Xander Well, she has an appointment with somebody who's actuallystill *scary*!
Walsh So, the Slayer.
Buffy Yeah. That's me.
Walsh We thought you were a myth.
Buffy Well, you were myth-taken.
Walsh And to think all that time you were sitting in myclass. Well, most of those times. I always knew you could do better than a Bminus. Now I understand your energies were directed in the same places as ours,in fact. It's only our methods thatdiffer. We use the latest in scientifictechnology and state-of-the-art weaponry and you, if I understand correctly,poke them with a sharp stick.
Buffy Well, it's more effective than it sounds.
Walsh Oh, , I'm, heh, quite sure of that. As I'm just as sure thatwe can learn much from each other. I'mworking on getting you clearance to come into the Initiative. I think you'llfind the results of our operation most impressive. Agent Finn here, alone, haskilled or captured how many is it?
Riley Seventeen. Eleven vampires, six demons.
Buffy Oh . . . Wow. I mean, that's . .. seventeen.
Walsh What about you?
Buffy Me?
Walsh How many hostiles would you say you've slain?
Giles Third new moon after the . . . nine-hundredth feast ofDelthrox. Oh, crap.
Giles No, we can't wait for her, Willow. The demon Prince Barvainis going to rise tonight. Well Whereis she, exactly?
Riley Wow.
Buffy Those are my best stories. And I didn't tell you theBuffy breaks her butt stories.
Riley But you've killed a You did the thing with that Uh, youdrowned. And the snake! Not to mention the . . daily . . slayageof Wow.
Buffy It's no big, really. Hey, who wants ice cream!
Riley Buffy. When I sawyou stop the world from, you know, ending . . . I just assumed that was a bigweek for you. Turns out I suddenly find myself . . . needing to know the pluralof apocalypse.
Buffy Look. If you've beenfighting since you were fifteen you'd have a hefty resume' too.
Riley Fifteen!?
Buffy I know, wow. The point is, that, that we have different amounts of experience.You know. And plus, I do have thatwhole preternatural Slayer strength deal.
Riley I've seen. Don't get me wrong. The girls I grew up with could hold their own. But . . . I'm not even sure I could takeyou.
Buffy That all depends on your meaning.
Walsh Yeah?
Giles Professor Walsh, I presume. You're hard to find.Thesethese halls are quite the labyrinth. I felt like Theseus and the Minotaur in the . . . labyrinth.
Walsh Can I help you with something, Mr. . . . ?
Giles Giles. Rupert. I'm looking for Buffy Summers. I'm,uh, a friend of hers. And I was her high school librarian.
Walsh I'm sorry, Buffy's not here. But if I see her . . .
Giles Buffy's been very influenced by your cause. She quotes you quite often.Sometimes she sounds like an introductory textbook herself.
Walsh I don't lecture from the textbook. But I'm glad she's inspired bythe material. She's bright. All she'sreally been lacking is encouragement in the academic sect.
Giles Oh, uh, I think it's best if-if. . . if we let a youngperson find their own strengths. If you lead a child by the hand then they'llnever find their own footing.
Walsh And if it's true about hiking, ergo, it must be true aboutlife.
Giles That's not, uh . . . I'm just saying Buffy is, uh, well she's not the typicalstudent. Once you get to know her, she's a very unique girl. I hope you're not going to push her.
Walsh I think I do know her. And I have found her to be a unique woman.
Giles Woman. Of course. How wrong of me tochoose my own words.
Walsh She's very self-reliant, very independent
Giles Exactly!
Walsh which is not always a good thing. I think it can be unhealthy to take on adult roles too early. What Isuspect I'm seeing is a reaction to the absence of a male role model.
Giles Absence?
Walsh Buffy clearly lacks a strong father figure.
Walsh I'm sorry, I have things to do. I'll tell Buffy her *friend* was looking for her.
Willow This prince/demon guy was supposed to rise at sunset soaren't we, like, late?
Giles Of course if I hadn't had to search the globe for our MissSummers and do battle with that harridan. . . .
Xander And if you hadn't gotten lost on campus afterwards . . .
Giles Never mind. I'll just have to take care of it myself. I've vanquished a few demons in my daywithout her. Of course, it wouldn't surprise me if we're entirely toolate. Demon on the loose, carnageeverywhere.
Xander Your better demons will clean up after themselves.
Giles I don't understand. Umm, there should be ruptured earth and-and broken stone. Oh, well, apparently it hasn't happenedyet. A bit of luck.
Willow Or, you know what I bet? I-I bet the Initiative took careof it.
Giles Who?
Xander Oh, Riley and his guys. Probably all over it.
Willow Yeah. It has thattoo neat look. They musthave cleaned up the place.
Giles What?
Willow Oh, they read hot spots. Areas of otherworldy energy.They must've picked this place up days ago.
Giles Stop, both of you. Uh, what, uh . . . What are you talkingabout? W-what's the Initiative? What. . . what on earth does it have to dowith Buffy's new boyfriend?
Willow You know. I'm sureyou know. Riley's one of the commandos.
Giles What?! Well that's marvelous, isn't it? Here I am, spentweeks trying, uh, t-to get a single scrap of information about our mysteriousdemon collectors and no one bothers to tell me that Buffy's dating one ofthem?! Who else knows?!
Xander No one. No one elseknows this. Anya, and that's it!
Willow And Spike.
Giles Ssspike?! Spike knew?
Xander Only the basic stuff. You know, that Riley is a commando and Professor Walsh is in charge.
Giles Professor Walsh!? That fishwife!?
Willow You know, she's actually not that bad once you get toSo, th-the demon is probably a little late. W-we'll just,you know
Giles Oh, forget it. Go on. You two clear off. I'll juststay a little longer just in case.
Willow You sure? 'Cause we can stay.
Giles No. Go.
Giles Who am I kidding?
Giles Nothing is gonna happen.
Ethan I wouldn't say that. I wouldn't say that at all.In fact, Ripper, old mate, I'd say something rather interesting was about tohap
Giles Did someone?
Ethan Oh, bugger! I thought you'd gone!
Giles Ethan Rayne. Youhave no idea how much thrashing you is gonna improve my day.
Ethan No, no, no! Wait! Hang on! You-you can beat thecrap out of me. Go ahead, I can't stop you! Or-oryou can listen to what I have to say. Find out what's going on.
Giles What are you talking about?
Ethan Something bad is happening. Bad for both of us.
Giles Bad for you.
Ethan No, no, no! Listen! You have to listen! You're going to need time to prepare!
Ethan Brilliant! Now isn'tthis more fun than kicking my ass?
Giles No.
Ethan Oh. It's more funfor me.
Giles Just tell me what you want to tell me.
Ethan Oh, so crass. We used to be friends, Ripper. When did all that fall apart?
Giles The same time you started to worship chaos.
Ethan Oh, religious intolerance. Sad, there. I mean, just look atthe Irish troubles. Oh, hang on, I'lltell ya. Something happening in the darkworlds. It'salways been rumors out there but . . . only one thing's coming through clear..That something's harming demons and it's not the Slayer. Know anything aboutit?
Giles What are they saying?
Ethan Heh, you know demons. It's all exaggeration and blankverse. Pain as bright assteel things like that. They're scared. There's something called314 that's got them scared most of all. The kind of scared thatturns to angry. I know we're not particularly fond of each other, Rupert. But we are a couple of old mystics. This knewoutfit, it's blundering into new places it doesn't belong. It's throwing theworlds out of balance. And that's way beyond chaos, mate. We're headed quiteliterally for one hell of a fight.
Riley Are you pulling back?
Buffy Are you?
Riley Maybe a little.
Buffy Maybe a little, too.
Riley I'll go all out if you will.
Buffy Are you sure?
Riley Here we go.
Buffy Riley!
Buffy Are you hurt?
Riley I, uh, I don't think so.
Buffy I'm so sorry. I-I didn't mean to, uh
Riley It's fine. I'm good.
Giles You know what gets me? This is what gets me. Twenty years I've beenfighting demons. Maggie Walsh and herNancy-ninja boys come in and six months later, demons are pissing themselveswith fear. They never even noticed me.
Ethan Who's Maggie Walsh?
Giles Oh, she's awful. She said I was an absent male role model.Absent my ass. I'm twice the man she is.
Ethan You know you're really very attractive.
Giles Hm?
Ethan Here's my name and number. You give me acall, I'll show you a good time.
Waitress Yeah, thanks.
Giles We gotta face it, we've changed. We'll not you . . . you're still sadistic and self-centered.
Ethan Here's to me.
Giles The world has past us by. Someone snuck in and left us a couple of has-beens in our place. ThisInitiative, I mean, their methods may be causing problems, but they're gettingthe job done. Where am I? I'm anunemployed librarian with a tendency to get knocked on the head.
Ethan Well, we won't have to worry about that anymore now,mate. When you went tothe loo I slipped a small pellet of poison in your drink. You'll be dead in an hour.
Ethan Just kidding!
Giles I'm gonna feel like hell in the morning.
Ethan Relax. Enjoy thenight. We're just a couple of sorcerers. The night is still our time. Time of magic.
Giles To magic.
Willow I'm glad you wanted to gettogether. I know it's late.
Tara Thanks. I was happy you called.
Willow We'll start out slow.
Tara Okay.
Tara Willow?
Willow Yeah?
Tara Start out slow doing what?
Willow Oh. We're gonna float the rose. Then use the majiks to pluck the petals off,one at a time. It's a test of synchronicity. Our minds have to be perfectly attuned to work as a single delicateimplement.
Tara Cool.
Willow And it should be very pretty.
Tara It worked.
Willow Now for the hard part. The petals.
Willow What the heck was that?
Tara I don't know, but, uh, the petals are off.
Giles I feel like hell in the morning.
Giles Uh! Wha WhaNo!
Giles Damn!
Giles Ethan.
Giles Oh, and I liked that shirt!
Buffy I like pancakes 'cause they're stackable. Ooo, and waffles 'cause you can put things in the little holes if youwanted to.
Willow You should always have a new boyfriend. You're so much fun right now.
Buffy Hey. I didn't hearyou come in last night. Where were you?
Willow The chem lab, by myself. I-I was tryingthis new spell; floating a rose, when all of a sudden zing,zing, zing! Like all over the room. Itwas like a rose-based missile.
Buffy Yikes.
Willow I know. I thinkthere's something out there. I-I felt this presence.. This dark majiks energyblocking the spell. It's new.
Buffy Someone else doing majiks?
Willow Maybe. If so, it'ssomeone pretty powerful.
Buffy Hmm. I'll tell Gilesabout it. Or maybe I'll tell Maggie. She seemed kind of interested in learningthe mystical side of the whole demon hunting biz.
Willow Tell Giles. He's feeling a little hurt right now. How come you never told him about Riley being a commando?
Buffy I did. I didn't?
Willow He says no. He'sfeeling neglected and out-of-the-loopy.
Buffy Well, I didn't at first because Riley said not to. And . .and then meow cat out of the bag and I-I guess I just forgot thathe didn't know. I'll make it up to him when I see him. Tomorrow. I'm spending today with Riley.
Willow Oh, yeah. I forgotthat's what you always do on the days when the earth rotates.
Buffy It's just going so well, right now. I think. I hope. I sort of kicked him acrossthe room last night.
Willow Uh, that's not good.
Buffy Well, we were sparring and he said not to hold back. And he's a little dented. But he said he was okay with it and I thinkhe's okay with it do-do you think he's okay with it?
Willow I'm sure he is. Imean, if he's not . . . you know, you had to do it. He's right. You can't walk around pretending you're lessthan you are. It wouldn't be right for you to hold back.
Buffy Right.
Willow What?
Buffy I held back a little.
Giles Still asleep? It's ten thirtyin the morning.
Giles Xander. Xander, wake up.
Xander Mom?
Giles No, it's not mum. Now, when you look at me . . . you may bea little alarmed but there's no need, it-it's me. Giles. Now, Ethan has turnedme into a demon and I need your help.
Giles Hello. Yes, it's me.
Xander AHHH!
Giles Xander, listen! Don't you understand me?
Xander Demon! Demon!
Giles Please, don't you understand? No, no! Don't! Xander!Xander, calm down! Ow! You're just alittle overwrought. Oww!
Xander That's right! Runfor your life!
Giles Oh, God. I'm sorry!
Mother Call 911!
Giles Bloody humans!
Buffy So it had pointy things. What kind of pointy things?
Xander The pointy kind. And tufty ears. Oh, and it might have a sauce pan shape bruise.
Willow Giles will know what it . . . was.
Buffy Giles?
Buffy Looks like Xander wasn't the only one to get a visitortoday.
Xander He's not upstairs.
Willow Oh, God, Giles.
Buffy Okay. There's ademon and Giles is gone. But it doesn'tmean that he's hurt. I mean, there's no blood anywhere so maybe the demon justtook him somewhere?
Anya I think it ate him up.
Spike Well. What do I spywith my little eye? A demon. That would be . . . oh, right . . . the things I can kill.
Giles Spike. Wonderful. A perfect end to a perfect day.
Spike Giles?
Giles Go on, then. Let's get on with the fighting Youunderstand me?
Spike Of course I understand you.
Giles I'm speaking English?
Spike No, you're speaking Fyarl. I happen to speak Fyarl. And . .. by the way, why the hell are you suddenly a Fyarl demon? You just come overall demony this morning?
Giles As a matter of fact, I did. Thanks to Ethan Rayne. You have to help me find him. He must undothis and then he needs a . . . goodbeing killed.
Spike And I'm just supposed to help you out of the evilness of myheart?
Giles Y-you help me and I-I don't kill you.
Spike Oh, tremendously convincing. Try it again without thestutter.
Giles Money. I could payyou money.
Spike Oh, I like money. Howmuch?
Giles A h-hundred dollars.
Spike A hundred dollars? You'll have to do a lot better thanthat. Two-hundred.
Giles Fine.
Spike Right, then.
Giles Right, then.
Spike So what's first? I run and tell the Slayer whatyou've gotten yourself into?
Giles No. When I find Ethan I can clear all this up without Buffyever having to find out that anything happened to me at all.
Xander Okay, that's a giant vulture. I'd have mentioned it if it was a giant vulture.
Willow Buffy, even if we figure out what kind of demon got GilesI mean, how are we gonna find it?
Buffy We'll figure it out. Oh, this onehas tufty ears.
Willow What was that?
Riley Buffy?
Buffy Riley. What are you doing here?
Riley There were 911 calls from a couple of different places.Including here.
Xander You get 911 calls?
Riley We have a tap into the system. It flags things with possible nonhuman causes. We check them out. Whatare you doing here?
Buffy This is Giles' apartment. He's missing. The calls, did anyone see what did it?
Riley Negative. No. Neighbors just heard, you know, growling,things breaking. Sounded like a struggle.
Willow Poor Giles.
Buffy We'll get him back.
Riley What are you working on?
Buffy Uh, we have stuff. Pictures . . .
Anya We have nothing.
Riley I'll help. The whole Initiative. We'll do whatever you need.
Buffy Thanks. I just wish I knew what I needed. I keep thinking,let's ask Giles and then I remember.
Xander He'd be great right now. He'd find himself in a second.Nobody is cooler in a crisis.
Giles If you can't find third gear, don't try for third gear!
Spike I'm doing my best. Idon't know if I'm driving this thing or wearing it.
Giles It's perfectly serviceable.
Spike Funny hearing a Fyarl demon say serviceable.Had a couple of them working for me once. They're more like Like tocrush. Crush now? Strongthough. You won't meet a jar you can'topen for the rest of your life.
Spike What was that? Did you growl?
Giles No. Listen, about this Fyarl demon. Do-do I have specialpowers? Like setting things on fire with my sizzling eye beams?
Spike Well, you got the mucous thing.
Giles What? Mucous?
Spike Paralyzing mucous. Shoots out through the nose. Sets on fast. Hard as a rock. Pretty good in a fight.
Giles Are you making this up?
Spike Maybe. But hey, you feel a sneeze coming on, youwarn me.
Giles Turn here.
Giles Down shift! Down shift!
Spike Calm down, will you?
Giles I'm not sure I can. I feel like I'm changing.
Spike Fine with me. So long as you pay me.
Giles I really like this feeling. Sort ofmindless need to destroy. This anger and rage.
Spike Good times. Go with it.
Giles No.
Spike Oh, it's fun. I can't do it, do it for me. Now let yourself go.
Giles I refuse to become a monster because I look like a monster.I have a soul. I have aconscience. I am a human being. Oh, stop the car!
Giles Right. Let's go, then.
Xander That's the thing that attacked me.
Willow A Fyarl demon. Sortof a foot soldier type, works for other demons lots of the times. Very strong .. . ugh! And hey, mucous.
Buffy Mucous?
Riley Agent Finn, go ahead.
Buffy How do I kill it?
Willow Silver. A weapon made of silver.
Riley Yes. I understand.The demon attacked Professor Walsh. Got out of a small, graycar. A Citroen.
Willow It stole Giles' car.
Xander Why would a demon steal a car?
Anya Why would a demon steal *that* car?
Buffy A demon that steals a car has a reason. A purpose. But itdoesn't sound like these Fyarl demons are really big independent thinkers. So,Will, the spells that are going wrong . . . could they be caused by someoneusing majiks to control a demon? Making this Fyarl demon attack Giles?
Willow Yes. Yeah, thatwould draw in a lot of dark energy.
Buffy Okay. Willow, Xander: stay here. Who's ever controlling this demon may call and askfor a ransom. Give them anything theywant.
Xander You got it.
Buffy Riley, you and I are going to the magic shop. Maybe they needed supplies. Uh, somethingsilver . . .
Riley A letter opener? It's not very sharp.
Buffy Then I'll have to put some muscle behind it.
Spike Two of them. English like me. But older, less attractive. One of them gave you hisnumber.
Waitress I threw it out. I mean, I took one look and saw that hewas staying at that rat trap. Nothanks.
Spike Which rat trap?
Waitress The one by the highway. The Sunnydale Motor Inn.
Spike Thank you.
Buffy Okay. Credit card slips, sales receipt. Help me look.
Riley You shouldn't have done that to the door.
Buffy I do not have time to play by the rules tonight.
Riley I have a master key. It opens every shop on Main Street.
Buffy Oh. Well . . . next time, absolutely.
Riley I don't know what I'm looking for.
Buffy I do. Ethan Rayne.
Riley Who's that?
Buffy At least we know who we're looking for.
Riley Command, are you there?
Buffy What are you doing?
Riley It's agent Finn. I need a search. Local hotelregistrations matching the name Ethan Rayne. R-A-Y-N-E. Call me back.
Buffy You can do that?
Riley It'll take a couple of minutes.
Buffy Get in the car. Beready to go.
Riley Buffy. Earlier, when I talked toProfessor Walsh, she gave me very specific orders.
Buffy Yeah?
Riley She said when we located the demon I . . . I'm not supposedto bring you along.
Buffy Oh.
Riley Uh, what are you doing?
Buffy I'm *going* to the car.
Riley Buffy, I can't take you with me.
Buffy You're not taking me with you. I am going and I am letting you come along.
Riley Buffy, it's not really your call. This is a militaryoperation now.
Buffy Then call out the troops. Because nothing less than that is gonna stop me. This demon did something to Giles and I'mgonna kill it.
Spike How ya feeling, mate?
Giles Like snapping necks until everyone isdead.
Spike Now that sounds like a Fyarl demon. Good for you.
Spike Hey, picked up a tail.
Giles Yes. Just a little one. It hurts when I sit.
Spike I mean someone is following us. Humvee. Military.
Giles Well speed up. Lose them.
Spike I got it floored. Why'd you buy this car?
Giles Well do something. If they catch us, we'll both end up in a lab!
Spike It's getting closer.
Spike And it's got a friend!
Giles Damn!
Spike Oh, sure! Dismantlethe getaway car. That'll scare them.
Giles Then slow down and I'll jump out. They'll follow you.
Spike Hold on. These commandos. They're the same guys that areafter me too.. Maybe I want you aroundto split their attention a bit?
Giles I'll pay you another hundred dollars.
Ethan Giles?
Ethan Now it-it calm down! It's okay. Good Giles.
Ethan No! No! Don't kill me!
Ethan I can't undo you if you kill me!
Ethan You've got to stop it! It killed Ripper and nowit's trying to get me!
Buffy Don't let him go.
Buffy What did you do to him? What did you do?!
Spike You just try and stop me, youstupid jar
Spike I can kill demons. Ican crash cars. . . . Things are looking up!**
Ethan You're only going to make him angry.
Buffy *This* is for Giles!
Giles For me?
Buffy Oh, God! Giles!
Buffy Oh, God! Giles! Giles! I'm soI'm so sorry!Please don't die!
Giles Actually, I feel quite well. Except for the rage.
Buffy I think he's okay. Iis this thing real silver?
Ethan I really got to learn to just do the damage andget out of town. It's the stayand gloat that gets me every time.
Buffy You okay?
Giles Oh, um, uh, embarrassed, mostly. Ethan's wardrobe's not helping any. Uh, how did you know it was me?
Buffy Your eyes. You're the only person in theworld that can looked *that* annoyed with me.
Ethan Is this gonna go on much longer? I'd rather like to begoing.
Buffy And why would I let you go?
Ethan Well, maybe because you have no choice. I'mhuman, you can't kill me. What's aSlayer going to do to me?
Riley By the authority of the US military,you're being taken into custody pending a determination of your status.Take it from here.
Riley They'll, uh, take Mr. Rayne to a secret detention facilityin the Nevada desert. I'm *sure* he'll be rehabilitated in no time.
Giles Uh, if you don't mind, I'm just gonna go andwatch them manhandle him into a vehicle.
Buffy Thanks.
Riley I told you I'd help.
Buffy You did. If I'd had gotten here any later and if Giles hadkilled Ethan, I . . . never would have gotten him back.
Riley You'd find some other way. You're reallystrong. Like Spider-Man strong.
Buffy Yeah. But I don'tstick to stuff. But . . yeah.
Riley And you're in charge. You're like, make the plan, executethe plan. No one giving you orders.
Buffy I'm the Slayer.
Riley I like it.
Buffy Yeah?
Riley But give me another . . oh . . week to get ready. And I'lltake you down.
Buffy Nice phone.
Giles Yes. Fabulous technology. See, if anyone has information Ineed to know, they can, uh, simply tell me about it. Through this ingenious speaking tube. I'm very excited.
Buffy I am sorry, Giles. Ireally thought I told you about Riley and the Initiative. And I know that it doesn't help. Look, Ipromise it won't happen again. I willtell you everything.
Giles Buffy, Idon't want to ask you to betray any confidences, and I certainly don't want tointerfere
Buffy Uh-oh, you have but-face. You look like you're gonna say but.
Giles But . . . this, um, Initiative, I'm-I'm a littleconcerned. Ethan's not exactly areliable source but, um . . . I'm not sure that he's wrong about them.
Buffy I'm not dating the Initiative. I'm dating Riley. He's a good guy.
Giles And I-I believe that. But he's part of something we-we don'treally understand.
Buffy You sure you're not just saying this because youdon't like Riley's boss?
Giles No! No. I'm not saying that at all. Though I do . . . hate her quitea lot. But I want you to have your personal life, but . . . keep your eyesopen. Make sure you know what you're getting into.
Walsh So she walks in and the rules just suddenly break?
Riley Umm . . . pretty much.
Walsh Be careful with her. She reacts on instinct. There's nodiscipline there. Her loyalties are uncertain.
Riley You won't be disappointed in her. She's good at what she does. She is the truest soul I've everknown.
Walsh Oh, no oh, no! Spontaneous poetic exclamations. Lord, spare me college boys in love.
Riley I'm just saying she'll work out. You'll be proud of her.
Walsh You want to know what I think? I think you'reprobably right.
