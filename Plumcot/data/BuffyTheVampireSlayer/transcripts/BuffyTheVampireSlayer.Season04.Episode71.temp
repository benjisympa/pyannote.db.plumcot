Faith I'm Faith.
Giles Previously on Buffy The Vampire Slayer.…
Mayor Open your present.
Faith This is a thing of beauty, boss.
Mayor That look on your face is my reward.
Giles We have a rogue Slayer on our hands. I can't think of anything more dangerous.
Doctor It's a wonder she's alive at all with the blood loss. There's virtually no chance that she'll ever regain consciousness.
Riley You're really strong. I like it.
Walsh I've worked too long... too long to let some little bitch threaten this project.
Giles Maggie Walsh...set you up?
Buffy Maggie wanted me dead didn't she?
Walsh Adam.....
Adam Mommy. Initiative.
Riley Why does it bug you so much that I'm hanging with her?
Forrest It bugs me that she's using you to infiltrate our operation.
Riley You saying she's a spy?
Riley I don't know what's going on...who the bad guys are...
Forrest Escort them out.
Riley Buffy....
Buffy They smell good don't they?
Faith What?
Buffy Clean sheets. Like summer.
Faith I wouldn't know.
Buffy Right. I forgot.
Faith I noticed.
Buffy I wish I could stay, but…
Faith Oh, you have to go.
Buffy That's just what…
Faith Little sis coming. I know.
Buffy So much to do before she gets here.
Buffy Now I really have to…
Faith So go. Don't let me keep.
Faith Damn. Just when we'd made it so nice. Are you ever gonna take this thing out?
Xander So, here it is. The latest in state-of-the-art combat technology. I gotta say, it doesn't look that complicated.
Buffy So can you repair it?
Xander Sure. As soon as I get my master's degree in advanced starship technology.
Willow Well, why don't we experiment? Press some buttons, see what happens.
Giles I'd like to veto that.
Xander Second. It's called a blaster, Will, a word that tends to discourage experimentation. Now, if it were called the Orgazmater, I'd be the first to try your basic button press approach.
Buffy Just tell me. Can you repair it or not?
Xander I'm working on it, I'm working on it. I blow a whole in my mom's exterior patch then the neighbours will not be pleased.
Giles Are you alright? You've been patrolling round the clock for three days straight now. I thought you could use some…
Buffy What? Some rest? There's a demonoid killing machine out there Giles, it doesn't only work the night shift.
Giles I was going to say perhaps you could use some backup, but um....now you mention it, building up your strength may not be a bad idea.
Buffy Just get the blaster working. That's all the strength I need.
Willow Are you sure?
Buffy Why? Because ray guns aren't in the Slayer handbook? Well, you haven't seen this Adam thing. He's the Terminator without the bashful charm. He's deadly, and the last time we met, he kicked my ass.
Willow Oh no, blast away, by all means. I only meant....no word about Riley?
Buffy They keep telling me that he's fine. That's all they'll say.
Willow Maybe they're telling the truth.
Buffy Maybe. I don't even know what the Initiative's version of "fine" is. I mean, they could be forcing him back onto medication or torturing him for all I know.
Giles From what we've seen, I doubt they'll be trying to hurt him.
Buffy The only thing I know for certain is that my boyfriend is locked away and I'm not helping.
Willow Maybe Giles has a point. I mean, Riley is their top gun guy. Doesn't make sense that they'd hurt him.
Buffy All I know is that the Initiative has all those brain-washy, behaviour modification guys.
Willow So?
Buffy So what happens when they start not liking his behaviour?
Riley Stand down, soldier. Stand down before I put you down.
Forrest You heard the man. At ease.
Forrest The shish kebab that walks like a man. Looks like you're feeling better. Walking around, threatening people and all that.
Riley He was in my way. I got places to be.
Forrest Really. And where were you thinking of going?
Riley You know where I'm going.
Forrest Don't even tell me you're headed to that girlfriend of yours. Look at you. One good injury and you're back in intensive care to stay.
Riley You wouldn't understand.
Forrest How about you explain it to me then?
Guard We all friends here fellows?
Forrest Absolutely. Riley here was about to explain why he's leaving us so very quickly.
Riley I don't explain. Because I don't have to. I'm the one in charge.
Forrest Things change.
Riley Do they?
Forrest Hey! In case you failed to notice, we're in a world of hurt around here. Now's the time for us to band together, not go flying off our separate ways.
Guard Forrest has a point, Riley.
Forrest We have a problem, we deal with that problem. You know, the most important part of the equation now is that we keep said problem within the family.
Riley Family? Is that what we are? Step aside.
Faith Think it's gonna rain?
Mayor Nonsense. It's a beautiful day. Now eat your sandwich.
Faith I dunno. It just always seems like it starts raining about now.
Mayor You're too young and too pretty a girl to start wearing worry lines on your face. Hey there, little fella. I dunno where you belong, butit's not here with us. There you go. Y'see, there's nothing gonna spoil our time together. Who wants cheese cake?
Faith NO!
Buffy I told you I had things to do.
Willow Spread out.
Buffy Not too far.
Xander So not a problem.
Buffy I've never seen anything like that.
Xander And I can go a long healthy stretch without seeing anything like that again.
Willow It had to be Adam who killed it, but why?
Buffy He's studying biology. Human, demon, whoever he can get his hands on and take apart.
Willow He's finding out what makes things work.
Xander I really don't want to be around for the final exam.
Buffy It's not coming to that. The Initiative created this thing and they can't stop it. But we will.
Xander Will hiding in a cavern with stockpiled chocolate goods be any part of this plan?
Buffy No. Xander sits next to Willow.
Xander Told you.
Willow What's first?
Buffy Riley. I'm not leaving him down there with the people that created this thing. I don't care how many guns they have, I'm going in. Okay. Will, I need you to hack into their security mainframe and buy me a ten minute shut down of operation systems.
Willow That could be...
Buffy Tricky. Not impossible. If you can't do it online, then use magic. Xander, any gear you've been saving for a rainy day, I want you to give to me.
Xander You want stealth stuff?
Buffy No, we tried sneaking in. This time, we're gonna use force. I figure I'll go in through the elevator shaft, use the cable as towlines.
Riley Am I really worth all that?
Buffy Riley! Oh God, I'm sorry! Did I hurt you?
Riley No, a giant skewer thr h the rib cage hurt me. That was just a reminder.
Buffy How did you get out?
Riley I walked.
Willow They didn't try to stop you?
Riley Oh, they did. Repeatedly. But then I told them they couldn't keep me without a major ass-kicking, one way or another. So here I am.
Xander That's.....great...Riley, and y'know...there's no polite way to ask you this, but...uh....did they put a chip in your brain?
Riley Beg your pardon?
Buffy Forget it. We're just happy to have you back.
Willow Yeah, we were pretty worried about you for a while, mister.
Riley Me too. Hey, I know my behaviour was pretty out there...
Willow Forget it. Tell you what, you two crazy kids take down a killer cyber demon hybrid thingy and we'll call it all even.
Riley Taking down Adam's gonna be tough. There's no way to predict what he'll throw at us.
Buffy You're here. Whatever comes, we can handle.
Faith Owch.
Woman Excuse me. You know how to get to third floor west?
Faith What?
Woman I see....you need some help or something?
Faith Graduation.
Woman What?
Faith Graduation. I gotta get to Sunnydale High School graduation NOW.
Woman Well, you can't. I mean, Sunnydale High School isn't even there anymore.
Faith What day is it?
Woman Friday.
Faith What date? The date.
Woman February 25th.
Faith What year?
Woman Maybe I should get you a nurse...
Faith What happened to the school?
Woman Don't you just wanna....
Faith Just tell me.
Woman Well, it was a tragedy really. Lots of students died. The Principal, the Mayor. I really think maybe I should get you some help.
Buffy Y'know, I never stopped thinking about you.
Riley Me neither. All I had in there was this one little part of you.
Buffy It's just the scarf part of me really.
Riley Sure it is. Just knowing you were out there...that you cared...I think we're being watched.
Buffy I dunno. Does the Initiative do that?
Riley Maybe.
Buffy You seem a little...somewhere else. Is there anything I can do?
Riley Give me an order. That's what I do isn't it? Follow orders.
Buffy You don't have to.
Riley Don't I? All my life that's what I've been groomed to do. They say jump, I ask "How high?", I get the job done. Just don't know if it's the right job anymore.
Buffy I know how you feel. Giles used to be part of this Council. And for years all they ever did was give me orders.
Riley Ever obey them?
Buffy Sure. The ones I was going to do anyway. The point is, I quit the Council. And I was scared. But it's okay now.
Riley Now, see, that's where you and I are different. I just suck at the whole gray area thing.
Buffy It's a choice. Go back in there and make some changes from the inside. Or you can quit the team, fight demons in your own way.
Riley You make it sound so simple. I don't even know what my way is.
Buffy Well, it's time to find out.
Riley I'm a soldier. I got a way, which one of them?
Buffy Good man.
Riley What're you doing?
Buffy I am looking for brain washy chips in your head.
Riley Heh....finding any?
Buffy Not sure. But I should probably keep looking just in case. You've been strong long enough, Riley Finn. I'm here for you. And we're gonna find this demon, and we're gonna kill it together. And in the mean time, you are gonna stop torturing yourself.
Riley Sure about that?
Buffy It's an order.
Doctor What do you mean she just wasn't there?
Nurse I don't know. I came to check the monitors like I always do at eight o'clock. Eight o'clock is my shift, I got here on time.
Officer You found the bed in this condition?
Nurse Haven't touched a thing.
Doctor Get the duty rosters and check the log. I wanna know exactly what happened. Coma patients do not just get up and walk away.
Nurse We are checking every room on every floor.
Officer Walk me through this one more time. You knew this woman was wanted for questioning on a series of murders and there's no security on this wing?
Doctor You don't understand. There's no way that girl was gonna wake up.
Officer Doctor...
Doctor This can't be happening... Nurse2 comes in.
Nurse Did you find her?
Nurse Another woman, unconscious and badly beaten. And she's been stripped. Officer, Doctor and Nurse2 leave in a hurry.
Nurse It's happened. Send the team.
Giles The problem for me seems to be why Adam has stayed dormant as long as he has.
Willow When he's not making performance art out of other demons, that is.
Riley He's probably working off an autonomic power source. And because he's straight out of the box, he needs to charge up a while. Shot of Faith at window.
Buffy Okay, what's he charging up for?
Xander Based on the clues, I'll go with killing spree.
Riley And that's a best case scenario. I suppose a little fire power would be a good idea right now.
Xander Hey! How'd you do that? Is there like an On/Off button somewhere here?
Riley Blasters are easy. Adam won't be.
Willow Since Professor Walsh designed it, any chance she left instructions lying around somewhere?
Buffy Well, if she did, they're gonna be in the Initiative.
Giles Which we can't get into without mounting a major offensive.
Riley Speak for yourself. I'm just saying.
Giles I must admit, a man on the inside would be...
Buffy A really good idea. Are you sure you wanna be double agent guy.
Riley I'm not exactly sure what you'd call me, but I will share information. It's the least I can do.
Xander Riley's right. It is the least we can do.
Giles Hello. What? Yes, she is. Um...it's for you.
Buffy Hello? What sort of emergency? No, I haven't. Thank you, I'll let you know.
Giles What is it?
Buffy It's Faith. She's awake.
Xander I'd say this qualifies for a "Worst Timing Ever" award.
Willow What do we do?
Giles Well, we have to find her.
Willow What about Adam?
Xander I'd hate to see the pursuit of a homicidal lunatic get in the way of pursuing a homicidal lunatic.
Buffy Well, Faith's not exactly low-profile girl. I'll patrol and wait for her to make a move.
Giles But then what?
Willow Oooh! I have an idea! Beat the crap out of her!
Xander Good plan.
Buffy Good on paper. But we still have a decision to make. Do we hand her over to the cops? They wouldn't know what to do with a Slayer even if they knew we existed.
Willow What about the Council?
Xander Been there. Tried that. Not unlike smothering a forest fire with napalm as I recall.
Giles Well, the Initiative, they do have containment facilities.
Xander One
word Evil.
Buffy There's no way around it. Faith is back, and whether I like it or not, she's my responsibility.
Willow Yeah, too bad. That was out first coma ever.
Buffy We have no idea where she is. We don't know what she's thinking, what she's feeling…
Xander Who she's doing.
Buffy She could be terrified. Maybe she doesn't even remember. Or maybe she does and she's sorry and she's alone hiding somewhere.
Giles Well, perhaps there's some form of rehabilitation we just haven't thought about.
Willow And if not, ass-kicking makes a solid plan B.
Buffy I'm not going to rule it out. First thing, we need to find her. Then we can take it from there.
Riley Who's Faith?
Willow What did you tell him?
Buffy The truth? That she's my wacky identical cousin from England, and whenever she visits hi-jinks ensue?
Willow It's good you guys have such an honest relationship.
Buffy No, I told him the story. I vagued up a few bits, but no flat-out lies.
Willow That's fair. How'd you handle the Angel-y parts?
Buffy I did some editing. It's not that I'm trying to hide anything from Riley, it's just that's a longer conversation, and I had a Faith-hunt to do.
Willow Any luck?
Buffy Couldn't find her. Don't know exactly where to place that little up-continuum.
Willow At least you're not alone on this. I bet every cop in Sunnydale is out there looking for her right now.
Buffy Pressure's definitely on. I'm telling you, if I were her, I'd get outta Dodge post hasty.
Faith But you're not me. Fade to Break.
Faith So, check you out B. Nice, the big girl on campus thing's really working for you.
Buffy I've been looking for you.
Faith I've been standing still for eight months, B. How hard did you look?
Buffy Are you alright?
Faith Five-by-five. It's that thing about a coma. Wake up all rested and rejuvinated. And ready for payback.
Buffy So much for pleasantries, huh?
Faith What did you think, I'd wake up and we'd go for tea? You tried to gut me, bonny. Buffy; You'd have done the same to me if you'd had the chance.
Faith Lets have another go at it. See who ends on top.
Buffy It doesn't have to be like this, y'know.
Faith Actually, I think it has to be exactly like this.
Buffy Faith, these are innocent people.
Faith No such animal.
Buffy I guess it was too much to hope that you'd use your downtime to reflect and grow.
Faith I could say the same about you. I mean, you're still the same better-than-thou Buffy. I mean, I knew it somehow. I kept having this dream, I'm not sure what it means, but in the dream the self-righteous blond chick stabs me, and you wanna know why?
Buffy You had it coming.
Faith That's one interpretation, but in my dream, she does it for a guy.
Faith Try it red, and you'll lose an arm. I wake up to find the blond chick isn't even dating the guy she was so nuts about before. I mean, she's moved on to the first college beefstick she meets. Not only has she forgotten about the love of her life, but she's forgotten about the chick she nearly killed for him. So that's my dream. That and some stuff about cigars and a tunnel. But tell me, college girl, what does it mean?
Buffy To me? Mostly, that you still mouth off about things you don't understand. Uh-oh. I guess somebody knows you're here.
Faith You took my life, B. Payback's a bitch.
Willow Look who's talking.
Faith See you around.
Willow Thanks for coming with. Hunting for a psychopathic superbitch is definitely in the above and beyond category.
Tara It's okay, really. So, what do we do if we find her?
Willow Run, flee, maybe skedadlle. We're not here to engage. This is strictly recon.
Willow What?
Tara You said "recon". You're like "Cool Monster Fighter"!
Willow Well, technically, Faith isn't a monster. And as far as fighting, I'd be lucky to bruise her fist with my face.
Tara Oh.
Willow What?
Tara Face-punching, I'm not so good with the whole..
Willow Swimming?
Tara Violence.
Willow Don't worry, we're sure to spot Faith first. She's like this cleavagy slut-bomb walking around "Ooh, check me out, I'm wicked-cool, I'm five-by-five."
Tara Five-by-five? Five what by five what?
Willow See, that's the thing. No-one knows.
Tara So, um.......we recon till nightfall?
Willow Then the ritual hiding begins.
Xander The point being I could be the target here. Faith finds Mr. Xander Harri still in town, she goes tighter than cat gut. Got a lotta pent up feelings there. I'm only saying.
Giles Yes, I'm sure.
Xander See, I can't be held responsible for the effect I have on women.
Giles No...
Xander See, Faith and I have this little thing between us called history... Rattling.
Xander Spike?
Giles What are you doing here?
Spike Me? Hey, I'm not the one out of place here.
Xander For your information, smarty, we've got a rogue Slayer on our hands. Real psycho-killer too.
Spike Sounds serious.
Giles It is. What do you know?
Spike What do you need?
Xander Her. Dark hair. Yay tall, name of Faith, criminally insane.
Giles Have you seen her?
Spike Is this bird after you?
Xander In a bad way, yeah.
Spike Tell you what I'll do then. I'll head out, find this girl, tell her exactly where you are and then watch as she kills you. Can't any one of your damn little Scooby club at least try to remember that I hate you all? Just because I can't do the damage myself doesn't stop me from aiming a loose cannon your way. And here I thought the evening be dull.
Xander Go ahead. You wouldn't even recognise her.
Spike Dark hair, this tall, name of Faith, criminally insane. Like this girl already.
Xander We're dumb.
Monster Faith! Your friend sent me. I got a little rememberance from him.
Mayor Hello Faith. If you're watching this tape, it can only mean one thing. I'm dead. And our noble campaign to bring order to the town of Sunnydale has failed. Utterly and completely. But on the other hand, heck, maybe we won. And right now, I'm on some jumbo monder in the Richard Wilkins surrounded by a bunch of kids sitting Indian style and looking up at my face filled with fear and wonder. "Hi kids!" But the realist in me tends to doubt it. Now, Faith, as I record this message you're sleeping. And the doctors tell me you might never wake up. I don't believe that. Sooner or later you will wake up, and when you do, you'll find the world has gone and changed on you. I wish I could make the world a better place for you to wake up in. But, tough as it is to accept, we both have to understand that even my power to protect and watch over you has it's limits. See, the hard pill to swallow is that once I'm gone, your days are just plain numbered. Now, I know, you're a smart and capable young woman in charge of her own life, but the problem, Faith, is that there won't be a place in the world for you anymore. By now I bet you're feeling very much alone. But you're never alone. You'll always have me. And you'll always have this. Go ahead. Open the box. Don't worry. It's not gonna bite. That's my job. Go ahead. Open it. Surprise! You won't find these in any gumball machine! See, when you've been around as long as I have, you make friends. And some of them forge neat little gizmos. Just like the one you're holding right now. And here's the good news. Just because it's over for my Faith, doesn't mean she can't go out with a bang.
Buffy She's a very dangerous woman.
Riley Okay, I get it. Faith bad. Do I look like I'm arguing?
Buffy Not yet. But you always make that innocent face right before you start.
Riley Figured it out, huh? Damn. It took my mom twelve years to catch that one. All I'm saying is, if you're in trouble, I wanna help.
Buffy You can't.
Riley Give me one reason why. She throws him a ball. He barely catches it and flinches in pain.
Buffy That's one.
Riley Alright, I'm not exactly action guy, but there's gotta be something I can do other than sit around waiting for you to pummel this gal.
Buffy Riley, the fact that you just called Faith a "gal" only proves that you don't know her.
Riley Never seen anyone get under your skin this way before. What exactly did she do to you?
Buffy It's a long story.
Riley I'm from Iowa. We drive four hours for our High School football game. Try me.
Buffy I told you, okay? She hurt me and people I care about. And did I mention the psycho killer part?
Riley There's something you're not telling me.
Buffy Riley, I have to go. She's out there.
Riley Alright. I'm just saying. I think you're holding out on me.
Buffy Riley, this isn't a joke. There's a criminally insane woman out there with super-powers who thinks I'm responsible for ruining her life. I know Faith. She'll come after me and she'll come after the people I love.
Faith Hi Joyce.
Faith Mind if I come in. Fade to Commercial Break. Faith going through Joyce's makeup drawer.
Faith Ruby sunset....burgendy skyline...harlot. Mmmmmmm, way to go Joyce. Now, normally I wouldn't be going for something this dark. But I read in some magazine that eight months in a coma will damage a girl's natural skin tone. Good thing pale is in this year.n Or was it last year? Anyway, for real now. I wanna ask you something, and I want you to promise to be honest, and to not spare my feelings just because I could kill you. You promise?
Joyce I promise.
Faith OK. How do I look?
Joyce Psychotic.
Faith Mmmmmmm. I was shooting for sultry, but hey. Bet I know what you're thinking.
Joyce Really.
Faith You're thinking "You'll never get away with this!" Moi?
Joyce Actually I was thinking "My daughter is going to kill you soon."
Faith That a fact?
Joyce More like a bet.
Faith Whoa. You got a pair on you, Joyce, I like seeing that in a woman your age. Guess you can afford to talk that way. I mean, in the world according to Joyce, Buffy is gonna come crashing through that door any minute. But, look what I found. Buffy Summers, Buffy Summers, Buffy Summers, Buffy, Buffy, Buffy. Lotta letters. She hasn't been by in a while, huh? And you'd think, with a crazy chick like me on the loose, crazy chick with a wicked grudge against her no less, she'd call, give you a heads up. But Buffy's too into her own deal to remember dear old mom.
Joyce You don't know the first thing about Buffy. Or me.
Faith Don't I? I know what it's like. You think you matter, you think you're a part of something and you get dumped. It's like the whole world is moving and you're stuck. It's like those animals in the tar pits. It's like you just keep sinking a little deeper everyday and no-one even sees.
Joyce Were you planning to slit my throat any time soon?
Faith Don't tell me you don't see it Joyce. You've served you purpose, squirted out the kids, raised her up, and now you might as well be dead. Nobody cares, nobody remembers, especially not Buffy fabulous superhero. Sooner or later you're going to have to face it. She was over us a long time ago Joyce. Too busy climbing onto her new boytoy to give a single though to the people that matter. I mean, you're her mother, and she just leaves you hear to die.
Buffy Hi mom.
Joyce Hi honey.
Faith Thought I'd go after the queen marine didn't ya?
Buffy You're not his type. He's not big on sleaze.
Faith He's probably just never tried it.
Buffy Going for the boyfriend again? That's tired.
Faith Just something to remember me by once I've moved on.
Buffy Ever occur to you, Faith, that the reason we forgot you is because we wanted to?
Guy Hello Rupert.
Joyce You okay?
Buffy All things considered.
Joyce What is that?
Buffy Weapon of some kind. Didn't work, whatever it was.
Joyce Oh, the Police.
Buffy She's their problem now.
Joyce You sure you're okay?
Buffy Five-by-five.
