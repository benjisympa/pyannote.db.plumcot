BUFFY Okay, you get Fang, I'll get Horny. Imean...
BUFFY Whoo! Vampire-demon tag team.Who says we can't all get along?
RILEY Don't recall ever seeing that before.
BUFFY It never happened. Vamps ... hate demons... Like stripes and polka dots. Major ... clashing. So, uh ... I guess we should tell Giles about this.
RILEY Right.
BUFFY I mean, it's the kind of thing he'd ... wanna know about.
RILEY Uh-huh.
BUFFY Like, as soon as possible.
RILEY As soon as possible.
BUFFY I mean it now. First thing... In the morning...We go tell Giles.
RILEY First thing. Good plan.
XANDER Aw, come on. Big party at Riley's house. It's gonna be fun.Why don't you wanna go?
ANYA You know why not. Those initiative men make me... not comfortable.And you don't care.
XANDER They don't even know that you're an ex-demon. And we don'tknow that they'd care even if they did know. Which, by the way, they'renot gonna find out. Anyways,they'll probably be too busy flirting with every other girl at the partyto even notice you.
ANYA So ... you don't think I'm desirable enough to be flirted with?Is that it?
XANDER I'm just not gonna win here, am I?
ANYA You don't find me attractive any more.
XANDER What are you talking about? I think you're gorgeous.
ANYA Oh, really? Well then, why didn't we have sex last night?
XANDER Is that what this is about? We've gone other nightswithout sex.
ANYA I know. Twice! I can't believe we're breaking up.
XANDER Breaking- We're not! Are we?
ANYA Of course we are. You, you've obviously grown tired of me. Imean, I've seen it happen to thousands of women over the centuries, I justnever thought it would happen to me.
XANDER Anya, there's a lot more to you and me than the sex. Well, there should be! I mean, a relationship is somethingthat you work at. Work through. Together.
ANYA I don't understand. I'm pretty, I'm young... I mean... Why didn't you take advantage of me? Is something wrongwith your body?
XANDER There's nothing wrong with my body.
ANYA Well, there must be. I saw that wrinkled man on TV talking abouterectile dysfunction-
XANDER Whoa! Hey. All systems go here. No function problem, okay?
XANDER You want sex?Let's have sex. Right here. Hot, sweaty, big sex.
GILES_VOICEOVER There's always been great discord between them.
GILES And yet you say that the, the vampire went to the demon's aid.The two of them were working as a team?
BUFFY Everything except giving eachother little pats on the behind.
GILES Extraordinarily odd. As a rule, demons ... have no empathy for any of the speciesother than their own.
GILES In fact, most think of vampires as ... abominations. Mixing with human blood and all.
WILLOW So ... what brought these two together?
RILEY Not what. Who.
GILES Adam.
BUFFY Think about it. Who better to bring together a bunch of ...demon types than someone who's made out of a ... bunch of demon types?
TARA So he's, um, bridging the gap between the races.
WILLOW Huh, like Martin Luther King.
GILES Um, I suggest that, uh, over the next severalnights, you twoconcentrate your patrol in that same area. If there's any other peculiarpairings or groupings, you let me know.
RILEY I'll let the squad know as well. They're patrolling.We'll have a, uh, reserve unit out during the party.
GILES Party?
RILEY Tomorrow night. We're having a thing.
GILES At a time like this? Who, well, whose idea was that?
RILEY Mine. Boys are pretty ragged, need to let off steam.
GILES Point taken.
RILEY You're welcome to come.
GILES Well, much as I, uh, long for a good kegger, I have other plans.The Espresso Pump.
WILLOW What are you doing there?
GILES I'm, um, uh, it's a, a meeting of, uh, grownups. It couldn'tpossibly be of any interest to you lot.
RILEY Buffy, hey, look at the time. Don't you, uh, have a class?
BUFFY Yeah, in about 20 minutes.
RILEY Yeah, but ... I have that ... thing...
BUFFY Right, that ... thing, we could ... squeeze in ... before.
RILEY Yeah.
BUFFY Bye!
RILEY Gotta run.
WILLOW They, they're probably going to-
GILES Yes, thank you Willow, I did attend university in the Mesozoicera, I do remember what it's like.
FORREST Didn't we just get the furnace fixed? It's freezing!
GRAHAM I'll call in the AM, get somebody to come-
FORREST Oh, you gotta be kidding me. When do these two come up forair?
GRAHAM Slaves to the rhythm.
FORREST Room shoulda warmed up by now.
MASON I been building this thing for an hour. It's still an iceboxin here.
GRAHAM Don't bother, Mason, we got a couple of heat generators pumpin'away upstairs.
GRAHAM Jeez!
FORREST Call a medic. Get help!
SPIKE Grr!
SPIKE Oh, it's you.
ANYA Spike! What are you doing? You made me yell reallyhigh.
SPIKE Hey! Yeah, I did. I scared you. Gimme money.
ANYA I'm not paying you for scaring me.
SPIKE You're not paying me. I'm robbing you.
ANYA Oh, well now that's just ludicrous. You can't hurt me becauseyou've got that chip in your brain. Also, I like my money the way it is...when it's mine.
ANYA Oh, now come on. You're not even bumpy any more.
SPIKE Oh. I was just a minute ago.Hang on. Get me mad again.
ANYA Does this really work? Scaring people into giving youtheir money?
SPIKE Yeah, it works. Keeps me in blood and beers. Plus, youknow, funny. Watching those little humans quail.
ANYA I'm beginning to understand why you're so friendless.
SPIKE Look who's talking! I don't see droopyboy on your arm. Did he have better things to do?
FORREST_VOICEOVER You're kidding.
FORREST Mason requested to go on patrol?
GRAHAM He just didn't want the girls to see him with his eyebrowsall burnt off.
FORREST He's lucky that's all he lost.
GRAHAM You shoulda seen it, Rye. Weird as hell.
RILEY Mm-hmm.
WILLOW How many kids?
XANDER I dunno, a whole herd of them. And some parents to boot. It was kind of embarrassing,which, welcome to life with Anya.
TARA So you don't even know if she's coming tonight.
XANDER I'm thinking no. She was... pretty upset. Which, makes me wonder,is it me? Am I the crazy one?
BUFFY Uh-huh. Absolutely.
WILLOW Hey, Buffy, this might be a good time to mention that someone,so not me, spilled something purply on your new peasant top which I wouldnever borrow without asking. Still love me?
BUFFY Uh-huh.
BUFFY Huh? What about my peasant top?
WILLOW Nothin'.
TARA Xander was just talking about Anya.
XANDER Oh, it's nothing much. Just feeling pretty glad right now thata certain ex-demon doesn't have any powers.
ANYA_VOICEOVER Boy, I miss those powers.
SPIKE Yeah, tell me about it.
ANYA A year and a half ago, I could have eviscerated him with my thoughts.Now I can barely hurt his feelings. Things used to be so much simpler.
SPIKE You know ... you take the killing for granted. And then it's gone, and you're like, I wish I'd appreciatedit more. Stopped and smelled the corpses, you know?
ANYA Yeah. Now everything's complicated.
SPIKE It's a terrible thing, love is. I been there myself.It ended badly.
ANYA Of course it did. It always does. Seen a thousand relationships.First there's the love, and sex, and then there's nothing left but thevengeance. That's how it works.
SPIKE You and I ... should just go do the vengeance. Both of us! Youeviscerate Xander, and I'll stake Dru. Like a project.
ANYA I don't know. I just can't.
ANYA You can go do Dru though.
SPIKE Yeah. I will. Maybe later.
SNOB See, the thing that they're afraid to teach us about is the inherentsensuality of language. I mean, you, you learn French and they make itall about conjugations and, uh, fronted vowels ... but nobody really talksabout ... you know, the way language tastes, you know, the, the way itfeels, rolling over your tongue. I mean, just think about car versusvoiture. Oh!
SNOB Wow.
GIRL Are you all right?
SNOB Fine! I - oh! Oh my god. Wow,wow.
GIRL So you really like French, huh?
SNOB Yeah, well...
XANDER Lowell house. 1962.
JULIE Yes.
XANDER Um, just, you know, impressing you with my knowledge of localhistory. Or my knowledge of reading.
JULIE You didn't even have to sound anything out.
XANDER You should see me add short columns of small numbers.
JULIE You're funny.
XANDER Thanks. I mean ... funny how amusing, or funny back awayand avoid eye contact?
JULIE Hmm ... kinda both.
JULIE Who are you here with?
XANDER Right now I seem to be here with you.
BUFFY Hey, uh, can we- I, um, need you to take alook at an ... essay, for ... class.
RILEY That ... essay, right. Here.
RILEY I'll catch you guys in a minute, uh, essay ... gotta look at...
GRAHAM And *I'm* the one who got a D in covert ops.
SNOB Hey, Evan, Evan, come here. You gotta see this.
EVAN I'm getting a beer.
SNOB No, no, no, first ... just ... put your hand right ... here.
EVAN Okay. Somehow this is a trick, I know it.
SNOB Here. Now stay. Don't move.
EVAN Whoa. What is that? Ikinda feel ... Oh my god. Oh god.
WILLOW Horses, like big ... tall ... teeth that can take your armoff horses?
TARA Well, sure. I learned to ride when I was a kid. It's fun.And, by the way, most horses don't like arm very much.
WILLOW I had a bad birthday party pony thing when I was four. I, Ilook at horses and I see really big ponies.
TARA You should ride with me sometime. I guarantee safety and fun.
WILLOW Well... if you promise you'll look after me.
TARA Don't touch me!
TARA That's ... just disgusting.
WILLOW Tara ... what's the matter?
TARA I don't, I don't know.
WILLOW I'm sorry, I-I didn't mean to ... are-are you feeling okay?
TARA I'm f-fine, I just wanna ... go to the bathroom...
SPIKE Hey ... I know these guys from somewhere.
ANYA Initiative soldiers, they live here. Experiments happen in thelab under the house. It's wherethey kept you, put in your chip. Let's have fun!
SPIKE What are you doing? You brought me *here*?
XANDER Anya? What are you doing?
XANDER You brought *him* here?
SPIKE That's what *I* said! Only I hit the here part.
XANDER Anya, this is crazy. And what have we been doing with him anyway?
SPIKE Oh, who's the puffed-up manly man? All splotchy andpossessive.
ANYA It's not very convincing, is it?
SPIKE Yeah. I see now what you said about him earlier. No follow-through.
XANDER Hey! What a surprise! Hostile 17! Can I get you a drink, Hostile 17?
ANYA Xander, stop.
SPIKE Pfft! Well, may be some fun to behad in the lion's den after all. You two keep scraping. I'll find the liquor.
XANDER Anya. What are you doing with him?
ANYA We didn't have sex, if that's what you mean. That's allI do now, not have sex.
XANDER You're overreacting. We had a fight. But see, it's okay. It'snormal.
ANYA Yes. The normal part of the ending a relationship right beforethe vengeance begins.
XANDER Right. No! Vengeance?
ANYA Relax, I'm not gonna do it. I'm just trying to tell you thatwe have nothing in common besides both of us liking your penis. And nowI don't even have that! So I get to say when it's done. And it's done.
XANDER Okay, you know what? You don't deserve to be the one to walkaway from this. I've put up with a hell of a lot from you ... much of thatin the last minute ... and if anyone gets to be the one to leave, it'sme.
ANYA You're leaving *me*?
XANDER Yes. I am.
ANYA Where are you going?
XANDER To enjoy the party.
ANYA Well then, then I'm staying too, to, to show you how much I'm not botheredby you having fun! Because I'll be having more fun!
XANDER I'm having fun already!
ANYA Me too! Woo hoo!
XANDER Huh. Sometimes I just don't get the sophisticated college lifestyle.
XANDER Gee, it's a good thing Mom's out. We'd be in trouble.
DRUNK_GUY Hey, buddy. You look familiar.
SPIKE Yeah. I get that a lot.
JULIE Hey, Xander.
XANDER Julie! Okay. This, then, wouldbe the kissing.
XANDER Very smooth cheek you have there. Do you exfoliate?
XANDER Whoa!
XANDER Julie! What?
JULIE I'm sorry. I didn't... I'm sorry!
XANDER Hi, uh, you okay? Julie?
JULIE I'm bad. I'm bad.
WILLOW Tara? It's me. Tara?Tara?
RILEY Was that Willow?
BUFFY I don't know. Doesn't matter.
XANDER Hey guys, that girl Julie, she's freakin' out. Is anyone friends with Julie?
WILLOW Xander? Tara?
WILLOW Xander. Ghost boy. Drowning in a tub. I, I tried to save him,but, being a ghost already, well, I was way too late.
XANDER A ghost? What's the deal? Is every frat on thiscampus haunted? And if so, why do people keep coming to these parties,cause it's not the snacks.
WILLOW Tara, how are you?
TARA I'm okay, but ... I, I don't like it here. This house ... I,I think we should go.
WILLOW We need Buffy.
XANDER Buffy?
WILLOW Buffy? Riley?
XANDER Buffy!
RILEY Do you wanna go back?
BUFFY Never.
WILLOW Buffy! Riley!
XANDER Buffy!
XANDER We gotta get them outta there.
SPIKE Well, this party's starting to liven up after all.
SPIKE Mmph!
FORREST Graham, quit standing around! Help get these people to safety!
GRAHAM Touch not the impure thing...
FORREST What?!
GRAHAM Or ye shall perish. Find salvation in the cross of our lordand savior.
FORREST Right.
COMPUTER_VOICE Retinal scan accepted.
XANDER Anya. We gotta get out of here. Come on!
JULIE Please help me.
FORREST We got trouble upstairs.
SCIENTIST Now.
FORREST Some sort of disembodied presence in the house.
SCIENTIST We've been paging you.
FORREST Whatever this thing's outputting, it must be scrambling allthe frequencies.
SCIENTIST Guard section 2, level 5 precautions. If the cell door lockingmechanisms malfunction ... you know what to do.
FORREST Got it.
FORREST You with me?
GRAHAM I'm good.
FORREST Let's lock it down.
WILLOW We have to go back in there.
ANYA Why?
XANDER Because Buffy and Riley are trapped.
ANYA So? She's the Slayer, he's abig soldier boy, what do they need you for?
XANDER Anya, look around! There's ghosts and shaking, and people aregoing all Felicity with their hair... We're fresh out of superpeople, andsomebody's gotta go back in there. Now who's with me?
SPIKE I am.
SPIKE I know I'm not the first choice for heroics ... and Buffy's tried to kill me more thanonce. And, I don't fancy a single one of you at all. But... Actually,all that sounds pretty convincing.I wonder if Danger Mouse is on.
ANYA Xander, let's get out of here.
XANDER You wanna bail, fine. I'm going back inthere, and I'm not coming out till I bring my friend with me.
XANDER Or ... it ... could be Watcher time.
WILLOW We'll, we'll go to Giles'.
TARA No, no, wait, he, he isn't there. He was going to the EspressoPump.
WILLOW Right, he-he told us not to come. He, he needed some grownuptime.
GILES No one knows what it's like
ANYA Oh.
WILLOW Wow.
GILES To be fated...
XANDER Um, could we go back to the haunted house? Cause, this is creepingme out.
TARA Does he do this a lot?
XANDER Sure. Every day the earth rotates backward and the skies turnorange.
GILES But my dreams, they are as empty, as my conscience...seemsto be...
GILES I have hours, only lonely...
WILLOW Now I remember why I used to have such a crush on him.
GILES ...my love is vengeance...
TARA Well, he *is* pretty good.
GILES ...that's never free-ee....
ANYA His voice ... is pleasant.
XANDER What?!
GILES No one knows what it's like...
WILLOW Oh, come on, he is kinda sexy.
XANDER I'm fighting total mental breakdown here, Will. No more fuelingthe fire please.
GILES And I blame you...
BUFFY You're, you're too far away from me.
RILEY I'm right here.
BUFFY You ... have to ... keep touching me...
GILES When you called to Buffy and Riley, they didn't cry out or,or respond in any way?
ANYA No. They're probably dead.
XANDER Unless they're too busy doin' it to answer.
GILES Doing what?
XANDER You know, for a god of acoustic rock, you're ... kind of naive.
GILES I didn't think you meant ... In the midst ofall that, do you really think they were keeping it up?
GILES Oh, for a different phrasing.
WILLOW Well, see, that's the thing. People all over the party werestarting to act ... weird. Sexually.
GILES In what way?
WILLOW You know. Ways.
GILES Well, it could be some form of, uh, succubi, or a satyr's prank.It could even be energy coming from the, the lab underneath the Lowellfraternity.
WILLOW It wasn't always a fraternity, look!
WILLOW Between 1949 and 1960, the Lowell Home for Childrenhoused upwards of 40 adolescents: runaways, juvenile delinquents, and emotionallydisturbed teenagers from the Sunnydale area.
TARA Children? Did any of them, um, die in there?
GILES If there were deaths, then, uh, perhaps we're dealing with afairly ... standard haunting.
WILLOW It doesn't say. It's mostly about the old house director, GenevieveHolt. Sunnydale Children's Aid. 30 years of community service. Givingdisadvantaged kids the love and care they deserve.
GILES When did she die?
WILLOW She didn't.
MRS._HOLT No, no, I don't mind at all. I was up. Early morning prayer.
GILES Of course.
MRS._HOLT And I like talking about my kids.
MRS._HOLT I still call them that. My kids.
GILES I, I suppose you were like a mother to them.You did everything for them?
MRS._HOLT Oh yes. I fed them clothed them, educated them in the wayof the lord. I was given a medal.
GILES Yes, wonderful. Uh, congratulations. Um, this'll sound a littlestrange, but, ah, did you notice any odd... disturbances in the house?
MRS._HOLT I don't understand.
GILES We-well, um, like uh, furniture moving of its own accord, or,uh, objects appearing out of nowhere, or, or perhaps you saw someone appearone moment, and then they were gone the next, i-inexplicably.
MRS._HOLT Why, that sounds like crazy talk.
GILES Yes, it does, doesn't it? Yes. Um...Well, forgive me for, for asking this, but um, the children in your care,were any of them ever ill, or did anything ever happen to any of them?
MRS._HOLT Well, some had the flu and such. No one died, if that'swhat you mean. The engraving on the medal says how good I was with thechildren.
GILES Oh, yes.
MRS._HOLT I treated them as I would my own flesh and blood. Gave themhugs and praise when they were good, and ... punished them when they weredirty.
GILES Well, ah, children will be children. They, you know, they dolike to play in the, uh, the muck.
ANYA You didn't mean mud dirty.
MRS._HOLT My kids didn't think I knew, but I did.
GILES Very, uh, perceptive of you.
MRS._HOLT Without me they would have been shut out of the kingdom.Lost to lust.
GILES But you ... helped them.
MRS._HOLT The girls felt the vanity more than the boys. I'd see thempreening like Jezebel. Doting over their pretty hair.
XANDER So you'd hack it off.
MRS._HOLT I'd remove the temptation to admire themselves. They were better for it.
ANYA What about the bathtub? Something happened there.
MRS._HOLT I performed baptisms on the most unclean. Those who weretainted with impure thought and deed.
GILES You held them under?
MRS._HOLT They needed to be reborn. You choose to pass judgmenton me?
GILES Well, someone ought to! You traumatized and, and abused these children, children who, who haveno doubt become extremely disturbed adults! You have ruined lives, Mrs. Holt. Furthermore, what you didhas now manifested itself as a, a malevolent presence which threatens stillmore lives! You have a great deal to answer for.
MRS._HOLT I refuse to listen to this when I can smell the sin on eachand every one of you.
XANDER Yeah? You smell sin? Well let me tell you something, lady,she who smelt it dealt it!
XANDER It's like what you said, but faster.
XANDER Well, that totally adds to my old people are crazy theorem.
ANYA I don't get it. I mean, those kids were tortured, but they weren'tkilled, so where are those ghosts coming from?
GILES I don't believe there are any ghosts.
ANYA One ran right through me.
GILES Not a ghost. An apparition. I believe we're dealing with a kindof poltergeist. A whole cluster of them, in fact, born out of intense adolescentemotion and sexual energy.
ANYA Both of which were totally pent up during Mrs. Holt's reign ofrepression.
XANDER So with Buffy and Riley having ... you know, acts of nakednessaround the clock lately, maybe they set something free. Like a ... bigburstin' poltergasm.
GILES Yes. And now the poltergeists are drawing more and more energyout of them. Feeding on them in fact. Buffy and Riley are, are poweringthis whole thing.
XANDER Okay, they're the battery in the boo factory, so what happenswhen the battery's drained?
GILES_VOICEOVER They die.
BUFFY Don't stop. Never stop touching me.
ANYA What good are weapons against disembodied spirits, Xander? Theyhave no ass to kick.
GILES She's right. You should just stayoutside.
WILLOW We'll bind the spirits long enough for you to get Riley andBuffy out.
XANDER How much time will you buy us?
TARA Could be tricky, we're calling upon the communal spirit of acertain time and place.
XANDER Let's go.
XANDER What do you feel?
ANYA Sad, afraid of being without you,and a little hungry.
XANDER I meant about the house.
ANYA Oh. Still haunted.
TARA Give me your hands. Form a circle.
TARA Children of the past, spirits of Lowell, be guided by ourlight. Come forth and be known to us.
GILES Ho-how will we know when it works?
TARA We'll know.
XANDER House is clean.
ANYA Let's go. You first.
XANDER We need to work fast. Never know how long before the munchkinsget homesick.
ANYA Or the human battery conks out.
XANDER Watch your fingers.
TARA We implore you ... be still.
GILES Find it in your hearts to leave our friends passage.
WILLOW Transform your pain. Release your past. And ... uh ... getover it.
XANDER You okay?
TARA Find here the serenity you seek, the peace you -
GILES What's happened?
TARA We lost them.
WILLOW Xander.
ANYA Xander!
ANYA Xander!
ANYA Shut up, repressed crybabies!
ANYA Ow!!
XANDER Come on, we just gotta-
ANYA Xander!
ANYA We can make it through this.
ANYA Xander, get it off!
BUFFY Xander! Don't you knock?
RILEY_VOICEOVER I can't believe it really happened.
BUFFY I just had no idea. It's so creepy!He was really singing?
XANDER I'd say it was more like crooning. If we grow oldtogether, remind me to skip the midlife crisis.
ANYA Okay.
WILLOW Come on, you have to admit, it was kinda sexy.
XANDER Please stop saying that. I'm willing to offer cash incentives.
RILEY We're just lucky no one got injured. No thanksto us.
WILLOW Don't be too hard on yourself.
BUFFY He's right, Will. If Riley and I hadn't ... gotten so wrappedup in each other, none of this would've happened.
ANYA True. Feel shame.
XANDER My girlfriend. Mistress of the learning plateau.
WILLOW Really, it wasn't your fault. You were under the influenceof powerful magicks.
BUFFY We were like zombies. I had no control over myself at all.
WILLOW Must have been horrible.
BUFFY Yeah. Horrible.
RILEY Uh-huh.
BUFFY Mm-hmm.
RILEY It was bad.
