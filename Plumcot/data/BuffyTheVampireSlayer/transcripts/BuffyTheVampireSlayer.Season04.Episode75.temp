Giles Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer... Oz and Willow in bed. Willow trying to kiss Oz but he pulls away.
Willow Oz... don't you love me? Oz walking forward and kissing her.
Oz_voiceover The wolf is inside me... all the time. Oz walking away from the house, getting into his van.
Oz_voiceover Until I figure out what that means, I shouldn't be around you. Or anybody. The van driving away. Shot of Adam's face. Shot of Adam killing Prof. Walsh.
Buffy The Initiative created this thing and they can't stop it, but we will. Spike trying to bite Willow but flinching back in pain.
Riley_voiceover The implant works. Hostile 17 can't hurt any living creature in any way. Spike in the Bronze: I get this chip out, you and me are gonna have a confrontation. Shot of Willow and Tara holding hands and moving the soda machine. Shot of Willow and Tara holding hands and lifting a rose.
Willow I just like having something that's ... mine.
Tara I am, you know. Yours.
TARA Do you like cats?
WILLOW I'm more of a dog person myself. But I'm not like, death to all cats. Why?
TARA Cause I was thinking of getting one.
WILLOW Can you have one in the dorms?
TARA No, but this would be a sneaky cat.
WILLOW That would be cool. You mean it'd be sort of like a familiar?
TARA Actually, I-I was thinking it would be sort of like a pet. You know, we could ... we could name her Trixie, or Miss Kitty Fantastico, or something.
WILLOW And we could make kitty go bonkers with string and catnip and stuff?
TARA Absolutely.
WILLOW Fun! I'm in.
TARA So, you're not allergic or anything.
WILLOW Nope.
TARA Good, cause ... I want my room to be Willow-friendly.
WILLOW Me too.
TARA So I'm excited about the Scooby meeting ... I think. What's it about?
WILLOW I'm not sure. Probably just your garden-variety disaster.
BUFFY_VOICE-OVER Zippo.
BUFFY Patrol's been totally uneventful. My kill count's way down., Xander, Willow, and Tara on stools against the kitchen counter. Giles in kitchen.)
WILLOW She means there's been less bad-guy activity.
GILES Well, we know what that often indicates.
XANDER Buffy doesn't make her quota. Bad slayer!
GILES Well, I wish it were that innocuous, but with Adam around, I feel he's involved somehow.
WILLOW When things get slow, it's usually because there's some extra evil brewing.
RILEY Except the weird thing is, we've been busy at the Initiative. Our squads are pulling a lot more captures. We got demons coming out our ears.
WILLOW That's a metaphor.
TARA I got it, thanks.
WILLOW I'm overhelping, aren't I?
GILES So the activity's shifted but not stopped. That's fascinating.
ANYA To an extremely bored person, maybe.
ANYA Well, that was a thrilling hour.
GILES You know, I really don't appreciate your snide remarks, Anya.
GILES Now, I have a great deal of experience in these matters...
GILES ...and if I say there is a matter of some import brewing, I-I-
OZ Hey.
WILLOW Oz.
TARA Oz.
WILLOW When, when did you get back?
OZ Pretty much now.
XANDER Oz, man. Hate to sound grandma, but... you don't call, you don't write.
OZ Yeah, sorry.
BUFFY So are you here here, or are you just passing through?
GILES Well, um, let's not, uh, bombard the poor chap with, uh, questions right off. Can I get you something, um, tea?
OZ I'll pass, thanks.
OZ Look, I'm going to Devon's to see if he's got a place I can crash. But... I was hoping that we could talk. Later. Tonight.
WILLOW I guess so.
OZ I'll come by your place?
WILLOW Okay.
OZ It's great to see you guys again. Really.
ANYA Everyone's uncomfortable now.
BUFFY You okay?
WILLOW I-
TARA I just, um - I realized, um, I'm-I'm late for study group.
WILLOW Tara, wait.
TARA No, no, it's okay. You-you should be with your friends, and, and I-I should go.
WILLOW Wait...
RILEY So, um, I was missing something this afternoon, wasn't I?
RILEY I mean, breakups are tough, but when Oz walked in, it seemed like emotions were running extra high.
BUFFY Oz and Willow had a rough breakup.
DEMON Grr.
RILEY Hold that thought.
RILEY Man, that was record time.
BUFFY It's no fun when they're that easy.
RILEY Speak for yourself. Base, this is Agent Finn. We've an HST down. Please send a retrieval team to sector 72.
RADIO , Finn. We'll get there as soon as we can.
BUFFY So, I was just about to say something fascinating.
RILEY Oz and Willow.
BUFFY Right. They had a rough breakup. Some stuff came up, and Oz pretty much bailed overnight. It left Will really devastated.
RILEY I remember.
BUFFY The thing is before that, they were doing great. I mean, she was totally dealing with Oz being a werewolf, it wasn't even-
RILEY Whoa, wait.
RILEY Oz is a werewolf, and Willow was dating him?!
BUFFY Yes. Hence the high emotions.
RILEY You're kidding me. Gotta say I'm surprised. I didn't think Willow was that kind of girl.
BUFFY What kind of girl?
RILEY Into dangerous guys. She seems smarter than that.
BUFFY Oz is not dangerous. Something happened to him that wasn't his fault. God, I never knew you were such a bigot.
RILEY Whoa, hey, how did we get to bigot? I'm just saying it's a little weird to date someone who tries to eat you once a month.
BUFFY Yeah, well love isn't logical, Riley. It's not like you can be Mister Joe Sensible about it all the time.
BUFFY God knows I haven't been.
RILEY I'm not talking about you.
BUFFY How about we don't talk about this at all? Okay? Let's just patrol.
OZ Hey.
WILLOW Hey.
WILLOW So... you wanna come inside?
OZ Actually, I want you to come outside. I wanna show you something.
WILLOW Oz... This is all so weird.
WILLOW I-I-I feel like... this isn't really happening. Like it's a dream or, or something.
OZ It's real. Look up.
WILLOW What?
OZ Look at the sky.
OZ I guess you stopped keeping track of 'em after I left.
WILLOW Full moon.
OZ Full moon.
WILLOW Full moon, but-but how? I mean you did it! How, how did you do it? Where did you go?
OZ It's a long story.
WILLOW Oh my god, Oz!
WILLOW This is... I mean, it's wonderful for you.
OZ I talked to Xander, and he said you didn't have a new guy.
WILLOW No. No new... guy.
OZ I know what I put you through, and I'm not gonna push. But I am... a different person than when I left. And I can be what you need now.
OZ That's what I want. That's why I'm here.
COMMANDO_1 Sir.
WILLOW I love this.
OZ A woman in Tibet traded it to me for the Radiohead record. Got a lot of mileage out of the barter system.
WILLOW So Tibet was your favorite?
OZ Well, it's where I stayed the longest. This warlock in Romania sent me to the monks there to learn some meditation techniques. Very intense. All about keeping your inner cool.
WILLOW Good, 'cause you were such a spaz before. So that's it? You keep your cool, and no more wolfie?
OZ No, there's more. I take some herbs and stuff. Some chanting. A couple of charms.
WILLOW It's incredible. You've been all around the world. You've had this ... complete mind/body transformation. I've just been here. Same old Sunnydale.
OZ Doesn't mean you haven't gone through a lot.
WILLOW It's true. Some of it, you know, was me telling myself I hated you and cursing your name. Not literally.
OZ Well, thanks for that.
WILLOW And, I don't know, I - I think I'm getting better at my spells and stuff.
WILLOW It's so light out.
OZ Yeah, we talked all night.
WILLOW Well, I believe a manly sized breakfast is in order, don't you?
OZ Or we could just... sleep a little while.
OZ Whatever you want.
WILLOW I'll have the less confusing waffles right now.
OZ Breakfast it is. They both get up.
WILLOW Lemme just, ah, freshen up.
TARA Oh, sorry, I-I-I'll come back.
OZ Are you looking for Willow? She's just in the bathroom down the hall.
TARA No, no. No, it's, it's okay.
OZ I saw you at Giles' yesterday.
TARA Yeah. Sometimes Willow takes me with her to the s-scoobies.
OZ You sure you don't wanna come in?
WILLOW What?
OZ Your friend came by. The blonde girl? But she wouldn't stay.
OZ So what do you think? Where you wanna go?
RILEY Morning.
BUFFY Morning.
BUFFY Those like, regulation? Do you have to do those every morning?
RILEY No, just a good way to start the day.
BUFFY Great, then you can have your perfectly balanced breakfast, and then you can call your mother.
RILEY Okay, I'm up less than a minute, and somehow I've managed to piss you off.
BUFFY I should go home.
RILEY No, come on. Is it that whole thing about Willow last night? Look, I only said what I said because I'm concerned. I don't wanna see her get hurt.
BUFFY You sounded like Mr. Initiative. Demons bad, people good.
RILEY Something wrong with that theorem?
BUFFY There's different degrees of-
RILEY Evil?
BUFFY It's just... different with different demons. There are creatures - vampires, for example that aren't evil at all.
RILEY Name one.
FORREST Rye, we need you downstairs. Beta team got hit.
RILEY Bad?
FORREST We lost Willis.
RILEY Graham?
FORREST He's walking.
FORREST We're going on a hunt.
BUFFY What kind of demon was it?
RILEY Does it matter?
BUFFY Hey.
WILLOW Hey. You okay?
BUFFY Yeah, I just - I don't wanna talk about it. I wanna hear about you and Oz. You saw him, right?
WILLOW I was with him all night.
BUFFY All night? Oh my god. Wait. Last night was a wolf moon, right?
WILLOW Yup.
BUFFY Either you're about to tell me something incredibly kinky, or-
WILLOW No kink. He didn't change, Buffy. He said he was gonna find a cure, and he did. In Tibet.
BUFFY Oh my god. I can't believe it. Okay, I'm all with the woo-hoo here, and you're not.
WILLOW No, there's woo and, and hoo. But there's uh-oh, and... why now? And... it's complicated.
BUFFY Why complicated?
WILLOW It's complicated... because of Tara.
BUFFY You mean Tara has a crush on Oz? No.
BUFFY Oh!
BUFFY Oh. Um... well... that's great. You know, I mean, I think Tara's a, a really great girl, Will.
WILLOW She is. And... there's something between us. It-it wasn't something I was looking for. It's just powerful. And it's totally different from what Oz and I have.
BUFFY Well, there you go, I mean, you know, you have to - you have to follow your heart, Will. And that's what's important, Will.
WILLOW Why do you keep saying my name like that?
BUFFY Like what, Will?
WILLOW Are you freaked?
BUFFY What? No, Will, d- No. No, absolutely no to that question.
BUFFY I'm glad you told me. What did you say to Oz?
WILLOW I was gonna tell him ... but then we started hanging out, and ... I could just feel everything coming back.
WILLOW He's Oz, you know?
BUFFY Yeah. I know.
WILLOW I don't wanna hurt anyone, Buffy.
BUFFY No matter what, somebody's gonna get hurt. And the important thing is, you just have to be honest, or it's gonna be a lot worse.
SPIKE From the sound of those massive mud flaps, I'd peg you as a demon. Which means you're in for a world of... Pain.
ADAM Spike, I want you to come with me.
SPIKE Do you? Well, let's go then.
SPIKE Ow.
ADAM Come. You're going to help me with my problem.
SPIKE Why is that exactly?
ADAM I'm going to help you with yours.
WILLOW Hi.
TARA Hi.
WILLOW I can only stay for a minute. I have class.
TARA Me too, I-I-I have class too.
WILLOW I just want you to know that what you saw this morning, it wasn't-
TARA No, it's okay. I-I always knew that if he came back-
WILLOW We were just talking. Nothing happened.
TARA Oh. Really?
WILLOW But, you know, it was intense. Just talking. We have a lot to talk about. I kinda feel like my head's gonna explode.
TARA Whatever, you know, happens ... I'll still be here. I'll still be your friend.
WILLOW Of course we'll be friends! That's not even a question.
TARA But I'm saying, I know what Oz means to you.
WILLOW How can you, when I'm not even sure? I mean, I know what he meant to me. But he left, and... everything changed. I changed, and... then we
TARA What?
WILLOW I don't know. I just - life was starting to get so good again, and You're a big part of that. And here comes the thing I wanted most of all, and... I don't know what to do, I ... I wanna know, but I don't.
TARA Do what makes you ... h-h-happy.
OZ Hey. I thought I sm...ah, heard Willow.
TARA Hey. You're um, you're coming back to school here, huh?
OZ Pretty much. Feeling ... oddly motivated.
TARA That's um, that's great. I mean, that's, that's great for you and Willow, right?
OZ I hope so.
TARA Good, that's, because-
OZ Is that her sweater?
TARA I just, I just hope that you guys'll be very ... happy.
OZ You smell like her. She's all over you, do you know that?
TARA I can't. I-I can't talk about this.
OZ But there's something to talk about?
OZ Are you two involved?!
TARA I have, I, I, I have to go.
OZ Cause she never said anything to me like that. We talked all night and she never- No, stop!
OZ Is she in love with you? Tell me, is she?!
OZ Run.
FORREST Are you okay?
TARA What's going on?
FORREST We'll take it from here.
COMMANDO_2 This thing looks like it may be one of the demons that took out Graham's guys the other night.
RILEY We'll take it back. We'll make an ID. If it is, we'll put him down.
TARA You don't understand, that's -
FORREST Listen, we know what we're doing. You're in shock.
TARA But-
FORREST We'll handle it.
TARA No.
SPIKE Well, that sounds like a lot of fun.
ADAM You see my problem, though. Total annihilation of the humans doesn't help me. I'll be needing heavy casualties on both sides.
SPIKE I get that. I'm still not sure how the Slayer fits in.
ADAM The humans need a leader... a champion. The Slayer can do that.
SPIKE Yeah... the thing about the Slayer is... she is a whiny little thing, but when it comes to the fighting, she does have a slight tendency to win.
ADAM Then I guess you should be on her side.
SPIKE This all goes down, the chip comes out, yeah? No tricks.
ADAM Scout's honor.
SPIKE *You* were a Boy Scout?
ADAM Parts of me.
WILLOW What's up? You okay?
TARA Oz. We were talking and, he changed. Right in front of me.
WILLOW What? It's daylight.
TARA I know, but it happened.
WILLOW Oh my god, are you all right?
TARA I'm fine. Riley and the commando guys, they stopped him. But they don't know it's Oz. I tried to tell them, but ... they took him away.
WILLOW When? Just now?
TARA I think they might hurt him.
WILLOW I, I have to go, I have to find Buffy.
TARA I know.
WILLOW Tara said they took him right before she found me.
ANYA So that's good, right? I mean, they probably haven't had time to eviscerate him yet.
XANDER An, you can help by making this a quiet time.
GILES Once again we're faced with a fairly daunting prospect of having to infiltrate the Initiative.
XANDER It'd be great if we knew someone dating a man on the inside. Someone with connections.
XANDER Oh, wait!
BUFFY He's still not answering his pages. I left him another message.
WILLOW So what do we do?
BUFFY Well, we need to move fast. So we make a plan without Riley... and hope he calls.
FORREST What's the word, Doc? Is this the animal that took apart our men?
DOC_1 We don't know yet, soldier.
RILEY What's the holdup? I thought Graham gave you a full description.
DOC_1 The holdup is that he described characteristics present in over 40 known varieties of demon. So we're cross-checking DNA evidence - hair, fibers-
RILEY And how long is that gonna take?
DOC_1 I have no idea.
RILEY I don't need a bunch of tests to know that this thing's a killer.
RILEY Hey, he's coming to. Oz!
DOC_1 He won't be able to talk for a while. We gave him Haldol to keep him quiet.
RILEY Why? He's not a threat now.
DOC_1 I allowed you to stay as long as you let us do our work, Agent Finn. Only Colonel Macnamara can place a cease order on medical testing, and he's told us to proceed.
DOC_2 I always suspected that stuff about werewolf transformations being based on a lunar cycle was campfire talk..)
RILEY Oh, hey, that's enough. Come on, the guy's a student, I know him.
DOC_1 Take him out.
COMMANDO_3 Yes sir.
DOC_2 See that? Transformation related to negative stimulation.
BUFFY Something's wrong. Riley usually returns my phone calls by now.
XANDER We can't wait much longer.
BUFFY I know. Okay. Xander, you and I are gonna go in. We've done it before.
WILLOW I'm going with you.
BUFFY No. Look, it's too dangerous, Will. Besides, I need you to help Giles hack into the city's electrical grid. We've gotta try to power down the Initiative.
WILLOW Giles can do it without me. I can give him all the instructions, I can show him exactly what to do.
GILES Of course.
WILLOW I-I can't just sit here.
BUFFY Okay. Okay, you can back us up. Now, the only way I know into the Initiative is through the elevator in the Lowell House. But my clearance is long gone.
XANDER So we grab a guy, make him take us.
SPIKE Or you could just use the back way.
SPIKE Hell of a lot less bother.
GILES How did you get in?
SPIKE Door was unlocked. You might wanna watch that, Rupert. Someone dangerous could get in.
BUFFY Or someone formerly dangerous and currently annoying.
SPIKE Now, now. None of that. Or I won't help you get Red's mongrel back. Bad news travels fast with us demons. We all like a good laugh.
GILES Short of cash, Spike?
SPIKE I happen to be seeking monetary gratification, yeah. But I also get a kick out of jackin' up those army ginks myself. I know how to find the big guy who can take you to Oz.
BUFFY Uh-huh. So what's the going rate on a wild goose chase, Spike?
SPIKE Fine, if you're not interested. But I was stuck in that hole, remember? And I've heard things from other guys who've ogtten out. I can get you in. No alarms, no cameras ... no waiting.
RILEY Oz. Put these on, man.
FORREST End of the line.
COLONEL At ease.
RILEY Permission to speak, Colonel.
COLONEL Denied.
COLONEL Being new around here, Finn, I had a look at your record and Professor Walsh's notes. Until recently, you were an exemplary soldier headed straight for the top. Then you meet this girl, this ... slayer, and suddenly you begin to exhibit signs of disloyalty. You abuse your command. But tonight... To release a lethal HST back into the population -
RILEY Sir, the prisoner-
COLONEL You will speak when I tell you to!
COLONEL Tomorrow I am going to institute a court-martial to investigate the extent of your involvement with the Slayer and her band of freaks. They're anarchists, Finn ... too backwards for the real world. You help us take them down, and you just might save your military career. Otherwise, you'll go to your grave labeled a traitor.
COLONEL No woman is worth that.
BUFFY I've mentioned how much I'm gonna kill you if this is a scam, right?
SPIKE Look, would I wear this if I wasn't on the up-and-up?
WILLOW You do sorta look like an evil olive.
XANDER Guys... check it out.
SPIKE For a nasty town like Sunnydale, nobody seems to mind their locks.
BUFFY You first.
GILES Try typing in.... X-H-4-J-7 for the emergency shutdown command. That covers the entire electrical grid for the university and outlying area.
ANYA Slap my hand now!
GILES Beg your pardon?
ANYA In celebration.
GILES Oh... Yes.
ANYA Ow!
BUFFY Hey!
BUFFY You know who I am?
COLONEL Yeah.
BUFFY Then you know I'm pretty good with this thing. Take us to him.
Colonel Finn stays in the brig. Helping an HST escape is a court-martial offense. You're only gonna make matters worse.
BUFFY Riley tried to help Oz escape?
COLONEL That's who you came for. The wolf.
XANDER Guess we're two for one.
BUFFY Get dressed.
GUARD Hey, you dropped-
RILEY How'd you get in?
BUFFY Talk later. Stealthy escape now.
RILEY Buffy... I leave now, I can't ever come back.
RILEY I just wanted to hear that out loud.
VOICE Hold it!
BUFFY Stay back... or I'll pull a William Burroughs on your leader here.
XANDER You'll bore him to death with free prose?
BUFFY Was I the only one awake in English that day? I'll kill him. Get him out.
WILLOW Oz....
OZ Will, get back.
BUFFY Let's go.
COLONEL You're a dead man, Finn.
RILEY No, sir. I'm an anarchist.
BUFFY I hope everybody else is okay. It was better to split up, right? I mean, we're just too findable in a big clump.
RILEY It was better. Besides, I think it's mostly me the Initiative wants now.
BUFFY Probably. So what should we do?
RILEY We'll be safe for tonight at least. The campus is still blacked out, so that oughta slow the Initiative down. I'll - figure out my next move tomorrow.
BUFFY Quite a day, huh?
BUFFY You woke up to a big bowl of Wheaties. Now you're a fugitive.
RILEY I don't know. I'm sorry it ended that way. But I am glad it's done. I'm glad I know where I stand, finally.
RILEY I was wrong about Oz. I *was* being a bigot.
BUFFY No you weren't. You were thrown. You found out that Willow was in... kind of an unconventional relationship, and it gave you a momentary wiggins. It happens.
RILEY Still... I was in a totally black and white space, people versus monsters, and it ain't like that... especially when it comes to love.
BUFFY I have to tell you some stuff... about my past. And it's not all stuff that you're gonna like.
RILEY You can tell me anything.
BUFFY I think so. I think I can.
WILLOW This thing looks pretty good, considering you drove it overseas.
OZ Well, it broke down outside of Mexico, and I traded my bass to have it fixed and garaged.
OZ I shouldn't have come back now.... I just thought I'd changed.
WILLOW You have changed. You stopped the wolf from coming out. I saw it.
OZ But I couldn't look at you. I mean, it turns out... the one thing that brings it out in me is you... which falls under the heading of ironic in my book.
WILLOW It was my fault. I upset you.
OZ Well, so we're safe then, cause you'll never do that again.
OZ But... you're happy?
WILLOW I am. I can't explain it-
OZ It may be safer for both os us if you don't.
WILLOW I missed you, Oz. I wrote you so many letters... but I didn't have any place to send them, you know?
WILLOW I couldn't live like that.
OZ It was stupid to think that you'd just be... waiting.
WILLOW I was waiting. I feel like some part of me will always be waiting for you. Like if I'm old and blue-haired, and I turn the corner in Istanbul and there you are, I won't be surprised. Because... you're with me, you know?
OZ I know. But now is not that time, I guess.
WILLOW No.
WILLOW What are you gonna do?
OZ I think I better take off.
WILLOW When?
OZ Pretty much now.
WILLOW No candles? Well, I brought one. It's extra flamey.
WILLOW Tara, I have to tell you...
TARA No, I-I understand. You have to be with the person you l-love.
WILLOW I am.
TARA You mean...
WILLOW I mean. Okay?
TARA Oh, yes.
WILLOW I feel horrible about everything I put you through. A-and I'm gonna make it up to you. Starting right now.
TARA Right now?
EXECUTIVE_PRODUCER JOSS WHEDON End.
