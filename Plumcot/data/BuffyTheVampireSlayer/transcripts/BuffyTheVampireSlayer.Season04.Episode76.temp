Mr._Ward And the men?
McNamara These are exceptional boys. Their capture ratiojust keeps increasing. *They're* keeping it together. Morale's aproblem. The death of Professor Walsh. The escape of the prototype. Controlling the HSTs is getting harder. We have serious overcrowdingin the containment areas.
Mr._Ward Quite a mess.
McNamara It's not my mess, sir. I'm just holding the fortwhile you figure out what you want to do with the place.
Mr._Ward This incident with Finn was unfortunate.
McNamara Fell in with a bad crowd. Quite frankly, I don'tthink he was ever the soldier that you all hoped he was. Boy thinkstoo much.
Mr._Ward Nevertheless, we want him back. The government'sinvested a sub
McNamara We'll catch up to him. My feeling is . . he won'tstray too far from the girl.
Mr._Ward Yes, uh . . . Buffy Summers. Our data banks don't havemuch on her.
McNamara She's just a girl.
Spike She's a lot more than that.
Spike The Slayer's dangerous is all I'm saying.
ADAM Yes. She makes things interesting.
Spike No. See? You're not getting it, Mr. Bits. You're gonna be interestingly dead. Little Miss Tiny's gota habit of bollixing up the plans of every would-be, unstoppablebad-ass who sets foot in this town.
Spike Just want you to know, when the big ugly goes down, theSlayer's gonna be right in the thick of it. You ready for that?
ADAM I'm counting on it.
ADAM Two Slayers.
Spike That's right.
ADAM And you killed them both?
Spike Yeah. I killed the hell out of them.
ADAM Yet you fear this one?
Spike Hey, watch it, mate. I don't fear anything. Just know my enemies.
ADAM Do you? Then why haven't you killed this Slayer yet?
Spike Because . . . Stinking, rotten luck is why. On top of that, now I got this buggering chip up my head.
ADAM Yes. Your behavior modification circuitry. Iknow what you feel.
Spike Not likely.
ADAM You feel smothered. Trapped like an animal. Pure in its ferocity, unable to actualize the urges within. Clingingto one truth. Like a flame struggling to burn within an enclosedglass. That a beast this powerful cannot be contained. Inevitablyit will break free and savage the land again. I will make you wholeagain. Make you savage.
Spike Wow. I mean, *yeah*. I get whythe demons all fall in line with you. You're like Tony Robbins. If he was a big scary . . Frankenstein looking You'reexactly like Tony Robbins.
ADAM I will restore you to what you once were. WhenI have the Slayer . . . how and where I want her.
Spike Easier said. She's crafty. Her and her littlefriends.
ADAM Friends?
Spike There's your what do you call it variable. TheSlayer's got pals. You want her evening the odds in a fight you don'twant the Slayerettes mucking about.
ADAM Take them away from her.
Spike Now there's a plan. She's working solo, she won'thave a chance to come after us when the wild rumpus begins.Plus, it will make her miserable. And I never get tired of that.
Spike Yeah. Leave `em to me.
ADAM You can't hurt them. What can you do to make surethey're out of the picture?
Spike Not a blessed thing. They're gonna do it for me.
Riley Do you know if she's back yet?
Xander L.A. Woman? Haven't heard from her. She'llprobably come here first thing, though. Hey, who's your buddy?
Xander So you don't have to be G.I. Joe while your civvies aregetting washed.
Xander Try those on. You'll feel like a new man.
Riley Would this man have a bright red nose and big, floppy feet?
Riley Hey, I'm sorry. That's the cabin fever talking.
Xander But as post-apocalypse-splendor goes . . .
Riley I've done wonders with the place.
Xander Yeah.
Riley Still . . The sooner Buffy gets back, the better I'll feel.
Xander You and me both, big guy.
Riley I take it you're not an Angel fan either?
Xander Well, it's not like I hate the guy. Just, you know. . the guts part of him.
Riley Can't blame you. But to be fair, it's not him youhate. It's the curse.
Riley Right?
Xander What did Buffy tell you?
Riley On Angel? Everything. More than I wanted toknow sometimes. She loved him. He turned evil. He, uh,killed people. She cured him. He left. Interesting littlecurse.
Xander One moment's happiness.
Riley What do you mean?
Xander You know, it's his trigger. Angel's an okay guyif he's mopey and sad and brooding, but if you give him even one secondof pure, real pleasure . . .
Riley And that sets him off.
Xander Only in the big ol kill your friends kind of way. And you know what makes Angel happiest? I'll give you a hint. It not creme brulee.
Riley Buffy.
Riley Sex with Buffy.
Xander She . . . kind of left that part out, huh?
Riley Yeah, she did. That explains a lot of things that. . I wish weren't explained.
Xander Hey, man. That's all ancient history.
Riley She went running to L.A. to bone up on her history.
Xander No! I'm sure it's boneless. She just needsto make sure everything's okay. She's probably back already.
Riley Maybe.
Xander You'll feel a lot better when you see her.
Riley I guess we'll see.
Giles If I leave here tomorrow/
Giles Would you still remember me?/
Giles Well I must be traveling on now/ There's too many placesI've got to see/
Giles And if I stay here with you girl/ Things just couldn'tbe the same/
Giles 'Cause I'm as free as bird now
Spike You know, for someone who's got Watcher on his resume', youmight want to cast an eye to the front door every now and again.
Giles What do you want?
Spike Ah. Knew I leftone. Buffy around?
Giles Why?
Spike I need to speak to the lady of the house. Hey, bea pet and give her a message for me, would you? Tell her I just mighthave something she just might want.
Giles And what might that something be?
Spike Information. Highly classified. Not cheap word-on-the-streetprattle either. I'm talking about the good stuff now.
Giles Thrill me.
Spike It's nothing I know. What, you think I'd come runningover saying I've got a secret, beat me till I talk? There's filesin the Initiative. I'm pretty sure I know where.
Giles Files?
Spike Yeah. Secrets.
Spike Mission statements. Design schematics. Allof Maggie Walsh's dirty laundry, which I guess would include lots of tidbitsabout
Giles Adam.
Spike Well, yeah. Say someone were to risk his life andlimb well, limb anyway to obtain said files. It might be wortha little something.
Giles A-at . . this point a cynical person might think that you'reoffering just what we need when we need it most.
Spike That person'd be right, Rupert. Supply and demand. And it won't be cheap this time.
Giles What do you want?
Spike Hmm, year supply of blood, guaranteed protection, merrybushels of cash, and, most important . . . a guarantee that I'm not tobe in anyway slain.
Giles Done.
Spike With a smile and a nod from you? Sorry. Notclose to good enough. This deal's with the Slayer.
Giles I'll tell her.
Spike Oh, you'll tell her! Great comfort that. Whatmakes you think she'll listen to you?
Giles Because . . .
Spike Very convincing.
Giles I'm her Watcher.
Spike I think you're neglecting the past-tense there, Rupert. Besides, she barely listened to you when you were in charge. I'veseen the way she treats you.
Giles Oh, yes? And how's that?
Spike Very much like a retired librarian.
Spike Look, I've got what she wants as long as she has what Iwant.
Spike Spread the word. She knows where to find me.
Giles I'll think about it.
Willow Oh. I keep thinking Okay, that's the cutest thingever, and then she does something cuter and completely resets the wholescale.
Tara Did you see her yawn earlier?
Willow Yes! I thought I was going to die.
Willow Oh, I love you, Miss Kitty Fantastico!
Tara We got to get her a real name.
Willow It's so cool that she's ours. Uh, yours. That she's yours is-is cool.
Tara She can be ours if you want?
Tara You still need an elective. Howabout . . Sophomore Level Psychology?
Willow Oh. Kinda psyched out since Professor Walsh. Maybe something fun like drama. I could be dramatic.
Willow You cannot have more catnip! Youhave a catnip problem!
Tara Definitely drama.
Willow I haven't even dealt with the housing situation yet. Have you done anything? I hear there some off-campus places thatare way cool for groups to, you know, go in on.
Tara Oh, I just figured you'd be dorming it up with Buffy again.
Willow Well, we haven't really talked about it. I usedto assume we'd be roomies through grad school well into little old ladyhood. You know, cheating at bingo together and forgetting to take our pills.
Tara But?
Willow But . . . I don't know. It hardly feels like we'reroomies now. I mean, she's busy with Riley and I'm gone a lot too.
Willow I guess I should ask her.
Buffy Riley.
Riley I got a little tired of sitting around waiting, so . ..
Buffy You joined the circus?
Riley Xander took my clothes to clean `em and left me these.Does he, uh, hate me in some way I don't know about yet? I think I would've attracted less attention in my uniform.
Buffy Is it okay for you to be here?
Riley You tell me.
Buffy I just meant with the government branch hunting you downand all.
Riley I'm good.
Riley And, uh, it took me a while, but I patched into their frequency.Can't sneak up on a guy if he'slistening in.
Buffy You're the sneakiest.
Riley Why they hired me.
Riley You okay?
Buffy Yeah. I just Angel kind of upset me.
Riley How?
Buffy It's not that interesting.
Riley Got my attention.
Buffy He just spun my head a little.
Riley You don't want to talk about it.
Buffy It's just deconstructing Angel can wait. Right now,I just want to get out there and patrol and-and find Adam. We cantalk about it . . later.
Riley It's the pants, isn't it? It's okay. I couldn'ttake me seriously in these things either.
Buffy Riley, it's not that big a deal.
Riley Tell you what, why don't I get out of your face? You had a long trip.
Buffy Look, you don't have to go.
Riley It's okay. Besides . . heh. I have to recharge them every two hours or they go dead on me.
Buffy Okay.
Xander Here. You should've just saved the ensemble fromthe last time we snuck into the Initiative.I'm not a clothing delivery service.
Anya Well, he is, kinda. He did Riley yesterday.
Spike Hello. This is just . . . swell.
Spike Gotta say . . liking this quite a lot.
Spike Kinda changes the balances of powOWW!!
Spike Akk! Oh, come on! You got to be kidding?
Anya Wow. That chip in your head meansyou can't even point a gun. How humiliating.
Xander Doesn't work anyway. It's a fake.
Anya Can't even point a decorative gun?
Xander Give it up for a American chipmanship.
Spike It doesn't work? What about self-defense? I'mtaking a risk here, you know?
Xander Can I tell you how much I really . . don't care?
Spike Say, I hope you getone of those toughs-as-nails drill sergeants who's only hard on the menbecause he's trying to keep them alive when the bullets start flying. I love that stuff.
Xander Boot camp? Yeah. Like I'd go there.
Spike What, you changed your mind? Not gonna join?
Anya You're joining the Army!?
Xander Okay, one Ow. Two Where'd you get thatidea? Three OW! I'm not joining the army!
Anya Oh, good. Stopped that nonsense just in time.
Xander I was never
Xander Who'd you hear this from?
Spike Oh, your girlie-mates were talking. Something about,uh, being all you can be. Or all *you* can be. And having laugh. Figured you were signing up. Say, have you got anything larger inthe . . toy gun line?
Xander All I can Canyou believe this!? Like I'm some sort of useless lunk. It happensI'm good at a lot of things. I help out with all kinds of . . . stuff. I have skills . . . and . . . stratagems. I'm very . . .Help me out.
Anya He's Viking in the sack.
Spike Terrific. Youdidn't have these cleaned after the last time, did you?
Xander This is so like them, lately. It's all about themand the college life. Well, you know what college is? It'shigh school only without the actual going to class. Well . . highschool was kinda like that too. But the point is, I'm out there workinghard to make a living. It's nothing but a huge joke to them. Xander got fired from Starbucks. Xander got fired from that phone-sexline.
Anya They look down on you.
Xander And they hate you.
Anya But they don't look down on me.
Spike Hey, it was just a laugh. There's no need to go insaneover it.
Xander Is anybody talking to you?
Spike Sir, no sir.
Forrest Don't shoot.
Buffy Give me a reason not to?
Forrest You're killing humans now?
Buffy Not yet. Beating you senseless shoulddo just fine.
Forrest I can have a patrol here in under a minute. Sohere's the plan: you go you're way, I'll go mine.
Buffy I'm checking out that cave.
Forrest My orders exactly.
Buffy Alone?
Forrest We're spread a little thin, so yeah. Family's tearingapart.
Buffy Family. What kind of family are you? Corleones.
Forrest We weren't until you showed up.
Buffy What? No girls in the club?
Forrest You think you're the first girlfriend Riley's ever had?Such a big headon that skinny little body. No. You're justthe first one to get him to commit treason. Riley had a career. And a future till he met you. And, yeah, I got a problem with that.
Buffy A future? A future doing what?Illegal experiments. Torture. Murder. I guess killing someoneisn't really a problem for you.
Forrest Less and less. And why don't you get the hell outof here before I
Buffy Touch me and you'll find out what Slayer strength islike.
Forrest I think it's about time you showed me then.
ADAM Yes.
ADAM I think that would be interesting.
Buffy Get out of here!
Forrest Not moving.
ADAM Thank you.
Buffy Go! Get out!
Buffy NO!
Buffy Oh, God.
Spike I think I lost the buggers.
Willow Any luck with the disks?
Spike Took what they had. Should be somethinguseful on one of them.
Willow Hope so.
Tara What are we looking for?
Willow Anything about Adam.
Giles Were there any problems getting in and out?
Spike No. I mean, a couple of them made me on the way out,but I took care of `em.
Giles Gave them a good running-away-from-them, did you?
Spike Well, yeah. When do I get paid?
Giles When Willow tells me you've brought us something useful.
Spike I could've gone straight to the Slayer, you know? I cut you in, let you pretend you're actually in charge, now you'vegot to wait for Red's permission to finish the deal?
Giles As soon as we see what's on the disks.
Tara It looks like gibberish.
Spike Gibberish?
Willow They're encrypted.
Giles Oh, wonderful.
Spike Can you fix `em?
Willow Crack a government encryption code on my laptop? Easy as really difficult pie. Why?
Spike You're not exactly the whiz these days either. God, I'm never gonna get paid.
Willow I am a whiz.
Tara She is a whiz.
Willow If every a whiz there was. I-I just need some time.
Spike No. I just heard you weren't . . . Your mates said you weren't playing with computersso much. Into the new thing.
Willow What new thing?
Spike You know, you two. The whole wicca thing.
Willow They-they were talking about that?
Spike Can we get back to business here? I've got a dealat stake.
Willow What did they say?
Spike Talking about, you know, it's a phase. You'll get over it.
Willow What? Who said that? Was it Buffy?'Cause . . . you know what she means by that.
Spike No, she was defending you. 'Cause Xander said youwere just being trendy.
Willow Trendy?
Spike I don't know what they were going on about. A personwants be a witch, that's their business.
Willow I knew Buffy was freaked.
Tara You should talk to her, 'cause I'm sure she
Spike Pressing business, ladies. Don'twant to get sidetracked. Still got your monstersto fight.
Lieutenant Cell capacity maxed out three days ago, sir. We keep up this pace they'll be nowhere left to contain the hostiles.
McNamara They're animals, lieutenant. We pack them inuntil we're out of room and then we pack them in some more.
Lieutenant They're going to start tearing each other apart,sir.
McNamara I have no problem with that scenario.
Commando Back-up team! Request immediate back-up! Over! They're tearing us apart over here! Two men down! From out of nowhere! Mayday! Repeat! Mayday!
Commando Team Epsilon requesting immediateback-up! We're in the alley behind the school building! Wherethe hell is Fall back! Fall back! It's coming
Angel Riley Finn.
Riley I know you?
Angel We have a friend in common.
Riley Angel.
Angel Welcoming committee your idea?
Riley Way I heard it. You were all peaceable now. You didn't by any chance go and lose that pesky soul again, did you?
Angel Don't push me, boy.
Riley Now what possibly could've happened with Buffy thatwould make you lose your soul?
Angel That'd be between me and her.
Riley Where do you think you're going?
Angel Going to see an old girlfriend.
Riley Oh, you really think I'm gonna let that happen?
Angel You think you're gonna stop me?
Riley I surely do.
Buffy Angel.
Angel Hi. Can I come in?
Buffy I guess.
Angel Uh, I need a little more than that.
Buffy Oh. Um . . . come in.
Buffy You're hurt.
Angel You too.
Buffy I'll live.
Buffy You want to tell me who ran your face into that doorknob?
Angel Not really. It's not world-in-peril stuff.
Buffy Let me guess. You thought of somethingelse really hurtful to say and, well, you couldn't tell me on the phonebecause the funniest part is that look on my face
Angel Buffy, please. I really don't have a lot of time.
Buffy What's going on?
Riley I told you you weren't coming near her.
Buffy You've got to be kidding me. This is why you came?
Angel No. This was accident.
Buffy Running a car into a tree is an accident! Running your fist into somebody's face is a plan! Please, explainthis to me!
Angel Put that gun down.
Riley It's pretty much all I got left, so I'm thinking not. He attacked four of my men, Buffy. I think he's up to his old tricks.
Buffy He won't hurt anybody. Tell him.
Angel Might hurt you.
Riley Please try.
Angel Heh. Some threat. You can barely stand.
Riley Trigger finger feels okay.
Angel You actually sleep with this guy?
Buffy Okay, stop it!
Buffy Okay, that's enough! I see one more display of testosteronepoisoning and I will personally put you both in the hospital!
Buffy Anybody think I'm exaggerating?
Angel He started
Buffy Riley.
Riley I'm sorry. Just wanted to know that youwere safe.
Buffy I need to talk to Angel for a minute.
Riley What?
Buffy Riley, please.
Riley I'm not leaving this room.I mean it.
Riley Not moving a muscle.
Buffy Okay. I come to see you, to help you, and you treatme like I'm just . . . your ex.
Angel Well, technically
Buffy Shut up! And then you order me out of *your* cityand then you come here and start pounding on my boyfriend?! I would reallylike to know what the HELL are you trying to do?!.
Angel I was trying to make things better.
Angel Heh. Well. It's a . . . going prettygood, don't you think?
Buffy Swell.
Angel You know heh. I couldn't leave it like that. The way I spoke to you I came to apologize. I . . I had no right.
Buffy And Riley?
Angel I got jumped by some soldiers. He came in in themiddle. And wasn't real forthcoming with the benefit of the doubt.
Buffy Put yourself in his place.
Angel I get it.
Buffy Look . . . You weren't entirely wrong, what you said inL.A. We don't live in each other's worlds anymore. I had no right to barge in on yours and make judgments.
Angel I'm still sorry.
Buffy Thank you.
Angel And, next time . . I'll apologize by phone. Uh, things are pretty tense around here.
Buffy They really are.
Angel Can I do anything?
Buffy Honestly . . . I think the best thing you can do rightnow is
Angel Okay.
Buffy It means a lot that you came.
Angel Oh, and . . . Riley.
Buffy Yeah?
Angel I don't like him.
Buffy Thank you.
Spike Now that . . . wasfun!
ADAM You were successful?
Spike Easier than I'd thought it'd be, too.
ADAM You're sure?
Spike Feel it in my bones. It's, uh . .called the Yoko Factor.
Spike Don't tell me you've never heard of the Beatles?
ADAM I have. I like Helter Skelter.
Spike What a surprise. The point is, they were once a realpowerful group. It's not a stretch to say they ruled the world. And when they broke up everyone blamed Yoko, but the fact is the groupsplit itself apart, she just happened to be there. And you know howit is with kids. They go off to college, they grow apart. Wayof the world.
ADAM So you separated the Slayer from her friends. I'mpleased.
Spike Well . . since we've got all our ducks in a row and nottalking to each other . . guess it's time for the grand plan, huh? You know the one where I get the chipectomy. You got everything youneed, right?
ADAM No. There's one more thing.
Buffy How bad are you hurt?
Riley Dunno yet. Night's still young.
Buffy Riley, I have to tell you something.
Riley Figured.
Buffy Maybe you want to sit down.
Riley I'm fine.
Buffy Riley, I
Riley Wait. Me first.
Riley Buffy . . . I feel like we've gotten really close. At least I thought we had. I don't know much about Angel or your relationship with him . . but . . . all I ask is . .if you're gonna break heart, do it fast.
Buffy What? You think that Angel and I . . .
Riley Didn't you?
Buffy No. Of course not. How can you even ask methat?
Riley I don't know. Xander said
Buffy Xander?! Oh, he's the deadest man in Deadonia.
Riley No. It's not his fault. I prodded and he explainedhow Angel went bad. The, uh, trigger.
Buffy Oh.
Riley And, uh after that, I went a little nuts! You know? I mean . . . On the one hand . . I should believe in us. But on the other . . Sometimes things happen between exes and when I sawthat he was bad. . .
Buffy He's . . not bad.
Riley Seriously? That's . . a good day? Well, there you go. Even when he's good he'sall Mister . . Billowy Coat King of Pain and girls really
Buffy Riley, stop.
Riley See? Nuts.
Buffy Have I ever given you any reason to feel that you can'ttrust me?
Riley No.
Buffy Then why with the crazy?
Riley Because I'm so in love with you I can't thinkstraight.
Buffy Tell me about it.
Buffy Riley. I still have to tell you something. And there's no easy way
Riley Just say it.
Buffy Forrest is dead.
Buffy I'm so sorry. There was a fight. Adam killedhim. I barely got away. I know that there's nothing I can saythat's gonna make this better. But we will find this thing and destroyit.
Riley I have to go.
Buffy Are you sure?
Riley I have to go now.
Willow It's still encrypted.
Tara Well, Willow's working really hard on it.
Buffy Okay, well, how long before you . . un-crypt it?
Willow Hours. Days maybe. Anyone suggesting monthswould not be accused of crazy talk.
Giles What ever happened to Latin? At least when that madeno sense, the church approved.
Buffy I can't just wait around, Will. Thedisk is no good to me unless you crack it soon.
Anya Hey! We worked really hard getting that. Xanderdelivered clothing.
Giles Church approved.
Buffy Sorry, you guys, but we're on a clock here. Okay,Adam was at that cave so maybe he was there for a reason? I-I canIcan go back, scope it out, track him if I have to.
Willow Right. Buffy, you can't go back alone.
Giles You never train with me anymore. He's gonna kickyour ass.
Buffy Giles.
Giles Sorry. Was it a bit honest? Terriblysorry.
Xander So she doesn't go alone. Giles, weaponsall around.
Buffy You're not going, Xander.
Buffy Y-you'd get hurt.
Xander Oh. Okay. You and Willowgo do the superpower thing, I'll stay behind and putt around the Batcavewith crusty old Alfred here.
Giles Ah-ah, no. I am no Alfred, sir. No, you forget. Alfred had a job.
Buffy Willow is not going either. I'm doing it alone.
Willow Oh, great. And then when you have yournew no arms we can all say Gee, it's a good thing we weren't there gettingin the way of that!
Xander Right! Maybe we can help in other ways?Want some fighting pants, Buff? I can get ya some new fighting pants!
Buffy You guys, this isn't helping.
Willow Oh, wow! We're already getting in the way. We're pretty good at this, Xander, huh?
Xander Right. I'm so good at it you might have to shipme off to the Army to get me out of the way!
Buffy The Army?
Xander You didn't think I knew about that, did you? Youtwo talking about me behind my back.
Buffy Us talking about *you*? How about you telling Rileyevery last detail of my life with Angel?
Willow And besides, when is there any us two? You twoare the two who are the two. I'm the other one.
Xander Uh-huh. But maybe that all changes when I'm doingsit-ups over at Fort Dix?
Giles Fort Dix?
Buffy Are you drunk?
Giles Yes. Quite a bit, actually.
Buffy Well, stop it! This is stupid.
Xander Stupid? So you finally have the guts to say it tomy face?
Buffy I didn't say you were stupid! So . . stop being anidiot and let me fix this!
Buffy Okay, I need you. I need both of you. All thetime! Just . . not now. Adam is very dangerous.
Willow Wait. How do you need me, really?
Buffy You're . . good with the computer stuff. And-and there's the witch stuff.
Willow Witch stuff? What exactly do you mean bywitch stuff?
Buffy You guys, what is happening? This is crazy!
Giles Oh, no, it's not. It's all finallymaking perfect sense and I'm not going to miss a moment of it.
Tara You think this will go on for a while?
Anya Hard to say.
Tara Nice bathroom.
Anya Like the tile.
Xander And if I did join the Army, I'd be great! You knowwhy? 'Cause they might give me a job that couldn't be done by anywell-trained border collie.
Giles That's it. I'm going to bed.
Willow No, you'd do wonderful in the Army. Hey, do youthink the umbilical cord between you and Anya can stretch that far?
Xander I knew it! I knew you hated her!
Willow Look, I'm not the one being judgmental here. I'llleave that territory to you and Buffy.
Buffy Judgmental? If I was anymore open-minded about thechoices you two make my whole brain would fall out!
Xander Oh! And superior. Don't forget that.Just because you're better than us doesn't mean that you canbe all superior!
Buffy You guys, stop this! What happened to you today?
Willow It's not today! Buffy, things have been wrong fora while! Don't you see that?
Buffy What do you mean wrong?
Willow Well, they certainly haven't been right, since Tara. We have to face it. You can't handle Tara being my girlfriend.
Xander No! It was bad before that! Tara's yourgirlfriend?
Giles Bloody hellll!
Buffy Enough! All I know is you want to help, right? Be part of the team?
Willow I don't know anymore.
Xander Really not wanted.
Buffy No! No, you said you wanted to go. So let's go! All of us. We'll walk into that cave with youtwo attacking me and the funny drunk drooling on my shoe! Hey! Hey, maybe that's the secret way of killing Adam?!
Xander Buffy . . .
Buffy Is that it? Is that how you can help?You're not answering me! How can you possibly help?
Buffy So . . . I guess I'm starting to understand why there'sno ancient prophecy about a Chosen One . . and her friends.
Buffy If I need help, I'll go to someone I can count on.
ADAM I've been waiting for you.
Riley And now I'm here.
