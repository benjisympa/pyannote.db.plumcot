Buffy The Initiative created this thing and they can't stop it, but we will.
Giles_Voiceover Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer... Overhead shot of Willow, Giles, and Xander doing the spell in Primeval.
Willow_Voiceover Power of the slayer and all who wield it, last to ancient first, we invoke thee. Giles lighting a candle.
Willow Make us mind and heart and spirit join. Shot of Willow's hand laying down a Tarot-sized card.
Willow Spiritus, the spirit. Shot of Xander laying down another card.
Xander Animus, heart. Shot of Giles laying down another card.
Giles Sophus, mind. Shot of Willow holding the last card.
Buffy And Manus, the hand. Shot of Buffy with bullets dissolving in front of her.
Buffy You could never hope to grasp the source of our power. Buffy reaching into Adam's chest and pulling out his power supply. Adam falling over dead.
BUFFY Are you sure you'll be all right? Cause I can be there in the morning.
RILEY It's just a debriefing.
RILEY They're not gonna make me disappear, and they're not pinning anything on me. I got Graham and a lot of the guys testifying I'm the reason they're alive. I might actually get out of this with an honorable discharge.
GILES In return for your silence, no doubt.
RILEY Oh yeah. Having the inside scoop on the administration's own Bay of Mutated Pigs is definitely an advantage.
WILLOW It's like you're blackmailing the government. In a ... patriotic way.
RILEY I'll call you when it's over.
XANDER Dinner is served.
XANDER And my very own recipe.
WILLOW Ooh, you pushed the button on the microwave that says popcorn?
XANDER Actually, I pushed defrost, but, um, Joyce was there in the clinch.
RILEY Well, you guys have fun tonight. It was very nice meeting you.
JOYCE It was nice meeting you ... finally.
RILEY Bye.
BUFFY Bye.
JOYCE Did you notice how pointedly I said finally?
BUFFY No.
XANDER Let the vid-fest begin.
GILES You sure you won't join us?
JOYCE No, you guys have your fun. I'm tired. I can't believe you're not exhausted. Have you even slept since...
GILES Still feel a little bit too wired.
WILLOW Mm. Yeah, that spell, that was, that was powerful.
BUFFY Don't think I *could* sleep.
XANDER Well, we got plenty of vids. And I'm putting in a preemptive bid for Apocalypse Now, huh?
WILLOW Did you get anything less heart-of-darkness-y?
XANDER Apocalypse Now is a gay romp! It's the feel-good movie of whatever year it was.
BUFFY What else?
XANDER Don't worry. Got plenty of chick-and-British-guy flicks too. These puppies should last us all night.
TARA I think it's strange. I mean, I think I should worry that we haven't found her name.
WILLOW Who, Miss Kitty?
TARA You'd think she'd let us know her name by now.
WILLOW She will. She's not all grown yet.
TARA You're not worried?
WILLOW I never worry here. I'm safe here.
TARA You don't know everything about me.
WILLOW Have you told me your real name?
TARA Oh, you know that.
TARA They will find out, you know.
TARA About you.
WILLOW Don't have time to think about that. You know I have all this homework to finish.
TARA Are you gonna finish in time for class?
WILLOW I can be late.
TARA But you've never taken drama before.
TARA Might miss something important.
WILLOW I don't wanna leave here.
TARA Why not?
WILLOW It's so bright.
WILLOW And there's something out there. moving, then it's gone.)
XANDER Hey.
WILLOW Hey, guys.
OZ Heard you're taking drama.
WILLOW Uh-huh.
OZ It's a tough course.
WILLOW You took it?
OZ Oh, I've been here forever.
XANDER So whatcha been doin'? Doing spells? She does spells with Tara.
OZ Yeah, I heard about that.
WILLOW I'm gonna be late.
XANDER Sometimes I think about two women doing a spell ... and then I do a spell by myself.
HARMONY Isn't this exciting? Our first production! I can't wait till our scene! I love you! Oh! Don't step on my cues.
WILLOW Production? (We see Buffy peeking out through the curtain at the audience. She runs over to Willow and Harmony. She's dressed as the lead character in
Chicago short straight black hair, short tight black dress.)
BUFFY Ohmigod. The place is packed. Everybody's here! Your whole family's in the front row, and they look really angry.
WILLOW There's a production?
HARMONY Oh, somebody's got stage fright.
WILLOW Isn't this the first class?
RILEY Well, you showed up late, or you'd have a better part. I'm Cowboy Guy.
BUFFY Your costume is perfect. Nobody's gonna know the truth. You know, about you.
WILLOW Costume?
BUFFY You're already in character! Oh, I shoulda done that!
WILLOW But how come there's - I mean, I was given to understand that a drama class would have, you know ... drama class. I mean, we haven't even rehearsed!
HARMONY Well, maybe some people haven't.
RILEY I showed up on time, so I got to be Cowboy Guy.
WILLOW I just think it's really early to be putting on a play. I, I don't even know what... This isn't Madame Butterfly, is it, because I have a whole problem with opera.
GILES All right, everyone! Pay attention! In just a few moments that curtain is going to open on our very first production. Now, everyone that Willow's ever met ... is out in that audience, including all of us. That means we have to be perfect. Stay in character, remember your lines, and energy energy energy, especially in the musical numbers!
WILLOW Did anyone see that?
GILES Acting is not about behaving, it's about hiding. The audience wants to find you, strip you naked, and eat you alive, so hide. Stop that.
GILES Now, costumes, sets, um, the things that you, uh, you know, uh, you, um... you hold them, you touch them, uh, use them, um...
HARMONY Props?
GILES No.
RILEY Props?
GILES Yes! It's all about subterfuge. That's very annoying. Now go on out there, lie like dogs, and have a wonderful time. Now, if we can stay in focus, keep our heads, and if Willow can stop stepping on everyone's cues, I know this'll be the best production of Death of a Salesman we've ever done. Stop it. Good luck everyone! Break a leg!
BALD_MAN I've made a little space for the cheese slices.
TARA Things aren't going very well.
WILLOW No! This drama class is just ... I think they're really not doing things in the proper way, and now I'm in a play and my whole family's out there, and ... why is there a cowboy in Death of a Salesman anyway?
TARA You don't understand yet, do you?
WILLOW Is there something following me?
TARA Yes.
WILLOW Well, what, uh, what should I do? The, the play's gonna start soon, and I don't even know my lines.
TARA The play's already started. That's not the point.
RILEY Why, hello, little lady. Can I hold those milk pails for you?
HARMONY Why thank you, but they're not very heavy. Why have you come to our lonely small town, which has no post office and very few exports?
RILEY I've come looking for a man. A *sales*man.
TARA Everyone's starting to wonder about you. The real you. If they find out, they'll punish you, I ... I can't help you with that.
WILLOW Well, what should I ... what's after me? Is it something I-I was supposed to do? W-was I supposed to-
TARA Shh.
WILLOW What was that?
BUFFY But what else could I expect from a bunch of low-rent, no-account hoodlums like you? Hoodlums, yes, I mean you and your friends, your whole sex, throw 'em in the sea for all I care, throw 'em in and wait for the bubbles, men with your groping and spitting all groin no brain three billion of you passing around the same worn-out urge. Men! With your ... sales!
WILLOW Tara? Tara, okay, this really isn't fu-
BUFFY Will!
WILLOW Buffy! Oh god.
BUFFY Come on.
BUFFY Stay low. What did it look like?
WILLOW I don't know. I-I don't know what's after me.
BUFFY Well, you must have *done* something.
WILLOW No. I never do anything. I'm very seldom naughty. I, I just came to class, and, and the play was starting.
BUFFY Play is long over. Why are you still in costume?
WILLOW Okay, still having to explain wherein this is just my outfit.
BUFFY Willow, everybody already knows. Take it off.
WILLOW No. No. I need it.
BUFFY Oh, for god's sake, just take it off.
BUFFY That's better. It's much more realistic.
HARMONY See? Isn't everybody very clear on this now?
ANYA My god, it's like a tragedy.
OZ I tried to warn you.
ANYA It's exactly like a Greek tragedy. There should only be Greeks.
WILLOW My book report. This summer I, I read The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.
XANDER Oh, who cares?
WILLOW This book ha-has many themes...
WILLOW Help! Help me!
WILLOW Help me!
XANDER I'm awake. I'm good. Did I miss anything?
GILES Not very much at all really.
BUFFY Bunch of massacring.
TV_SOLDIER We gotta keep going, men. We gotta take that hill. Damn this war!
GILES I have to say, I really feel that Apocalypse Now is overrated.
XANDER No, no. It gets better.
TV_SOLDIER Men...
XANDER I remember that it gets better.
TV_SOLDIER Oh my god. What's happened to my men? Ahhh!
BUFFY Want some corn?
XANDER Butter flavor?
BUFFY New car smell.
XANDER Cool. What's her deal?
BUFFY Big faker.
GILES Oh, I'm beginning to understand this now. It's all about the journey, isn't it?
XANDER Well, thanks for making me have to pee.
BUFFY You don't need any help with that, right?
XANDER Got a system.
JOYCE Hey.
XANDER Hey Joyce. Mrs. Summers. We're not making too much noise down there, are we?
JOYCE Oh, no. Anyway, they all left a while ago.
XANDER Oh, I should probably go catch up.
JOYCE I've heard that before.
XANDER I move pretty fast. You know, a man's always after-
JOYCE Conquest?
XANDER I'm a conquistador.
JOYCE You sure it isn't comfort?
XANDER I'm a comfortador also.
JOYCE I do know the difference. I've learned about boys.
XANDER That's cool about you.
JOYCE It's very late.
JOYCE Would you like to rest for a while?
XANDER Um, yeah. I'd like you. I'm just ... gonna go to the bathroom first.
JOYCE Don't get lost.
XANDER Okay, I'm gonna find another bathroom.
XANDER I didn't *order* any vampires.
XANDER That's not the way out.
XANDER Hey, there you are.
BUFFY Are you sure it's us you were looking for?
SPIKE Giles here is gonna teach me to be a Watcher. Says I got the stuff.
GILES Spike's like a son to me.
XANDER That's good. I was into that for a while, but... I got other stuff goin' on.
XANDER You gotta have something. Gotta be with movin' forward.
BUFFY Like a shark.
XANDER Like a shark with feet and ... much less fins.
SPIKE And on land!
GILES Very good!
XANDER Buffy, are you sure you wanna play there?
XANDER It's a pretty big sandbox.
BUFFY I'm okay. It's not coming for me yet.
XANDER I just mean ... you can't protect yourself from ... some stuff.
BUFFY I'm way ahead of you, big brother.
XANDER Brother?
GILES Go on, put your back into it! A Watcher scoffs at gravity.
ANYA Do you know where you're going?
ANYA I've been thinking about getting back into vengeance.
XANDER Is that right?
ANYA Well, you know how I miss it. I'm so at loose ends since I quit. I think this is going to be a very big year for vengeance.
XANDER But ... isn't vengeance kind of ... vengeful?
ANYA You don't want me to have a hobby.
XANDER Not a vengeance hobby, no! It's dangerous. People can't do anything they want. Society has rules, and borders, and an end zone. It doesn't matter if-
XANDER Do you mind? I'm talking to my demon.
WILLOW Sorry.
TARA We just think you're really interesting.
XANDER Oh, I-I'm going places.
WILLOW I'm way ahead of you.
XANDER Is that right?
WILLOW Watch this.
TARA Do you wanna come in the back with us?
ANYA Oh, go on.
XANDER I don't have to.
ANYA I'll be fine. I think I've figured out how to steer by gesturing emphatically.
XANDER Girls?
XANDER I know what's up there!
BALD_MAN These ... will not protect you.
XANDER Giles.
GILES Xander, what are you doing here?
XANDER What's after me?
GILES It's because of what we did, I know that.
XANDER What we did?
GILES Hm. Now, the others have gone on ahead. Now, listen very carefully. Your life may depend on what I'm about to tell you. You need- GILES:
XANDER What? Go where? I don't understand.
GILES Ce n'est pas le temps pour des jeux.
ANYA Xander. Il faut que tu viens avec nous maintenant. On t'attends.
GILES C'est que j'ai vous dire.
XANDER Honey, I don't... I can't hear you.
ANYA C'est pas importante. Je t'escorte.
GILES Allons-y la.
XANDER W-wait! Where we going? Where? Hey! Let go! Hey!
MALE_VOICE Where are you from, Harris?
XANDER Well, the basement, mostly.
MALE_VOICE Were you born there?
XANDER Possibly.
VOICE I walked by your guidance counselor's office one time.
SNYDER A bunch of you were sitting there ... waiting to be shepherded.
SNYDER I remember it smelled like dead flowers. Like decay. Then it hit me. The hope of our nation's future is a bunch of mulch.
XANDER You know, I never got the chance to tell you how glad I was you were eaten by a snake.
SNYDER Where are you heading?
XANDER Well, I'm supposed to meet Tara and Willow.
XANDER And possibly Buffy's mom.
SNYDER Your time is running out.
XANDER No, I'm just trying to get away. There's ... something I can't fight.
SNYDER Are you a soldier?
XANDER I'm a comfortador.
SNYDER You're neither. You're a whipping boy. Raised by mongrels and set on a sacrificial stone.
XANDER I'm getting a cramp.
XANDER Giles, it's here!
GILES It's more serious than we thought.
XANDER Giles!
BUFFY I can fight anything. Right?
ANYA Maybe we should slap her.
XANDER Buffy?
XANDER That's not the way out.
VOICE What the hell is wrong with you?
DAD You won't come upstairs? What are you ... ashamed of us? Your mother's crying her guts out!
XANDER You don't understand.
DAD No. You don't understand. The line ends here with us, and you're not gonna change that.
DAD You haven't got the heart.
GILES_VOICEOVER You have to stop thinking.
GILES_VOICEOVER Let it wash over you.
BUFFY Don't you think it's a little old-fashioned?
GILES This is the way women and men have behaved since the beginning...
GILES ...before time. Now look into the light.
BUFFY Come on! Come on!
BUFFY We're gonna miss all the good stuff.
OLIVIA Does she always want to train this badly?
GILES Well, it appears she's never heard the fable about patience. (Buffy pulls them through crowds of people. Carnival booths, colorful lights.
OLIVIA Which one is that?
GILES The, the one about the fox, and the, uh, less patient fox.
BUFFY Here, I want to, I want to!
GILES Yes, go ahead.
VAMP I am a vampire!
GILES Buffy, you have a sacred birthright to protect mankind. Don't stick out your elbow.
VAMP I am a vampire!
VAMP Ahh, you staked me!
GILES I haven't got any treats.
OLIVIA For god's sake, Rupert, go easy on the girl.
GILES This is my business. Blood of the lamb and all that. Oh, now you're gonna get that all over your face.
GILES I know you.
SPIKE Hey!
SPIKE Come on! You're gonna miss everything!
GILES Don't push me around. You know I have a great deal to do.
SPIKE I've hired myself out as an attraction.
(Color_shot Giles staring at Spike, Olivia still crying in the background.)
GILES Sideshow freak?
(B&W;_shot Spike flips up the collar of his coat.)
SPIKE Well, at least it's showbiz.
(Color Giles moves forward, looks in confusion at Olivia, back in Spike's direction.)
GILES What am I supposed to do with all of this?
SPIKE You gotta make up your mind, Rupes.
SPIKE What are you wasting your time for?
(Color Giles turning to look at Spike again.)
SPIKE Haven't you figured it all out yet, with your enormous squishy frontal lobes?
(Color Giles walking across the crypt.)
GILES I still think Buffy should have killed you.
(B&W; Spike looks annoyed. He strikes a Jesus-on-the-cross pose. Very loud oohs, cameras flashing.)
(Color Giles walking through crypt. The bald man stops him.)
BALD_MAN I wear the cheese. It does not wear me.
GILES Honestly, you meet the most appalling sorts of people.
GILES I'm so sorry I'm late. There's a great deal going on. And all at once!
WILLOW Don't we know it. Only at death's door over here, look at Xander!
XANDER Got the sucking chest wound swingin'. I promised Anya I'd be there for her big night. Now I'll probably be pushing up daisies, in the sense of being in the ground underneath them and fertilizing the soil with decomposition.
ANYA Okay. A man ... walks into the office of a doctor. He's wearing on his head, um...
ANYA Wait, there's, there's a, there's a duck. Is that right?
MAN_IN_CROWD You suck!
ANYA Quiet! You'll miss the humorous conclusion.
GILES She's doing quite well.
WILLOW Do you know this is your fault?
GILES We have to think of the facts, Willow. I'm very busy. I have a gig myself, you know.
WILLOW Something's after us. It's, uh, like some primal ... some animal force.
GILES That used to be us.
XANDER Don't get linear on me now, man.
ANYA And ... then the duck tells the doctor that there's a man, that's attached to my ass.
ANYA See, it was the duck, and not the man that spoke.
WILLOW Rupert. You've gotta focus. You must have some kind of explanation. If we don't know what we're fighting, I don't think we stand a chance.
GILES It's strange, it's not like anything we've faced before.
GILES It seems familiar somehow. Of course!
GILES The spell we cast with Buffy Must have released Some primal evil that's come back seeking I'm not sure what Willow, look through the chronicles For some reference To a warrior beast
GILES I've got to warn Buffy There's every chance she might be next Xander, help Willow
GILES And try not to bleed on my couch I've just had it steam-cleaned.
GILES No, wait...
GILES Well, that was ... obvious.
GILES I know who you are.
GILES And I can defeat you ... with my intellect. I ... can cripple you with my thoughts. Of course, you underestimate me. You couldn't know.
GILES You never had a Watcher.
ANYA Buffy! Wake up!)
ANYA Buffy, you have to wake up right away!
BUFFY I'm not really in charge of these things.
ANYA Please wake up. Oh please.
BUFFY I need my beauty sleep. So stop it, okay?
BUFFY Faith and I just made that bed.
TARA For who?
BUFFY I thought you were here to tell me.
BUFFY The guys aren't here, are they? We were gonna hang out and, watch movies t-
TARA You lost them.
BUFFY No. No. I think they need me to find them.
BUFFY It's so late.
TARA Oh ... that clock's completely wrong. Here.. It has a picture of two hands crossed, one open, the other balled into a fist.)
BUFFY I'm never gonna use those.
TARA You think you know ... what's to come ... what you are. You haven't even begun.
BUFFY I think I need to go find the others. TARA Be back before dawn.
BUFFY Have you seen my friends? They wouldn't just disappear.
BUFFY Mom?
JOYCE Oh, hi, honey.
BUFFY Why are you living in the walls?
JOYCE Oh, sweetie, no, I'm fine here. Don't worry about me.
BUFFY It looks dirty.
JOYCE Well, it seems that way to you. I made some lemonade, and I'm learning how to play mah-jongg. You go find your friends.
BUFFY I, I think they might be in danger.
JOYCE I-I'm sorry, dear. Um, a mouse is playing with my knees.
BUFFY I, I really don't think you should live in there.
JOYCE Well ... you could ... probably break through the wall.
RILEY Hey there, killer.
BUFFY Riley? You're back.
RILEY I never left.
BUFFY But how did the debriefing go?
RILEY I told you not to worry about that. It went great. They made me surgeon general.
BUFFY Why didn't you come and tell me? We could have celebrated.
RILEY Oh. We're drawing up a plan for world domination. The key element? Coffeemakers that think.
BUFFY World domination? I-is that a good?
RILEY Baby, we're the government.
RILEY It's what we do.
OTHER_GUY She's uncomfortable with certain concepts. It's understandable. Aggression is a natural human tendency. Though you and me come by it another way.
BUFFY We're not demons.
OTHER_GUY Is that a fact?
RILEY Buffy, we've got important work here. A lot of filing, giving things names.
BUFFY What was yours?
OTHER_GUY Before Adam? Not a man among us can remember.
COMPUTER_VOICE The demons have escaped. Please run for your lives.
ADAM This could be trouble.
RILEY We better make a fort.
ADAM I'll get some pillows.
BUFFY Wait! I have weapons! She sits on the floor and opens the bag. It's full of mud. Buffy frowns, putting her hands in the mud and moving them around. Lifts her hands, covered in mud. Brings them up and smears the mud on her face. Reaches in for more, rubs it all over her face as the colors invert again like a photo-negative.)
RILEY Thought you were looking for your friends. Okay, killer...
RILEY ...if that's the way you want it. I guess you're on your own.
before rocks, scraggly bushes, sand. Again we hear the woman humming. Buffy walks down a hill. The camera zooms out and we can see more of the same landscape with mountains in the distance. A breeze ruffles her hair and dress.)
BUFFY I'm never gonna find them here.
TARA_VOICEOVER Of course not. That's the reason you came.
BUFFY_VOICEOVER You're not in my dream.
TARA_VOICEOVER I was borrowed.
TARA Someone has to speak for her.
BUFFY Let her speak for herself. That's what's done in polite circles.
BUFFY Why do you follow me?
TARA I don't.
BUFFY Where are my friends?
TARA You're asking the wrong questions.
BUFFY Make her speak.
TARA I have no speech. No name. I live in the action of death, the blood cry, the penetrating wound.
TARA I am destruction. Absolute ... alone.
BUFFY The Slayer.
Tara The first.
BUFFY I am not alone.
TARA The Slayer does not walk in this world.
BUFFY I walk.
BUFFY I talk. I shop, I sneeze. I'm gonna be a fireman when the floods roll back.
BUFFY There's trees in the desert since you moved out. And I don't sleep on a bed of bones.
BUFFY Now give me back my friends.
FIRST_SLAYER No ... friends! Just the kill.
FIRST_SLAYER We ... are ... alone!
BUFFY That's it. I'm waking up.
BUFFY It's over. We don't do this any more.
BUFFY_VOICEOVER Enough!
BUFFY Are you quite finished?
BUFFY It's over, okay? I'm going to ignore you, and you're going to go away.
BUFFY You're really gonna have to get over the whole ... primal power thing.
BUFFY You're *not* the source of me.
BUFFY Also, in terms of hair care, you really wanna say, what kind of impression am I making in the workplace? 'Cause-
WILLOW The First Slayer. Wow.
XANDER Not big with the socialization.
WILLOW Or the floss.
GILES Somehow our joining with ... Buffy and ... invoking the essence of the, the Slayer's power was an affront to the source of that power.
BUFFY You know, you could have brought that up to us *before* we did it.
GILES I did. I said there could be dire consequences.
BUFFY Yes, but you say that about chewing too fast.
JOYCE I'm, uh, guessing I missed some fun?
WILLOW The spirit of the first Slayer tried to kill us in our dreams.
JOYCE Oh, you want some hot chocolate?
JOYCE Xander?
XANDER Yes, what, Joyce? Uh ... Buffy's mom.
JOYCE Be my kitchen buddy again, help me carry?
XANDER Yes. Sure. Buffy's mom. Giles You all right?
BUFFY Yeah. I think I might jump in the shower.
GILES You seem a bit, uh...
BUFFY A little. The First Slayer. I never really thought about it. It was intense. I-I guess you guys got a taste of that, huh.
XANDER Yeah, from now on, you keep your Slayer friends out of my dreams. Is that clear?
WILLOW It's not good for the sleepin'.
BUFFY Ah... Well, at least you all didn't dream about that guy with the cheese.
BUFFY I don't know *where* the hell that came from.
TARA_VOICEOVER You think you know ... what's to come ... what you are. You haven't even begun.
