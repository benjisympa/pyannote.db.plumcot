GILES_VOICEOVER Previously on
GILES You are the Slayer. Into each generation a Slayer is born.
BUFFY Why don't we start with 'Hi, I'm Buffy.'
XANDER Xander.
CORDELIA Cordelia.
BUFFY_VOICEOVER Willow, right?
GILES Mister Giles.
ANGEL Angel.
VAMP Gave me a pretty good run there. Bet the blood's just pumpin'.
VAMP Bet it's hot.
KID Don't hurt me.
VAMP Don't hurt you?
BUFFY Hey, what's going on?
KID Help me! Call the police!
VAMP Get outta here, girl.
BUFFY You guys havin' a fight? 'Cause, you know, fighting's not cool.
KID Get out of here!
VAMP No. No, she wants to stay. I don't mind a little appetizer.
BUFFY Have you ever heard the expression, 'biting off more than you can chew'?
BUFFY Okay. Um ... how about the expression, 'vampire slayer'?
VAMP What the hell you talkin' about?
BUFFY Wow. Never heard that one. Okay. How about, 'Oh god, my leg, my leg'?
VAMP Oh god! My leg! Uhh...
BUFFY See? Now we're communicating.
BUFFY Wow. Been a long while since I met one who didn't know me.
BUFFY You should get home.
KID H-how'd you do that?
BUFFY It's what I do.
KID But you're ... you're just a girl.
BUFFY That's what *I* keep saying.
XANDER Something goin' on out back?
BUFFY Vampire.
XANDER Oh.
BUFFY Anything?
GILES Nothing you want to hear. The ritual is, uh...
BUFFY Explain it again.
GILES There's nothing new to-
BUFFY Go through it again.
GILES The key was ... living energy. It needed to be channeled, poured into a specific place at a specific time. The energy ... would flow into that spot, the walls between the dimensions break down. It stops, the energy's used up, the walls come back up. Glory uses that time to get back into her own dimension, not caring that all manner of hell will be unleashed on earth in the meantime.
ANYA Um, but only for a little while, right? The walls come back up, uh, n-no more hell?
WILLOW That's only if the energy is stopped. And now the key is human ... ...is Dawn.
GILES The blood flows, the gates will open. The gates will close when it flows no more. When Dawn is dead.
TARA I have places to be!
XANDER Why blood? Why Dawn's blood? I mean, why couldn't it be like a, a lymph ritual?
SPIKE 'Cause it's always got to be blood.
XANDER We're not actually discussing dinner right now.
SPIKE Blood is life, lackbrain. Why do you think we eat it? It's what keeps you going. Makes you warm. Makes you hard. Makes you other than dead. Course it's her blood.
BUFFY Pretty simple math here. We stop Glory before she can start the ritual. We still have a couple of hours, right?
GILES If my calculations are right. But Buffy-
BUFFY I don't wanna hear it.
GILES I understand that-
BUFFY No! No, you don't understand. We are not talking about this.
GILES Yes, we bloody well are!
GILES If Glory begins the ritual ... if we can't stop her...
BUFFY Come on. Say it. We're bloody well talking about this. Tell me to kill my sister.
GILES She's not your sister.
BUFFY No. She's not. She's more than that. She's me. The monks made her out of me. I hold her ... and I feel closer to her than ... It's not just the memories they built. It's physical. Dawn ... is a part of me. The only part that I-
WILLOW We'll solve this. We will. Don't have another coma, okay?
GILES If the ritual starts, then every living creature in this and every other dimension imaginable will suffer unbearable torment and death ... including Dawn.
BUFFY Then the last thing she'll see is me protecting her.
GILES You'll fail. You'll die. We all will.
BUFFY I'm sorry.
BUFFY I love you all ... but I'm sorry.
ANYA Okay. All in favor of stopping Glory *before* the ritual. Suggestions, ideas? Time's a-wastin'.
SPIKE Uh ... when you say you love us all...
XANDER/GILES Shut up.
ANYA Willow. I bet you've got some dark spell a-brewin'. Uh, make her a, a, a toad? Little hoppy toad, we can hit her with a hammer?
TARA Hoppy toad.
XANDER What about Ben? He can be killed, right? I mean, I know he's an innocent, but, you know, not like Dawn innocent. We could kill a ... regular guy.
XANDER God.
GILES It's doubtful he'll surface again this close to the ritual. We can expect it's Glory we're dealing with.
WILLOW We don't have to kill her. Uh, we just have to stop her from doing the ritual. I mean, there's only the one time that she can do it, right?
SPIKE Yeah. We get her on the ropes, we just gotta keep her occupied till it's too late.
ANYA Okay. But I'm still not hearing enough ideas. She's a god. Let's think outside the box.
SPIKE Why don't *you* go think outside the bleeding box.
GILES Yes, Anya, apart from your incredibly uninfectious enthusiasm, have you anything else to contribu-
ANYA The Dagon sphere!
GILES Sorry?
ANYA When Buffy first met Glory, she found that magical ... glowy sphere that was meant to repel Glory. We've got it in the basement. It might drive her away or hurt her. Ooh!
ANYA And Olaf the troll god's enchanted hammer.
ANYA You wanna fight a god, use the weapon of a god.
SPIKE Uh, nah, that thing's too heavy to- Yeah. Good.
BUFFY I like this. Thanks.
ANYA Here to help. Wanna live.
XANDER Smart chicks are soooo hot.
WILLOW You couldn't have figured that out in tenth grade?
GILES Well, we have some ideas, if we could actually get Glory on the run, but, um...
BUFFY But, we still have no idea how to find her.
TARA Big day. Oh, it calls me! I have to be there!
TARA Big day!
BEN They, uh ... said you have to put this on ... for the ceremony.
DAWN What if I don't?
BEN Come on, just-
DAWN What if I don't like the color?
BEN Look, I ... I wish there was another way.
DAWN And I wish you'd fall on your head and drown in your own barf, so ... I guess we're both disappointed.
BEN I think ... it'll be quick.
MINION Actually, sir, the bleeding is quite a slow process to give the portal time to-
BEN Thank you ... for the information. I'll do what I can to-
DAWN Change.
BEN What?
DAWN Change. Be her. I don't wanna look at you.
BEN Dawn, I don't think you wanna-
DAWN Be Glory. Be Glory. Glory! Glory! Glory!
BEN Will you just stop-
GLORY -shouting already?
GLORY Huh.
GLORY So, what's the hubbub, bub? What do you got against old Benjy?
DAWN He's a monster. At least you're up-front about it.
GLORY Don't be so hard on the boy. He just wants to live. Most guys would do the same. Besides, he's probably the reason your sis and her little cartoon pals are still alive. That little nagging pinch of humanity that makes me go for the hurt instead of the kill. Lowering myself to trade blows with the Slayer when I should have just put my fist through her heart.
GLORY It's gotta be Ben.
DAWN Or maybe you just can't take her.
GLORY Hmm, funny thing. You've been here for a few hours now, and I haven't seen big sis galloping in to save you. She probably knows what a terrible mistake that'd be.
DAWN She's not afraid of you.
GLORY Oh no, sweetie baby. I'm talking about the ritual. 'Cause you know I bleed you, the portals open, but once you die they close. The faster you die, the better for your sorry species.
GLORY I'm bettin' Buffy knows that. Since she's not really your sister, I'm guessin' she isn't gonna show. And if she does...
GLORY ...it might not be to save you.
DAWN Buffy.
GILES You sure you're not going to tire yourself out?
BUFFY I'm sure.
GILES We're ... still working on ideas. Time's short, but, uh, best leave it to the last moment. If we go in too early and she takes us out, no chance of getting her to miss her window.
BUFFY Then we wait.
GILES I imagine you hate me right now.
GILES I love Dawn.
BUFFY I know.
GILES But I've sworn to protect this sorry world, and sometimes that means saying and doing ... what other people can't. What they shouldn't have to.
BUFFY You try and hurt her, and you know I'll stop you.
GILES I know.
BUFFY This is how many apocalypses for us now?
GILES Oh, uh, well... six, at least. Feels like a hundred.
BUFFY I've always stopped them. Always won.
GILES Yes.
BUFFY I sacrificed Angel to save the world.
BUFFY I loved him so much. But I knew ... what was right. I don't have that any more. I don't understand. I don't know how to live in this world if these are the choices. If everything just gets stripped away. I don't see the point. I just wish that... I just wish my mom was here.
BUFFY The spirit guide told me ... that death is my gift. Guess that means a Slayer really is just a killer after all.
GILES I think you're wrong about that.
BUFFY It doesn't matter. If Dawn dies, I'm done with it. I'm quitting.
GLORY Okay, campers, it's almost stab time. You two, get her.
DAWN No. No! Aah! Buffy!
GLORY See you in a few.
GILES Any luck? Have you found the Dagon sphere?
ANYA Um, I'm sure it's here, just be a minute!
XANDER Yeah, we're on it! Let's look over here, where we didn't look yet.
GILES Time is a factor.
ANYA Yes. Yes. Not to worry.
XANDER So, are you more, uh ... relaxed?
ANYA No.
XANDER No? I mean, it sounded like you, uh ... arrived.
ANYA No. Yes. Um, I had the pleasure moment, and the blissful calm that comes right after it. But that only lasted a couple of seconds, and now I'm terrified again.
XANDER Well, you don't have to be.
XANDER Gah!
ANYA What?
XANDER Spike's sex-bot. Why didn't they just melt it down into scrap?
ANYA Maybe Willow wanted it.
XANDER I don't think Willow feels that way about, about Buffy. I mean, I know she's gone through a lot of changes, but-
ANYA To study it.
XANDER Right. Robotics. Science.
ANYA Pervert.
XANDER Other pervert.
ANYA And don't frighten me like tha-aah!
ANYA God, who, who would put something like that there? Is this supposed to be some sort of sick joke?
ANYA I mean, things aren't bad enough! This is an omen.
XANDER Hey, hey, shh.
ANYA No, no, it's an omen. It's a higher power, trying to tell me through bunnies that we're all gonna die. Oh god.
XANDER No it's not.
XANDER It's okay.
ANYA No, you see, usually when there's an apocalypse, I skedaddle. But now I love you so much that instead I have inappropriately timed sex and try to think of ways to fight a god ... and worry terribly that something might happen to you. And also worry that something'll happen to me. And then I have guilt that I'm not more worried about everyone else, but I just don't have enough! I'm just on total overload, and I honestly don't think that I could be more nervous than I am right now.
XANDER Care to wager on that?
XANDER Anya ... you wanna marry me?
XANDER Can I take that as a maybe?
ANYA You're proposing to me!
XANDER Yes...
ANYA You're proposing to me 'cause we're gonna die! And you think it's romantic and sexy and, and you know you're not gonna have to go through with it 'cause the world's gonna end!
XANDER I'm proposing to you, Anya, because it's not.
ANYA You can't know that.
XANDER I believe it. I think we're gonna get through this. I think I'm gonna live a long ... and silly life, and I'm not interested in doing that without you around.
ANYA Oh. Okay.
XANDER Okay?
ANYA Yes. I mean, yes.
ANYA No.
XANDER No?
ANYA After. Give it to me when the world doesn't end.
BUFFY Will, what do you got for me?
WILLOW Some ideas. Well, notions. Or, theories based on wild speculation. Did I mention I'm not good under pressure?
BUFFY I need you, Will. You're my big gun.
WILLOW I'm your - no, I-I was never a gun. Someone else should be the gun. I, I could be a, a cudgel. Or, or a pointy stick.
BUFFY You're the strongest person here. You know that, right?
WILLOW Well ... no.
BUFFY Will, you're the only person that's ever hurt Glory. At all. You're my best shot at getting her on the ropes, so don't get a jelly belly on me now.
WILLOW Well ... I, I ... do sort of have this one idea. But, last few days, I've mostly been looking into ways to help Tara. I-I know that shouldn't be my priority....
BUFFY Of course it should.
WILLOW Well, I've been charting their essences. Mapping out. I think ... if I can get close enough, I may be able to reverse what Glory did. Like, take back what she took from Tara. It might weaken Glory, or ... make her less coherent. Or it might make all our heads explode.
GILES Buffy.
WILLOW I'll try to work it.
WILLOW Don't worry, love. It won't be long.
TARA Bitch! I'm supposed to work on the factors!
TARA I'm, I'm not ... I'm not....
WILLOW I'm gonna bring you back.
BUFFY No. No, no, that's good. That could be pivotal. Thank you guys.
GILES Well, um, you're gonna need some-
BUFFY Way ahead of you. We have time?
GILES Yes, if you hurry.
BUFFY Okay. I'll grab some weapons too.
XANDER I'm looking for something in a broadsword.
SPIKE Don't be swingin' that thing near me.
XANDER Hey, I happen to be-
SPIKE A glorified bricklayer?
XANDER I'm also a swell bowler.
ANYA Has his own shoes.
SPIKE The gods themselves do tremble.
BUFFY Spike, shut your mouth, come with me.
BUFFY The weapons are in the chest by the TV, I'll grab the stuff upstairs.
SPIKE Uh, Buffy...
SPIKE If you wanna just hand them over the threshold, I'll...
BUFFY Come in, Spike.
SPIKE Hmm. Presto. No barrier.
SPIKE Um, won't bother with the small stuff. Couple of good axes should hold off Glory's mates while you take on the lady herself.
BUFFY We're not all gonna make it. You know that.
SPIKE Yeah.
SPIKE Hey. Always knew I'd go down fightin'.
BUFFY I'm counting on you ... to protect her.
SPIKE Till the end of the world. Even if that happens to be tonight.
BUFFY I'll be a minute.
SPIKE Yeah.
SPIKE I know you'll never love me.
SPIKE I know that I'm a monster. But you treat me like a man. And that's...
SPIKE Get your stuff, I'll be here.
MINION She will come to you soon.
BUFFY We on schedule?
GILES Yes, it's time.
BUFFY Will?
WILLOW Tara, baby? Is there somewhere you should be?
TARA They held me down.
WILLOW No one's holding you. It's the big day, right?
WILLOW Do you wanna go?
TARA You're a killer. This is all set down.
BUFFY Stay close but don't crowd her. We'll follow in a minute.
BUFFY Everybody knows their jobs. Remember, the ritual starts, we all die. And I'll kill anyone who comes near Dawn.
SPIKE Well, not exactly the St. Crispin's Day speech, was it?
GILES We few...
GILES ...we happy few.
SPIKE We band of buggered.
XANDER Shpadoinkle.
ANYA What is that?
GILES The portal must open up there.
BUFFY Will, you're up.
GILES Need anything?
WILLOW Could use a little courage.
WILLOW The real kind.
WILLOW But thanks.
GLORY You. What are you doing here?
WILLOW She's with me.
GLORY What the frickin' hell did that bitch do to me?
MINION You look fine. Truly.
GLORY She made a little ... she made a hole. Uh, I need a brain to eat.
MINION Oh, take mine, oh groove-tastic one!
GLORY I said a brain, you worthless dirt!
GLORY Big day. I got places to be, big day. Need a brain.
GLORY Suppose I could always use yours.
BUFFY Okay then.
BUFFY Come and get it.
BUFFY You don't seem very well.
GLORY Your little witch bitch ... gave me kind of a headache there. But if you think this is gonna last more than eight seconds-
BUFFY I noticed you're talking, whereas in your position, I would attack me.
MINION Oh, most sweaty-naughty-feelings-causing one, should we...
GLORY Go guard the girl. This is a ... this is a, a...
MINION Diversionary tactic?
GLORY Go guard!
BUFFY It's strange, you're not as blurry with speed as usual either.
GLORY The witch...
BUFFY It's not her.
BUFFY Might be this.
BUFFY I heard it's supposed to repel you. So my guess is ... you probably shouldn't touch it, either.
GLORY You're gonna wish you-
MINION_1 Stand fast! Kill anyone who dares approach! This will be our day of glory!
MINION_2 Well punned.
MINION_1 Well, it just called out to me.
WILLOW Tara!
WILLOW Tara?
WILLOW Tara?
TARA W ... Willow?
WILLOW Tara?
TARA Willow ... I got so lost.
WILLOW I found you.
WILLOW I will always find you.
GLORY You know what?
GLORY I'm feeling a little better. And now? I'm a little bored.
BUFFY Oh, I'm sorry. Cause you're about-
GLORY Hey, wow, the Slayer's a robot. Did everybody else know the Slayer was a robot?
BUFFY Glory?
BUFFY You're not the brightest god in the heavens, are you?
DAWN Buffy! I'm up here!
DAWN Buffy!
GLORY Oh no you don't!
DAWN Buffy! I'm up here!
DAWN Buffy!
GLORY You lost your hammer, sweet cheeks. What are you gonna hit me with now?
BUFFY Whatever's handy.
XANDER The glorified bricklayer picks up a spare.
ANYA Has anyone noticed we're going backwards?
SPIKE It's crossed my mind.
GILES As long as ... Buffy can keep Glory down ... long enough, it doesn't matter. There's only a few minutes left to start the ritual.
DAWN You. You can help me. Untie me. Please. Help me, she's coming.
DOC Well, it seems she's running a bit late, is the thing. And, uh, if her Splendidness can't be here in time to bleed you...
DOC Hey! Kid. Wanna see a trick?
XANDER How we doing?
ANYA So far it's a tie.
GILES We haven't got up to Dawn, but then neither has anyone else.
SPIKE Someone's up there.
XANDER Okay, we gotta charge or something.
ANYA We tried that.
WILLOW_VOICEOVER Spike. Can you hear me?
SPIKE Yeah, loud and clear.
WILLOW_VOICEOVER Is there someone up there with Dawn?
SPIKE Yeah, can't tell who.
XANDER Are you talking to us?
WILLOW_VOICEOVER Get up there. Go now.
SPIKE Yeah, but-
WILLOW_VOICEOVER Go!
DOC Well. What do you know? It's just about that time.
DAWN Spike!
SPIKE Doesn't a fella stay dead when you kill him?
DOC Look who's talking.
SPIKE Come on, Doc. Let's you and me have a go.
DOC I ... do have a prior appointment.
SPIKE This won't take long.
DOC No, I-I don't imagine it will.
GLORY You're just a mortal. You couldn't understand my pain.
BUFFY Then I'll just have to settle for causing it.
GLORY You can't kill me.
BUFFY No ... but my arm's not even tired yet.
SPIKE You don't come near the girl, Doc.
DOC I don't smell a soul anywhere on you. Why do you even care?
SPIKE I made a promise to a lady.
DOC Oh?
DOC Then I'll send the lady your regrets.
SPIKE No.
DAWN Aah! No!
GLORY Stop it.
BUFFY You're a god.
BUFFY Make it stop.
BEN I'm sorry.
BUFFY Tell her it's over. She missed her shot. She goes. She ever, *ever* comes near me and mine again...
BEN We won't. I swear.
BEN I guess we're stuck with each other, huh baby?
GILES Can you move?
BEN Need a ... a minute. She could've killed me.
GILES No she couldn't. Never. And sooner or later Glory will re-emerge, and ... make Buffy pay for that mercy. And the world with her. Buffy even knows that... and still she couldn't take a human life.
GILES She's a hero, you see. She's not like us.
BEN Us?
DOC Shallow cuts... shallow cuts...
DOC Let the blood ... flow ...
DOC ...free.
BUFFY Dawn.
DAWN Buffy!
DOC This should be interesting.
BUFFY Here.
DAWN Buffy, it hurts.
BUFFY I got it. Come here. You're gonna be okay.
BUFFY Go!
DAWN Buffy, it's started.
ANYA Xander!
XANDER Anya!
DAWN I'm sorry.
BUFFY It doesn't matter.
BUFFY What are you doing?
DAWN I have to jump. The energy.
BUFFY It'll kill you.
DAWN I know. Buffy, I know about the ritual. I have to stop it.
BUFFY No.
DAWN I have to. Look at what's happening.
DAWN Buffy, you have to let me go. Blood starts it, and until the blood stops flowing, it'll never stop.
DAWN You know you have to let me. It has to have the blood.
SPIKE Cause it's always got to be blood.
BUFFY_VOICEOVER It's Summers blood. It's just like mine.
BUFFY She's me. The monks made her out of me.
FIRST_SLAYER Death is your gift.
BUFFY Death...
FIRST_SLAYER_VOICEOVER ...is your gift.
DAWN Buffy ... no!
BUFFY Dawnie, I have to.
DAWN No!
BUFFY Listen to me. Please, there's not a lot of time, listen.
BUFFY_VOICEOVER Dawn, listen to me. Listen.
BUFFY_VOICEOVER I love you. I will *always* love you.
BUFFY_VOICEOVER But this is the work that I have to do.
BUFFY_VOICEOVER Tell Giles ... tell Giles I figured it out. And, and I'm okay.
BUFFY_VOICEOVER And give my love to my friends.
BUFFY_VOICEOVER You have to take care of them now.
BUFFY_VOICEOVER You have to take care of each other.
BUFFY_VOICEOVER You have to be strong.
BUFFY_VOICEOVER Dawn, the hardest thing in this world ... is to live in it.
BUFFY Be brave. Live.
BUFFY_VOICEOVER For me.
