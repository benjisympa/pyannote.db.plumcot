BUFFY Ha! Touchdown! Oh yeah. Go team me.
RILEY Anybody ever tell team you the quarterback throws like a girl?
BUFFY I do?
BUFFY Ooh, sorry!
BUFFY No, don't, no -
XANDER I'm exhausted just looking at those two. All the splashing and jumping and running... Shouldn't relaxing involve less exertion?
ANYA Absolutely. Exertion can lead to sweatiness.
TARA Which can cause the pain and heartbreak of stinkiness. Better to just stay put.
WILLOW I think we've just put our finger on why we're the sidekicks.
WILLOW Game over?
RILEY Uh, Buffy slayed the football.
BUFFY Where's my burger?
RILEY Yeah, man, I'm starving. Cow me.
XANDER The, uh, fire's not cooperating. It's comforting to know that I lack the culinary finesse of a caveman.
BUFFY Willow, check you out! Witch-fu.
WILLOW It's no big. You just have to balance the elements so when you affect one, you don't wind up causing...
WILLOW I didn't do it! I didn't do it!
GUY1 Come on, hurry it up, I'm getting soaked.
GUY2 I'm trying. Geez, this thing weighs-
GUY1 Nice. Good job.
GUY2 Look at this. Guy's carting dirt around.
GUY1 Leave it. We'll, we'll turn it on its side.
GUY2 Dirt. Man, rich people are-
WILLOW There you go. All set.
GILES Thank you, Willow. Obstinate bloody machine simply refused to work for me.
WILLOW Just call me the computer whisperer. Let's get scannin'. I want to see this puppy go.
GILES Start with those.
WILLOW Start? Where is finish?
GILES Willow, it's essential that we begin archiving the library. I mean, most of these texts have no duplicates.
WILLOW But ... now? Doesn't winter seem more like archiving season?
GILES Well, you don't have to, Willow, I mean, you're, you're welcome to leave if, uh...
WILLOW No. It's fine. It's just, you've been Mr. Project all summer. You know? Labeling the amulets and indexing your diaries. I draw the line at making giant rubber band balls. That's when you'll just have to get a life.
GILES That's what I'm trying to do, actually, is, um, get a life.
WILLOW It might go better if you left the house.
GILES Willow, um... you mustn't repeat what I'm about to say. Especially not to Buffy.
WILLOW Uh-oh.
GILES You promise?
WILLOW Oh, god. Well, I guess. Now that I know there's something to know, I can't *not* know, just because I'm afraid somebody'll know I know, you know?
GILES Did that mean yes?
WILLOW Yeah.
GILES We're doing all this because I, I want you and the others to have everything you need at your fingertips. You see, I'm, I'm going back to England.
WILLOW You're ... what? But you can't! You're ... Buffy's Watcher!
WILLOW I mean, in a fired way, but...
GILES Well, it's become quite obvious that Buffy doesn't need me. I-I don't say that in a self-pitying way, I'm, I'm quite proud, actually.
WILLOW But what about the rest of us? We still need to be watched! Personally, I can't get through a day without a little hairy eyeball.
GILES I appreciate the sentiment, but it's, it's just not so. You'll be fine. You all will. And you know, we'll, we'll stay in touch. You can always call me whenever you like.
WILLOW When are you gonna tell Buffy?
GILES Soon. It won't be easy, but, um... I know she'll understand.
BUFFY Thanks, Mom. Everything was yummy.
JOYCE Hey, you up for dessert? We could, uh, take a drive, get some ice cream.
BUFFY You know, I, I would, but I kinda have to get out on patrol.
JOYCE Now? It's 8:30.
BUFFY Well, vamps don't really care what time it is. You know, dark equals dinner bell.
JOYCE Right, of course. You know, I'm gonna have to get used to this place without you again. It gets so quiet.
BUFFY You know, maybe we should make a regular date of this, when school starts.
JOYCE Mm.
BUFFY I'm sorry. Duty calls. It's a total drag.
MAN Very impressive hunt.
MAN Such power.
BUFFY That was no hunt. That was just another day on the job.
BUFFY Care to step up for some overtime?
MAN We're not going to fight.
BUFFY Do you *know* what a slayer is?
MAN Do you?
BUFFY Who are you?
MAN I apologize. I assumed you knew. I am Dracula.
BUFFY Get out!
WILLOW Xand ... what if somebody had a secret, and that somebody promised somebody else that they wouldn't tell anyone.
XANDER News flash, Will. Everybody knows.
WILLOW No, thi-this isn't about me and Tara.
XANDER Oh. Well, not that I wouldn't be all ears if you wanted to tell me a secret about you two. Even if it was very, very naughty.
WILLOW Sorry, this is of the non-naughty variety. And I'm not telling you.
XANDER Okay. Want to see if Buffy's hanging around the headstones?
WILLOW Sure. So if I was gonna tell you, which I'm not going to....
BUFFY So lemme get this straight. You're ... Dracula. The guy, the count.
DRACULA I am.
BUFFY And you're sure this isn't just some fanboy thing? Cause ... I've fought more than a couple of pimply overweight vamps that called themselves Lestat.
DRACULA You know who I am. As I would now without question that you are Buffy Summers.
BUFFY You're heard of me?
DRACULA Naturally. You're known throughout the world.
BUFFY Naw. Really?
DRACULA Why else would I come here? For the sun? I came to meet the renowned ... killer.
BUFFY Yeah, I prefer the term slayer. You know, killer just sounds so...
DRACULA Naked?
BUFFY Like I ... paint clowns or something. I'm the good guy, remember?
DRACULA Perhaps, but your power is rooted in darkness. You must feel it.
BUFFY No. You know what I feel? Bored.
BUFFY Okay, that's cheating.
XANDER Hey Buff, what's up?
WILLOW You look like you just-
BUFFY Get out of here. Now.
XANDER Fine, but I was gonna give you a sip of my double-mint mocha, but..
BUFFY Behind you.
WILLOW Hi.
XANDER Nice. Look who's got a bad case of dark prince envy.
DRACULA I have no interest in you. Leave us.
XANDER No, we're not going to leave you. And where'd you get that accent, Sesame Street? Vun, two, three three victims. Mwa ha ha!
BUFFY Xander, I'm pretty sure that's Dracula.
XANDER Wow, really? Hey, sorry, man, I was ... just jokin' around.
DRACULA This is not the time. I will see you soon.
BUFFY Bat! Ooh, bat!
XANDER_VO And then Buffy's all, Look out!
XANDER And then frigging Dracula's standing right behind us.
WILLOW And then, he lunges at us, like whoosh!
XANDER He totally looked shorter in person.
BUFFY I told you he'd heard of me, right? I mean, can you believe that? Count Famous heard of me.
RILEY I couldn't believe it the first twenty times you told us, but it's starting to sink in now.
BUFFY I'm sorry. Am I repeat-o-girl? I was just ... blown away.
RILEY It's not that surprising that he's heard of you, Buffy. You are the slayer.
BUFFY I guess. Just - the way he said it, you know, I mean, he made it sound so...
WILLOW Sexy? I bet he made it sound sexy.
BUFFY Kinda. He of the dark penetrating eyes and lilty accent.
TARA You thought Dracula was sexy?
WILLOW Oh! No. He, he was ... yuck.
ANYA Right, except for the whole tall, dark, and handsome thing? Yucko.
XANDER How would you know?
ANYA Well, we hung out a few times. Back in my demon days, you know, once or twice. He's pretty cool. You know, from, from a whole ... evil thing perspective.
XANDER Please. He was no big whoop.
WILLOW No big whoop?? What about that thing where he turned himself into a bat? That was awesome!
GILES It must have been, yes. I must admit, I'm sorry I missed that.
WILLOW Me too! The whole time I was thinking, 'Gosh, I wish Giles were here, he'd know what to do!'
WILLOW Didn't you guys ... think that?
BUFFY Actually, I was more thinking, 'Bat!'
XANDER How come he can do that?
GILES I, I have no idea. There's a great deal of myth about Dracula. I imagine the trick to defeating him lies in separating the fact from the fiction.
WILLOW Great point! That is so Giles, to think of something like that, you know? That, that we ... would have never...
BUFFY So we should take things slow with Dracula. I mean, he said that we would meet again, but I would like to avoid that until we do some serious homework.
RILEY I don't know. I mean, he may have a bunch of swell party tricks, but he's still just a vampire. I say we load up with stakes and crossbows and go after him now.
XANDER Second.
ANYA No, Buffy's right. Dracula's too slick to fall for the usual stuff.
BUFFY So we hold off. No killing until we know exactly what we're dealing with.
RILEY You're not just saying that because of those dark penetrating eyes of his, are you?
BUFFY Noooo, his eyes were There were - there was no penetration. Cross my heart.
GILES All right. Willow, you and Tara find out everything you can about the actual legend of Vlad the Impaler on the Internet, and, uh, I'll check the library.
RILEY If the Initiative was still around, we'd be able to find everything on this guy in a few hours.
BUFFY We might not be as fast, but we'll find him. You guys, we'll reconvene here in the morning.
RILEY What's your plan?
BUFFY Big sleep. My count encounter wiped me out.
RILEY I'm kinda wired. Maybe I should just let you get your rest.
BUFFY You sure? I mean, maybe if you just lie down with me...
RILEY Nothing you are about to say will lead to rest.
BUFFY I guess you're right. I'll see you in the morning?
RILEY Mm-hmm. With donuts.
BUFFY Mm. Heaven. See? A little sugar and I'm all yours. Dracula schmacula.
ANYA I doubt he'd remember me. I was just a silly young thing. I mean, like seven hundred or so. But he did say that this guy I cursed was doomed forever, which was really sweet, don't you think?
XANDER Adorable.
ANYA It was a great spell. I made this jerk incredibly fat, like a human minivan.
ANYA_VO You should just mention my name if you see him again.
XANDER Or better yet, why don't you just go sit on top of a crypt and flaunt your neck cleavage until Dracula shows up? Then you two can talk private.
ANYA Oh please, don't tell me you're jealous.
XANDER Oh no, just because you're panting over the guy.
ANYA I am not panting. Now stop being silly. I'll see you tomorrow.
XANDER You don't wanna come back to my place?
ANYA It's whites day, remember? The bleach smell makes me nauseous.
XANDER Fine. I suppose Dracula doesn't use bleach, huh? He's a darks-only man.
XANDER Great. Perfect. You know what? You're not so big. One round of old-fashioned fisticuffs, you'd fold like a bitty baby.
XANDER Okay, let's do it. And no poofing. Come on, puffy shirt. Pucker on up, cause you can kiss your pale ass-
DRACULA Silence.
XANDER Yes master. No, that's not-
DRACULA You will be my emissary, my eyes and ears in daylight.
XANDER Your emissary?
DRACULA Serve me well. You will be rewarded. I will make you an immortal. A child of darkness that feeds on life itself... on blood.
XANDER Blood? Yes! Yes! I will serve you, your excellent spookiness.
XANDER Or master. I'll just stick with master.
XANDER But master, how can I find- Brilliant. What an exit! Guy's a genius!
SPIKE Well, well.
SPIKE You can take the boy out of the Initiative, but you can't take the Initiative out of the boy.
RILEY I'd put that down, unless you're bucking for one hell of a headache.
SPIKE I can't be too careful. I got quite a few demons after me these days.
RILEY I'm looking for some information.
SPIKE I'll play.
RILEY What can you tell me about Dracula?
SPIKE Dracula? Poncy bugger owes me eleven pounds, for one thing.
RILEY You know him?
SPIKE Know him? We're old rivals. But then he got famous, forgot all about his foes. I'll tell you what. That glory hound's done more harm to vampires than any slayer. His story gets out, and suddenly everybody knows how to kill us. You know, the mirror bit?
RILEY But he's not just a regular vampire. I mean, he has special powers, right?
SPIKE Nothing but showy gypsy stuff. What's it to you, anyway?
RILEY He's in town. Making his presence known.
SPIKE Drac's in Sunnydale-way? I guess the old boy needed closure after all.
RILEY Actually, he's gunning for Buffy. But I'm out to find him before he gets another shot at her.
SPIKE Tough talk, cowboy. But you're not gonna catch him napping in a crypt. No, the count has to have his luxury estate and his bug-eaters and his special dirt, don't he?
RILEY So you're saying I should check out mansions, that sort of thing?
SPIKE No. I'm saying ... you should go home to your superhoney. Have a nice, safe snog. You're out of your depth on this one, boy.
RILEY You've helped Buffy before, so she has a problem with killing you now that you're helpless.
RILEY I don't.
SPIKE I'd like to see you try.
RILEY Would you?
SPIKE Pfft.
SPIKE You're never gonna find him.
SPIKE Not before he gets to her.
DRACULA You are magnificent.
BUFFY I bet you say that before you bite all the girls.
DRACULA No, you are different. Kindred.
BUFFY Kindred? Hardly, I-
DRACULA Pull your hair back.
BUFFY You think you can just waft in here with your music video wind and your hypno-eyes...
DRACULA I have searched the world over for you. I have yearned for you.
BUFFY He was-
DRACULA Unworthy. He let you go. But the embrace ... his bite ... you remember.
BUFFY No.
DRACULA Do not fight. I can feel your hunger.
RILEY Here's a jelly one, you want it?
BUFFY No.
XANDER Got it! Got it. Mine, mine.
WILLOW Well, I think we have Dracula factoids.
XANDER Like any of that's enough to fight the dark master.
XANDER ...bator.
WILLOW A lot of it we already knew. Turnoffs: wood, fire, crosses, garlic. Turnons: nice duds, minions, long slow bites that last for days...
RILEY Yeah, I did a little research too. Dracula likes to live in style. Which means we can rule out the usual dumps vampires haunt.
XANDER Ah! But he's smart enough to figure that we probably already know that. I'm guessing he's lying low.
WILLOW Actually, my research backs Riley up. Drac isn't the lay-low type.
GILES So we can, uh, check out the nicer places. Don't you think, Buffy?
GILES Buffy?
BUFFY Yeah. We'll check all the swanky places first. What else did you guys get?
GILES Well, Willow has most of it, actually.
WILLOW Only because you gave me super pointers! I never would have...
GILES Just go ahead, Willow.
WILLOW OK. Dracula's modus operandi is different from other vampires. He will kill just to feed, but he'd rather have a connection with his victims. And he has all of these mental powers to draw them in.
WILLOW He, he can read and control minds... appear in dreams...
BUFFY Uh huh.
WILLOW Makes sense. That stare ... he just kinda ... looked right through you. Didn't you feel it, Buffy?
BUFFY No. No, I didn't.
XANDER See! Buffy didn't feel it. I think you're drawing a low of crazy conclusions about the unholy prince.
XANDER ...bator.
GILES The point is, though he goes through the motions of an intimate seduction, the end result is the same. He turns them into a vampire.
XANDER Well. That *is* intimate. Dracula's gifting these ladies with his own blood. And blood Blood is life.
XANDER According to them.
GILES Um ... Just be aware that he, he tends to form a relationship with his prey. It's not enough for him to take her. She must want to be taken. She must ... burn for him.
BUFFY That's ... interesting. I'm gonna go find him.
RILEY You shouldn't go by yourself, Buffy. I mean, this guy's seriously dangerous.
BUFFY It's cool, I got it.
RILEY Hey. Take off that scarf.
BUFFY What? No.
RILEY You're under the thrall of the dark prince!
BUFFY I am not under the thrall of the dark prince.
RILEY Then take off the scarf.
BUFFY Oh, let go of me! This is ridiculous.
GILES Why didn't you say anything?
XANDER Cause she didn't want to worry us, right Buffster? It's nothin'. Just a scratch.
WILLOW Two deep, puncture-y scratches.
BUFFY I'm not sure why I tried to hide it. Uh, there was just this voice, and it was, it was telling me to cover it.
RILEY And what did I tell you? That's thrall.
XANDER You're saying Dracula has some sort of freaky mind control over her? You're watching too many creature features, man.
BUFFY But it does seem like he has this ... control over me, I ... even though a big part of me is resisting.
RILEY No, that's okay. I shouldn't take this personally. I mean, what with Angel, I mean, it's understandable that there would be transference. I mean, they're both broody immortals.
BUFFY I am not transfer-y. I swear to you. I'm your girl, and I'm gonna stay that way.
RILEY Okay. But you are not going anywhere near him again.
GILES Uh, Riley's right, you should - you should stay out of sight. Let the rest of us look for Dracula.
BUFFY I can't go home. He already got inside once.
XANDER You can come over to my place. I'll make sure you stay put.
GILES Good. Um, Riley and I can, uh, can... search for Dracula, and Willow, you and Tara could uh, could do a protection spell on Buffy's mother's house, and prevent him from returning.
WILLOW Got it. How'd he get inside anyway?
JOYCE He seemed so nice and normal. A little pale.
WILLOW A good Sunnydale rule of thumb? Avoid white-skinned men in capes.
JOYCE I'm not like this. I don't invite strange men over for coffee, it's just ... Oh, when you girls are older you'll understand. It's hard to date. Sometimes you just ... feel like giving up on men altogether.
RILEY Another bust.
GILES And it's getting dark. I should have turned up a better lead. There must be an easier way to find him.
RILEY Too late to worry about that now. If we hurry, we can hit these last places.
ANYA How come I have to be here slayer-sitting while the other guys get to look for Dracula?
ANYA I mean, just because I'm-
XANDER What time is it?
ANYA Uh, almost six. Look, I mean, I'm the one who knows him, I-I'm the one who had a really good look at him, and so, I mean, what-
ANYA Hey! What?
XANDER I'm supposed to deliver you to the master now.
XANDER There's this whole deal where I get to be immortal. You cool with that?
BUFFY Take me to him.
XANDER Master? I deliver the slayer. She who you most desire.
XANDER Sorry, whom.
XANDER So now comes the immortality, right? You do the thing, and-
DRACULA Leave us.
DRACULA We must not be interrupted.
XANDER You bet.
DRACULA I knew you'd come.
BUFFY Why? Because I'm under your thrall? Well, guess again, pal.
DRACULA Put the stake down.
BUFFY Okay. Right. That ... was not ... you. I did that. I did that because ... I wanted to.
BUFFY Maybe I should rethink that thrall thing.
RILEY I've lived in Sunnydale a couple of years now. Know what I've never noticed before?
GILES Uh, a castle?
RILEY A big honking castle.
BUFFY Stay away from me.
DRACULA Are you afraid I will bite you? Slayer, that's why you came.
BUFFY No. Last night ... it's not gonna happen again.
DRACULA Stop me. Stake me.
BUFFY I... Any minute now.
DRACULA Do you know why you cannot resist?
BUFFY Cause you're famous?
DRACULA Because you do not want to.
BUFFY My friends-
DRACULA They're here. They will not find us. We are alone.
DRACULA Always alone.
DRACULA There is so much I have to teach you. Your history, your power ... what your body is capable of...
BUFFY I don't need to know.
DRACULA You long to. And you will have eternity to discover yourself. But first ... a little taste.
BUFFY I won't let you.
DRACULA I didn't mean for me.
XANDER Nobody harms my master.
RILEY Your master?
XANDER You want him? You come through me.
RILEY Okey-dokey.
GILES Oh, good show, Giles. Uhh... at least you didn't get knocked out for a change.
GILES Oh ... oh, ladies.
GILES You would ... be the three sisters, yes?
GILES E-excellent, right. Uh, I'd heard that you were myth ... obviously erroneous.
GILES Aah! Ooh, that's, uh, that, uh... tickles! Ooh, uh... oh, dear god.
BUFFY What are you-
DRACULA All those years fighting us. Your power so near to our own... ...and you've never once wanted to know what it is that we fight for? Never even a taste?
BUFFY If I drink that-
DRACULA I have not drunk enough for you to change. You must be near death to become one of us. And that comes only when you plead for it.
BUFFY I'm not hungry.
DRACULA No. Your craving goes deeper than that.
DRACULA You think you know ... what you are ... what's to come. You haven't even begun.
DRACULA Find it. The darkness. Find your true nature.
BUFFY Wow.
BUFFY That was gross.
DRACULA You are resisting.
BUFFY Looks like.
DRACULA Come here. Come to me.
BUFFY You know, I really think the thrall has gone out of our relationship. But I want to thank you for opening up my eyes a little.
DRACULA What is this?
BUFFY My true nature. You want a taste?
RILEY Buffy? Are you in- Giles! Giles!
RILEY Come on, come on. Grab my hand.
GILES Thank god you came.
RILEY Come on!
GILES There was no possible escape.
GILES Oh, my shoe. Silly me, I'll just pop-
RILEY No no no, sir! No more chick pit for you. Come on.
BUFFY A guy like you should think about going electric. Seriously.
BUFFY How do you like my darkness now?
RILEY Buffy! You okay?
BUFFY Yeah. Chock full of free will.
GILES And Dracula?
BUFFY Eurotrashed.
XANDER Where is he?? Where's the creep that turned me into his spider-eating man-bitch?
BUFFY He's gone.
XANDER Dammit! You know what? I'm sick of this crap. I'm sick of being the guy who eats insects and gets the funny syphilis. As of this moment, it's over. I'm finished being everybody's butt-monkey!
BUFFY Check. No more butt-monkey.
RILEY It coulda been worse. At least you weren't making time with the dracu-babes like Giles here.
GILES I was not making time! I, I was, uh, just about to kill those, uh, loathsome creatures when Riley interrupted me.
GILES Of course not! I was in complete... control.
BUFFY You think I don't watch your movies? You always come back.
BUFFY_VO I'm standing right here!
BUFFY_VO You wanted to see me?
GILES Yes. Thanks for coming. Can I offer you some tea?
BUFFY Oh ... no, thanks. Ooh, cookies. How come I rate the little cookie treatment?
GILES Well, actually, I have something to tell you.
BUFFY Actually, I have something that I'd like to talk to you about, too.
GILES Oh, well, you go first, by all means.
BUFFY No, go ahead.
GILES No, I insist.
BUFFY You haven't been my Watcher for a while. I haven't been training ... and I haven't really needed to come to you for help.
GILES I agree.
BUFFY And then this whole thing with Dracula ... it made me face up to some stuff. Ever since we did that spell where we called on the first slayer ... I've been going out a lot. Every night.
GILES Patrolling?
BUFFY Hunting. That's ... what Dracula called it. And he was right. He understood my power better than I do. He saw darkness in it.
BUFFY I need to know more. About where I come from, about the other slayers. I mean, maybe ... maybe if I could learn to control this thing, I could be stronger, I could be better. But ... I'm scared. I know it's gonna be hard. And I can't do it ... without you. I need your help. I need you to be my Watcher again.
BUFFY Boy, I just, I just keep talking, don't I? I'm sorry, you-you had something you wanted to say?
GILES No ... it's nothing.
BUFFY I'm outta here. Riley and I are going to the movies.
JOYCE Okay. Have a good time.
JOYCE Buffy? If you're going out, why don't you take your sister?
