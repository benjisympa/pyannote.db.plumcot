BUFFY I've been going out a lot.
GILES Patrolling?
BUFFY Hunting.
GILES_VOICEOVER Previously on BTVS...
BUFFY_VOICEOVER That's ... what Dracula called it. And he was right.
BUFFY He understood my power better than I do. He saw darkness in it.
BUFFY I need to know more. About where I come from, about the other slayers. I need you to be my Watcher again.
XANDER Dammit! You know what? I'm sick of this crap. I'm sick of being the guy who eats insects and gets the funny syphilis. As of this moment, it's over. I'm finished being everybody's butt-monkey!
BUFFY_VOICEOVER What are you *doing* here?
JOYCE Buffy? If you're going out, why don't you take your sister?
GILES_VOICEOVER There is nothing but you.
GILES_VOICEOVER You are the center. And within you, there is the core of your being ... of what you are.
GILES Find it ... breathe into it.
GILES_VOICEOVER Focus inward. Let the world fall away ... fall away ... fall away....
DAWN Can we go now?
DAWN_VOICEOVER Nobody knows who I am. Not the real me. It's like, nobody cares enough to find out. I mean, does anyone ever ask *me* what I want to do with my life? Or what my opinion is on stuff? Or what restaurant to order in from?
DAWN_VOICEOVER No. Underline. Exclamation point.
DAWN_VOICEOVER Exclamation point, exclamation point. No one understands. No one has an older sister who's a slayer.
DAWN_VOICEOVER People wouldn't be so crazy about her if they had to live in the same house with her every single day. Everybody cares what she thinks. Just 'cause she can do backflips and stuff.
DAWN_VOICEOVER Like that's *such* a crucial job skill in the real world.
DAWN_VOICEOVER Plus Mom lets her get away with everything. Your sister's saving the world.
DAWN_VOICEOVER *I* could so save the world if somebody handed me super powers...
DAWN_VOICEOVER ...but I'd think of a cool name and wear a mask to protect my loved ones, which Buffy doesn't even.
DAWN_VOICEOVER If this town wasn't so lame everyone would completely know what she does. And then I bet they wouldn't even be that impressed, because like, killing things with wood? Oh, scary vampires, they die from a splinter.
JOYCE So Buffy, what are your plans today?
BUFFY Oh, actually, Giles and I are gonna go to the magic shop for supplies for my new and improved training sessions.
JOYCE Oh, that's great.
BUFFY Oh, yeah, I'm actually-
JOYCE You can take Dawn shopping for back to school supplies.
BUFFY What??
DAWN Mom, I-I thought you were taking me.
JOYCE Well, honey, I've got the Gurion showing tonight, and there's so much to do to get the gallery ready.
BUFFY No, but, see, Mom
BUFFY That doesn't really work for me. We're just going to the magic shop. No school supplies there.
DAWN Yeah, Mom, I'm not going to Hogwarts. Geez, crack a book sometime.
JOYCE Look, I'm sure Giles doesn't mind dropping you and your sister off at the mall afterwards.
BUFFY Actually, he does mind. This is supposed to be quality Watcher/slayer time. I told you, she completely ruined my training yesterday.
DAWN Did not!
BUFFY Oh, you know you did too.
JOYCE Buffy. I realize the importance of your new slayer thing, but-
JOYCE -I could really use your help.
RILEY Morning, Mrs. Summers. You look great.
JOYCE Oh, thank you, Riley.
BUFFY Suck up.
RILEY What? It's a nice outfit.
BUFFY Mm-hmm.
RILEY Besides, I'm here to violate your firstborn never goes over with parents. Not sure why.
DAWN_VOICEOVER Riley, my sister's boyfriend, is *so* into her. They're always kissing ... and groping. I bet they have sex!
RILEY Hey, kid.
DAWN I'm not a kid.
BUFFY Well, this is a surprise of the nicest kind.
RILEY Now it's my turn to be surprised. I thought we had plans today.
BUFFY Plans? We planned plans?
RILEY Well, you said, uh, come over tomorrow and we'll hang, and then I said, OK. Not the invasion of Normandy, but still a plan.
BUFFY Right.
RILEY We're not hangin' today, are we?
BUFFY Giles is on his way to pick me up.
RILEY Oh, slayer training.
BUFFY Slayer shopping, actually, but equally as important.
RILEY I have no doubt. Okay, well, we'll hook up later.
BUFFY Are you mad at me?
RILEY Oh, no, not at all. I'm plotting your death, but in a happy way.
BUFFY Good.
RILEY Look, Buffy, I know what this means to you. I think it's great that you've got this new mission. I'll see you tonight.
RILEY Bye. See ya, kid!
DAWN I'm not a kid!
GILES Well, I sympathize with you, Buffy, I truly do. But I'm certain that Riley understands better than anyone else the importance of training. You can't allow personal concerns to distract you from- Dawn, will you stop fiddling with the radio and sit down?
DAWN_VOICEOVER I don't think Buffy's Watcher likes me too much.
DAWN_VOICEOVER I think it's 'cause he's just so ... old. I'm not sure how old he is, but I heard him use the word newfangled one time. So he's gotta be pretty far gone.
BUFFY There's a lot of books on this list. Any of them come on tape? You know, read by George Clooney or someone cute like that?
GILES You're entering a new realm here, Buffy. One for which I myself am not entirely prepared. Are you ready for this commitment?
BUFFY I'm just kidding! Hey, this Betty's ready. Color me committed.
GILES Blast!
BUFFY You put it in neutral again, huh?
GILES I'm just not used to this automatic transmission. I-I loathe this sitting here, not contributing.
GILES No, i-it's not working out.
BUFFY Giles, are you breaking up with your car?
GILES Well, it did seduce me, all red and sporty!
BUFFY Little two-door tramp.
GILES I-I-I don't know, I just - I was so at loose ends, I-I found myself searching for ... some way of feeling more...
BUFFY Shallow?
GILES Perhaps, as I am to act as your Watcher again, a modicum of respect might be in order.
BUFFY Do I have to?
GILES I'm serious, Buffy, there's going to be far less time for the sort of flighty, frivolous-
DAWN Hey, there's Willow and Tara!
GILES Ooh, they haven't seen my new car.
WILLOW Hey Giles, sharp wheels!
TARA The rest of the car's nice too.
GILES Handles like a dream.
BUFFY Where are you guys heading?
WILLOW Magic shop. I have some charms on back order.
DAWN Willow, hi.
WILLOW Hey Dawny! How's my favorite chess partner? Still leading with your knight?
DAWN_VOICEOVER Willow's the awesomest person.
DAWN_VOICEOVER She's the only one I know who likes school as much as me.
DAWN_VOICEOVER Even her friends are cool!
TARA Hey Dawn.
DAWN_VOICEOVER Like Tara. She and Willow are both witches. They do spells and stuff, which is so much cooler than slaying. I told Mom one time I wished they'd teach me some of the things they do together. A-and then she got really quiet and made me go upstairs. Huh. I guess her generation isn't cool with witchcraft.
BUFFY So Giles and I worked out a whole schedule around school. A block of time every day just to focus on my new slayer training.
WILLOW That's a work ethic! Buffy, you're developing a work ethic.
BUFFY Oh, no. Do they make an ointment for that?
WILLOW People gotta respect a solid work ethic. Look at you, motivated Buffy. Eager to soak up learning. Oh, you and I are gonna have so much fun this semester.
BUFFY Yeah, that reminds me. With the whole new training schedule, I kinda had to drop a class.
WILLOW That's understandable. Your slayer studies are way more important.
BUFFY So I won't be taking drama with you.
WILLOW What? You have to, you promised!
BUFFY Well, I know, but Giles said that it just was-
WILLOW The hell with Giles.
GILES I can hear you, Willow.
WILLOW Drama is just Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. You can blow off training Tuesday and Thursday afternoons, can't you?
BUFFY What happened to people gotta respect a work ethic?
WILLOW Other people, not me! There's a whole best friend loophole.
TARA Shop's kinda dark. Maybe it's closed.
GILES That's odd.
BUFFY Well, I think odd just got upped to bad.
GILES Hello? Anyone here?
TARA Mr. Bogarty?
TARA The owner. I-I come in here a lot.
WILLOW Well, maybe this happened ... really late at night when nobody was...
BUFFY Will?
WILLOW I'm fine, I - I just tripped over...
WILLOW Mr. Bogarty.
DAWN Wha-what is it, is he okay?
BUFFY It's nothing you need to see, Dawn, go wait outside.
DAWN I don't wanna wait outside!
BUFFY Dawn!
DAWN Ow, that hurt! You're hurting me. I'm telling.
BUFFY Look, I don't have time for this. Just do as I say and wait.
BUFFY Here.
GUY Whatcha doin'?
GUY What are you doing here? You can't loiter. There's no loitering.
GUY That's why I'm a cat. Quiet. See, cat's in the cupboard but they find you there anyway, and it hurts.
GUY Please, make it stop. Shut up, shut up, they'll hear you!
DAWN Buff-
GUY I know you. Curds and whey. I know what you are. You ... don't ... belong ... here.
TARA Dawn?
TARA Dawn?
TARA Dawn. You okay?
DAWN Is ... Is that guy dead in there?
TARA Yeah.
TARA They're gonna be a little while longer, doing the detective thing. Best non-scoobies like you and me stay out of the way.
TARA Do you wanna thumb-wrestle?
DAWN Okay.
BUFFY Judging by the bite-fest, I'd say it was more than one vampire.
GILES I make it four at least.
BUFFY Looks like someone's put together a new fang club.
WILLOW Well, I've cross-checked the inventory list, and things are definitely missing. Mostly books. Including
BUFFY Oh, shoot! Was that the only copy?
GILES Come on, Buffy, this could be very serious. Whoever's leading this pack of vampires appears to be interested in learning more about you. Perhaps searching for weaknesses or ... good lord.
BUFFY What?
GILES Well, I had no idea the profit margins on a shop like this were so high.
GILES Look at this! Uh, low overhead, out-of-state orders, international - it's no wonder there's never any trouble attracting new owners. A place like this is a virtual-
BUFFY Deathtrap?
GILES What? Well, uh, yes, there is that. But, uh, still... Location, pedestrian traffic...
WILLOW So what's the next step?
GILES Buffy, you should begin looking for their lair straight away.
BUFFY I'll get Riley to help me patrol.
WILLOW Wait, aren't you forgetting something?
GILES Impressive square footage...
WILLOW You're on Dawn duty.
BUFFY Oh, duty. I gotta drop my sister back home. My mother's gonna *kill* me.
GILES I bet the death rate keeps the rent down. Oh, hello. Something's been taken from this case, look here.
BUFFY What'd they take?
GILES I should think an item of, of value, or-or power, possibly even a-
WILLOW A unicorn. 10-inch ceramic unicorn imported from Thailand.
BUFFY Was it valuable?
WILLOW List price, $12.95.
GILES Which begs the question, what kind of an unholy creature fancies cheap tasteless statuary?
HARMONY Okay, hi. First of all, I wanna thank everybody for a really successful raid on the magic shop last night. Good job, minions!
HARMONY Yes, you deserve it. Secondly... somebody remembered to pick me up the sweetest little unicorn!
BRAD What?
HARMONY Brad, guess someone was feeling guilty for standing me up in the tenth grade.
BRAD I, I had to get her something. She sired me.
Peaches Sire-whipped.
HARMONY Anyway, the books you guys brought me to help with the plan? Well, I've been skimming through the book jackets all morning, and let me tell you, there's some pretty useful stuff in there, so-
HARMONY Yes, uh ... sorry, forgot your name.
CYRUS Cyrus.
HARMONY Cyrus, huh, right. Peaches' friend. What's your question?
CYRUS When are we gonna do it?
HARMONY Eww! That's rude! I barely know you! Uch, and you're a minion!
MORT He means the plan! When are we gonna do the plan?
HARMONY Ohhh! The plan! Ah, well, first lemme tell you I'm really psyched about it and I hope the rest of you guys-
MORT When?!
HARMONY Tonight! We kill the slayer ... tonight.
JOYCE_VOICEOVER So not only didn't you take your sister shopping for school supplies-
JOYCE -you brought her to a murder scene.
BUFFY No, I didn't bring her to it, it ... just ... sorta came upon us. It's not like she saw the body or anything.
JOYCE Oh, well. That makes it all right then, doesn't it?
BUFFY No, that is not what I meant.
JOYCE I asked one favor of you, Buffy. To look after your sister. And now you want to unload her, so you and Riley can go out.
BUFFY To patrol. I'm working, it's not like I wanna go to the sock hop.
JOYCE I have to be at the pre-show reception in half an hour. Who's gonna watch Dawn?
DAWN I don't need anyone to watch me!
BUFFY_and_JOYCE Yes you do!
BUFFY Wait. So what you're saying is if I can get an acceptable babysitter here before you leave, I can go patrol?
DAWN Babysitter? I'm fourteen! I'm old enough to *be* a babysitter!
JOYCE And who are you gonna get on such short notice?
DAWN I can take care of myself!
BUFFY Xander.
JOYCE Xander?
DAWN Okay.
XANDER Dawn patrol.
DAWN Hey.
XANDER Check this out, they put cheese on round bread. It's gonna be big.
DAWN_VOICEOVER Xander is so much cuter than anyone. And smarter too. He totally skipped college and got a job working construction. Which is so kind of ... deep, you know? He builds things. And he's brave too.
DAWN_VOICEOVER Just last week he went undercover to stop that Dracula guy.
XANDER Have fun. Not too much fun, though.
JOYCE Dawn, be good.
XANDER Oh, we will. We're just gonna play with matches, run with scissors, take candy from ... some guy ... I don't know his name.
DAWN_VOICEOVER Xander treats everyone like an equal. He doesn't look down on people.
ANYA Hello there, little girl.
DAWN_VOICEOVER Even when he should.
ANYA We are gonna have fun, fun, fun. Look, I've got Monopoly, Clue, and ooh, the Game of Life! That sounds good!
TARA Poor Dawn.
TARA She was pretty shaken up.
WILLOW Well, sure. Bloody death and stuff.
WILLOW She'll be okay.
TARA It's just ... I, I think it's tough for her, not being able to ... well, allowed to, you know, help.
WILLOW Help?
TARA Oh, you. You guys. The slayer circle.
WILLOW Well, Buffy doesn't really need ... a-and I think Dawn's a little young.
TARA I-I know, you're right. It's just hard. That outsider feeling.
WILLOW Tara ... you're not an outsider.
TARA Well, yeah. I kinda am.
WILLOW No, you're not.
TARA Willow, it's okay. Where does this go?
WILLOW Somebody making you feel uncomfortable? Is it Xander? It's Xander, isn't it?
TARA No, Xander's a sweetie.
WILLOW It's Giles! It's 'cause he's ... British and doesn't understand about stuff.
TARA It's no one. You guys all just have this really tight bond. It's-it's hard to break into that. And I'm not even sure I want to.
WILLOW I'm sure.
WILLOW You're completely one of the gang now. Everyone accepts that.
WILLOW You're one of the good guys.
WILLOW Maybe I can talk to the rest of the group and we can do something, some kind of scooby initiation. Oh! Maybe we could wear some kind of special ring that identifies us as members.
TARA I don't think so. But maybe something like that would be nice for Dawn. I do worry about her sometimes.
WILLOW You don't have to. She's got big sister Buffy happily looking out for her.
BUFFY So then my mom goes off on me about how I'm supposed to watch out for Dawn and make sure that she's shielded from something that might upset her.
RILEY Like dead shopkeepers.
BUFFY She didn't see him! A foot, maybe. A dead foot, which is bad, okay, but hello, I see dead stuff *all* the time, and you don't see Mom shielding me.
RILEY So you want your mother to give you space to be a slayer, and shield you from it at the same time.
BUFFY Thank you, logic boy. Did I mention this is a rant? Sense really has no place in it.
RILEY I'm getting that. What's the deal, Buffy? You seem really-
BUFFY Oh, trash can. From a distance it looked kinda-
RILEY Tense.
BUFFY Nooo, I-I was gonna say brown, squat, shadowy...
RILEY Uh-uh. Back to what I was saying before we were rudely attacked by nothing. You seem really tense.
BUFFY Yeah, there's a new vampire gang in town.
RILEY I mean domestically tense. You're on Dawn's case a lot.
BUFFY I guess. It's just... I don't know, it ... I know it's always been this way. She's the baby. But for some reason lately, it's just really getting to me. She's *always* around.
RILEY Well, yeah. You're like her idol, Buffy.
BUFFY Her idol? I don't think so, unless you like to spill things on your idol's new leather pants, and-
RILEY You know what I mean. You have super powers ... and college ... a studly yet sensitive boyfriend...
BUFFY And a pesky life-or-death job that I can't quit or even take a break from.
RILEY She doesn't get the sacrifices. She's a kid.
BUFFY And that's what bugs. *She* gets to be a kid, and she acts like it's the biggest burden in the world. Sometimes *I* would like to just curl up in Mom's lap and not worry about the fate of the world. I'd like to be the one who's protected, who's waited on-
DAWN -hand and foot, getting her own way. Always the favorite.
XANDER You nut. Your mom loves you both equally. But if I'm wrong, I find money usually helps tip the scale. Slip Joyce a 10 or a 20 once in a while. Then we'll see who's the favorite.
DAWN_VOICEOVER He says I'm like a kid sister...
XANDER Here comes the judge!
DAWN_VOICEOVER ...but sometimes when he looks at me, I feel like he sees me as I am...
DAWN_VOICEOVER ...as a woman.
ANYA Oh, crap. Look at this! Now I'm burdened with a husband and several tiny pink children, more cash than I can reasonably manage...
XANDER That means you're winning.
ANYA Really?
XANDER Yes. Cash equals good.
ANYA Ooh! I'm so pleased. Can I trade in the children for more cash?
XANDER Slayer, come out and die.
HARMONY I'm waiting for you, Buffy!
HARMONY I know you're in there!
HARMONY What do you mean, she's not in there?
HARMONY She has to be. I'm calling her out!
XANDER Then I bet she'll be real sorry she missed your call. 'Fraid you and your buddies are gonna have to come back and be killed by Buffy later.
HARMONY They're not my buddies. They're my minions.
XANDER They're ... what now?
HARMONY Minions! You know, lackeys? They work for me.
HARMONY What's so funny?!
XANDER Nothing! What could be funny, just Look out, it's a terrifying Harmony gang, ooh!
HARMONY Stop laughing!
XANDER I just, I just can't picture anyone pathetic enough to be following- Is that Brad Konig? Huh! Hey Brad, who'd have thought when you were beating up kids in gym class, you'd end up Harmony's lapdog?
BRAD Screw you, Harris.
HARMONY You should know all about being somebody's lapdog. I hear you were a good little puppy for Dracula.
XANDER You heard wrong.
HARMONY Don't feel bad. I hear that mind-control thing he does works really well on weak fraidy-cat losers. You didn't stand a chance.
DAWN Shut up!
XANDER Dawn, I'm handling this. Shut up, Harmony!
HARMONY Make me.
XANDER Fraid I don't feel like getting into another hair-pulling contest with you.
HARMONY You're the hair-puller, you big girl!
DAWN Oh yeah? Come inside and say that! Xander will kick your-
ANYA Dawn, no!
XANDER The invitation was for one.
HARMONY Not such a pushover any more, am I?
ANYA Slayer's house have more weapons lying around.
HARMONY I've been working out, learning some new tricks, honing my -
HARMONY Instincts.
HARMONY This isn't over, Xander! I'll be back!
XANDER And we'll be ready for you! Stakes ... crosses ... the whole enchilada.
XANDER Buffy is not going to be happy about this.
BUFFY Harmony ... Harmony has minions?
XANDER Yeah, that was pretty much my reaction.
BUFFY I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It's just ... Harmony has minions!
XANDER And Ruffles have ridges. Uh, Buffy, there's actually a more serious side to all this.
BUFFY I sure hope so, 'cause I'm having trouble breathing. What is it?
XANDER Well, she did come here to kill you.
RILEY Buffy, come on, they have killed once that we know of. She could be a threat to you.
ANYA Especially now that she can enter your house any time she wants.
BUFFY What?
XANDER Uh, yeah, actually, she Harmony kind of happened to sort of get an invite.
BUFFY You guys can't invite her in. I mean, only someone who lives here can-
BUFFY Where is she?
ANYA In her room. Look, I think she's still pretty freaked out.
BUFFY Dawn!
XANDER Buff, it was an accident. She didn't mean it.
BUFFY Oh, well that just makes it okay then, doesn't it?
XANDER No, but believe me, nobody feels worse than her right now.
HARMONY What a total disaster. My first plan! I so wanted it to go well. Plus, I didn't even get to kill stupid Xander Harris! God, that was so embarrassing.
MORT We'll go back later.
HARMONY No! It's no good. Buffy's gonna expect us now. The whole surprise is blown.
PEACHES Who're you growling at?
CYRUS Not me, my stomach. If I don't eat somebody soon, I-I'll get dizzy.
PEACHES Let's go back to the lair. That census taker may not be empty yet.
BRAD Not me. This night is young, and I want some action.
SPIKE Happy to oblige. Here I thought it was gonna be a slow night. Step on up, kiddies. Thrashings for all.
HARMONY Stop!
SPIKE Well. Hello, Harm.
HARMONY Spikey. I mean, Spike.
SPIKE Long time. You look good.
HARMONY I feel good.
SPIKE I remember.
HARMONY How've you been?
SPIKE Not bad. Just got a brand-new telly in my crypt, so...
MORT Why are you talking to him?
HARMONY It's okay, we used to go steady. Spike, Mort. Mort, this is-
MORT I know who he is. He kills our kind.
HARMONY Oh yeah!What's up with that?
SPIKE Bloke's gotta have a hobby, don't he? Piss off, Mort.
HARMONY Mort, just give us ... a couple minutes, 'kay? He's really testy. Some of us were thinking of voting him out of the gang.
SPIKE Gang?
HARMONY Oh, yeah. I've got my own gang now.
SPIKE Is that what those circus freaks are?
HARMONY Uh huh. I mean ... shut up! We're gonna kill the slayer.
SPIKE Singing my song now, are you? You should pay me royalties for that one, or at least get your own tune.
HARMONY I'm not gonna make the same mistakes you did. I've been doing my homework, reading books and stuff.
SPIKE What,
HARMONY You just can't stand the fact that I'm my own person now. There comes a time in every woman's life when she realizes she needs to take the next step. I've taken it. I've found the real me... and I like her.
SPIKE Hope you'll be very happy together. In the meantime, save slayer slaying for the professionals.
HARMONY You'll see. Buffy'll be dead by sunrise. I've got a plan.
SPIKE Lemme guess. Snatch one of her friends, use 'em as bait, lead her into a trap. That sort of thing?
HARMONY No! Much, much better one. I'm not gonna tell you!
SPIKE Thought as much. Best of luck. Let me know how this arch-villain thing works out for you.
HARMONY I'll do that. And after Buffy is gone? I'm gonna kill everybody in this town that was ever mean to me ... Spike!
HARMONY Guys! New plan.
RILEY That's a lot of weapons for somebody you weren't sweating twenty minutes ago.
BUFFY Well, that was before Dawn gave Harmony a backstage pass to kill us all in our sleep.
XANDER Buff, I left word with Willow. She'll come do a return engagement of her uninvitation spell. She probably still has the stuff from last week. And bang, boom, you're back in the Fortress of Solitude. All better.
BUFFY No. Not all better. I mean, it's not like Dawn hasn't grown up in this house knowing all the rules.
BUFFY Especially the biggie! Numero one-oh. Do not invite bloodsucking dead people into our house.
BUFFY I mean, please. I would never have Harmony over even when she was alive.
XANDER People slip, Buffy. Your mom did. She invited in the mas- Dracula. In for coffee.
BUFFY Well, that was different. I mean, she ... He would ... She was lonely, and, and, and she didn't know he was a vampire. *The* vampire. Meanwhile, Dawn knew exactly what Harmony was and she rolled out the welcome mat for her.
RILEY She's just a kid.
BUFFY You know, will everybody please stop saying that? I was just a kid when I met my first vampire, but somehow, I still managed to remember the rules.
RILEY You had to. It was your job.
BUFFY No. No, it was common sense. But nobody expects even that much from Dawn, do they? No, she has to be protected and coddled from the big bad world, well you know what? We are doing nothing but turning her into a little idiot who is going to get us all killed.
BUFFY She just has to be more careful. Now, I can't be there to protect her 24 hours a day. I-I just can't.
ANYA Hey! Don't!
ANYA Dawn!
ANYA What do you think you're doing?
DAWN Leave me alone.
ANYA I will after you come back inside the house.
DAWN Let go of me!
ANYA No, it's not safe out here!
MORT You got that right.
XANDER Anya!
ANYA Oh, vampires took...
RILEY This head wound looks bad. We gotta get her to the hospital.
ANYA They took her...
XANDER Shh, shh.
ANYA Dawn.
BUFFY Dawn? Wha-what about Dawn?
ANYA She ran out ... they took her ... vampires...
BUFFY Oh god. Oh god. Uh, take care of Anya.
RILEY Buffy!
HARMONY All right, once again, nice work, minionators. I'm really, really proud of you guys. Ah, Mort. I trust you made our guest ... comfortable?
MORT You told me to chain her to a wall.
HARMONY Yeah, I know, I'm being, you know, sarcastic or whatever? Anyway... I'm feeling really good about this new plan, people. I think it's a winner.
CYRUS When do we eat the girl?
HARMONY We don't. Not yet.
CYRUS Why not?
HARMONY Because! That's not the plan! Do I have to go over the plan again? We use the sister as bait. We send Buffy a note-
PEACHES More notes?
HARMONY We send Buffy a note, telling her that if she wants to see her sister again, she has to come alone to a place we choose. She comes, we jump her, we kill her.
MORT So it doesn't really matter if we're actually holding the slayer's sister, just as long as she thinks we are. She'll walk into the trap.
HARMONY I guess.
CYRUS So it won't make any difference if we eat the girl now.
HARMONY We're not eating the girl.
PEACHES Why not?
HARMONY Cause! That's not the plan.
SPIKE Bollocks. Gonna have to pinch one of those satellite dishes.
SPIKE Well, speaking of dishes, to what do I owe this unpleasant- Ow! Bloody hell!
BUFFY I don't have time for banter, Spike. Where's Harmony's lair?
SPIKE Haven't seen her in months. How should I know- Ow!
BUFFY Where is she?
SPIKE At least lay off the nose. Okay! Okay! Used to have a cave in the north woods. About forty meters past the overpass construction site.
SPIKE Ow!! I was telling you the truth!
BUFFY I know.
HARMONY They don't respect me. They pretend they do, but deep down they think I'm nothing.
HARMONY I mean, I'm the one who put this group together. Me! But they treat me like I don't even matter. Do you have any idea what that feels like?
DAWN A little.
HARMONY They have no idea how much pressure I'm under. I have to make all the hard decisions. And it's hard!
HARMONY Excuse me, I didn't hear anybody knock.
MORT We've been talking it over, and we decided we don't like this plan.
PEACHES Except for Brad. He abstained.
HARMONY Oh really? You have a plan you like better?
MORT We're gonna feed on the girl and kill you.
MORT Maybe not in that order.
HARMONY I don't think I like your attitude, Mort. Kill him for me.
HARMONY All right. You're all on my list. Th-this isn't fair. Okay, so things haven't been perfect. I just need a little more time to grow into my leadership role.
MORT Time's up.
DAWN Touch me and my sister's gonna kill you.
BUFFY Can't say she didn't warn him.
HARMONY And you didn't like the plan.
BUFFY Dawn, close your eyes.
HARMONY So, slayer, at last we meet.
BUFFY We've met, Harmony, you halfwit.
HARMONY I'm the halfwit? Um, excuse me, but look who's fallen into my-
HARMONY Trap.
BUFFY Harmony, when you tried to be head cheerleader, you were bad. When you tried to chair the homecoming committee, you were really bad. But when you try to be bad ... you *suck*.
DAWN Buffy, watch out!
HARMONY Ooh, good shot, Mort, I think you got her on the-
BUFFY You are going to be in so much trouble when we get home.
DAWN Yeah, well ... I'm telling Mom you slayed in front of me.
BUFFY Fine. I'll just tell her that you ran out of the house in the middle of the night, that you got Anya hurt, invited a vampire in, got kidnapped....
JOYCE Sorry it ran so late. Everything, uh, go okay?
BUFFY Yeah. Yeah, you know ... I got the vamps and we watched some TV.
JOYCE Well, I know at least one of us who's supposed to be in bed by now.
JOYCE Night.
BUFFY So how was the exhibit?
JOYCE Oh, it was fantastic.
DAWN_VOICEOVER Buffy probably would've gotten in way more trouble than me anyway.
DAWN_VOICEOVER But I guess it was pretty okay of her not to say anything to mom. Anya's gonna be okay, and Xander wasn't mad at me. So stuff mostly worked out.
BUFFY Giles, are you sure about this?
GILES Why wouldn't I be?
BUFFY Well, aside from the fact that most magic shop owners in Sunnydale have the life expectancy of a Spinal Tap drummer ... and, have you ever run a store before?
GILES I was a librarian for years. This is exactly the same, except people pay for the things they don't return. It'll give me focus. Increase my resources. And it'll prevent you lot from trampling all over my flat at all hours. There may even be some space for you to train in the back.
BUFFY Boy, you've really thought this through. How bored *were* you last year?
GILES I watched
BUFFY Don't. Break. Anything.
BUFFY Just don't *touch* anything.
DAWN_VOICEOVER Not that Buffy's really changed at all. Like she ever would.
BUFFY What you're doing right now, not moving? Good. Keep doing that.
DAWN She still thinks I'm Little Miss Nobody, just her dumb little sister. Boy, is she in for a surprise.
