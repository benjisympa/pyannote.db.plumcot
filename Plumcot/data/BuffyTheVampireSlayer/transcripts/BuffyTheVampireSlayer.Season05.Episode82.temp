RILEY Buffy's like nobody else in the world. But she doesn't love me.
GILES Previously on
RILEY What have you done to me?
ADAM_VOICEOVER Professor Walsh. She implanted the behavior modifier.
RILEY_VOICEOVER The chip in my head.
ADAM_VOICEOVER Actually, the chip is here...
ADAM_VOICEOVER ... tied directly into your central nervous system through the thoracic nerve.
RILEY_VOICEOVER What's happening to me?
BUFFY_VOICEOVER Engleman said Walsh was feeding you drugs.
RILEY Something's crawling inside me.
INITIATIVE_DOC I don't want to think about the damage our guys could do under the stress of withdrawal.
JOYCE_VOICEOVER Buffy? If you're going out, why don't you take your sister?
BUFFY/DAWN Mom!
DAWN_VOICEOVER Nobody knows who I am. Not the real me. No one understands. No one has an older sister who's a Slayer.
BUFFY Riley?
RILEY Buffy, what are you doing here?
BUFFY My job?
RILEY Well, I just thought you were in the north sector.
BUFFY Watch out!
BUFFY Never mind.
BUFFY Why do I even bother to show up?
BUFFY Spike, what are you doing here?
SPIKE Same thing as you and your Cub Scout here, I'll wager.
SPIKE A spot of violence before bedtime.
SPIKE What? I softened him up.
BUFFY Better keep out of my way, Spike. I'm not gonna take this much longer.
SPIKE And I should do what in my spare time? Sit at home knitting cunning sweater sets?
BUFFY Would it keep you out of my way?
RILEY She's right. You shouldn't be out here when she's patrolling.
SPIKE Oh! I saw that. Looks like neither boy's entirely welcome. You should take him home, Slayer. Make him stay there. I've got knitting needles he can borrow.
BUFFY Spike ... I just saw you taste your own nose blood, you know what? I'm too grossed out to hear anything you have to say. Go home.
SPIKE It's blood! It's what I do!
RILEY Hey, hope I didn't get in the way.
BUFFY Of course not. I-I was just ... startled. And, you know I don't ... love the idea of you patrolling alone.
RILEY Not much for bench-warming.
BUFFY No, you made the squad. You ... threw that vampire like he was a ... teeny-weeny little vampire.
RILEY Hey, wanna go again? Come on, I bet this place is just teeming with aerodynamic vampires.
BUFFY Nah. Unless you wanna go back and kill Spike for the fun of it?
SPIKE I will know your blood, Slayer. I will make your neck my chalice ... and drink deep.
SPIKE Ow!
WILLOW You can't possibly be arguing that Marat didn't betray the French Revolutionaries.
WILLOW This was the guy who declared the rights of man, and then the next thing you know he's ... killing Girondin like it's going out of style.
BUFFY Will, you're totally missing my point. Now, I agree that Marat wasn't a real martyr, but the death in the tub ... the neck wound, all that blood, just a little more fang-y than knife-y. I mean, Charlotte Corday wasn't a real martyr either, but...
WILLOW Buffy!
BUFFY What?
WILLOW Listen to us! We-we're arguing! We're having a debate about a college lecture! I have dreamt of this day since ... forever! You are turning into quite the student. Should I be watching my occipital lobe?
BUFFY Your what?
WILLOW Occipital. The lobe in the back of your brain. You know, like, should I be watching my back? But, you know, the ... back of your brain.
BUFFY Apparently not. Don't worry, Will, you still wear the smarty-pants in the family.
WILLOW I don't know. You've been studying ... really a lot.
BUFFY I'm trying. But they're really piling on the reading, and Giles fills any free time I have with extra training ... I'm starting to think this working hard is hard work.
WILLOW Isn't it crazy like that?
BUFFY I thought it was gonna be like in the movies. You know, inspirational music ... a montage, me sharpening my pencils, me reading, writing, falling asleep on a big pile of books with my glasses all crooked, 'cause in my montage I have glasses. But real life is slow, and it's starting to hurt my occipital lobe.
WILLOW Aw. Poor Buffy's brain.
BUFFY Actually, I'm heading to training now. Do you wanna come with?
WILLOW I'm in. Maybe we can argue some more about the French Revolution. Hey! Wasn't that Robespierre the coolest?
BUFFY Robespierre? You're kidding me, right?
WILLOW I'm just gettin' it goin'.
GILES It seems the plans worked perfectly.
XANDER Yes, blueprints, not a bad idea. That, and getting straight measure twice, cut once. You know, for the longest time I had it backwards. Mess-y!
GILES Well, I must say, I'm very impressed.
XANDER Yeah, carpentry is pretty cool.
ANYA Oh! Who put the monkey heads near the Styx water? Do we *want* to pick exploded monkey out of our hair?
BUFFY Trick or treat!
GILES Hello, you two, come on in.
WILLOW Thank you, kind proprietor.
TARA Hey, you.
WILLOW Hey! Oh, wow, this place looks great. Oh, I feel like a witch in a magic shop. Ooh. Are these real newt eyes?
GILES No, too ... rich for my blood, I'm afraid. No, these are salamander eyes, it's the ... cataracts which give them their newt-like appearance. They're really equally effective, though, it's ... just a matter of overcoming snobberies.
XANDER I'm telling you Giles. You gotta set up a blind taste test and prove once and for all that generic amphibian eyeballs are just as good.
WILLOW I don't know. If you ask me, the newt name still means something.
GILES You ready to train?
BUFFY You betcha.
GILES Shall we then?
BUFFY We shall then.
TARA I just ... keep thinking how cool it would be, if we got a real psychic to sit up here and read fortunes and stuff.
WILLOW You should do it.
TARA Not me. But, but I'd love to, to watch and learn. From someone who's really good, you know?
WILLOW You're really good. I'll prove it. Here, do me.
TARA Hmm.
WILLOW What do you see?
TARA Willow hand.
BUFFY Unh! Ow, Riley...
RILEY Just keeping you on your toes.
BUFFY Or off them, as it were. What's gotten into-
BUFFY Oh my god. Look at this place!
BUFFY Thank you. Thank you ... so much.
GILES It's just a start, you need a proper space to train, so-
BUFFY I love it.
RILEY So come on, let's test this puppy out. Think you can take me? What's the matter, afraid of a little competition?
BUFFY It must have been so much work.
XANDER I'm the dummy man. I mean, I ... made the dummy. The thing that you hit that doesn't hit back. That, I made.
BUFFY It's great. I-it's all great.
GILES Well, you've earned it. Truly.
BUFFY Thank you guys so much. You're like my ... fairy godmother and Santa Claus and Q all wrapped up into one.
BUFFY Q from Bond, not Star Trek.
BUFFY I'm gonna go change.
SPIKE Oh Pacey, you blind idiot. Can't you see she doesn't love you?
SPIKE Well, well, well. Looky here.
HARMONY Is it safe? Has Buffy gotten to you yet? I saw her patrolling just now ... with a stake! She won't give up until she's killed me to death!
SPIKE Buffy's looking for you.
HARMONY Of course! That's why I'm on the lam. Didn't you hear? I'm totally her arch-nemesis!
SPIKE Is that right. I must have missed the memo.
HARMONY There was a mem-? Spike, oh my god! This is like a real emergency! Uhh! I need a hideout so bad. You're my only hope. We're just gonna have to rise above ... our petty differences... Listen, Spike ... I'm desperate.
SPIKE Desperate, are you?
HARMONY Come on, Spike. Pretty please? I'll do anything!
SPIKE Anything, will you?
HARMONY Yeah! I said I'll do anything.
HARMONY Ohhhh. You mean will I have sex with you? Well, yeah.
SPIKE Taking up smoking, are you?
HARMONY I *am* a villain, Spike, hellooooo.
SPIKE I guess you are at that. What with the slayer on your tail and all.
SPIKE She's not the type to give up, either. She'll hunt you down, day and night, till you're too tired and too hungry to run any more. And then? Then... that is you.
SPIKE I guess you're gonna have to kill her.
HARMONY I tried! It was all hard and stuff! You do it.
SPIKE I'd love to. But, I can't. Remember? I've got this cute little government chip in my head.
HARMONY Oh, right. Guess it'll have to be me after all. Can you help with the thinking?
SPIKE Yeah. I suppose I could do that.
RILEY Yeah.
BUFFY Mm, that was relaxing.
RILEY You, uh ... wanna relax some more?
BUFFY Again? Right away again?
RILEY Maybe you're too tired.
BUFFY Hey. I have the endurance of ten men.
RILEY Let's make it women, okay? Just for the imagery.
BUFFY Whatever. You know, it takes a lot to wear me out.
RILEY Oh, I love a challenge.
BUFFY Mm.
DAWN_VOICEOVER Well, wouldn't you?
DAWN Every kid tries to make the substitute cry. It's like a rite of passage.
JOYCE I certainly would not. Being a substitute is an *extremely* difficult job. Besides... Honestly, Dawn, how many bowls of cereal are you planning on eating?
DAWN Oh, these aren't for eating. I'm just trying to get the extra out of the way so I could... get this. Anyway, I want eggs.
JOYCE You want the cereal prize, but you don't want the cereal. You *are* growing up. All righty, half an omelette coming up.
DAWN Oh, um, with ketchup if you please?
JOYCE Mm-hmm.
JOYCE Oh, what is the... Who are you?
BUFFY Hey. How's Mom? Are you okay?
DAWN I'm okay.
MAN And your mom's doing just fine.
DAWN This is Ben. He gave me his stethoscope.
BEN *Lent* you his stethoscope. Buffy, right? I'm Ben, I'm an intern here. I've had the pleasure of hanging out with the renowned Dr. Dawn here while your mom's being tested.
RILEY So what's goin' on? What happened?
BEN Well, she's doing okay now ... the doctors don't really know what caused the collapse...
BEN ... it could've just been a dizzy spell, low blood sugar, that sort of thing.
BUFFY But it's nothing bad. I, I mean it's not ... serious, right?
BEN Very unlikely. So your mom doesn't have a ... history of fainting?
BUFFY No. I mean, not that I know of. She's usually really healthy.
BEN Well, I think they'll be running tests for a few more hours...
BEN ...then they'll probably want her to come back for some follow-up tests in a couple weeks, but it really doesn't look like anything too serious.
BUFFY Oh, thank god. I was freaking out.
BEN I think you'll be able to take her home before too long.
RILEY Well, that is definitely good news.
DOCTOR I know I'm repeating myself here, but I don't know what else to say to convince you.
DOCTOR I have never in all my years of medicine let a patient with tachycardia this severe leave a hospital.
RILEY You said you couldn't keep me.
DOCTOR Legally, no, I can't force you to do a thing. But with that pulse, believe me, I'd get on my knees and beg you if I thought I could change your mind.
RILEY You can't. I'm going home.
DOCTOR And your friend here can't convince you to-
RILEY I'm going.
DOCTOR All right then, but you're leaving against my recommendation.
BUFFY What's going on? What are you doing? What if you have a heart attack?
RILEY Listen to me. Calm down.
BUFFY *Me* calm down? I'm not the one with a pulse of a hundred and fifty.
RILEY My heart's different than yours, Buffy. It works differently now, but it's okay.
BUFFY But you're still a human, Riley. You could still have a heart attack.
RILEY I'm a human who was used as a lab rat for months.
JOYCE Hi.
BUFFY Hey. How are you?
JOYCE Oh ... embarrassed, mostly. I'm sorry to put you through this. But, no more tests, so you can take this pincushion home.
RILEY Yes. Let's, uh, get outta here.
WILLOW What about a crossword? Some people say feed a cold, I say puzzle it.
JOYCE Oh, no thanks, Willow.
DAWN I like chicken fingers with mustard when I'm sick.
JOYCE I know you do, sweetie. I can make us some later.
BUFFY Oh, uh-uh. You are sitting right here on this couch today.
JOYCE I feel silly lying here like a lump!
WILLOW You could make a game out of it. A-a very quiet game, about being a lump.
JOYCE I feel fine. Honestly, I'm more concerned about Riley than I am about me.
BUFFY You shouldn't even be thinking about that. He's not worried, so I don't think we should be.
BUFFY I don't get what he's thinking. Why isn't he worried?
WILLOW Maybe he thinks his body can handle it. He *is* in really good shape.
BUFFY Nobody's body can handle a heart attack.
WILLOW I know. I'm sorry, Buffy. I'm trying too hard to make it okay.
BUFFY I just keep coming back to the Initiative.
WILLOW It does have that icky government feel to it.
DAWN Did you know that one time the CIA tried to kill Fidel Castro with poisonous aspirin?
BUFFY Dawn, please.
BUFFY I know I have to do something, I just don't know what.
DAWN Another time the CIA-
BUFFY Dawn!
DAWN It's important.
DAWN Tried to make Castro go crazy by putting itching powder in his beard. It's about the government!
WILLOW Call the Initiative. If they know what's wrong with him, they have to help.
BUFFY Yeah, but call them how? First of all, they don't exist any more, and secondly, they never *claimed* to exist in the first place.
BUFFY It's so unfair. I mean, i-it's like Big Brother can spy on you all the time, and-and the second I have something to say, no one will listen!
DAWN Sounds more like Big Sister.
WILLOW There has to be a way.
BUFFY Like what? Take a tour of the White House and pretend to get lost, and look for some door with a sign on it that says Secret Government Monster Hunters?
DAWN If they're really spying on you all the time, you just say something so you know they'll hear you. Like sometimes, I write fake things in my diary in case...
BUFFY I gotta go. Uh, see you guys later.
DAWN What'd I say?
BUFFY Riley?
BUFFY Riley's in trouble. He needs help.
GUY No way, man.
RILEY I'm out.
RILEY Graham.
GRAHAM Riley. Can we talk?
GRAHAM Agent Goodman, Agent Brown.
RILEY So talk.
GRAHAM What's goin' on, man? You gotta get this taken care of immediately. We gotta get you into an operating room.
RILEY Very convincing. Makes me completely wanna put myself under government control.
RILEY Please take me where they can make me unconscious and naked.
GRAHAM Hey, you think I'd pull something on you?
RILEY You're still in. I'm out. I don't know what orders you're following.
GRAHAM Oh, come on. You know Walsh pumped all those chemicals and crap into us. You got more than anyone. She messed us up bad.
RILEY And now the government's knocking themselves out to kiss it and make it better.
GRAHAM Riley, I'm tellin' you, you need help. I'm not saying it to trick you.
RILEY Maybe you even believe it.
GRAHAM I know it. You don't want this.
RILEY You're sure you got the fix for it?
GRAHAM Yeah. We got a guy, a doctor. He's gonna take care of you, and we're going to him now. I'm not givin' you a choice.
RILEY I guess you're not.
BUFFY So you messed up and now he's gone and when are you even gonna tell me what's wrong with him?
GRAHAM I'm not permitted to say.
BUFFY Say.
GRAHAM Hyperadrenal overload and a bunch of stuff that sounds even worse than that, and all it means is he's way stronger than he oughta be and feeling no pain. His heart can't take it. We've been at him for weeks about it.
GRAHAM There's a specialist waiting at Sunnydale General, fourth floor neurology. Get Riley there. If you don't-
BUFFY I'll get him there.
GRAHAM I'll tell the doc.
GRAHAM Buffy.
BUFFY If you tell me to hurry ... I'll kick your ass.
WILLOW Poor Riley.
GILES Could he have simply gone back to his apartment?
BUFFY No, he's not at his apartment, he's not at the gym, he's not at the library ... he's gone somewhere where he doesn't wanna be found.
ANYA So basically he's gone AWOL.
BUFFY Basically exactly.
WILLOW Poor Buffy.
XANDER Maybe he just needs some time alone. Like, I had this friend once, who really liked this girl, and ... he got all worried that maybe she didn't like him back... and maybe that made him act like a total jerk. Maybe Riley reminds me of that friend.
WILLOW What are you talking about?
XANDER Then again, maybe not. Maybe he just wants attention.
BUFFY Well, here's a hot tip, if you want attention? *Be* there so people can give it to you.
ANYA I care about you, Xander.
XANDER Thanks.
ANYA Don't be insecure.
XANDER Thanks ... I won't.
ANYA And, I also have this friend and, uh, I have it on really good authority that she really likes that guy, your friend ... and, by the by, my friend-
BUFFY You guys, enough! Okay, Riley is in real danger here. Anya, Xander, why don't you guys check the docks.
XANDER Aye aye.
WILLOW Tara and I can scope out the burned-out school. Riley hid there once. Maybe he ... feels it's homey or something.
BUFFY Homey. You know what else he might find homey in a ... dank, unpleasant evil sort of way? The Initiative caves. I don't know them too well.
GILES We do have an associate who knows those caves like the back of his ... melanin-deprived hand.
BUFFY I *so* don't want to deal with Spike right now. That guy is really starting to bug me in that special I wanna shove something wooden through his heart kinda way.
WILLOW He does seem extra twitchy lately. Maybe the whole not killing is gettin' to him.
BUFFY Plus hanging out all day in that moldy crypt, you just *know* he's doing something nasty.
SPIKE Okay, is it bigger than a breadbox?
HARMONY No. Four left.
SPIKE So it's smaller than a breadbox.
HARMONY No! Only three!
SPIKE Harmony ... is it a sodding breadbox?
HARMONY Yes! Oh my god! Someone's blondie bear is a twenty-question genius!
HARMONY She's found me!
BUFFY I've got a proposition for you.
SPIKE Funny, I've got a proposition for you, what about knocking? Seems only fair since we vamps can't enter your flat without an invite, you could at least - Say, look at those pretty pieces of paper.
BUFFY Riley's sick with some Initiative thing and he's missing. I think he might be in the caves. You find him, bring him to the fourth floor of the hospital, their doctors get to him in time... you get the cash.
SPIKE Oh, dear, is the enormous hall monitor sick? Tell me, is he gonna die?
BUFFY He is not the only person that can die.
SPIKE Hey. I'm just saying, if it's really that important to you, I think I'll get half now.
HARMONY So? What'd she say about me?
OVERHEISER Any word?
GRAHAM They'll be here any minute.
GRAHAM That's soon enough, right? I mean, if we bring him in now?
OVERHEISER I'll be honest. I'm not sure it's soon enough if you brought him in yesterday.
GRAHAM Finally.
SPIKE You got yourself a new patient, doc.
OVERHEISER Look, you don't understand. This is a complicated neurological procedure and I've never performed it before.
SPIKE Little performance anxiety, eh doc? Butterflies in the old belly? Harm, do us a favor. Shoot the nasty butterflies for the good doctor. There you go. It's not so complicated. Just do whatever those Initiative lab monkeys did, only backwards.
OVERHEISER This is a medical school, not a proper operating facility, these instruments...
SPIKE They look pointy enough. They'll do.
OVERHEISER You're not listening. That chip is deeply imbedded in your cerebral cortex. Removing it could leave you a vegetable.
SPIKE That's not gonna happen, mate. See, I have faith in your survival instinct.
SPIKE Yeah. You'll have me up and killing before the night's over.
SPIKE Come on, doc! You'll do me right. Nothing bad'll happen to you.
HARMONY Oops. String was slippy.
WILLOW_VOICEOVER Riley!
TARA This place kinda creeps me out.
WILLOW You shoulda been here when it was a school. Riley!
WILLOW Oof. Darkness.
TARA Piles of it. We shoulda brought a flashlight.
WILLOW Ooh! I know! Better to light a candle than curse the damn darkness. A little spell.
!_(Latin,_translation let there be light)
TARA Wow.
WILLOW There, that's better.
WILLOW Riley! Come on out!
TARA How'd you do that? With the light?
WILLOW Oh, you know. You taught me.
TARA I taught you teeny Tinkerbell light.
WILLOW Okay, so I ... tinkered with the Tinkerbell. It was easy. And besides, isn't this better than ... using a flashlight like some kind of doofus?
BUFFY Riley? Riley, answer me. Please.
BUFFY Riley?
RILEY You know, this doesn't even hurt.
BUFFY Your hand is bleeding.
RILEY Don't feel a thing.
BUFFY This stops now. I'm taking you to the doctor.
RILEY The one from the government, you mean? Like the ones who did this to me in the first place?
BUFFY He's the only one that understands what's wrong with you. He's the only one that can help.
RILEY What's wrong with me? I'm more powerful than I've ever been, Buffy. Most people would kill to feel this way.
BUFFY Yeah, and this feeling is *going* to kill you. Riley, your body was not built for this kind of strength-
RILEY I can handle it. This is my deal, Buffy, just ... back off.
BUFFY What is this?
BUFFY What's happening to you?
RILEY I go back ... let the government get whimsical with my innards again ... They could do anything that- Best-case scenario, they turn me into Joe Normal, just... Just another guy.
BUFFY And that's not enough for you?
RILEY It's not enough for *you*.
BUFFY Why would you say that?
RILEY Come on. Your last boyfriend wasn't exactly a civilian.
BUFFY So that's what this is about? You're going to die, all over some macho pissing contest.
RILEY It's not about him. It's about us. You're getting stronger every day, more powerful. I can't touch you. Every day, you're just ... a little further out of my reach.
BUFFY You wanna touch me? I'm right here. I'm not the one running away.
RILEY Not yet.
BUFFY So you have this all figured out? I'm bailing because you're not in the super club.
RILEY It's human nature.
BUFFY Don't Psych 101 me. Not now. Not after everything that ... Nobody has ever known me the way you do. Nobody. I've opened up to you in ways that I've never opened up to ... God, you're just sitting back there thinking that none of this means anything to me.
RILEY I never said that.
BUFFY Because it obviously doesn't mean anything to you. Do you really think so little of me-
RILEY Buffy.
BUFFY No! No. Do you think that I spent the last year with you because you had super powers? If that's what I wanted, then I'd be dating Spike. Riley, I need you. I need you with me ... and I need you healthy. But if you wanna throw it all away because you don't trust me, then ... then I'm still gonna make you go to that doctor.
RILEY Take me to him.
BUFFY We have to hurry.
RILEY Loving you is the scariest thing I've ever done, Buffy.
BUFFY I don't know why.
BUFFY The doctor said we didn't have much time.
HARMONY I read in a magazine that some women think a man's real sex organ is his brain.
HARMONY Yecch! No contest. I mean, look at it. It's so ... pink and wriggly-looking. Can I touch it?
SPIKE/OVERHEISER No!
HARMONY Oh my god, you're awake?
OVERHEISER Local anesthetic.
HARMONY Wow, Spikey, how does it feel?
SPIKE Like someone's cutting into my brain with a knife, you silly bint.
HARMONY You know what it means that he can't hurt any living thing? It means he can't even pick flowers.
SPIKE What? Yes I can!
OVERHEISER Please be quiet.
HARMONY Is it supposed to do that?
OVERHEISER Please. For god's sake, please, be quiet.
HARMONY Listen, buster. I don't see a crossbow in *your* hands, okay?
SPIKE Harmony, if your incessant prattling bolloxes up this operation, I'm gonna personally yank out your pink and wriggly tongue.
HARMONY What are you looking at?
BUFFY Uh-oh.
RILEY Graham. Graham. How many fingers I got?
GRAHAM Seventeen.
GRAHAM Hostile 17 and a blonde girl.
BUFFY Spike and Harmony, together again.
GILES Where's Dr. Overheiser?
BUFFY Uh, Spike must have taken him. What would Spike want with - The chip. He's gonna force the doctor to remove the chip from his brain.
BUFFY Riley?
RILEY I'm okay. Okay.
GRAHAM We're running out of time. We don't find the medic soon, he's not gonna make it.
BUFFY Okay, okay, brain surgery. He, he's gonna need a medical facility, he-he's gonna need, uh, uh, equipment...
GRAHAM This is a big hospital.
BUFFY No, uh-uh, he wouldn't do it here. It's too risky. We'll split up. Graham, get on the horn, or the ... pipe, or whatever you guys get on, I-I want you to check animal hospitals, doctors' offices...
RILEY Hey, about before...
GRAHAM We're good. Apologize later, if you're not dead.
BUFFY You are *not* going to die.
RILEY Bet you say that to all the boys.
BUFFY No. There is one peroxided pest whose number is up. When I get my hands on Spike, I'm gonna rip his head off, I'm gonna...
SPIKE ...bathe in the slayer's blood. Gonna dive in it. Swim in it.
SPIKE I'm gonna do the bloody backstroke.
HARMONY I see it, Spikey! I see the chip! It's nestled in there like ... a pretty little Easter egg with your brain all around it like that green plastic grassy stuff ... only this is more a beige, like-
OVERHEISER Would you please put out that cigarette? It's really not allowed.
HARMONY Oh yeah? Says who?
HARMONY Oh god, sorry! Didn't see the sign!
OVERHEISER The chip's out. Didn't think I could do it, I just ... it's out.
SPIKE Yeah?
HARMONY Yay! Yay for Spikey!
SPIKE Right then. Stitch me up, doc. Got places to go. And slayers to kill.
SPIKE Listen to me. My stomach's growling, I'm so starved. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to have me a little snack.
SPIKE Oh, don't worry. I won't fill up on the bread. I'll still have plenty of room for the main course.
SPIKE Slayer!
SPIKE Suit up, Harm.
BUFFY Stay here. We're gonna need you.
SPIKE Buffy. I swear I was just thinking of you. I wanted to tell you the great news. My head's all clear now. No more bug-zapper in my noggin.
BUFFY That means I get to kill you.
SPIKE You get to try.
HARMONY Oops.
SPIKE At long last.
BUFFY Riley!
BUFFY Riley.
SPIKE A penny?
OVERHEISER I told you I couldn't do it.
BUFFY Oh god. Doctor! Doctor, we need you *now*!
SPIKE Buffy, Buffy, Buffy! Everywhere I turn, she's there! That nasty little face, that ... bouncing shampoo-commercial hair, that whole sodding holier-than-thou attitude.
HARMONY Well, aren't we kinda unholy, by the-
SPIKE She follows me, you know, tracks me down. I'm her pet project. Drive Spike round the bend. Makes every day a fresh bout of torture.
HARMONY Spike!
SPIKE You don't understand. I can't get rid of her. She's everywhere. She's haunting me, Harmony!
SPIKE This ... has got to end.
OVERHEISER All patched up.
BUFFY How's it goin' in there?
RILEY Good. Back to normal.
BUFFY Yep.
BUFFY And see ... I'm still touchable.
RILEY Give me a week or so to heal, and ... I'll take full advantage of that fact.
BUFFY Are you gonna be okay? 'Cause I should really go check on my mom.
RILEY Yeah. Yeah, go ahead. I'll be fine.
BUFFY I'll talk to you later.
GRAHAM It's a good thing Buffy found you when she did, 'cause you were about to detonate big-time. Always said she's pretty impressive.
RILEY You know, she really is.
GRAHAM But you know you don't belong here, right? This town? I mean, you're nothin' here.
RILEY Hey. What are you saying?
GRAHAM Come on, man. You know it's true. There's nothing for you here.
RILEY There's her.
GRAHAM Okay, right, there's her. And? You used to have a mission, and now you're what? The mission's boyfriend? Mission's true love?
GRAHAM You belong with us.
SPIKE Should have known it's you. Been nearly six hours.
BUFFY Well, it would've been less if I wasn't busy cleaning up your mess.
SPIKE *My* mess? I just *borrowed* the doc. The mess is yours, Slayer. Yours and the boy's.
BUFFY I'm done.
BUFFY Spike, you're a killer. And I shoulda done this *years* ago.
SPIKE You know what? Do it. Bloody just do it.
BUFFY What?
SPIKE End ... my ... torment. Seeing you, every day, everywhere I go, every time I turn around. Take me ... out of a world ... that has you in it! Just kill me!
BUFFY Spike ... I want you.
SPIKE Buffy, I love you.
SPIKE God, I love you so much.
SPIKE Oh, god, no.
SPIKE Please, no.
