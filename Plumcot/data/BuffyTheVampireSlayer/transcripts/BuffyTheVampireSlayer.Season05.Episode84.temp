GILES_VOICEOVER Previously on
SPIKE_VOICEOVER Buffy, I love you.
WILLOW We conjure the goddess Thespia to help us locate demonic energy.
TARA Are you sure we're ready for that?
WILLOW Or not.
GLORY Tell me ... where ... the key is.
MONK The key is energy. It's a portal. My brethren sent it to you.
BUFFY Dawn. She's not my sister?
MONK She doesn't know that.
WILLOW_VOICEOVER Tell me a story.
TARA_VOICEOVER Okay. Once upon a time, there was, um ... a kitty. She was very little, and she was all alone, and nobody wanted her.
WILLOW_VOICEOVER This is a very upsetting story.
TARA_VOICEOVER Oh, oh, but it gets better.
TARA_VOICEOVER 'Cause one day the kitty was running around in the street and a man came, and swooped her up...
TARA And took her to the pound.
TARA And at the pound there were lots of other kitties, and there were puppies, and some ferrets...
WILLOW Were there dolphins?
TARA Yes. Many dolphins at the pound.
WILLOW Or was there a camel?
TARA There was the front of a camel. A half camel.
WILLOW Did the kitty get chosen by some nice people?
TARA Well, now you ruined the ending.
WILLOW Mmm... I'm sleepy.
TARA Do you mind if I keep the light on? I was gonna look up some spells.
WILLOW It's fine. I don't need to be snuggled.
TARA Vixen!
WILLOW You've been spell gal night and day lately.
TARA Well, I just wanna keep up with you, and I'm ... well, I just like to be useful. You know, to the gang? I just ... never ... feel useful.
WILLOW You are. You're essential.
TARA Do you think Buffy found out anything tonight?
WILLOW At the factory? I don't know. If there was something, I figured she'd call us.
GILES Uh, I don't know what to say.
BUFFY Tell me about it.
GILES She has no idea?
BUFFY No. She thinks she's my kid sister.
GILES Are you going to tell her?
BUFFY How can I? She'd freak, and that's the last thing we need.
BUFFY We have to keep her safe.
GILES This ... woman, this, uh, whatever she was... she knows you now. Should we be thinking about ... sending Dawn away?
BUFFY Away where?
GILES I don't know, uh ... your father's?
BUFFY Yeah, he's, um ... in Spain, with his secretary. Living the cliche. I called him when Mom got sick, he hasn't even...
GILES I'm sorry.
BUFFY When he bailed on us ... I remember, Dawn cried for a week. Except she didn't. She wasn't there, but ... I can still feel what it was like.
BUFFY They sent her to me, Giles. I think ... I have to take care of her. I want to.
GILES Do we tell the others?
BUFFY No. No one. They-they'd act weird around her, and it's, it's safer for everyone if they don't know.
GILES Yes. We have to find out who this woman is, and what she needs Dawn for.
GILES I mean, if she comes after you-
BUFFY She'll come. She'll come for us.
GLORY Okay. Now I'm upset.
XANDER Ow! Thumb! Necessary opposable thumb!
RILEY Sorry. Crybaby.
BUFFY You know what, you guys, just leave it here.
RILEY Got it.
DAWN I don't need help.
BUFFY Just be careful.
ANYA But we just helped her move the stuff in a few days ago... ...and it was fun!
GILES People help each other out, Anya. It's one of our strange customs.
BUFFY Giles, I noticed you're doing the smallest amount of helping that can actually be called helping.
GILES Well, I saw myself in more of a ... patriarchal sort of role. You know, lots of pointing and scowling. You two, stop that!
RILEY He started it.
XANDER He called me a bad name. I think it was bad. It might've been Latin.
GILES Stop it, or you're going to break something.
BUFFY Or I'm going to break something.
XANDER Still can't believe you're giving up this cherry corner suite.
ANYA Just a few days after we moved you in!
BUFFY It's no big. You know, with Mom not being well, I'm hardly ever here. Just figured I'd ... save a little cash for this semester, that's all.
WILLOW I think that's smart.
XANDER Still, it's hard to give up. You've got the two entrances lot of opportunity for bawdy French farce, and everybody loves bawdy-
BUFFY Where's Dawn?
RILEY I think she just walked out.
BUFFY Dawn!
DAWN Some of your CDs are my CDs.
BUFFY I know. Come help me fold.
RILEY Starting to feel that fight?
BUFFY Nothing like gettin' your ass kicked to ... make your ass hurt.
DAWN You'll totally take her next time.
XANDER 'Cause you'll have backup, baby. She's messin' with all of us.
GILES Yes, uh, we'll, we'll, uh, find her weaknesses, and then, uh-
TARA Yeah. You learn her source, and, uh, we'll introduce her to her insect reflection.
TARA Um ... that, that was funny if you, um, studied Taglarin mythic rites... and are a complete dork.
RILEY Oh, then how come Xander didn't laugh?
XANDER I don't know that Taglarin stuff.
RILEY Oh.
WILLOW Hey. You wanna start taking stuff down to the car?
TARA Yeah.
WILLOW Okay.
TARA Stupid...
WILLOW Okay. Guys, now remember, you have to be at the Bronze by eight.
BUFFY Bronze.
WILLOW Tomorrow night! Tara's birthday!
BUFFY Right! Right.
ANYA We have to bring presents, right? Birth is a present thing?
XANDER I got something ... picked out, yeah.
WILLOW You-you guys can all still come, right? I mean, I know there's ... this new evil and all, but...
BUFFY No, no. We'll be there. I could definitely use a break from all this craziness.
BEN What's the story?
INTERN Another crazy. Got her family out there.
BEN OK, let me guess, no history of mental problems.
INTERN Yeah. That makes like five this month.
BEN Ah, they told me Sunnydale was gonna be interesting.
INTERN Yeah. Aren't you off?
BEN Yeah, as of now. Have fun.
GLORY I need a favor.
ANYA Thank you for coming. We value your patronage. Please come again for more purchases!
GILES Could we please be a little less effusive, Anya? Don't want to frighten the people.
ANYA I'm just so excited. They come in, I help them ... they give us money in exchange for goods ... you give me money for working for you ... I have a place in the world now. I'm part of the system. I'm a working gal.
GILES Yes. Well, why don't you start organizing the shipping orders.
ANYA Oh, no, that's boring. I just want to do the money parts.
BUFFY Well, sure I forgot about the party. I mean, there's kind of a lot going on. And it's not ... you know ... the most thrilling social event of the season.
XANDER Yeah ... it's a big deal for Willow, though. I mean, you are gonna be there?
BUFFY Yeah. Barring monsters.
ANYA Hey, hi.
XANDER Gimme sugar. I've come to buy sugar.
ANYA Mmm. We value your patronage.
BUFFY So, any breakthroughs on the identity of Miss Congeniality?
GILES Well, I have narrowed it down somewhat.
BUFFY Your definition of narrow is impressively wide.
GILES Well, you didn't give me much to go on. She-she looks human, so the mug shots aren't any use, and, uh, you can't be more specific about what she's like?
BUFFY She was kinda like Cordelia, actually. I'm pretty sure she dyes her hair.
GILES Right! That one, of course. Our work is done.
BUFFY There must be something on her.
XANDER The answer is somewhere here. It's right in front of us and we're too blind to see it!
XANDER I'm helping, I'm reading, I'm quiet.
BUFFY So ... what'd you get her?
XANDER Huh?
BUFFY Tara. You said you got a present already.
XANDER Yeah, that was a tangled web of lies, sweetie. I'm not really sure what kind of thing she'd ... I mean, I don't really know her that well.
BUFFY I know.
XANDER I mean, she's nice.
BUFFY Yeah! Yeah, nice ... nice. I-it's just, I-I sort of...
XANDER I don't necessarily get her ... but she's really nice.
BUFFY Yeah. There's ... just that thing.
XANDER That thing.
BUFFY That ... thing of not understanding-
XANDER Half of what she says?
BUFFY As for example. But she's super nice.
XANDER You betcha.
BUFFY Think there'll be a lot of Wiccas there, heavy Wiccan crowd?
XANDER Well, that's sort of her deal. Her and Willow are all Wiccie. Swingin' with the Wiccan lifestyle.
BUFFY Which is cool.
XANDER Well, yeah.
BUFFY I just hope we fit in, not awkward.
XANDER With Willow it's like, she's got this ... whole new thing in her life. But she's still Willow, so I can always figure her out. But Tara, I just know she likes Willow, and she already has one of those.
BUFFY Ugh! I have a present-buying headache. Tara's damn birthday is just one too many things for me to worry about.
XANDER Relax. You should take a few minutes. Train or stretch out. You should do something to ... work off the tension.
SPIKE You want me, Slayer, come and get me.
BUFFY Oh, I'm coming. I'm coming right-
HARMONY -now!
HARMONY What are you thinking?
SPIKE All about you, baby.
HARMONY Aww. You're my little lamb.
GILES Come up with anything yet?
XANDER Well, candles, maybe, or bath oils of some kind.
BUFFY I saw a really cute sweater at Bloomy's ... but, I think I want me to have it.
GILES And you are talking about what on earth?
BUFFY Tara's birthday. We're at a loss.
GILES You're in a magic shop, and you can't think what Tara would like. I believe you're both profoundly stupid.
XANDER Well, we don't really know ... the kind of things witches like. What, are we gonna get her some cheesy crystal ball?
GILES Bloody well better not. I've got mine already wrapped.
DONNY Uh, are all these magic books?
GILES Uh, private collection. Uh, books for sale are against the walls over there.
DONNY So all these books got spells in 'em? Turn people into frogs, things like that?
XANDER Yeah, we're building a race of frog people. It's a good time.
DONNY So, uh... You all witches? Hey, don't do a spell on me now.
GILES Was there something in particular you were looking for?
WILLOW Her insect reflection. That is so good.
TARA I just thought that'd be funny, you know, if her center of power was-
DONNY Whatta you know.
DONNY What's the matter? You don't have a hug for your big brother?
WILLOW Brother?
TARA Willow, this is Donny.
WILLOW Hi.
DONNY Nice to meet you.
TARA And, uh, these are my-my friends.
DONNY What, uh, all of you hang out? Wow. That's more people than you met in high school.
TARA How did you fi - I, I mean, how come you came?
DONNY Well, duh, birthday girl. Uh, we came down in the camper, been all over the campus.
TARA We?
DONNY Look what I found!
TARA Uh, Dad, hi.
MR._MACLAY Well, here's my girl.
TARA S-such a s-surprise.
DONNY Yes.
TARA Cousin Beth.
BETH Hey.
MR._MACLAY One of your dorm-mates said I might ... find you here.
TARA Oh. Oh, um, these are, these are friends. Um, this is Mr. Giles, um, he runs the shop.
GILES_VOICEOVER How do you do?
MR._MACLAY Pleasure. Well, I, I don't mean to interrupt your plans, I know we've come on you kind of suddenly, but I thought we could have dinner.
TARA Okay.
MR._MACLAY Why don't I pick you up at six, And we'll ... do some catching up.
TARA Yes, sir.
MR._MACLAY Forgive me for running out. We're double-parked.
DONNY Nice to meet you all.
WILLOW That's so weird. Your ... whole family.
TARA Yeah.
WILLOW They seem nice.
TARA You know, they-they're okay. Families are always-
WILLOW They make you crazy.
TARA Usually. Wanna get into research mode?
WILLOW Sure.
BUFFY Honey, I'm home.
RILEY Did you have a good day at work?
BUFFY It's a rat race.
RILEY I squared away the rest of your stuff. Wouldn't even know you ever left.
BUFFY Oh, you're a god. You're like the ... god of boyfriends.
RILEY Nah, I just like it when you owe me favors.
BUFFY Well, this earns you a big favor. There could be outfits.
RILEY Ooh. Be still my heart.
DAWN See ya later.
BUFFY Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, where do you think you're going?
DAWN I'm going to Melinda's for dinner.
BUFFY Since when?
DAWN Now-ish.
BUFFY You can't. I-it's not safe for you to walk there.
DAWN It's just across the street. What is the big deal, I'm just gonna go-
BUFFY No. It's family night. And besides, Melinda's a bad influence. I don't like you hanging out with someone that ... short.
DAWN I am so glad you're moving back into the house. This is the source of my gladness.
BUFFY She makes me crazy.
RILEY That's ... kinda the word I was searching for.
BUFFY What? She shouldn't be going over there.
RILEY Yeah, a lot of young people nowadays are experimenting with shortness. Gotta nip that in the bud.
BUFFY She ... can't be running out whenever she'd like.
RILEY It's more than that.
BUFFY What do you mean?
RILEY You tell me.
BUFFY We all have to be careful. This ... demon chick is ... exciting and new. I don't know what I'm up against.
RILEY If we're in trouble here I could contact Graham, maybe get the government boys on it-
BUFFY No! No, I-I-I don't want them anywhere near this.
RILEY Just a suggestion.
BUFFY Look, the fewer people that are involved, the safer I will feel.
RILEY Every time I think I'm getting close to you ... I gotta take off.
BUFFY Wait! What?
RILEY I'll call you later.
BUFFY Riley! I *want* you to help. I'm not-
RILEY Yeah. Know you got a lot on your mind. You decide you wanna let me in on any of it, let me know. I'll come running.
MR._MACLAY The door wasn't locked. I was a little early. I suppose you ... wanted me to see all these ... toys. You don't even try to hide it any more. I'd hoped maybe you'd gotten over the whole witchcraft thing. That if we let you go, you'd ... get it out of your system. Then they told me to look for you in ... that store.
TARA I didn't - I, I didn't kn-know that you were coming.
MR._MACLAY Of course we came. We haven't heard from you in months. Your birthday's getting closer and closer. You know what that means.
TARA I don't think it's ... it, it won't mean that-
MR._MACLAY You're turning twenty. It's the same age your mother was when she... Do your friends even know?
TARA Y-yes.
MR._MACLAY Are you lying to me? Tara, you're coming home with us. You know it's the only way.
TARA Home?
MR._MACLAY You can't control what's going to happen. You have evil inside of you and it will come out. And letting yourself work all this magic is only going to make it worse. Where do you think that power comes from?
TARA It ... it doesn't feel evil ... sir.
MR._MACLAY Evil never does. I don't feel much like eating right now. I'll give you some time, but we need to be gone by morning. Your family loves you, Tara, no matter what. How do you think your friends are going to feel when they see your true face?
GLORY Finally. I thought you were gonna nap the whole day away. Stop whining.
GLORY You know, I remember when the Lei-Ach were a proud warrior race, not sneaking around hospitals looking for weak sickly types to suck the bone marrow from. But ... let's talk about my problems for thirty seconds, if that's perfectly all right with you.
GLORY Blonde ... short ... strong for a human ... and massively rude! Broke my shoe, took my monk, do you have any idea who I'm talking about?
GLORY A slayer?? Oh god, please don't tell me I was fighting a vampire slayer! How unbelievably common! If I had friends, and they heard about this ... and you know she's going around telling everybody, I mean she probably just- Pay attention! I am great and I am beautiful, and when I walk into a room all eyes turn to me, because my name is a holy name, and you will listen! Get your friends ... find the girl ... kill the girl ... okay baby? You have the cutest little suppurating sores! Has anyone ever told you that?
WILLOW Hey.
TARA Hey.
WILLOW Was dinner fun?
WILLOW Well, there's Scoobyage afoot. Giles called a meeting about our spankin' new menace.
TARA Oh ... y-you should go, they don't need me for that. You can fill me in.
WILLOW No, no, you have to come. This demon chick is supposed to be really powerful, and I was thinking. Maybe we could try that, that spell, you know, the one to find demons?
TARA That didn't work.
WILLOW Yeah ... but we only tried it once, and I-I think I got some ingredients wrong.
TARA Well, I-I'm tired. Maybe we can do it tomorrow?
WILLOW You sure you don't wanna-
TARA Look, my family's here, okay, I can't just- Not everything is about your friends and stuff.
WILLOW Sorry.
TARA No! No, I mean... There's just so much ... going on. It's just ... I'm, I'm really tired.
WILLOW Okay.
TARA I'll see you in the morning. You can fill me in.
WILLOW Great. We'll be demon hunters.
WILLOW Hey. Am I late? Did I miss any exposition?
GILES No, no, no, no, nothing earth-shattering to relate. I just have a few thoughts, and, uh, wanted to make sure that we were all on the same page.
DAWN Can I buy one of these?
BUFFY No.
DAWN With my own money?
BUFFY I let you come, now sit down and look studious.
GILES Well, first of all, I want to talk to you about ... safety. Um, this creature could be-
BUFFY Will be.
GILES Will be coming after Buffy, and possibly all of us.
TARA Blind Cadria, desolate queen, work my will upon them all. Your curse upon them, my obeisance to you.
GILES Now, I may have a lead on this monk that Buffy spoke of. There, there are a few orders that I-I've read up on-
GILES I-I'm sorry, where was I?
BUFFY The monk.
GILES Yes, um, I'd like us all to start looking at these orders, I-it's possible whichever one this monk belonged to was wiped out entirely...
BARTENDER You shouldn't be coming in here. You got a rep with these monsters. But you come in here... night after night. Are you lookin' to get killed?
RILEY I come for the ambiance. What can I say? This place just reeks of class.
BARTENDER Yeah, well, if Willy was here-
RILEY Well, Willy's not here. Hit me.
FEMALE_VOICE Drinking alone?
SANDY It's not a good sign.
RILEY So they tell me. I buy you a drink, neither one of us has that problem any more, now do we?
SANDY Vodka tonic.
RILEY Vodka tonic.
SANDY I'm Sandy.
RILEY Riley.
SANDY This place is such a dive.
RILEY No no, it's great. You just have to close your eyes, plug up your nostrils, it's fine.
SANDY We ... could go somewhere else. Someplace more ... private.
RILEY Ohhhh, Sandy, Sandy. It's no good. My heart belongs to another. Besides, I don't go out with vampires.
RILEY Never interested in my intellect.
HARMONY Hi baby!
SPIKE Hello, sweetbreads. Have fun?
HARMONY Uhh, it was so exciting. You wouldn't believe it. I went to April Fool's, and absolutely everything was on sale.
SPIKE You *paid* for it?
HARMONY Oh, no. I just killed the clerk. Still, a bargain's a bargain. Oh, I ran into Carol Beets. You know. She sired Brandon, Brandon from the sewer gang ... and she said, the Lei-Ach demon... was recruiting his brethren to kill the slayer!
SPIKE How's that?
HARMONY Apparently, he got recruited by some big nether-wig and now he's on a mission. You think they might actually do it? Kill her?
SPIKE God, that would be ... pleasant.
HARMONY Well, if they do, I think we should do something. Like a gift basket or something. Where are you going?
SPIKE To get a decent seat. If the slayer's gonna die ... I'm gonna watch.
BETH Tara.
TARA Beth, what are you-
BETH I-I was looking for you.
TARA I'm sorry we didn't get to have dinner.
BETH I just ... wanted to see if everything was okay. See if you needed any help with anything. Packing.
TARA Beth, I'm not, I'm n-not coming back with you.
BETH You're not?
TARA I-I don't think so.
BETH You ... selfish bitch!
TARA What?!
BETH You don't care the slightest bitty bit about your family, do you? Your dad's been worried sick about you every day since you've been gone. There's a, a house that needs taking care of ... Donny and your dad having to do for themselves while you're down here living god knows what kind of lifestyle. I can't wait till your little friends find out the truth about you. And they will, you know. No matter how innocent you act, they'll see.
TARA No they won't.
BETH They will. Unless you ... do some kind of spell on them .... You did!
TARA N-no!
BETH You did something to them. I'm telling your father.
TARA No! No, it wasn't anything!
BETH You think you can just go around cursing people? Your dad's gonna pop.
TARA It was just so they wouldn't see. So-so-so they wouldn't see the demon part of me. Please don't tell Dad. It's harmless.
WILLOW Tara?
WILLOW I thought I heard something.
BETH Don't you see how out of control you are? You've been lying to these people for a year, and now you've put a spell on them, is that right? Is that a human thing to do? Now I'm telling your father. If he doesn't force you to come home, and I think he should, I know he's going to tell your friends the truth. If I were you, I'd tell them first. And then I'd tell them good-bye.
ANYA Do I get paid overtime for this?
GILES Certainly not. Dawn, would you close the door?
DAWN I didn't open it.
BUFFY Giles!
BUFFY Something's in here!
ANYA Where'd it go??
GILES Under there, go.
DAWN Willow?
SPIKE You're welcome!
ANYA Where'd it go?!
XANDER It's over there!
GILES How many are there?
ANYA I've already been injured once this month!
BUFFY Shut up!
TARA Buffy, behind you!
BUFFY Tara, where is it? Can you see it?
TARA Oh, god.
TARA Blind Cadria, lift your veil. Give evil form... ...and break my spell.
MR._MACLAY Tara!
MR._MACLAY What in god's name is that?
SPIKE Lei-ach demon. Fun little buggers. Big with the marrow-sucking.
MR._MACLAY I don't understand.
BUFFY I'm not sure I do either.
TARA I'm sorry. I'm s-s-so sorry. I was, I was trying to hide.
TARA I didn't want you to see ... what I am.
WILLOW Tara, what?
BUFFY What do you mean, what you are?
MR._MACLAY Demon. The women in our family... have demon in them. Her mother had it. That's where the magic comes from.
MR._MACLAY We came to take her home before... well, before things like ... this started happening.
GILES You cast a spell on us, to keep us from seeing your ... demon side. That's why we couldn't see our attackers.
BUFFY Nearly got us killed.
TARA I'll go. I'm very sorry.
MR._MACLAY The camper's outside.
WILLOW Wait! Go? I, she just did a spell that went wrong. It-it was just a mistake.
MR._MACLAY That's not the point and it's not your concern. She belongs with us. We know how to control her ... problem.
WILLOW Tara ... look at me. I, I trusted you more than anyone in my life. Was all that just a lie?
TARA No!
WILLOW Well, do you wanna leave?
MR._MACLAY It's not your decision, young lady.
WILLOW I know that! Do you wanna leave?
MR._MACLAY You're going to do what's right, Tara. Now, I'm taking you out of here before somebody *does* get killed. The girl belongs with her family. I hope that's clear to the rest of you.
BUFFY It is.
BUFFY You want her, Mr. Maclay? You can go ahead and take her.
BUFFY You just gotta go through me.
MR._MACLAY What?
BUFFY You heard me.
BUFFY You wanna take Tara out of here against her will? You gotta come through me.
DAWN And me!
MR._MACLAY Is this a joke? I'm not gonna be threatened by two little girls.
DAWN You don't wanna mess with us.
BUFFY She's a hair-puller.
GILES And ... you're not just dealing with, uh, two little girls.
XANDER You're dealing with all of us.
SPIKE 'Cept me.
XANDER 'Cept Spike.
SPIKE I don't care what happens.
MR._MACLAY This is insane. You people have no right to interfere with Tara's affairs. *We* ... are her blood kin! Who the hell are you?
BUFFY We're family.
DONNY Daaad. You you gonna let 'em just... Tara, if you don't get in that car, I swear by god I will beat you down.
XANDER And I swear by your full and manly beard, you're gonna break something trying.
BETH Well. I hope you'll all be happy hanging out with a disgusting demon.
ANYA E-excuse me. What kind?
BETH What?
ANYA What kind of demon is she? There's a lot of different kinds. Some are very, very evil. And some have been considered to be useful members of society.
BETH Well, I-I ... what does it matter?
MR._MACLAY Evil is evil.
ANYA Well, let's just narrow it down.
SPIKE Ohhh. Why don't I make this simple.
SPIKE Oww!!
WILLOW Hey! Hey...
TARA He hit my nose!
WILLOW And it hurt! Uh, him, I mean.
BUFFY And that only works on humans.
SPIKE There's no demon in there. That's just a family legend, am I right? Just a bit of spin to keep the ladies in line. Oh, you're a piece of work. I like you.
TARA I'm not a demon.
WILLOW You're not a demon.
TARA He hurt my nose.
WILLOW Aw.
SPIKE Yeah, you're welcome.
GILES Mr. Maclay, I would say your business here is finished.
MR._MACLAY Tara. For eighteen years your family has taken care of you and supported you. If you wanna turn your back-
TARA Dad ... just go.
MR._MACLAY Magic.
BETH Are you happy now?
RILEY Sorry I'm late.
BUFFY You came.
RILEY Of course I came.
TARA No, see, 'cause your insect reflection represents your insignificance... in terms of the karmic cycle.
ANYA But it's still not funny.
DAWN This place is so cool. 'Cept I have to wear this stupid stamp on my hand.
XANDER That's to keep you from boozing it up.
DAWN Oh please. Only losers drink alcohol.
ANYA So what's an eagle reflection?
TARA Umm...
WILLOW My dance?
WILLOW Good birthday?
TARA Best birthday.
WILLOW I still can't believe you didn't tell me about your family and all that.
TARA I was just afraid if you saw the kind of people I came from, you wouldn't wanna be anywhere near me.
WILLOW See ... that's where you're a dummy. I think about ... what you grew up with, and ... then I look at what you are ... it makes me proud. It makes me love you more.
TARA Every time I- even when I'm at my worst ... you always make me feel special.
TARA How do you do that?
WILLOW Magic.
SINGER I can't take my eyes off you.... I can't take my eyes off you....
