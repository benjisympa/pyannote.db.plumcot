GLORY You keep refusing to tell me where the key is!
MONK We had to hide the key ... made it human and sent it to you.
BUFFY_VOICEOVER Dawn.
DAWN What's wrong with Mom?
GILES_VOICEOVER Previously on
BUFFY I don't know.
RILEY Buffy's like nobody else in the world. When I'm with her it's like, half of me is just ... on fire, going crazy if I'm not touching her. But she doesn't love me.
RILEY I know you got a lot on your mind. You decide you wanna let me in on any of it, you let me know.
SANDY We ... could go somewhere else. Someplace more ... private.
RILEY Ohhhh, Sandy, Sandy. My heart belongs to another. Besides, I don't go out with vampires.
BUFFY Spike. I want you.
SPIKE God, I love you so much.
SPIKE Oh god, no. Please no.
BUFFY Are you okay?
JOYCE You know the nothing that I've been dealing with the last couple of weeks? I-it might not be nothing.
BUFFY What is it?
JOYCE I'm, uh, staying overnight at the hospital for observation. I'm getting a CAT scan.
DAWN What is a CAT scan exactly?
BUFFY I don't know. It's some ... x-ray, I guess.
DAWN Where do they get the CAT scan from? I mean, do they test it on cats or ... or does the machine sort of look like a cat?
BUFFY Dawn, I'm really...
TARA_VOICEOVER Your one-stop spot to shop for all your occult needs.
TARA Catchy.
GILES Think so?
TARA Uh-huh. In a ... hard to read sort of way, but I think it's great.
GILES Oh.
XANDER I'm just saying, I think it's rude.
WILLOW I wouldn't call it rude.
XANDER Rude-ish. Rude-esque. Whatever you want to call it. When a person makes a destroy all vampires date, it's simple courtesy to wait for your co-destroyers. Am I right, Giles?
GILES I'm almost certain you're not, but to be fair, I wasn't listening.
TARA Oh, the-the new phone book's in with Mr. Giles' ad.
WILLOW Oh, nice.
ANYA Yay! Am I mentioned?
GILES Not as such.
ANYA Oh.
XANDER Okay, we were supposed to hook up with Riley this morning, to take on a nest o'vamps holed up in a tomb? So we get there, and guess what? Tell him, Will.
WILLOW Tomb go boom.
XANDER Yep. Captain America blowed it up real good. All by his lone wolf lonesome.
GILES Hmm, uh, rather reckless of him.
XANDER I'd say very rather.
GILES All that aside, I should think you'd be pleased to avoid the confrontation.
ANYA That's what I've been saying. I mean, I for one didn't want to start my day with a slaughter. Which really just goes to show how much I've grown!
GILES Yes, well, um, in any event, uh, since you're all here, Tara and I could use your help researching Buffy's mysterious woman.
XANDER Oh yeah, this has been fruitful. Trying to look up something you ... never saw and don't know the name of.
ANYA Just do what I do: flip through the pages and look busy.
WILLOW It'd be nice if we knew where she was, where she's hiding out.
XANDER No doubt lurking around some sewer or condemned church or rat-infested warehouse. You know, the usual haunts.
DREG Most beauteous and supremely magnificent one, this dark spell I hold in my worthless and scabby hand is our gift to you, most tingly and wonderful Glorificus...
GLORY Please, call me Glory. And get up, looking at you is hurting my neck.
DREG Forgive me, shiny special one. I beg of you to rip out my inadequate tongue.
GLORY Gimme.
DREG Oh. I thought... You should know, your elaborate marvelousness, that this dark incantation has been lost for eons...
GLORY Uh-huh.
DREG And great dangers have been faced to...
GLORY Does this pump make my ankle look bony?
DREG No! No, no, your terrifically smooth one, it is the epitome of ankles. To touch such an ankle would be - but I'm not touching. I'm backing away.
DREG Ow! Thank you.
GLORY Dreg, is it?
DREG Yes. Dreg. Your creamy coolness has honored me by speaking my name. Your voice is like a thousand sweet songbirds that-
GLORY Yeah, I never tire of hearing that. Look, just so we're clear, the spell's gonna work, right? I mean, nothing worse than a gift that doesn't work. Then I'd have to get all mad and kill you! It's this whole big thing.
DREG It will work, your extremeness. Provided you have the other items you need.
GLORY Don't worry. I'll have them all right.
GLORY I'll have it all.
RILEY Hello? Buffy?
RILEY What are you doing in here?
SPIKE What, me? I was um ... uh ... what are *you* doing here?
RILEY Looking for the girl who's gonna rip your arms off when she finds out you were in her bedroom.
SPIKE Oh yeah? Well ... me too.
RILEY Were you ... were you just smelling her sweater?
SPIKE No. Well, yeah, all right, I did. It's a ... predator thing, nothin' wrong with it. Just ... know your enemy's scent, whet the appetite for a hunt. Ah, that's the stuff! Slayer musk, it's bitter and aggravating!
RILEY Out.
SPIKE Hey, watch it! Easy, you're bruising the leather! Look. I know for a bleeding fact the Slayer wouldn't mind me being here.
RILEY Right. What's a little sweater-sniffing between sworn enemies.
SPIKE Your girl in the habit of buying her enemies drinks? 'Cause she spent the better part of last night with me, doing just that.
RILEY 'Cause you guys are such tight pals.
SPIKE Yeah.
RILEY That's good. Tell me another.
SPIKE Okay, how 'bout this one. Twice in recent memory, she's had the lover-wiccas do a deinvite on the house. Keep out specific vamps. Ever ask yourself why she's never taken my name off the guest list?
RILEY Because you're harmless.
SPIKE Oh yeah, right. Takes one to know, I suppose. Least I still got the attitude. What do you got, a piercing glance? Face it, white bread. Buffy's got a type, and you're not it. She likes us dangerous, rough, occasionally bumpy in the forehead region. Not that she doesn't like you ... but sorry Charlie, you're just not dark enough.
SPIKE Hey ... Hey! Hey! Hey!
RILEY Am I dark enough for you now?
SPIKE Bloody pull me back in, you sod, I'm starting to sizzle!
RILEY You don't know anything about Buffy, you never did. I'm the one who knows what she needs.
SPIKE Oh yeah? That's why you're with her at hospital right now, giving her what she needs.
RILEY What are you talking about?
SPIKE Don't you know, didn't she tell you?
RILEY You tell me.
SPIKE Mum's sickly. Buffy took her to the hospital for a bit of prod 'n probe. Bite-sized one went too. You know, it's-it's funny her not calling you about that. I've known since last night.
SPIKE Blanket! Blanket!
BUFFY Riley.
RILEY Sorry. I heard. I thought maybe you'd ... need ....
BUFFY I do. I do. I'm glad. I just, I-I didn't ... I mean, until we knew what it was...
RILEY I understand. How's she doing?
BUFFY Well, she just had a CAT scan. I was about to go in and find out. Will you ... sit with Dawn while I talk to Mom? She's in the waiting room.
RILEY Yeah, yeah, you got it.
BUFFY Hi.
BUFFY May I come in?
JOYCE Oh, of course, baby, come on in. Uh, where's Dawn?
BUFFY Uh, she's with Riley. They're watching TV in the waiting room.
DR._ISAACS Excuse me, I'm just gonna check on the status of the OR.
BUFFY The OR?
JOYCE Dr Isaacs says I'm ... lucky there's one available on such short notice. Some people wait for days, sometimes, weeks.
BUFFY Mom, what did they find?
JOYCE A shadow. I've got a shadow. Somewhere ... over there ... he showed it to me, but, um ... they have to do a biopsy to find out exactly what it is.
JOYCE Doctor says it's too early to be concerned.
BUFFY Right. No concern.
JOYCE Just a shadow.
WILLOW_VOICEOVER I just wish we knew what we were dealing with.
WILLOW It feels like we're going around in circles.
XANDER Our circles are going around in circles. We've got dizzy circles here, Giles.
GILES Ah, weeping buddha, shoulders your spiritual burden. Makes a lovely paperweight too.
TARA Maybe she's not in the books.
WILLOW What do you mean?
TARA I mean, what if she's not a demon or sorceress or spirit or whatever these books cover? What if she's something else altogether?
GILES Thank you, come again. Something new, you mean?
TARA Something old. So old it pre-dates the written word.
WILLOW Giles, the Dagon sphere. You said that was created to repel...
GILES That which cannot be named.
WILLOW So I'm thinking maybe she...
GILES Predates language itself?
XANDER Well hey, if it means I don't have to read any more, woo! And might I add a big hoo!
GILES If Tara's right, then we're blind. There's ... there's no way we can determine ... her moves, her habits, where she'll turn up next-
GILES Oh! I beg your-
GLORY Uh-huh. I want these.
GILES Yes, of course! Um, you find everything all right?
GLORY No problemo.
GILES That's, um...
GILES Your receipt. And ... Thank you!
GILES She could be anywhere. But if she is as powerful as, uh, Buffy says, I imagine it won't be long before she makes herself known.
DR._ISAACS Everything went fine, they're moving her into recovery now.
BUFFY Do we have the results yet?
DR._ISAACS Let's, um, sit down over here for a minute.
BUFFY No! Excuse me, no, I ... I don't mean to be rude, I just, I've been sitting for hours, I don't wanna sit. I just ... tell me, please.
DR._ISAACS Your mother has ... the term is low-grade glioma. It's a brain tumor. The clinical name is oligodendroglioma. It's in the left hemisphere of the cerebrum. In your mother's case the tumor seems to have started there. In other words, it hasn't spread from another part of the body...
DR._ISAACS I know this is very difficult, and, uh, because of the nature of your mother's illness ... unfortunately, things may progress very quickly.
BUFFY Things? What things?
DR._ISAACS Symptoms. There's a fair variety that might present. Loss of vision or appetite, lack of muscle control, uh, mood swings...
BUFFY But what can we do?
DR._ISAACS Well, not much, until we determine if the tumor's operable. Which we are working on.
BUFFY Is there something that I ... I mean ... can I help?
DR._ISAACS Well, there's some literature you might want to look at. If we aren't able to go in surgically, there are a number of new treatments that are very promising. Your mother's prognosis is a lot better today than it would have been only a year ago. Even if the tumor's not operable, she has a real chance.
BUFFY What's a real chance?
DR._ISAACS Nearly one out of three patients with this condition does just fine. Now, let me ask. Does your mother's insurance company require copies of the MRI and pathology reports?
BUFFY I'm not sure.
DR._ISAACS Well, just let me know as soon as possible. And I could use some information regarding your mom's lifestyle and home environment. For instance, does she use a cell phone?
BUFFY Uh, I think so. Uh, yeah, she um, she-she has one of those ear things.
DR._ISAACS OK, is your house near any power lines, chemical plants, waste disposal facilities?
BUFFY Uh ... I-I don't know. Maybe.
DR._ISAACS Well, the more we know...
BUFFY I'm sorry.
BEN Excuse me Doc, but they told me you're needed in ICU.
DR._ISAACS Excuse me, Miss Summers.
BUFFY Uh, it's okay.
BEN Thought you looked like you needed a break. Guy's great, but he doesn't have the bone in his head that tells him when to back off.
BUFFY You mean ... they, they didn't need him?
BEN Well, I'm sure someone does somewhere, they always do. He really is a good doctor. Your mom's in good hands.
BUFFY Thank you. It's Ben, right?
BEN Right.
BUFFY He, um, he was just telling me that there's nothing I can do.
BEN Yeah, I'm gonna tell you the same thing. Give yourself a break. Listen, your mom's gonna be unconscious for at least another six, seven hours.
BUFFY A break?
BEN Well, I just mean go out, get some air. Come back later on this evening, talk to the doc then if you want. My unsolicited advice of the day.
RILEY Buffy.
BUFFY It's bad.
RILEY I know.
BUFFY I ... I have to do something.
RILEY Do something?
BUFFY Yeah, like, you know, magic, like a healing spell.
RILEY Buffy ... people get sick. I don't think magic-
BUFFY That attitude's not helping. I have to try.
RILEY Okay.
BUFFY I need to talk to Giles. Uh, will you do me a favor and, and drop Dawn off at school, and tell her I'll meet her at the magic shop in an hour when she gets off?
RILEY Of course, whatever you need me to do. Buffy! What do you want me to tell Dawn ... about your mom?
BUFFY Tell her we don't know anything yet.
ANYA Hey. Hey! HEY!
ANYA HEY!!
GILES Anya, your heys are startling the customers.
XANDER And-and pretty much the state.
ANYA You sold someone a Khul's amulet and a Sobekian bloodstone.
GILES Yes, I believe I did.
ANYA Are you stupid or something?
GILES Allow me to answer that question with a firing.
XANDER She's kidding! An, we talked about the employee-employer vocabulary no-nos. That was number five.
ANYA You never sell these things together, ever! Bad news! Don't you know about the Sobekites?
WILLOW Oh! I do. It was an ancient Egyptian cult, heavy into dark magic.
TARA And the Khul's amulet, wasn't that a transmogrification conduit?
ANYA Damn straight!
GILES Be that as it may, I still see no reason for concern. I mean, the-the Sobekian transmogrification spells were lost thousands of years ago. And besides, the young woman to whom I sold them would have to have had enormous power-
WILLOW Young woman?
GILES Oh, dear lord.
XANDER What?
RILEY You're melting.
DAWN Oh, um ... guess I'm not hungry.
RILEY Maybe I'm not making this any better.
DAWN No, I just ... this is better. I had my tenth birthday party here.
RILEY Really?
DAWN Mm-hmm. We'd just moved to Sunnydale, and ... Mom rented the carousel for an entire hour for just me and my friends. Except I hadn't made any friends yet, so ... it was just me and Mom and Buffy riding it by ourselves, over and over and over again... for the whole hour, just so Mom felt like we'd gotten our money's worth. She's ... she's not gonna get better, is she?
RILEY Absolutely she will. Summers women are tough.
DAWN I'm really glad you're here.
RILEY Thanks.
DAWN Buffy's glad too.
RILEY Yeah?
DAWN She sure cries a lot less with you than she did with Angel.
RILEY Angel ... made her cry a lot, huh?
DAWN Everything with him was all ... eee, you know?
RILEY All...?
DAWN You know ... my boyfriend's a vampire crazy crazy. Every day was like the end of the world. She doesn't get all worked up like that over you.
DAWN I think you've been really good for her.
BUFFY So I figured there has to be some kind of mystical cure, right? I mean, like a, a potion, or a spell or something. We have to look.
WILLOW We can look ... I mean, we will, but ... I haven't seen anything.
GILES The truth is, uh, the ... mystical and the medical aren't meant to mix, Buffy. Sorry, um .. .the human mind is very delicate. Too much can go wrong.
TARA Yeah, I've heard stories about people trying healing spells ... if we did something, it could make things a lot worse, Buffy.
ANYA We've done just about enough making things worse for one day, haven't we?
BUFFY Why? What do you mean?
XANDER Uh, nothing. Anya broke a ... bippity boppity boo. A thing. Don't worry about it.
ANYA I did not! I didn't break-
GILES Anya, Buffy doesn't need to hear about your ... clumsiness right now.
ANYA My clumsiness. I mean, that is so- ...like ... me. Slippery, slippery ... butterfingers.
BUFFY What happened?
GILES Nothing to concern you, uh-
BUFFY Giles!
GILES The, uh, demon woman was here, the one who attacked you.
WILLOW It's no biggie, she-she just got an amulet and a bloodstone.
ANYA That can create a monster.
WILLOW Okay, biggie.
BUFFY My god, are you guys okay though? I mean, did - no one got hurt, right?
GILES Oh no, thankfully, no, uh, no violence to speak of.
BUFFY Okay, so, that's good ... How did she get away with this bad mojo stuff?
ANYA Giles sold it to her.
GILES I, I, I... I didn't know it was her! I mean, how could I? If it's any consolation, I may have overcharged her.
TARA Anya figured out what the demon lady's up to.
ANYA Yeah, a few thousand years ago there was this cult, the temple of Sobek.
BUFFY Sobek.
ANYA Reptile demon. Sobekites were reptile worshippers.
XANDER Just once I would like to run into a cult of bunny worshippers.
ANYA Great. Thank you very much for those nightmares.
XANDER Sorry.
ANYA Anyway, their high priest Khul had great mystic powers. He, um, forged an amulet with transmogrifying crystal.
WILLOW Transmogrifying is changing a living thing into a different kind of thing.
GILES We've managed to decipher the markings that were on the bloodstone that I sold - that she left with. Um, cobra. She's going to transmogrify a cobra.
BUFFY Okay, so she's making a monster. What for? What does it do?
GILES That's the part ... we're working on it.
BUFFY Well, you keep working on it I'll go kill it.
GILES Buffy?
BUFFY What? I'm going.
XANDER Buffy, this chick creamed you last time.
BUFFY That's because I wasn't ready for her last time. I am now.
WILLOW But you-
BUFFY But what? Will, I can't just sit here. I have to do something.
GLORY Chill, worm. I'm gonna make you a star!
GLORY Chant!
DREG The form is vessel, rendered new. The base is stone, bathed in blood. The gem is fire and elements rarified...
GLORY Sobek, grant the power ... that it may mold this wretched creature ... that it may be reborn ... that it may serve ... ah! Dark incantations! Always overwritten! Why can't they just cut to the-
BUFFY Fight?
GLORY No fair- attacking- when I wasn't even looking! Ow! No, this is no good. I'm out of the moment... and you're not giving me anything I can use. Dreg! I'm not hearing chanting!
DREG Yes, Glory.
GLORY Hey, hey. Work with me here. There! That feels more real, don't you think? (Pulls Buffy up and flings her against another wall. Buffy lands upside down and stares, gasping, as Glory approaches. She grabs Buffy by the throat and lifts her up again.
GLORY Even if I do have to carry your performance.
GLORY Scene!
DREG Cir hayyan win-hud!
GLORY Arise. Arise.
DREG Cir hayyan win-hud!
GLORY Arise!
DREG He is arisen!
GLORY 'Bout damn time!
GLORY Spawn of Sobek!
GLORY The power is yours ... to see what is unseen. To find what is shrouded in shadow. Already, you know what I seek. I have given you form, now find for me the key. Seek it out in the holy places. Yes, yes, yes! Let your vision guide you to its hiding place, and then return to me and tell me where it lies.
GLORY Now would be good.
GLORY Fun, fun, fun!
RILEY Where's Buffy?
GILES Um, she-she left a while ago.
RILEY What? Where?
XANDER That creepy demon woman's conjuring some kind of monster.
RILEY And you let Buffy go after her? Alone?
GILES Uh, let isn't really a factor when she sets her mind to something, you know that.
RILEY She'll get herself killed. It's crazy.
XANDER Yeah. Crazy. Going off alone, half-cocked, instead of waiting for much-needed backup ... charging in with a big old hand grenade ... oh, wait.
RILEY This is different.
XANDER Yeah, it is. Buffy needs something she can fight, something she can solve. I don't know what kind of action you're looking for ... Do you?
XANDER Hey, I'm not trying to get-
RILEY It's cool.
XANDER You okay?
RILEY Just a little crazed.
XANDER I hear ya.
RILEY If, uh, she needs me...
GILES Magic Box, your one-stop spot to shop for-
BUFFY Giles, it's me.
GILES Buffy! You all right?
BUFFY No, I'm really not. I-I couldn't stop her. I couldn't even slow her down.
GILES Where are you?
BUFFY Sunnydale Memorial.
GILES Are you badly hurt? I'll, I'll come right over.
BUFFY No. No, I-I just wanted to warn you that that thing she conjured, it's loose it's a big snake thing. Not mayor big, but it's pretty lethal looking.
GILES Do you know why she raised it?
BUFFY I don't know yet.
GILES I'll warn the others. We'll get weapons, we'll fan out-
BUFFY Wait. What time is it?
GILES Half past four, why?
BUFFY School's out. Dawn's on her way over to you. Giles-
GILES Understood. We'll keep her safe here until you arrive.
BUFFY Thanks. And Giles...
GILES Yes?
BUFFY Dawn's kind of fragile right now. About Mom. She doesn't know how bad it is.
GILES We'll not say a word.
BUFFY Well, my mom's gonna wake up soon, and I should ... be there when the doctors tell her.
GILES She's in good hands, Buffy. There's really nothing else you can do.
BUFFY Okay. Bye.
GILES Bye.
DAWN Is she awake yet?
BUFFY Yeah. She's waiting for us.
DAWN Can we take her home now?
BUFFY We'll see. Go get your stuff.
BUFFY So, any monster reptile sightings?
GILES None.
WILLOW Tara and I did a mini-patrol earlier, but biggie snake was nowhere to be-
XANDER Dawn, you okay?
WILLOW Why was the big snake afraid of Dawn?
BUFFY It knows!
BUFFY I've gotta stop this monster before it gets back to Glory.
GILES Glory?
BUFFY That's what he called her. Giles, she's gonna know Dawn's the key if we don't-
GILES We will.
DREG Please! Please, mistress!
DREG Perturbed, yet ultimately merciful-
DREG Please, don't-
GLORY What is taking so long, Dreg? You told me snakey-wakey would find my key. Now why isn't he back here with a beautiful message for me?
DREG I grovel like a bug, most silky and effervescent Glorificus- Glory! Glory. Your most fresh and cleanness, it's just a matter of time.
GLORY Ohh! Everything takes time! What about my time? Does anyone appreciate that I'm on a schedule here? Tick, tock, Dreg! Tick frickin' tock!
BUFFY You want me to stay?
JOYCE No, I'm fine. I-I think I should ... talk to Dawn alone.
BUFFY Okay.
JOYCE Oh. Do I have bad hair? I don't look like scary mom, do I?
BUFFY No. You look beautiful.
JOYCE Okay. Let's do this. Stay close.
BUFFY I will.
RILEY Buffy...
RILEY You okay? You look pretty beat up.
BUFFY Minimal damage of the fighting kind. It's all the other kind.
RILEY Come here.
RILEY It's okay. Just let it out. I'm right here.
BUFFY I can't. Not now. They need me. If I start now ... I won't be able to stop.
JOYCE Buffy?
