GILES_VOICEOVER Previously on
DREG This dark spell I hold in my worthless hand is our gift to you, Glorificus...
GLORY Please, call me Glory.
TARA What if she's something else altogether?
GILES Something new, you mean?
TARA Something old. So old it pre-dates the written word.
SECURITY_GUARD Lady, whatever you are, please ... I have two daughters.
MONK The key ... is energy. My brethren sent it to you.
BUFFY_VOICEOVER Dawn.
GILES She has no idea.
BUFFY No. She thinks she's my kid sister.
BUFFY_VOICEOVER I have to take care of her.
DOCTOR Your mother has ... low-grade glioma. It's a brain tumor.
JOYCE Listen you two, I know this creamed spinach is pretty delicious, but I promise, I won't be offended if you go out for some real food.
BUFFY You kidding me? This is the good life. Relaxing in bed while people bring you food on trays.
DAWN I like the Jello.
JOYCE Help yourself. There's something about food that moves by itself that gives me the heebie-jeebies.
DAWN It's good and wiggly. This girl at school told me that gelatin is made from ground-up cow's feet, and that if you eat Jello there's some cows out limping with no feet.
DAWN But I told her I'm sure they kill 'em before they take off their feet. Right?
BUFFY You're the one who insisted on teaching her to talk.
JOYCE Oh, hello, Dr. Kriegel, um, you know my girls, Buffy and Dawn.
DR._KRIEGEL Yes, of course. You two are becoming part of the regular crew around here.
BUFFY Just keeping her company.
DR._KRIEGEL Good. Just be careful you don't wear her out.
JOYCE Ohh, don't worry about that. I woke up exhausted, there's really no more exhausted to get.
DR._KRIEGEL Well, maybe some good news will help. The blood work's come back from the lab, and everything seems fine. So, we've scheduled your surgery for day after tomorrow at ten in the morning.
DR._KRIEGEL How's that sound to you?
JOYCE Oh, well, I think they had me scheduled for volleyball, but, ah, we can work around it.
DR._KRIEGEL All right. Joyce, you take care. Make sure you get some good solid rest. And I mean that.
JOYCE Uhh, the day after tomorrow. I don't think I can stand to stay here another two days just waiting.
BUFFY Waiting? Gimme a break, we got, we got tons to do.
DAWN We have soap operas to watch and trashy magazines to read.
BUFFY And an adjustable bed to fiddle with. That alone will keep me busy for four hours or so.
JOYCE Oh, I really don't need you to stay here, Buffy. I know you've got patrolling to do.
BUFFY Not tonight. Tonight I have mom-taking-care-of to do. And besides, Riley's filling in for me with the others. I'm sure they have everything under control.
XANDER Human chest! Human chest!
GILES Sorry!
GILES My god, what a rough night.
WILLOW I just did two of 'em! Yay on me!
WILLOW That was pretty cool. Except the part where I was all terrified and ... and now my knees are all dizzy.
XANDER Not so much a big success night for me. But I think I should get points just for showing up. Unlike some Riley Finn who shall remain unnamed.
GILES Yes, that was disappointing. Things would have been easier if he'd been here.
WILLOW Oh, piffle, who needs him when I'm dusting two at a ti- Whoops. Maybe it would've been good if ... he'd shown up.
GILES Perhaps he forgot.
WILLOW Care package! Special delivery for the Summers girls. Now, let's see what I have in this sack of mine. Oh, I feel just like Santa Claus, except thinner and younger and female and, well, Jewish. This is an extra-special gift for your mom, that I know she'll need. A beer hat! See, i-it's got cup holders, and a straw that goes directly into your mouth, and you can fill it with other stuff than beer. And somehow, when I was in the store this seemed like the most important idea and now there's the whole part where I'm crazy.
JOYCE It's perfect. Thank you, Willow. You're very sweet.
WILLOW Now, let's see, who's next? Dawn, I believe I have something in here for you...
BUFFY Headache?
JOYCE Just a little one. A biggish little one. I'm fine! Go on, what else is in that sack of goodies, Willow?
WILLOW All right. Dawn, to keep you busy.
DAWN Ooh, spells! Thank you, Willow!
BUFFY You got her a book on spells. The girl who can break things by just looking at them, now has a book to teach her to ... break things by looking at them?
WILLOW Oh, well, it doesn't actually have spells in it. Just history, and anecdotes, stuff like that.
WILLOW Oh, Buffy- I have this for you.
BUFFY Homework? Oh. I don't believe in tiny Jewish Santa any more.
WILLOW And a yo-yo.
BUFFY Thank you.
WILLOW The book is just in case you get a chance to look it over.
WILLOW We're doing World War One now. The last exam was really pretty easy, just underlying causes and trench foot. So it should be no hassle to make it up-
BUFFY I don't even know if I'm gonna take that exam.
JOYCE I'd rip it in half and stick it in bed with me!
BUFFY Mom?
JOYCE You know, I think I'm gonna take a little rest now.
BUFFY Okay. We'll be right outside if you need us.
DAWN What was she talking about? I mean, that was weird.
WILLOW She's gonna be fine.
BUFFY It's okay. I'm sorry, the doctor spoke to me, and uh, I should have told you. Um, the, the thing that's pressing on her brain, sometimes it, it might make her say weird things.
DAWN Does she know she's saying them?
BUFFY Not really. It's sort of like a flash, you know, but you saw her two seconds afterward. She was normal.
WILLOW And after the operation, no more pressing. She'll be all normal all the time.
DAWN Is that right?
BUFFY Hey, Santa doesn't lie.
BUFFY Oh, excuse me.
MAN Careful, the facts say a-a picnic is in order.
GUARD What is that thing?
GUARD There-there's no data. There's no pictures on this one there!
GUARD What is the data? There's no one in there.
DAWN Buffy?
BUFFY Come on, honey. Don't worry about it.
GUARD I'm going home? Home? Home, home, home.
DAWN What's wrong with him? Is it like Mom? A thing in his head?
BUFFY I don't think so, I-I think it's, it's different. Don't, don't worry about it.
BEN I guess I missed that, was he bothering you?
BUFFY Hey Ben, uh, this is my friend Willow.
BEN Hi.
WILLOW Hi.
BUFFY And, uh, yeah, the crazy man was a little ... you know, crazy, but it's okay. Are they really gonna send him home?
BEN Don't get me started. The mental ward's booked beyond capacity, literally nowhere to put them, so the ones with families, they're letting 'em go home. Like his family's gonna be able to take care of him. He has to have someone to watch him 24-7! What was he saying to you?
DAWN I-
BUFFY Oh, he was just babbling.
WILLOW You know what's weird?
TARA Japanese commercials are weird.
WILLOW Yes. And also, you know some of the stars we're looking at ... don't even exist any more? In the time that it takes for their light to reach us, they've died. Exploded. Poof.
TARA Were, um ... were things rough at the hospital?
WILLOW You know, I used to love to look up at them when I was little. They're supposed to make you feel all insignificant, but ... they made me feel like ... like I was in space ... part of the stars. There's ... Canis Minor ... and ... and Cassiopeia.
TARA And the big pineapple.
WILLOW Hmm. You know, I'm not sure I remember that one.
TARA Oh, it's, it's a major one. See those three bright stars right over there?
WILLOW Yeah.
TARA And see those stars along there? That's the bottom of the pineapple.
WILLOW It's big.
TARA Hence the name. The real ones never made sense to me, I ... sort of have my own.
WILLOW Teach me.
TARA See those stars over there? Short man looking uncomfortable.
TARA Uh... Moose getting a sponge bath. Umm... little pile o'crackers. Tha-that was a bit of a stretch. You do it. What would you call ... mm, that one?
WILLOW Hmm, let's see.
WILLOW A huge flaming meteor about to crash into something!
GUARD I know what I said. I said-I said I won't go away far. A person needs to respect a man.
GUARD And then it says ... that... the facts says... he's got to go take a walk and get some fresh air and find some fresh spaces.
GUARD ...and some fresh space! And needs to walk to get ... to get where he's going.
JOYCE This thing doesn't work! It isn't working!
BUFFY I'm sure they heard you.
JOYCE I bet it's not even hooked up to anything. Just like the push buttons at the crosswalk that are supposed to make the signal change.
BUFFY I'm sure someone's on - What, the push buttons aren't hooked up to anything?
JOYCE Oh, tell him, Buffy. Tell him, okay?
BUFFY Look, Dr. Kriegel, we wanna go home.
DR._KRIEGEL Well, of course. You can come back and visit your mother first thing in the morning.
BUFFY No. We. I-I mean, all of us. My mom too.
DR._KRIEGEL Oh. Well, I understand that, but it's not necessarily the first thing I'd recommend.
JOYCE I can't! I-I can't stay here waiting for two days for this operation, I just can't. It makes my head hurt to be here, can't you tell that?
DR._KRIEGEL Joyce, there's no reason to get upset.
JOYCE No reason to get upset? Oh, right, sorry, I must just think there is because of my brain tumor!
BUFFY Here, Dawn, why don't you get something from the machine?
JOYCE I-I'm sorry I said that, I'm just tired.
BUFFY I know. Listen, Doctor, I don't see why we can't take her home, you know, just until... I-I mean, wouldn't it be better for her to rest someplace where she felt safe and comfortable?
DR._KRIEGEL Even if it would mean some work for you, taking care of her?
JOYCE Oh, thank god.
BUFFY I'll do it, anything.
DR._KRIEGEL There are medications to administer, I'd have to go over those with you, and I'd need for you to check her vitals, watch her pretty closely. I'm afraid you won't get a lot of sleep.
BUFFY I'm not much of a sleep person anyway.
JOYCE Can we go now? Let's go now!
BUFFY Oh, hold on! Lemme get all the medications and all the instructions on how to do everything.
DR._KRIEGEL She's right. Let's do this right. We don't wanna forget anything.
RILEY Everyone stay close. I'm glad you called me in on this.
XANDER Glad you answered.
RILEY Oh, yeah. I'm sorry about last time. Heard I missed out on some fun.
XANDER Oh, yeah, fun was had. Also frolic, merriment, and near-death hijinks.
RILEY Look, there it is.
WILLOW Wow. We have meteorite.
ANYA Is it hot?
ANYA 'Cause, uh, if there's radiation, you could like go all sterile.
RILEY No, it's not hot. It's warm. And broken. It's sort of-
GILES Hollow.
RILEY Yeah.
ANYA So, uh, we're all thinking the same thing, right?
XANDER Festive pinata? Delicious candy?
WILLOW Something evil crashed to earth in this and then broke out and ... slithered away to do badness.
GILES In all fairness, we don't really know about the slithered part.
ANYA Oh, no. I'm sure it frisked about like a fluffy lamb.
TARA Let's look around. Maybe we can figure out where it went.
WILLOW It went here!
RILEY No pulse.
ANYA Yep, the space lamb got 'im.
XANDER I don't see any marks on him.
WILLOW I-I know him! He, he was at the hospital, a mental patient. They released him today.
GILES Uh, Riley, what are you doing?
RILEY I'm not sure, there's something...
RILEY Oh, that might be toxic, don't touch it.
XANDER Oh yeah, touching it was my first impulse. Luckily I've moved on to my second, which involves dry-heaving and running like hell. Oh, man, does that smell.
ANYA So what do we do now?
WILLOW We can't call Buffy. I wanna call Buffy!
TARA You can't. She's got ... life stuff. That has to come first.
WILLOW So, so we'll just figure this out ourselves. We're experienced.
ANYA Yes, 'cause it seems like we're always dealing with creatures from outer space. Except that we don't ever do that.
RILEY This is definitely new territory.
GILES Perhaps we should explore a bit more, head into the woods a bit.
XANDER Who votes research?
WILLOW Research.
RILEY Yeah, I think that's a good call. There could have been some other cases like this. I'm gonna stay here, examine the body some more, look around a little bit.
XANDER Yeah, don't do anything hunterly.
RILEY No, no, I'm just not great at research, which I'm sure you guys figured out. I like me a good crime scene.
GILES Um, give us a call if you need help.
RILEY Believe me, something jumps out at me in the dark ... you'll hear me even without the phone. Call me if you learn anything.
WILLOW You got it.
WILLOW I don't wanna be the one who finds the bodies any more.
RILEY I need to speak to the man at the desk. This is A ... this is Riley Finn. You have an Agent Miller, Graham Miller, he'll tell you who ... Yes. Emergency frequency.
PATIENT Cold. Cold.
PATIENT Wait! You can't go! Don't you be that kind of barn owl! Please! Please don't go! Please!
PATIENT Please! Please! Please don't-
PATIENT I can't see you! I can't see you! I can't see you!
DR._KRIEGEL Well, I guess we're all set then.
DR._KRIEGEL You've got my home phone number, pager number, and here, these are the medications I talked to you about. The sedative and so forth, painkillers.
BUFFY Right. No problem.
DR._KRIEGEL Now, if this is gonna be too much for you, we can make your mom perfectly comfortable here.
BUFFY No. No, no, I-I got this. We really, really appreciate-
JOYCE You look just like your father when he cries.
BUFFY I-I told you she's been-
DR._KRIEGEL I know. Joyce? Joyce. We're all done here. Why don't you take your girls home now.
JOYCE Yes. Yes, thank you. Thank you for all your help, doctor.
DR._KRIEGEL I'll see you in a couple of days.
JOYCE Oh, let's get the hell outta here.
BUFFY Here we go.
JOYCE Oh, it's nice to be home.
DAWN Do you wanna go in to bed, Mom?
JOYCE Buffy, no, that light is too bright. It's too bright.
BUFFY Oh, okay, okay!
JOYCE It's too bright. Buffy, it hurts. It hurts, it hurts my eyes.
BUFFY It's off, it's off. You know what, why don't you turn off the lights in the living room, and I will take you upstairs and we'll shut off all the lights up there. Okay? Come on.
ELLIS You Finn?
RILEY Yeah.
ELLIS Major Ellis. I'm in charge of this op. What's the situation, just the one civilian casualty?
RILEY That I know of. This way.
GRAHAM You found a stiff in the woods and called us in? Don't you usually call your girlfriend for this kind of thing?
RILEY I wouldn't touch that stuff in his mouth if I were you.
ELLIS Toxic?
RILEY No, just messy. Guy seemed to have simply choked on the stuff. Near as I can tell, it's some kind of protein alkaloid.
ELLIS Does this fit the profile of any Sub-T you're familiar with?
RILEY Not subterrestrial, Major. Extraterrestrial. It came outta that.
ELLIS Miller, set the trackers for a protein signature.
GRAHAM Yes sir.
RILEY No good, Major. This alkaloid's breaking down at an accelerated rate. It's dissolving too fast to track.
ELLIS You got a better idea?
RILEY Thing came from space. Gotta be some trace radiation.
ELLIS We have Geiger counters in the packs.
RILEY Shouldn't be too much background gamma noise out here.
ELLIS Break 'em out.
DAWN Mom?
BUFFY Oh, my-
BUFFY Mom, wha-what are you doing?
JOYCE I'm making breakfast. And you shouldn't eat any more, you're disgustingly fat.
JOYCE Oh, Buffy, I don't know what I'm doing.
BUFFY You just need some rest. We'll put you back to bed.
BUFFY Okay, here we go. That will help you sleep. Come on, let's get you all tucked into bed.
JOYCE Don't touch me! You - you thing!
DAWN Mom, please!
JOYCE Get away from me! You're nothing, you're, you're a shadow!
BUFFY Mom-
JOYCE I don't know what you are or how you got here!
BUFFY Mom, it's Dawn.
JOYCE Dawn? Honey, what's wrong?
BUFFY She's .. just tired. We all are. Come on, go to sleep. I'll check in on you in a little bit.
DAWN She hates me.
BUFFY No.
DAWN She called me a thing.
BUFFY She loves you. Okay? She's not herself. I told you what the doctor said about the tumor.
DAWN No, not just Mom. People. They keep saying weird stuff about me.
BUFFY Are you talking about the man in the hospital?
DAWN He called me a thing too. And there was another one. Weird guy outside the magic shop. He said I didn't belong. He said I wasn't real. Why does everybody keep doing that? What's wrong with me?
BUFFY Nothing. It's not you. I think there's something that happens in people's brains when there's something wrong. It's, it's like a short-circuit ... and it makes them feel like nothing's real except for them. That's all it is.
BUFFY Look, it is not you. Okay? And if anyone says anything like that to you again, don't listen. Even if it's Mom.
DAWN I hate it.
BUFFY I know. Just don't listen.
XANDER Look at how teeny Mercury is compared to, like, Saturn. Whereas in contrast, the cars of the same name-
GILES Xander, please, we have work to do here.
XANDER I still don't get why we had to come here to get info about a killer snot monster.
GILES Because it's a killer snot monster from outer space. I did not say that.
GILES Demons enter our world in all sorts of ways, this one came from above.
XANDER And the university library's astronomy section is the home of aboveness. Got it. Hey, take in the study material, too.
TARA We've been scouring all the international periodicals for any other meteorite landings in the last week.
ANYA Big zippo.
GILES Well, then it would appear that the world is not being invaded.
TARA I'm pretty pleased about that.
WILLOW Uh, guys? I've got some stuff. The most recent meteoric anomaly was the Tunguska blast in Russia in 1917. Some witnesses claimed the meteor was hollow.
XANDER Hmm. Maybe with a chewy demon center like ours.
GILES How far back does this list of anomalies go?
WILLOW Pretty far. Back to the Queller impact in the twelfth century.
TARA The what?
WILLOW Queller. I-I don't know why they call it that, it didn't hit a place called Queller or anything. It landed just outside of Reykjavik in Iceland.
XANDER Wait, I just saw... Queller. Quell ... here, here! Primitive people used to believe that the moon was a cause of insanity. Sometimes they would pray to the moon to send a special meteor to fix the problem the moon had caused. These meteors were expected to *quell* the madmen.
TARA The man in the woods. He was a mental patient.
XANDER And he got pretty well ... quelled.
WILLOW Okay, I'm looking in history right now. It says in the Middle Ages there were these sweeping plagues of madness. People were losing their marbles everywhere. But then it would suddenly subside. And these dates look pretty close. Like-like maybe it happened after each one of the meteor events.
GILES So something emerged from the meteors ... and quelled the madmen.
XANDER Meteor go boom, crazy guy goes bye-bye.
TARA Xander's little book made it sound like this Queller thing had to be summoned. So ... who summoned it?
XANDER Who else? My money's on Glory, our resident beastie summoner.
WILLOW We should call Buffy. E-except we can't call Buffy. Can we?
GILES No, but we better call Riley.
RILEY Queller demon?
WILLOW Yeah, that's our perp. It's sort of a scavenger that can be summoned to kill-
RILEY Crazy people.
WILLOW Yeah, how'd you know?
RILEY 'Cause I've got five corpses here at the mental ward at Sunnydale Memorial.
WILLOW You're at the hospital? Oh, listen, Riley, I ... I saw Buffy's mom earlier, and she was acting kinda ... wacky. Insane wacky, if you know what I mean?
RILEY It's okay. Joyce was released earlier today. That intern, um, Ben, told me. They're safe at home.
WILLOW Oh, good. A-and the thing, the Queller, is it still there?
RILEY We - I think I've got it cornered in the air ducts.
RILEY Look, Willow, keep at what you're doing. Call me if you find out how I can kill this thing.
WILLOW Well, okay, but shouldn't we come help- Oooookay.
JOYCE I wish that someone had bothered to tell me that there would be tennis being played!
JOYCE I just didn't know. Those eyes ... Those eyes, they're like gasoline puddles! Tell me. Tell me because I need to know why, why are you staring at me like that?
JOYCE What are you asking me? You are asking me, aren't you? Is this a test? And if this counts for the final grade, I need to know now! Okay, there are teachers, and they put this on the syllabus, but they do not stare down at you, they do not cling, they do not look down on you....
JOYCE You know there are people who are nice, and they give you presents, even when you are bad.
JOYCE Does someone know you're here? Because they should have told you that at the gate. You are *not* supposed to be here. I need to rest now. I-I don't like the way you're staring at me! Did they tell you that at the gate?
JOYCE Stop staring at me, I don't like it!
GRAHAM Trail stops here, edge of the parking lot.
ELLIS It stops?
RILEY A car. It hitched a ride. Probably underneath. So much for containment.
ELLIS So some poor mental patient checks out of here today, drives away with this thing, took it right to his own home.
RILEY Checked out today.
ELLIS Get me a list of all patients discharged in the last 24 hours.
RILEY No. I know where it's going. We've gotta move, now!
JOYCE I'm going to close my eyes, and when I open them, you are going to go away.
JOYCE Get off me!
DAWN Buffy!!
DAWN BUFFY!
BUFFY What? What is it?
DAWN There's something out there, Buffy. It's after Mom!
BUFFY You guys stay in here. Don't leave this room.
JOYCE It's okay, my baby. It's okay.
BUFFY Spike?
SPIKE Yeah. Listen, uh, did you hear a noise?
BUFFY What the hell are you doing in my house?
SPIKE Right then, caught me. Your basement's full of junk. And me being in need of, uh, junk...
BUFFY You were stealing?
SPIKE Well, yeah. Can't exactly work the counter at Burger Barn, can I?
BUFFY Wait, are those pictures of me?
SPIKE Buffy!
RILEY Are you okay?
SPIKE You just missed a real nice time.
BUFFY It's gone. I killed it.
JOYCE Oh god.
DAWN It's gone? You promise?
BUFFY I promise. Everything's all right. Everything's all right.
DREG It's strange. A body might ask what exactly it is you think you're doing. He might ask what all this was meant to accomplish. Because to a humble postulant, it looks like chaos. Like unnecessary attention drawn where it ought not to be.
BEN Get out!
DREG Sir.
DREG Sir, forgive me. I just want to understand. Why summon the Queller?
BEN What do you think? Because I'm cleaning up Glory's mess. Just like I've done my whole damn life.
JOYCE Buffy, uh, I'm gonna ask you something, a-and if I'm, if I'm being crazy you just tell me, okay?
BUFFY You got it.
JOYCE The other day ... well, actually, I'm, I'm not sure when, the days seem to all bleed together...
BUFFY It's not important.
JOYCE No, I guess it isn't. I do know I was ... pretty out of it, and I had ... not-not a dream ... exactly, more like I had this ... knowledge, i-it just came to me like ....truth, you know? Even though it didn't seem...possible, even though I shouldn't even think such things.
BUFFY What?
JOYCE That Dawn...
JOYCE She's not ... mine, is she?
BUFFY No.
JOYCE She's ... she does belong to us, though.
BUFFY Yes, she does.
JOYCE And she's important. To the world. Precious. As precious as you are to me.
JOYCE Then we have to take care of her. Buffy, promise me. If anything happens, if I don't come through this-
BUFFY Mom-
JOYCE No, listen to me. No matter what she is, she still feels like my daughter. I have to know that you'll take care of her, that you'll keep her safe. That you'll love her like I love you.
BUFFY I promise.
JOYCE Good. Good.
JOYCE Oh, my sweet brave Buffy. What would I do without you?
