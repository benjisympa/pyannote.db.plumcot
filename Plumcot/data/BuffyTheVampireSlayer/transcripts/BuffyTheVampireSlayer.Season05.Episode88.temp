BUFFY Riley!
RILEY Know you got a lot on your mind. You decide you wanna let me in on any of it, you let me know.
GILES_VOICEOVER Previously on
RILEY_VOICEOVER Buffy's like nobody else in the world. But she doesn't love me.
SPIKE_VOICEOVER Buffy, I love you.
SPIKE Oh God, no.
DOCTOR_VOICEOVER Your mother has ... a brain tumor.
GILES Just me. Sorry. Can I get you anything?
BUFFY No, thank you.
GILES Riley?
RILEY No, I'm fine.
WILLOW What time is it?
XANDER There's a clock behind you, Will.
WILLOW I know, but there's a watch right above your hand.
WILLOW That can't be right. Oh.
BUFFY I can't stand this. What's taking so long?
RILEY It doesn't mean anything.
BUFFY You think?
RILEY I'd worry more if your mom was out of surgery quickly. Might mean that, you know, they couldn't do much.
DR._KRIEGEL Okay, your mom's in recovery.
BUFFY What happened, is she all right?
DR._KRIEGEL It was possible to visualize the tumor completely, which means I was able to get all of it. So, barring complications in recovery ... I think your mother's going to be fine. Of course we're still going to have to watch your mother carefully, and, uh, have her back in here for some follow-up testing, but, uh, overall I'd consider the procedure a complete success.
BUFFY Oh my goodness, doctor, thank you, thank you so much.
DR._KRIEGEL Please, it's my pleasure.
BUFFY Sorry. Sorry!
DAWN When I was younger, I used to put my chopsticks in my mouth like this, and then Buffy would chase me around the house yelling, 'I'm the slayer, I'm going to get you!'
ANYA That's disturbing. You're emotionally scarred and will end up badly.
DAWN No, it was great. I mean, she didn't actually stake me in the heart, you know.
XANDER Buffy's pretty cool like that. So, what do you wanna do now, Dawnster? Keeping in mind that I won't chase you because I'm old and I'm stuffed full of moo goo gai starch.
ANYA Well, we could play that game again, Life. That was fun.
DAWN For you. You always win.
ANYA Well ... we can make a wager this time. You can give me real money. That would be different.
XANDER And after we teach her to gamble, maybe we can all get drunk!
ANYA I don't think the bar would serve her, but we could bring something in. Strawberry schnapps taste just like real ice cream.
XANDER Okay, how's about a movie? They're showing them in theaters now. I hear it's like watching a video with a bunch of strangers and a sticky floor.
DAWN That one looks sad.
XANDER The chimp playing hockey? Is that based on the Chekhov?
ANYA There's a chimp playing hockey?
DAWN Um, no, the other one. I don't wanna see a sad movie.
ANYA We have to see the chimp playing hockey! That's hilarious! The ice is so slippery, and, and monkeys are all irrational. We have to see this.
XANDER You pick, Dawn. This is your night. We are celebrating your mom's good news.
ANYA Go monkey. Choose monkey.
DAWN It's okay. You guys don't have to make a big deal for me. I'm only sleeping over here so Buffy and Riley can boink.
XANDER No, that's not, that's not it at all, they just need time to, uh... be tender. Relax.
ANYA He's not very convincing, is he?
DAWN 'Alone time' always translates into 'get Dawn out of the house so we can have loud obnoxious sex.'
ANYA Oh, does that mean we can't?
BUFFY Can we put this song on repeat?
RILEY Whatever you want.
BUFFY Can we put the whole night on repeat?
RILEY Absolutely.
BUFFY Good. Mm, I can't believe how relaxed I feel. It's like all the tension's just left my body.
RILEY Oh, really? 'Cause I had that scheduled for a little later on.
BUFFY Scheduled? Are you planning on seducing me, Mr. Finn?
RILEY Always.
RILEY I want tonight to be special for you.
BUFFY It's more than special. It's perfect.
RILEY Well, I'm glad. You deserve it after everything you've been through.
BUFFY Well, it's nothing compared to what my mom had to deal with.
RILEY It was a lot. And you were incredible.
BUFFY Not really. Just covering for the weepy chicken within.
RILEY Don't sell yourself short. You stayed strong throughout, Buffy. You never even cried.
BUFFY Oh, I cried. I cried so hard, I didn't think I was gonna be able to stop.
RILEY Oh.
BUFFY That's all in the past now. Mom's out of the woods, and I'm here with you. That's all that matters.
JOYCE I don't know, Buffy. I think I'll look like I have a cat on my head.
BUFFY But a very well-groomed cat.
JOYCE I think maybe I'll ... stick with a scarf.
BUFFY Come on, wigs are fun. We can get you a whole bunch of different ones. You know, you can be, like, Sixties Mom, Action Mom... French Maid Mom...
JOYCE I must be getting better, 'cause you're making fun of me.
BUFFY Well, you know. Got a lot of time to make up for.
JOYCE You have more important things to make up. I know you've been missing a lot of school.
BUFFY I may have to take a few incompletes, but I will make it through the semester.
JOYCE Well, what about slaying and your friends? I want you to have your life back.
BUFFY Right now I'd rather be here, styling your beautiful new plastic dream hair.
JOYCE Fair enough, but you don't have to keep me company all night. Go out, have fun, get, get Riley to take you to a movie or something.
BUFFY I gave Riley the day off.
JOYCE I don't think he thinks of you as a chore, Buffy.
BUFFY I know that. Look, I told him to make plans with his friends because I wanted to have you all to myself, okay? Besides, I can see him any time. And I'm sure he'll come over later looking for a little... bible study.
JOYCE Well, good. I mean, just as long as the two of you are spending some quality time with ... the lord.
BUFFY We are. Absolutely.
ELLIS What've we got?
GRAHAM Belize. Last transmission. Infra-red scans say they're-
ELLIS Breeding. They're not gonna stay in that village for long. Looks like we got ourselves a hot spot. Tell the men to get ready.
GRAHAM What about Riley? Agent Finn. I'm telling you, sir, if we go in for a sweep and drop, he's definitely a guy we want on the team.
ELLIS Well, let's bring him on board.
GRAHAM It, uh, might take a little convincing.
ELLIS Why? What's he got here in Sunnydale that's so special?
BUFFY Riley?
SPIKE It's me.
BUFFY Every time you show up like this, you risk all of your parts, you know that?
SPIKE I wouldn't be here if I didn't have a good reason. As usual, I'm here to help you, and I - are you naked under there?
BUFFY Get out.
SPIKE No, I'm serious. I mean, not about the naked part, I mean...
BUFFY Get out or I will drop you out head-first.
SPIKE I wanna show you something.
BUFFY What?
SPIKE You need to see this.
SPIKE But we need to move if we wanna get there in time.
SPIKE Oh, please! Like I give a bloody damn.
SPIKE Don't stop, Slayer. This isn't what we're here for.
VAMP_1 What do you think you're doing?
SPIKE Just having a little look, mate. Keep it down.
VAMP_1 You can't go up there.
SPIKE I said keep it down.
RILEY Harder.
RILEY Buffy.
RILEY Buffy!
SPIKE We only came here because we care about you, friend. You need help.
VAMP_2 Hey. Hey, hey.
SPIKE I thought you should know-
VAMP_2 Was that the slayer? What the hell do you think you're doing bringing the slayer here?
RILEY Back off, man. I didn't know.
VAMP_2 Nobody's gonna risk coming here now!
RILEY I said back off!
RILEY Get out.
ELLIS I need to talk to you.
RILEY I'm not in a talkin' mood.
ELLIS Then listen.
GRAHAM Riley, just give the man a chance. You don't like what you hear, we'll be on our way.
RILEY Talk fast.
ELLIS We have a Code One in Belize. A demon tribe is taking apart missionaries in the rain forest down there.
RILEY And you're telling me this because?
ELLIS We're going down to terminate their operation. We want you to join us.
RILEY I'm a civilian.
ELLIS You're a soldier.
RILEY I quit the government a long way back.
ELLIS We're not government. We're army.
GRAHAM Just like you.
ELLIS It's not the Initiative, Finn. We don't do experiments. None of us give a damn what makes monsters tick. We just stop 'em.
RILEY What do you need me for?
ELLIS I think you can handle yourself. And I always need bodies. I'm not gonna lie to you. It's the real deal. High risk, low pay, and seriously messy. We ship out for Central America tomorrow midnight. Now maybe civilian life is working out for you... and maybe not. Midnight. Tomorrow. The decision's yours.
GILES And so it begins.
GILES No longer a victim of crass holiday commercialization, I'm ... a purveyor of it.
ANYA Oh. Who ordered more chickens' feet? The ones we have aren't moving at all.
XANDER That's generally what happens when you cut them off the chicken.
ANYA I'm serious. Maybe we could do a ... holiday promotion. One free with every purchase!
GILES Oh, yeah. Dear holiday memories. Merry tykes by the fire, enjoying their new Christmas ... chicken feet.
WILLOW Aw, holding them tight as they fall asleep. Painting their little toenails.
ANYA That's so very humorous. Make fun of the ex-demon! I can just hear you in private. 'I dislike that Anya. She's newly human and strangely literal.'
WILLOW Anya, I don't say that. No one says that. No one talks that way.
ANYA There's nothing wrong with my idea anyway. I've been very good for this store. If it wasn't for me, Giles would be a terrified old man staring at a quarterly tax statement and wetting himself.
GILES I say, that's an exaggeration.
WILLOW Anya, you've helped out a lot, but I have too.
ANYA Yes, I forgot about all the vigorous sitting around.
XANDER Anya, you can back off a little. You get paid. Willow's doing this on her own time.
ANYA I'm sorry, Willow. Thank you for making time in your busy life to come in here and get in the way of mine.
XANDER Anya, play nice.
ANYA You know, fine, take her side instead of mine even though I'm the one who sleeps with you and feeds you, bathes you...
WILLOW She bathes you?
XANDER Only in an erotic, Penthouse-y way, not in a sponge-bath-y geriatric sort of...
GILES Please! Stop, I beg of you.
BUFFY I need to find out everything I can about a vamp nest downtown.
GILES A nest? What sort of-
BUFFY There were people there. It, um, it looked like they were paying vampires to bite them.
XANDER *Now* I know what to get for the person who has everything!
WILLOW Who would pay to get bitten?
ANYA Oh, that's been going on for centuries. Humans hire vampires to feed off them, they, well, you know, they-they get off on the rush.
GILES And the ... hazards of the underworld can become addictive to ... some people.
XANDER Why don't the vampires just kill 'em?
ANYA Because they get cash, hot and cold running blood, and ... they don't leave any corpses behind so they don't get hunted.
GILES But still, i-it can be terribly dangerous for humans. I mean, people can end up dying accidentally, or, or meeting a, a vampire who only pretends to play by the house rules.
BUFFY You knew about this and you didn't tell me?
GILES I hadn't seen it since my Ripper days. I had no idea it was going on in Sunnydale.
BUFFY Well, it is. And I'm gonna stop it.
GILES Buffy, even if I had known about this, I might not have told you right now.
BUFFY What? Why?
GILES Well, I'm not sure this is where your efforts are best spent. Perhaps you should focus on ... a less ambiguous evil. Glory, for instance?
BUFFY You said people are dying.
GILES They're willing victims. I mean, there are people out there who deserve your help who aren't.
BUFFY Vampires are vampires. And my job description is pretty clear. Are you coming with me or not?
XANDER What's the rush, Buff? If we're going into a nest, maybe we should come up with a strategy. Wait for Riley.
BUFFY Back me up or not. I'm going.
GILES Anya, will you mind the store?
ANYA Have a nice day! Don't get killed.
BUFFY I don't understand. This place was doing serious business last night.
XANDER Well, I guess everybody jumped ship once the word got out that the slayer found their crib. I just want to apologize for the use of the word 'crib.'
BUFFY Do you think they'll set up shop again in town?
GILES It's hard to say. I'm sure they'll lie low for a bit.
BUFFY But they're around somewhere. There's gotta be a way to find these creeps.
WILLOW Don't worry, Buff, you'll find them.
XANDER Yeah, I'm sure you'll get them next time, champ.
SPIKE What took you? Guess it takes a while to get back to full strength after those bites.
SPIKE Hey! Hey, let's be reasonable about this.
RILEY You may have noticed, Spike, I left reasonable about three exits back.
SPIKE Look, I'm not the one who got you into this. Don't kill the messenger.
RILEY Why the hell not?
SPIKE Ow! Bloody hell! Oh god! Hey.
RILEY Plastic wood-grain. Looks real, doesn't it? Don't think I don't know what's goin' on with you, Spike. Stay away from her. Or we'll do this for real next time.
SPIKE Oh, man. You are really under it, aren't you?
RILEY What?
SPIKE Look at you. All afraid I'm hot for your honey.
RILEY Because you are.
SPIKE Well ... yeah. But that's not your problem. Even if I wasn't in the picture, you're never gonna be able to hold onto her.
SPIKE Ow, bloody hell!
RILEY Maybe I didn't almost kill you enough.
SPIKE Come on. You're not the long haul guy and you know it.
RILEY Shut up.
SPIKE You know it. Or else you wouldn't be getting suck jobs from two-bit vampire trulls.
SPIKE The girl needs some monster in her man ... and that's not in your nature... ...no matter how low you try to go.
RILEY You actually think you've got a shot with her?
SPIKE No, I don't. Fella's gotta try, though. Gotta do what he can.RILEY: If you touched her... you know I'd kill you for real.
SPIKE I had this chip outta my head, I'da killed you long ago. Ain't love grand?
SPIKE Sometimes I envy you so much it chokes me. And sometimes I think I got the better deal. To be that close to her and not have her. To be all alone even when you're holding her. Feeling her, feeling her beneath you. Surrounding you. The scent ... No, you got the better deal.
RILEY I'm the lucky guy. Yeah.
RILEY I'm the guy.
XANDER How long has she been in there?
ANYA A while now. Seems pretty gung-ho about it too. Didn't even stop to say hello.
XANDER Yeah, when we went to deal with that vampire nest, she got all Rambo and torched the place. Something seriously bad is going on with her.
ANYA Oh, I don't know, maybe you're overreacting. I mean, who hasn't done stuff like that from time to time? I mean, I made this one guy spontaneously combust, and he set his whole village on fire.
XANDER Can you stop being scary for a minute and listen to what I'm trying to tell you?
RILEY She in there?
XANDER She's training.
RILEY Would you guys mind clearing out? I need a minute alone with her.
ANYA A little after-hours hanky-panky in the training room, huh? Boy, Xander and I could tell you some stories...
XANDER Not now. Let's go, Anya.
ANYA There's a funny thing with the vaulting horse that you can tr...
XANDER Anya!
ANYA What? He started it.
XANDER In your world, maybe, but where the people are, this isn't the time for 'Tales of Anya and Xander's Sexcapades.'
ANYA Oh. Uh, well, maybe we can go home and, you know, have 'em.
XANDER Actually, I've got some stuff to take care of.
RILEY We need to talk.
BUFFY I'm not ready to talk to you yet.
RILEY Too bad.
BUFFY I'm serious. Unless you wanna fight.
RILEY So let's fight. We need to have this out, Buffy. Right now.
BUFFY And say what, Riley? 'What were you thinking? How long have you been lying to me?' Nothing you say right now is gonna make this better.
RILEY I realize that. I don't expect... I just need you to hear me out.
BUFFY Fine. Get your hand off of me.
RILEY I think, when this thing started, it was just some stupid, immature game. I wanted to even the score after you let Dracula bite you.
BUFFY I did not *let* Dracula-
RILEY I know. On some level I know that. But I was still spun. I don't know, I - I wanted to know what you felt. I wanted to know why Dracula and Angel have so much power over you.
BUFFY You so don't get it.
RILEY I wanted to get it, Buffy. I wanted to get you.
BUFFY So this is my fault? Hey, gee, Buffy's so mysterious, I think I'll go out and almost die. I think I'll go and let some other w...
RILEY This isn't your fault. It's mine. I feel like hell for what I've put you through. It's just... these girls-
BUFFY Vampires. Killers.
RILEY They made me feel something, Buffy. Something I didn't even know I was missing until-
BUFFY I can't. I can't hear this.
RILEY You *need* to hear this.
BUFFY Fine. Fine! Tell me about your whores! Tell me what on earth they were giving you that I can't.
RILEY They needed me.
BUFFY They needed your money. It wasn't about you.
RILEY No. On some basic level it *was* about me. My blood, my body. When they bit me ... it was beyond passion. They wanted to devour me, all of me.
BUFFY Why are you telling me this?
RILEY It wasn't real. I know, it was just physical. But the fact that I craved it ... that, that I kept going back ... even if it was fleeting, they made me feel like they had such... hunger for me.
BUFFY And I don't ... make you feel that way? How on earth can you compare me to that? How can you tell me you understand what those vampires are feeling? You aren't a passion to them, you are a snack! A willing, idiotic snack.
RILEY No, I know exactly what they feel when they bite me, because I feel it every time we're together. It's like the whole world falls away. And all there is is you.
BUFFY And you think that I don't feel the same way about you? How dare you tell me what I feel?
RILEY You keep me at a distance, Buffy. You didn't even call me when your mom went into the hospital.
BUFFY Oh, I'm sorry. You know, um, I'm sorry that I couldn't take care of you when I thought that my mother was dying.
RILEY It's about me taking care of you! It's about letting me in. So you don't have to be on top of everything all the time.
BUFFY But I do. That's part of what being a slayer is. And that's what this is really about, isn't it? You can't handle the fact that I'm stronger than you.
RILEY It's hard sometimes, yeah. But that's not it.
BUFFY Then what? What else do you want from me, Riley? I've given you everything that I have, I've given you my heart, my body and soul!
RILEY You say that, but I don't feel it. I just don't feel it.
BUFFY Well, whose fault its that? Because I'm telling you, this is it, this is me. This is the package. And if it's so deficient that you need to get your kicks elsewhere ... then we really have a problem.
RILEY They want me back, Buffy ... the military. It's deep undercover, no contact with civilians. Transport's leaving tonight.
BUFFY Tonight? When were you gonna tell me about this?
RILEY I'm telling you now.
BUFFY Are you going?
RILEY I don't know. If we can't work this out...
BUFFY Then what? This is goodbye? You are unbelievable. You're giving me an ultimatum?
RILEY No, I'm not.
BUFFY Yes you are! You expect me to get over it now or you're gone!
RILEY I don't, Buffy, that's not what I meant.
BUFFY Well, I have heard enough. I will not take the blame for this.
RILEY I'm not asking you to.
BUFFY Let go of me!
RILEY Or what? You'll hit me? Go ahead. Come on, do it.
BUFFY Get out of my way.
RILEY I'm serious, Buffy, hit me. Hit me.
RILEY I'm leaving, Buffy.
RILEY Unless you give me a reason to stay ... I'm leaving tonight.
VAMP2 The pyro act was a bad idea, slayer.
BUFFY Felt pretty good to me.
VAMP2 I'm not running. And you're not shutting me down.
VAMP2 In fact ... you're not gonna make it through the night.Blackout.
BUFFY Walk away. I'm serious. Don't do this. Not now.
XANDER So, how'd that work out for ya?
XANDER Make you feel better?
BUFFY What are you doing here?
XANDER I thought you might need to talk. Then I saw the skirmish happen. I was gonna lend a hand, but I noticed you grew a few extra ones.
BUFFY Go home, Xander.
XANDER Buffy.
BUFFY I'm serious!
XANDER So am I. Something's up. You're acting like a crazy person.
XANDER Take this, for instance. You don't wanna deal, so you hide? It's not very slayer-like.
BUFFY Just leave me alone, Xander. You have no idea what's going on.
XANDER No? Good, so you and Riley *aren't* imploding? It doesn't take a genius. What I can't figure out is how you never saw it coming.
BUFFY What? Who told you?
XANDER Nobody told me anything, Buffy. It was right in front of my Xander face. The guy would do anything for you.
BUFFY The guy got himself bit by a vampire! He lied to me. He ran around behind my back and almost got himself killed! And now he tells me that he's leaving with some covert military operation at midnight unless *I* convince him not to. Now tell me that you understand. Because I sure as hell don't.
XANDER You gonna let him go?
BUFFY It's not my decision to make.
XANDER Of course it is.
BUFFY Well, it's not fair.
XANDER Who cares if it's fair? In about twenty minutes, Riley's gonna disappear, maybe forever, unless you do something to stop him.
BUFFY What am I supposed to do? Beg him to stay?
XANDER Why wouldn't you? To keep Riley here-
BUFFY I don't even know who he is any more. I mean, I thought he was ... dependable.
XANDER Dependable? What is he, State Farm?
BUFFY You know what I mean.
XANDER Yeah. I think you mean convenient. I think you took it for granted that he was gonna show up when you wanted him to, and take off when you didn't.
BUFFY Look who's talking. Look who has Anya following him around like a lovesick puppy.
XANDER Oh boy, is this *not* about me.
BUFFY Is she more than a convenience? 'Cause that would kinda be a surprise.
XANDER If you don't wanna hear what I have to say, I'll shut up right now.
BUFFY Good, 'cause I don't.
XANDER I lied. See, what I think, you got burned with Angel, then Riley shows up.
BUFFY I know the story, Xander.
XANDER But you miss the point. You shut down, Buffy. And you've been treating Riley like the rebound guy. When he's the one that comes along once in a lifetime. He's never held back with you. He's risked everything. And you're about to let him fly because you don't like ultimatums?
XANDER If he's not the guy, if what he needs from you just isn't there, let him go. Break his heart, and make it a clean break. But if you really think you can love this guy ... I'm talking scary, messy, no-emotions-barred need ... if you're ready for that ... then think about what you're about to lose.
BUFFY Xander...
XANDER Run.
BUFFY Riley! Riley!
BUFFY Riley! Riley!
XANDER_VOICEOVER I've gotta say something...
XANDER 'Cause ... I don't think I've made it clear.
XANDER I'm in love with you.
XANDER Powerfully, painfully in love. The things you do ... the way you think ... the way you move ... I get excited every time I'm about to see you.
XANDER You make me feel like I've never felt before in my life. Like a man. I just thought you might wanna know.
