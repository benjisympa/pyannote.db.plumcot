GILES_VOICEOVER Previously on
MONK We had to hide the key ... made it human...
MONK ...and sent it to you.
BUFFY_VOICEOVER Dawn.
GLORY Did you know your sister took my key, Dawnie? And she won't give it back! I bet you know where she put it, don't you?
BUFFY She doesn't know anything.
BUFFY Okay, let's see who you are.
ORLANDO The Knights of Byzantium, an ancient order. And now your enemy. So long as you protect the key, the brotherhood will never stop until we destroy it and you.
SPIKE Look at you. All afraid I'm hot for your honey.
RILEY_VOICEOVER Because you are.
SPIKE Well ... yeah.
BUFFY Just tell me what kind of demon I'm fighting.
QUINTON_TRAVERS Glory isn't a demon.
BUFFY What is she?
TRAVERS She's a god.
BUFFY Look, I know Mom wants to gather and make with the merry tomorrow night, but with everything that's going on...
WILLOW This is exactly what you need. A 20th birthday party with, with, with presents, and funny hats, and, and those candles that don't blow out... Those used to scare me.
TARA Me too.
BUFFY I just don't think this is the best time to break out the party pinata. We need to stay focused if we're gonna find a way to stop Glory.
XANDER We're going up against a god. An actual mightier-than-thou god.
WILLOW Well, you know what they say, the bigger they are-
ANYA The faster they stomp you into nothing.
BUFFY She's right. I've thrown everything I've got at her and she just shrugs it off.
WILLOW Then we have to find something heavier to throw.
GILES That might pose some difficulty. From what the Council's been able to discover from the book of Tarnis and, and, and other sources, Glory and two of her fellow hellgods ruled over ... one of the more seriously unpleasant demon dimensions.
TARA There's more than one?
ANYA Oh, there are thousands of demon dimensions. All different.
GILES All pushing on the edges of our reality, trying to find a way in.
BUFFY I guess Glory found one. The question is, why?
GILES There's nothing to indicate that here. Just ... vague references to ... chaos and destruction.
BUFFY Okay, so, we know where Glory's from. What do we know about her? You know, she's tough, yeah, but, but no bolts of lightning, no blasts of fire, shouldn't a god be able to do that kind of stuff?
GILES Uh, usually, yes, but um, being in human form must be severely limiting her powers. All we have to worry about right now is she's immortal, invulnerable, and insane.
XANDER A *crazy* hellgod? And the fun just keeps on leaving.
GILES From what I've been able to gather, her living in this world is ... seriously affecting her mental state as well. She's only being able to keep her mind intact by, uh, extracting energy from us. Well, from, from the human brain.
TARA She, she, she's a brain-sucker?
GILES She, um ... absorbs the energies that bind the human mind into a cohesive whole. Once drained, all that's left behind is, uh-
BUFFY Crazy people.
GILES Which is, I'm afraid, why there's been a marked increase in the ranks of the mentally unstable here in Sunnydale.
TARA At least vampires just kill you.
BUFFY We have to find a way to stop her.
WILLOW Oh, well, Tara and I can work on some tactical spells.
ANYA I can do some research. I know *way* more about demon dimensions than Giles does. Well, I do.
XANDER This is great long-term plan-y stuff, but what about this ... key thingy Glory's looking for?
TARA Yeah, I mean, shouldn't we be trying to find it before she does?
BUFFY I don't think that's what we should be worrying about right now.
WILLOW They've got a point. Whatever Glory's planning on opening with the key, I'm guessing it won't be filled with candy and flowers.
XANDER So where should we start looking? Do we know where it used to be kept? Who saw it last?
BUFFY We did. Giles and me. We, we know where it is.
XANDER You what?
WILLOW You know, and you didn't tell us?
GILES There were ... reasons.
BUFFY Look, i-if Glory knew that you guys knew where it was, I ... I-I just didn't wanna put you in that kind of danger.
XANDER As opposed to the other kind we're always in?
WILLOW You should have said something.
BUFFY Will, there- You're right. It's time.
GILES Are you sure?
BUFFY If they're gonna be risking their lives, they deserve to know.
XANDER Know what?
BUFFY There's something that you need to know ... about Dawn.
ORLANDO The link must be severed. Such is the will of God.
KNIGHTS The key is the link. The link must be severed. Such is the will of God. The key is the link. The link must be severed. Such is the will of God.
JINX You really think *he* is going to help you?
JINX I fear your faith is gravely misplaced.
ORLANDO Shall we test your faith now?
GLORY Never send a minion to do a god's work.
GLORY Hey, nice sword. Bet it hurts.
DAWN You guys doin' a spell?
WILLOW Dawn, hey. Y-yeah, we're doing an early warning incantation. If anything hellgodishly powerful comes within a hundred feet of the shop, then screechy siren things will, you know, screech.
TARA This should give us a heads-up so we can hide ... the, um, key.
WILLOW We already put one up around your house.
DAWN Cool, can I help?
WILLOW Well, I don't think Buffy would like the, uh, black arts bumpin' auras with the littlest Summers.
DAWN Yeah, whatever.
TARA How can she not be real?
WILLOW She's real, she's just ... kinda ... new.
DAWN Hey. We on the case?
XANDER Yeah. Right on top, perched, ready for action. How's my sweet fancy Dawn doing?
DAWN Fine. What's up with you? Did you get into the sugar again?
ANYA You make a very pretty little girl!
XANDER Anya, you wanna help me with that thing?
ANYA Xander needs help with his thing!
GILES I'm not sure our regular workout is ... challenging you any more. Perhaps we should make it harder.
BUFFY You always think harder is better. Maybe next time I patrol I should carry a load of bricks, use a stake made of butter.
GILES Very amusing.
GILES I'm sure Dawn feels that way about her schoolwork sometimes.
BUFFY That true? How was school today?
DAWN Um, the usual. Big square building filled with boredom and despair.
BUFFY Just how I remember it.
BUFFY So, what's the homework sitch?
DAWN We have to imagine what we'll be like ten years from now and write a letter to our future self. The teacher's clearly so out of ideas. Wanna help?
BUFFY Maybe later. I have some stuff I have to do first.
DAWN Is it about that weird girl that came to the house?
BUFFY Glory. And no it's not.
DAWN Like you'd tell me anyway. Dawn's too young and Dawn's too delicate.
BUFFY Right. A young delicate pain in my butt.
DAWN I just think you're freakin' out 'cause you have to fight someone prettier than you. That is the case, right?
BUFFY Glory is evil. And powerful. And in no way prettier than me.
DAWN I just think you're getting soft in your advanced age. She didn't look that tough to me.
GLORY Okay. One more time. Just between me and you. Our itsy-bitsy little secret. Where ... is ... the key?
ORLANDO Even if I knew, I'd die a thousand deaths before I'd tell you.
GLORY Well, you won't need a thousand, sweetie. I'll make the first one last. Long time.
GLORY What is it with you religious types? It's intimacy, isn't it?
GLORY Oh! You're just scared of letting someone in! Shh, shh, shh. It's okay. I know how difficult the first time can be. You don't have to be afraid. Just relax. You may not have the info I want ... but you still got something I need.
BUFFY_VOICEOVER Prezzies!
WILLOW See, just what you needed.
BUFFY You are very, very wise. Now gimme, gimme, gimme!
ANYA This is extremely suspenseful! I want the presents.
BUFFY Ohh ... it's beautiful. Thank you, guys.
TARA Well, we thought you'd get lots of crossbows, other killy stuff.
WILLOW Yeah, so we figured, less killy, more frilly.
ANYA Gotta look. Oh, it's just so lovely! Oh, I wish it was mine!
ANYA Oh, like you weren't all thinking the same thing.
GILES I'm fairly certain I wasn't. I've got one just like it.
DAWN Here. Open mine.
BUFFY It's not gonna explode, is it?
DAWN It's when we visited Dad that summer in San Diego. Um, I put the shells on it myself. We picked them off the beach.
BUFFY I remember.
DAWN Well, geez, don't get all movie-of-the-week. I was just too cheap to buy a real present.
BUFFY Thank you.
JOYCE It still seems to me like there's a lot you don't know about this. I mean, is she dangerous?
BUFFY No.
GILES Well, now, wait just a second. I assume you're talking about her existence rather than her intentions.
JOYCE Exactly.
BUFFY Dawn? What are you doing in there? Party gettin' slow?
DAWN Uh, we need plates. Cake time.
DAWN Why does everybody start acting all weird when I'm around?
XANDER Me? Me not weird.
DAWN I'm not an idiot. I know you're talking about me.
XANDER No, no, we really weren't.
ANYA We were talking about sex.
DAWN They were talking about me, just like everybody is.
XANDER Again, not so much. In fact, none.
ANYA We were talking about sex. I mean, you know us, sometimes we like to pretend stuff-
JOYCE Um...
XANDER Anya!
ANYA You know, like, say there's a fireman, or a shepherd-
BUFFY You know what? Let's not have this exchange of images right now.
DAWN Oh. Right. Of course. Can't let Dawn hear anything. Fine. I'm just gonna go to bed. That way I won't accidentally get exposed to, like, words.
WILLOW Cake?
DAWN Geez! Lurk much?
SPIKE I wasn't lurking. I was standing about. It's a whole different vibe.
DAWN What is- Are you giving Buffy a birthday present? Oh my god. Weird. And chocolates? Lame. And the box is all bent, and, well, you know she'd never touch anything from you anyway.
SPIKE Shouldn't you be tucked away in your beddy-bye? All warm and safe where nothing can eat you?
DAWN Is that supposed to scare me?
SPIKE Little tremble wouldn't hurt.
DAWN Sorry, it's just ... come on. *I'm* badder than you.
SPIKE Are not!
DAWN Am too. You're standing in the bushes hugging a bent box of chocolates, and I'm-
SPIKE What? Sneaking out to braid hair and watch Teletubbies with your mates?
DAWN No. I'm breaking into the magic shop ... to steal things.
SPIKE Magic shop, eh? All number of beasties between here and there. Bet they'd really go for a little red riding hood like you. Bet that wouldn't sit too well with big sister.
DAWN I can take care of myself.
DAWN You wanna come steal some stuff?
SPIKE Yeah, all right.
DAWN Do you know how to do that or not?
SPIKE Give us a sec. I usually just burst through doors.
SPIKE That's right! Who's bad now?
SPIKE Girl with a mission, eh? What's the caper? Jewels? Ancient artifacts? Or just plain hard cash liberated from the till?
DAWN A book.
SPIKE All this for a book?
DAWN I don't want the book. Just what's inside. I think it was Giles' notes. He was standing here, and when I turned around it was gone.
SPIKE Where did he learn to write so bloody small, from a fruit fly?
DAWN Wait, here's something. Uh, Tarnis, 12th century. One of the founders of the monks of the order of Dagon. Their sole purpose appears to have been as protectors of the key.
SPIKE Brown-robe types are always protecting something. It's the only way they can justify giving up girls. Hey! Troll hammer.
SPIKE Didn't go with my stuff anyway.
DAWN The key is not directly described in any known literature, but all research indicates an energy matrix vibrating at a dimensional frequency beyond normal human perception. Only those outside reality can see the key's true nature. Outside reality. What's that mean?
SPIKE Mm. Second-sight blokes, mostly. Or even just your run-of-the-mill lunatics.
CRAZY_SECURITY_GUARD There! There's no one in there.
CRAZY_GUY I know what you are.
SPIKE What else does it say about this key? Is it made out of gold? Maybe we can hock it, split the take.
DAWN Um, The key is also susceptible to necromanced animal detection, particularly those of canine or serpent construct.
SPIKE The monks possessed the ability to transform energy, bend reality. Blah, blah, blah. Good lord, Giles writes as dull as he talks, doesn't he? They started work. But the Council ... has suggested ... to us that they were interrupted. Presumably by ... Glory. They obviously did manage to accomplish the taste... accomplish the task. They had to be certain the Slayer would protect it with her life. So they sent the key to her ... in human form. In the form of a sister.
SPIKE Huh! I guess that's you, nibblet.
WILLOW Not even a card, huh?
BUFFY I wasn't really expecting one. No contact with civilians. There's probably a ... code name for it. You know, like radio silence, it's greeting card silence.
WILLOW Sorry.
BUFFY Maybe it's time to start a new tradition. Birthdays without boyfriends. It could be just as much fun.
WILLOW Preaching to the choir here, baby.
TARA Yeah, some of my best- Oh-oh my god.
DAWN Is this blood?
BUFFY Dawn!
JOYCE Oh, baby.
BUFFY What did you do?!
DAWN This is blood, isn't it? It can't be me. I'm not a key. I'm not a thing.
JOYCE Oh, sweetie, no. Wha-what is this all about?
DAWN What am I? Am I real? Am I anything?
WILLOW If you need anything-
BUFFY Thanks.
GILES Perhaps I should stay, you know, just in case.
BUFFY This is a family thing. We should deal with this.
GILES Okay.
DAWN Why didn't you tell me?
BUFFY We were going to. It just...
JOYCE We thought it would be better if we waited until you were older.
DAWN How old am I now?
JOYCE You're fourteen, sweetheart, you know that.
DAWN No. The monks. When did ... when did they ...
BUFFY Six months ago.
DAWN I've only been alive for six months, huh?
JOYCE Honey, you've been alive a lot longer than that to us.
DAWN You don't know that! You don't know anything. I'm, I'm just a key, right? Everything about me is made up.
BUFFY Dawn ... Mom and I know what we feel. I know I care about you. I know that I worry about you-
DAWN You worry about me because you have to. I'm your job. Protect the key, right?
BUFFY I worry because my sister is cutting herself!
DAWN Yeah? How do you know? Maybe this is just another fake memory from my fake family.
JOYCE Sweetheart-
DAWN Get out.
BUFFY Dawn...
DAWN Get out, get out, get out!
BUFFY We need answers, Giles.
BUFFY We need to find out everything we can about the key. What's it for, who created it.
XANDER And why Glory has a big girl-god jones for it.
BUFFY This isn't about her. It's about Dawn. She deserves to know where she came from. She needs to know. Or it's just gonna eat away at her.
GILES How did she find these? How did she get in here?
ANYA Ew! Who's been using the urn of Ishtar as an ashtray?
SPIKE Morning, sunshine. If you've come around for eggs or sausage, I'm fresh out.
SPIKE Hey, careful! These are wet.
BUFFY How could you let her find out like that? From books and papers? You hate me that much?
SPIKE I was just along for the ride. Not like I knew she was mystical glowy key thing. Nobody keeps me in the bloody loop, do they?
BUFFY You could have stopped her.
SPIKE Oh, yeah, here it comes. Something goes wrong in your life, blame Spike. News flash, blondie. If kid sis wants to grab a midnight stroll, she'll find a way sooner or later. I just thought she'd be safer with big bad looking over her shoulder.
BUFFY She shouldn't have found out like that.
SPIKE You didn't think you could keep the truth from her forever, did you? Maybe if *you* had been more honest with her in the first place, you wouldn't be trying to make yourself feel better with a round of Kick The Spike.
JOYCE Honey? You're gonna be late for school.
DAWN I'm not going. Blobs of energy don't need an education.
JOYCE You want me to make you some soup? I think there's some chicken and stars...
DAWN I'm not sick! I'm not anything.
JOYCE Honey, calm down, okay...
DAWN Don't tell me what to do. You're not my mother.
DAWN I changed my mind. I'd rather be at school.
BEN All right, fellas, today we've got blues, greens, and... oh, hey, chartreuse. It's a party.
ORLANDO It won't stick. The birds have been pecking too hard.
BEN Byzantium.
JINX Yes, they've arrived. Unfortunate, but not completely unexpected.
BEN How many?
JINX Their numbers are few for the moment, but they will grow. The Knights of Byzantium are like ants. First you see one, then two, then the picnic's ruined. No matter how many we kill, they'll keep coming ... wave after wave. It's time to set old animosities aside. Your fate is directly linked to her magnificently-scented Glorificus. She's been extremely forgiving of your considerable foibles up until now, but if you persist in your defiance, she'll be forced to-
BEN To what? What is she going to do? Send a six-pack of minions to bore me to death? Glory can't lay a finger on me. You know it, I know it, she knows it. So save the threats, or I'll finish the job I started on your head.
JOYCE We can't just let her sit up there all alone.
BUFFY She needs time. We can't force her to be all right with this.
JOYCE That's your answer? Just ... leave her alone and hope that everything works itself out?
BUFFY No, but if I were her, I'd want a little bit of time right now. I wouldn't want my mother and my sister coming at me from all sides.
JOYCE Her school called today. She was suspended.
JOYCE She yelled at a teacher. The things she said, Buffy, I mean she never used language like that
BUFFY She probably feels like she can say or do anything right now. She's not real. We're not her family, we don't even know what she is.
JOYCE How can you talk about Dawn as if she's a thing?
BUFFY I'm not! I'm just ... saying that's probably how she feels.
JOYCE Well, then we have to show her that it isn't true. She needs to know that she's still a part of this family and that we love her.
BUFFY It's not that simple! We're not gonna be able to fix this with a hug and a kiss and a bowl of soup! Dawn needs to know where she came from, she needs real answers.
JOYCE What she needs is her sister, Buffy, not the Slayer.
BUFFY The Slayer is the only thing standing between Dawn ... and this god from the bitch dimension that wants to shove her in some kind of lock and give her a good twirl. Mom, I need to be out there, doing my job-
BUFFY Oh my god, Glory. It's Willow's spell.
JOYCE Wait. It's not Glory.
BUFFY Damn it.
BUFFY Dawn!
JOYCE Buffy.
BUFFY No. No, she could have burned the house down.
JOYCE Buffy ... she's gone.
BUFFY She tore up her room ... she burned all of her diaries.
XANDER The
WILLOW She's been keeping those since ... I mean...
BUFFY Since she was seven. I remember too, Will. We have to find her. Fast. Before Glory or the knights of hack-n-slash figure out what - *who* she really is. Mom's gonna stay at home in case she shows up. I figure we split up and sweep the city. Anya. Will you stay here in case she shows up? Xander, Giles, you guys take the center of town. Willow, Tara, west side. Spike, you and I'll get the east side.
BUFFY Just find her ... please.
YOUNG_DAWN Bet you can't push me all the way around!
YOUNG_BUFFY Oh yes I can!
YOUNG_DAWN No you can't!
XANDER There's so many things I remember. Seeing Dawn ... hanging with her ... listening to Buffy complain about her. Mostly that last one. How could it be that all those things never really happened?
GILES Well, it takes some getting used to. The idea of a ... bright fourteen-year-old actually being living energy thousands of years old.
XANDER I'm guessing some kind of super-powerful in her raw form.
GILES People have killed, died for it ... summoned armies to control the key.
XANDER You know, uh ... she kinda has a crush on me.
GILES Your point being?
XANDER Well nothing, no, uh ... just saying, powerful being ... big energy gal digging the Xan-man. Some guys are just cooler, you know?
BUFFY Dawn! Dawn!
SPIKE Yeah, that should do it.
BUFFY Shut up.
SPIKE The nibblet scampered off to get away from you. She hears you bellowing, she's gonna pack it in the opposite direction. Can't say I blame her.
BUFFY You were right. This is my fault. I should have told her.
SPIKE Look, she probably would have skipped off anyway, even if she never found out. She's not just a blob of energy, she's also a fourteen-year-old hormone bomb. Which one's screwing her up more right now, spin the bloody wheel. You'll find her, just in the nick of time, that's what you hero types do.
SPIKE You'll find her.
BUFFY And then what?
PATIENT_1 It's here. It's here. It's here.
PATIENT_2 Can't stop.
PATIENT_1 It's here. It's here.
PATIENT_2 Make it stop. The skin's too tight.
PATIENT_1 Can't hear it. What's the frequency? Empty. All spilled out.
DAWN Please. Y-you see me, right? Look at me.
PATIENT_2 Can't stop it!
DAWN You know what I am, don't you? You all know!
PATIENT_1 Can't hear it, can't hear it, can't hear it
DAWN Tell me!
PATIENT_1 Can't hear it, can't hear it ...
DAWN What am I?
ORLANDO The key.
ORLANDO I found it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
DAWN You know what the key is? Where did I come from? Who made me, wha-what am I?
ORLANDO Thank you, thank you...
DAWN Please!
ORLANDO Destroyer! Cracked ... bones ... the sun bleeding into the sky! The key is the link.
DAWN No, no.
ORLANDO The link must be severed. Such is the will of God. Such is the will of God. Such is the will of God.
ORLANDO Such is the will of God.
PATIENT_1 Can't hear it.
BEN Two steaming cups of chocolate goodness courtesy of ... whoever I swiped it from out of the cupboard. Couldn't find any marshmallows. I'll try to steal some for next time.
DAWN Don't like 'em anyway.
BEN What? Is that even possible?
DAWN Too squishy. When I was five, Buffy told me they were monkey brains, and I-
BEN Dawn, was your mom brought back in? Is that why you're here?
DAWN No. My *mom*'s just fine.
BEN Is there anybody I can call? Your sister?
DAWN I don't have a sister.
BEN Oh ... you two have a fight? It's okay, I know how that goes. I got a sister too. They can be a real pain sometimes. I tell you, there've been a lot of nights I wish she didn't exist either.
DAWN It's not Buffy. It's me. I'm the one that doesn't exist.
BEN Look, I know it can feel that way sometimes, but when you're older-
DAWN No, you don't understand. It's not real. None of this. They made it.
BEN Dawn-
DAWN I'm nothing! I'm just a thing the monks made so Glory couldn't find me. I'm not real.
BEN You're the key?
DAWN How do you know about the key?
BEN Go! Before she finds you. Don't ask me how she knows, 'cause she always knows. Just go.
DAWN Wait! Calm down, just tell me-
BEN You don't understand, you're a kid. You stay, she'll find you. She finds you, she'll hurt you.
DAWN What's wrong with you?
BEN You're what she's been searching for. I am telling you, run. You don't know, you - Oh god. Oh god no, she's coming. I can feel it, you've gotta get out. No ... oh no, she's here!
BEN She's here!
GLORY Hey, don't I know you?
GLORY Ugh, cotton!
GLORY Could a fabric be more annoyingly pedestrian? Now *this* is what I'm talkin' about. Makes your skin sing.
DAWN You're-you're Ben...
GLORY Uh, it's an eensy more complicated than that. Family always is, isn't it?
GLORY You'd never make it. I'd rip out your spine before you got half a step. And those little legs? They wouldn't be much good without one of those.
GLORY Would they, Dawnie?
GLORY Now. What I'm trying to noodle, is what in the world was the Slayer's little sis doing here with gentle Ben?
DAWN Y-you don't remember?
GLORY Remember what? You were talking to him, not me. Oh, he wasn't being naughty, was he?
GUARD Excuse me, ma'am. This area's for hospital personnel-
GLORY Rude! I was talking! What do you say ... we find a nice place off the beaten where you and I can have a long uninterrupted chat.
WILLOW We looked, but no Dawn.
BUFFY What about the carousel?
TARA Checked there too.
BUFFY Nothing?
XANDER Sorry, Buff.
BUFFY Anything could have happened to her. Not just Glory.
BUFFY We better check the hospital.
GLORY Okay. Small talk over. I'm in a bit of a crunch here, so let's cut right to the ooey gooey center. Your sister, the Slayer, has my key. It's mine, I want it. Do you know where she squirreled it away? There's ice cream and puppydogs in it for you if you start singin'.
DAWN I'm not sure. What does it look like?
GLORY Well... the last time I caught a peep ... it was a bright green swirly shimmer. Really brought out the blue in my eyes. But then those sneaky little monks pulled an abracadabra, so now it could look like anything. You see the predicament I'm in.
DAWN Maybe...
GLORY Yes?
DAWN Well, maybe if you ... told me more about it, I'd know if I've seen it.
GLORY Okay.
BUFFY She wasn't brought in.
XANDER Which is a happy thing, right?
BUFFY I don't know, I...
DOCTOR ...found him on the floor in the break room. You guys gotta see him. His head's almost twisted clean off.
BUFFY Glory.
DAWN So this ... key thing ... it's been around for a long time?
GLORY Well, not as long as me, but ... yeah. Just this side of forever.
DAWN Is it evil?
GLORY Totally!
GLORY Well, no, not really. I guess it depends on your point of view.
DAWN What's it for? I mean ... if it's a key, there's gotta be a lock, right?
GLORY Yes. We have a winner.
DAWN S-so what does it open?
GLORY I smell a fox in my hen house. Is that why you've been playing sugar and spice with old Uncle Ben? Trying to get a peek at Glory's unmentionables?
DAWN No, I-
GLORY Shh! I kinda wanna hear me talking right now. Me talking. You know what I'm starting to think? I'm thinking ... that maybe you ... don't have any idea where my key is.
GLORY Very irritating. Irrational. Know what I mean, tiny snapdragon? Like...
GLORY ...bugs under my skin. And say, I'm feelin' a little...
DAWN What's wrong with you?
GLORY Hey. Hey! This doesn't have to be a complete waste of my precious time. I've been meaning to send the Slayer a message. And I could use a little pick-me-up. Two birds, one stone, and Boom. You have yummy dead birds.
BUFFY Get away from my sister.
GLORY Hey, we were just talking about you.
BUFFY Conversation's over, hell-bitch.
SPIKE I thought you said this skank was tough.
GLORY He wakes up, tell your boyfriend to watch his mouth.
BUFFY He is NOT my boyfriend.
GLORY Hey, those are really nice shoes.
BUFFY Giles, now!
GLORY Oh, please. Like that's-
GLORY Hey! Watch the hair.
GLORY Time to start the dyin'. Start with the whelp!
BUFFY Dawn!
DAWN Buffy!
BUFFY Get back!
GLORY Nice catch. Is that the best you little crap-gnats can muster? 'Cause I gotta tell ya, so not impressed.
GLORY Look what you did to my dress, you little-
!_(latin disperse or separate)
TARA Willow!
BUFFY Dawn.
BUFFY What did you do to her?
WILLOW Teleportation spell. Still working out the kinks.
BUFFY Where'd you send her?
WILLOW Don't know. That's one of the kinks.
GLORY Oh, sh-
GILES That was an incredibly ... dangerous spell for an adept at your level.
WILLOW Yep. Won't be trying that one again soon.
BUFFY Are you okay? Did she hurt you?
DAWN Why do you care?
BUFFY Because I love you. You're my sister.
DAWN No I'm not.
BUFFY Yes you are. Look, it's blood. It's Summers blood.
BUFFY It's just like mine. It doesn't matter where you came from, or, or how you got here. You are my sister. There's no way you could annoy me so much if you weren't.
DAWN I was so scared.
BUFFY Me too.
BUFFY Come on.
DAWN Wait. Ben. He was here, he was trying to help me. He... I ... I think he might have left before Glory came ... I can't, I can't remember.
BUFFY It's okay. Don't worry about it. Next time we see him, we'll thank him. I have to get you back home though. Mom's freaking out.
DAWN Oh. Is she mad about the whole fire thing?
BUFFY I think you sorta have a get-out-of-jail-free card on account of big love and trauma.
DAWN Really? Okay. Good.
DAWN You think she'd raise my allowance?
BUFFY Don't push it.
