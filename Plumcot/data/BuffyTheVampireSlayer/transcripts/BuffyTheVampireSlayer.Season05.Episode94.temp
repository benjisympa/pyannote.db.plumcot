BUFFY Hey, Mom.
BUFFY Ooh.
BUFFY Still a couple of guys gettin' it right.
BUFFY Hey. Flower-gettin' lady. Want me to pick Dawn up from school?
BUFFY Mom?
BUFFY What are you doing?
BUFFY Mom? Mom? Mommy?
JOYCE I think we're just about ready for pie.
XANDER Then I'll be pretty much ready for barf.
BUFFY Xander!
XANDER No, no, barf from the eating. 'Cause all was good, and too much goodness...
JOYCE I'm taking it as a compliment.
GILES Yes, uh, everything was delicious.
ANYA Yes, I'm going to barf too.
JOYCE Everyone's so sweet.
XANDER How you doing there, Will, are you in the vomit club too?
WILLOW I had too much nog.
TARA Oh, baby, want me to rub your tummy? She likes it when I ... stop explaining things.
DAWN My nog tastes funny. I think I got one with rum in it.
WILLOW That's bad.
XANDER Yeah, now Santa's gonna pass you right by, naughty booze hound.
WILLOW Santa always passes me by. Something puts him off. Could be the big honkin' menorah.
TARA Oh, did you write him a letter?
XANDER What'd you ask for?
DAWN Um, guys, hello, puberty? Sorta figured out the whole no Santa thing.
ANYA That's a myth.
DAWN Yeah.
ANYA No, I mean, it's a myth that it's a myth. There is a Santa Claus.
XANDER The advantage of having a thousand-year-old girlfriend. Inside scoop.
TARA There's a Santa Claus?
ANYA Mm-hmm. Been around since, like, the 1500s. He wasn't always called Santa, but you know, Christmas night, flying reindeer, coming down the chimney all true.
DAWN All true?
ANYA Well, he doesn't traditionally bring presents so much as, you know, disemboweled children, but otherwise...
TARA The reindeer part was nice.
JOYCE Damn it! I hate this oven. It burnt.
BUFFY Oh, no, it's just blackened, you know, it's, it's Cajun pie.
GILES Shall I open another?
JOYCE Oh, do you think we dare?
BUFFY As long as you two stay away from the band candy, I'm cool with anything.
JOYCE You are a demon child.
BUFFY I live to torment you, is that so wrong?
JOYCE A daughter's duty, I suppose.
BUFFY Look, all we have to do is just cut off a little bit of the burnt...
BUFFY Mom! Mom! Mom Mom Mom-
911_OPERATOR 911 emergency.
BUFFY Hello?
911_OPERATOR Do you have...
BUFFY My mom, she, she's not breathing.
911_OPERATOR Is she conscious?
BUFFY No. I-I-I can't, she, she's not breathing.
911_OPERATOR OK, I need you to give me your address.
BUFFY What?
911_OPERATOR I'm gonna send an ambulance over.
BUFFY Si-Sixteen thirty Rivelo, it-it's a house, Rivelo near Hadley.
911_OPERATOR I'm sending a unit right away. Are you alone in the house?
BUFFY Yes.
911_OPERATOR Well, did you see what happened, did she fall?
BUFFY No, no, I-I came home and she-what should I do?
911_OPERATOR Do you know how to administer CPR?
BUFFY No, I don't remember.
911_OPERATOR Okay, it's very simple. You wanna tilt your mother's head back. Cover her mouth with yours, and breathe into her mouth.
BUFFY I know this. I know this. God.
BUFFY I can do this. Okay. Okay.
BUFFY One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight...
BUFFY One, two, three... Oh! Oh god.
BUFFY I, are you there? I, I broke something.
911_OPERATOR Hello?
BUFFY It cracked.
911_OPERATOR Is she breathing?
BUFFY No.
911_OPERATOR Paramedics should be there in a moment. You might have cracked a rib. It's not important.
BUFFY She's cold.
911_OPERATOR The body's cold?
BUFFY No, my mom! Sh-should I make her warm?
911_OPERATOR No ... if she's not responding to CPR, the best thing is to wait for the paramedics, okay?
BUFFY When will they be here?
911_OPERATOR They're very nearby.
BUFFY I have to make a call.
GILES Hello?
BUFFY Giles. You have to come.
GILES Buffy?
BUFFY She's at the house.
BUFFY She's in here.
PARAMEDIC_1 I'm getting no pulse.
PARAMEDIC_2 Let's lay her out.
PARAMEDIC_2 How long's she been like this?
BUFFY I found her, a-a few, few minutes.
PARAMEDIC_2 Was she conscious?
BUFFY No.
PARAMEDIC_1 I'm bagging her.
BUFFY What?
PARAMEDIC_2 We're gonna intubate. Just trying to get her to breathe, all right?
PARAMEDIC_2 This your mother?
BUFFY Yes.
PARAMEDIC_2 She have any serious physical health problems, any history of heart disease?
BUFFY No.
BUFFY I mean, there, there was a tumor, a brain tumor, but she had an operation and she's fine now. She, she's been fine.
PARAMEDIC_1 I got her! My god, we got her!
PARAMEDIC_2 Let's get her on the truck now. I'm calling ahead.
PARAMEDIC_1 Never brought one back this stiff.
JOYCE Buffy.
BUFFY I'm here.
PARAMEDIC_1 It's a miracle. That's what it is, a beautiful miracle.
DOCTOR Good as new.
JOYCE Buffy, thank god you found me in ti-
PARAMEDIC_2 She's cold, man.
PARAMEDIC_2 Call it.
PARAMEDIC_2 I'm sorry.
BUFFY Wha-what do we do now?
PARAMEDIC_2 I'm sorry, but I have to tell you that...
PARAMEDIC_2 ...your mother's dead.
PARAMEDIC_2 It looks like she did die a good while before you found her. There's .. nothing you could have done.
BUFFY W-what...
PARAMEDIC_2 I'm guessing it must have been a aneurysm or some clotting. Some complication from surgery. She probably felt...
PARAMEDIC_2 ...very little pain. I'm gonna call it in. The coroner's office will come by and take her in, and they'll determine the cause of death conclusively.
RADIO Dispatch 7, we have a 206, what's your status?
PARAMEDIC_1 We're moving.
RADIO Location is Beaumont and 9th, your gig is on the street, go now.
PARAMEDIC_1 Okay. We gotta fly.
PARAMEDIC_2 All right. I'm gonna call this right away.
PARAMEDIC_2 Now the coroner's office may take a while. In the meanwhile, I think you should sit. Have a glass of water, and try not to disturb the body.
PARAMEDIC_2 Do you need anything, is there someone you can call?
BUFFY Someone's coming.
PARAMEDIC_1 Let's go.
PARAMEDIC_2 I'm very sorry for your loss.
BUFFY Thank you.
BUFFY Good luck.
GILES Buffy!
GILES What is it? Is it Glory?
BUFFY I'm waiting. The, the coroner's coming.
GILES What?
BUFFY I have to tell Dawn. She's at school. I'll go there.
GILES I'm not sure...
GILES Oh god.
BUFFY No. No. Don't. No, it's too late.
GILES Joyce?
BUFFY They're, they're coming for her, no, no, we're-
GILES Joyce!
BUFFY We're not supposed to move the body!
DAWN Oh, god. I can't believe it.
GIRL It's not that bad.
DAWN How can you say it's not that bad?
DAWN Kevin Berman called me a freak in front of everybody. No, that's no big deal.
LISA He didn't say you were a freak.
DAWN Forget it.
LISA He just said you were ... freaky. Which, you know, freaky can be ... sort of cool.
DAWN Oh yeah. Real cool. I'm a suicidal head-case.
LISA You know it was Kirsty. She was telling people how you were into cutting yourself, and how you-
DAWN That's such a lie! I got cut. By accident. One time.
DAWN Now Kevin thinks I'm a-
LISA Well, that was when you were wigging out about your family, and of course Kirsty's gotta turn everything into a story.
LISA She was telling people that you were adopted.
DAWN What a prima bee-yotch. I swear, if I could make her head explode using only the power of my mind? That's what I'd be doing right about now.
DAWN Great. Now I look like a wet rat.
LISA Yeah, you know you can't go out there looking all cry-faced. That'll just give Kirsty more ammo.
DAWN You know? My big sister could really beat the crap out of her. I mean, really really. Okay. What do you think? Can I show my face?
LISA You're good to go. We're gonna be late anyway.
LISA Kirsty alert.
KIRSTY Hey Dawn.
DAWN Hey.
KIRSTY How you doing, you okay?
DAWN Good, thanks for asking.
DAWN Bee-yotch.
TEACHER Okay. Remember, we're not ... drawing the object.
KEVIN Hey.
DAWN Oh. Hey Kevin.
TEACHER ...and then give me a sense of the spaces around ... the space in-between.
KEVIN What's goin' on?
DAWN Um, negative space.
KEVIN Yeah, what's that all about?
DAWN Yeah.
KEVIN That's pretty good.
DAWN Thanks.
KEVIN So I heard you, like, had a freak-out and cut yourself.
DAWN Uh, no, not even. It was a whole ... it was so not...
KEVIN I've felt like that before. Things get so crazed, you know, you just feel like you wanna do something ... extreme.
DAWN Yeah. I just ... I had a lot of intense stuff going on. A lot of people don't understand that. Pain.
KEVIN Yeah.
DAWN Then Kirsty's gotta blab it everywhere, 'cause she's-
KEVIN Kirsty, man. It's like she thinks, I'm so hot, everybody should just bow down before me. And I'm like, whatever.
DAWN She's so superficial. Everything's always about clothes, or who likes who, and... there's just way more important stuff going on. There's a lot of ... crucial ... you know ... stuff.
KEVIN Yeah.
DAWN Uh, this one time in history, uh, she had this book called
BUFFY Dawn.
BUFFY I have to talk to you.
DAWN Um...
BUFFY What?
DAWN Can it wait? I'm in the middle of a class.
BUFFY I know. Please come with me.
DAWN I thought Mom was picking me up.
DAWN What's going on? Something's going on.
BUFFY Let's go outside.
DAWN No. Tell me what's going on.
BUFFY It's ... bad ... news.
DAWN Well, what is it? What happened?
BUFFY It's bad. Please, can we-
DAWN Where's Mom?
BUFFY Mom ... had an accident. Or, um...
BUFFY ...something went ... wrong from the tumor.
DAWN Is she okay? Is she ... but she's okay? But ... it's, it's serious, but...
BUFFY Dawn...
DAWN No.
DAWN No, it's not true. No, you're a liar, she's fine!
TARA I think they're here.
XANDER Do you wanna come up?
ANYA You're double-parked.
XANDER Let 'em give me a ticket.
WILLOW What do you think? The, the, the purple, right? 'Cause, 'cause it's somber?
WILLOW No. No, it's too depressing, i-it's like, um, a ... funeral, god, I ... Well, this is, this is cheerier, maybe, I-I wanna be cheery, like, like everything is normal?
WILLOW No, that's rude, that's, that's disrespectful. La la la! I don't care!
WILLOW If I had that blue one - Jo-Joyce really liked the blue one. She told me one time. You, you sure it's not in your room?
TARA I-I-I could look again.
WILLOW No, no, I-I, I should, I should wear the purple The purple, I, I, I think the purple, it's just that it's so, I don't know, i-it doesn't mean something bad?
TARA I think it's, um ... royal. Purple means ... royalty.
WILLOW Well, I can't see Buffy at the morgue and be all royal! Oh, I'm the king of everything, I'm better than you! I have to be supportive, I, Buffy needs me to be supportive, I...
WILLOW God, why do all my shirts have such stupid things on them? Why can't I just dress like a grownup? Can't I be a grownup?
TARA Shh.
TARA Shh, darling.
WILLOW I can't do this.
TARA We can do this.
WILLOW Okay. We can be there for Buffy. And Dawn. Little Dawn.
TARA We can be strong.
WILLOW Strong like an Amazon?
TARA Strong like an Amazon, right.
WILLOW Okay. I wish I had the blue.
ANYA So ... what do we do?
XANDER I'm not sure. We'll, uh, talk to Giles.
ANYA Xander, what will *we* do? What will *we* be expected to do?
XANDER Hey.
XANDER How you doing?
XANDER I know the feeling.
WILLOW I'm afraid I'm gonna start to cry again.
ANYA Xander cried at the apartment. It was weird.
WILLOW I-i-it's a, it's a thing we do.
ANYA What's going to happen?
WILLOW Well, I ... I guess we're gonna ... meet them at the morgue, That's where they were ... taking ... her.
TARA Um, Giles said that he, he was gonna go with Joyce, and Buffy was gonna go to ... the school to ... tell Dawn.
XANDER God.
TARA Do you know how to, how to get-
XANDER Yeah. It's at the hospital, it's a wing. We do morgue time in the Scooby gang.
WILLOW I have to change.
XANDER What else did Giles say?
TARA Not a lot.
XANDER Are they sure this was ... natural? I mean, Glory.
TARA Uh, Giles was pretty sure that it wasn't, wasn't her.
XANDER But, I mean, she said she was gonna come after Buffy's family.
TARA I don't-
XANDER I mean, we should be going after her. I mean, she coulda done it, and, and, covered her tracks.
WILLOW Why would she? She'd want us to know.
XANDER I'll tell you what it is. It's the frickin' doctors. I mean, they just let her out, you know? Clean bill of health. Dig a hole in your skull. Here's a band-aid. Next!
WILLOW Xander...
XANDER They should have checked her over, they should have had her in. Well, don't we have enough monsters in this town, the doctors gotta help 'em out?
WILLOW Xander, I-I don't think it was ... any ... it just happened.
XANDER Things don't happen! I mean ... they don't *just* happen. Somebody... I mean, somebody's got...
WILLOW Okay. Let's go. Come on, you and me. Come on.
XANDER You know I can't take you.
WILLOW Damn straight.
ANYA Are we gonna see the body?
WILLOW What?
ANYA Are we gonna be in the room ... with the dead body?
WILLOW I don't know. No.
TARA But I guess we should take over patrolling and all that.
XANDER Yeah.
WILLOW Oh, yeah.
TARA For however long.
XANDER You know it.
WILLOW I can't wear this.
WILLOW I, I really should have the other. Joyce liked it so.
TARA Do you think you coulda left it in the laundry room?
WILLOW Maybe.
TARA I'll go check. I'll, I'll just be one minute.
XANDER We're cool.
ANYA Are they gonna cut the body open?
WILLOW Oh my god! Would you just ... stop talking? Just ... shut your mouth. Please.
ANYA What am I doing?
WILLOW How can you act like that?
ANYA Am I supposed to be changing my clothes a lot? Is that the helpful thing to do?
XANDER Guys...
WILLOW The way you behave-
ANYA Nobody will tell me.
WILLOW Because it's not okay for you to be asking these things!
ANYA But I don't understand!
ANYA I don't understand how this all happens. How we go through this. I mean, I knew her, and then she's, there's just a body, and I don't understand why she just can't get back in it and not be dead anymore. It's stupid. It's mortal and stupid. And, and Xander's crying and not talking, and, and I was having fruit punch, and I thought, well, Joyce will never have any more fruit punch ever, and she'll never have eggs, or yawn or brush her hair, not ever, and no one will explain to me why.
WILLOW We don't know ... how it works... or why.
XANDER Sorry, sorry, some ... pent-up...
WILLOW Xander...
WILLOW Where did your hand go?
XANDER As I was saying, some frustration, and now, uh ... I appear to be stuck.
ANYA My god. Is your hand okay?
XANDER Pretty much. I, I'm really sorry.
ANYA You could have hit an electrical... thing!
XANDER And once again with the sorry.
WILLOW Did it make you feel better?
XANDER For a second there.
WILLOW A whole second?
XANDER In my defense, some crappy wallmanship.
WILLOW Yeah, you can hear everything next door.
XANDER Who did the drywall in this place?
WILLOW I always forget to ask.
TARA Did I miss something?
ANYA Xander decided that he blames the wall.
WILLOW Can you ... turn your wrist?
XANDER Hold on.
XANDER It's okay.
TARA It hurts.
WILLOW Here, wash it off.
ANYA Band-aids?
WILLOW Underneath.
TARA I couldn't find it.
WILLOW It doesn't matter. We should get there.
TARA Yes.
WILLOW I, I wanna be there for Buffy.
XANDER You're right.
XANDER The avengers gotta get to the assembly. We'll go. We'll deal. We'll help. That's what we do. We help Buffy.
ANYA How are we going to help?
XANDER If there's anything we can do.
DAWN Glad you're here.
WILLOW Love you so much.
BUFFY I know.
DAWN They're not telling us anything.
GILES Doctor?
DR._KRIEGEL Okay, I've examined your mother's body.
DAWN Can we see her?
BUFFY Dawn, not now.
DR._KRIEGEL The on-site report seems more or less accurate. Your mother did have what looks like an aneurysm. A sudden hemorrhaging from a ruptured arterial vessel near the, uh ... where the tumor was removed.
BUFFY Shouldn't we have known about that, that ... was a danger?
DR._KRIEGEL Sometimes these things are detectable, and sometimes they're not.
DR._KRIEGEL Joyce was aware of the possibility of a rupture, and the effects. She didn't even get on the phone, so clearly this was very sudden.
DR._KRIEGEL She, uh, may have felt a little nausea, and probably passed out as it happened.
DR._KRIEGEL I doubt there was much pain, and ... even if someone had been by her side...
Flash Joyce in the living room, Buffy by her side. Buffy takes Joyce's hand in concern as Joyce sits on the sofa.
JOYCE My head...
BUFFY Mom?
Flash Buffy, Joyce, and Paramedic 1 in the ambulance.
Flash Dawn, Joyce, Buffy, and the doctor in the hospital.
DR._KRIEGEL ...it's doubtful that this could have been dealt with in time.
GILES Uh, thank you, Doctor.
BUFFY Are you sure...
BUFFY ...that there wasn't a lot of pain?
DR._KRIEGEL Absolutely.
DR._KRIEGEL I have to lie to make you feel better.
GILES What, uh, what, uh, needs to be done now?
DR._KRIEGEL Well, there, uh, there'll be some forms, and some decisions you'll need to make.
GILES Uh, Buffy, why don't you let me handle those as much as I can.
BUFFY Please.
DR._KRIEGEL We will need you to ... sign a couple of release forms.GILES: Yes, thank you, Doctor.
GILES I'll, uh, figure out which ones you need to see.
BUFFY We'll be here.
XANDER What'd the doctor say?
BUFFY Nothing. Uh, it's, you know, it's what we thought, the tumor.
WILLOW Why don't we sit down?
BUFFY Giles says he's gonna go over the paperwork.
XANDER Man, if there's one day they should *not* give you homework.
WILLOW Dawnie, do you wanna sit?
BUFFY I don't think we're gonna have to be here very long.
DAWN What about...
BUFFY What about what?
DAWN Nothing. I have to pee.
BUFFY Do you want someone to go with you?
DAWN No. I still remember how to pee.
BUFFY Do you know where it is?
DAWN Yeah.
BUFFY I think maybe she's ... mad at me or something.
WILLOW 'Cause you were the one that told her?
XANDER How'd she take it?
BUFFY Meltdown. She just wouldn't believe me. I still don't think she does.
ANYA I wish that Joyce didn't die...
ANYA ...because she was nice. And now we all hurt.
XANDER Anya, ever the wordsmith.
BUFFY Thank you.
WILLOW Do you want anything? Something to eat, or ... soda?
BUFFY Honestly, I ... couldn't tell.
WILLOW Well, I-I think you should try to eat something.
BUFFY Yeah, maybe Dawn could use a snack.
WILLOW I'll, I'll find something. Xander, do you have any money?
XANDER We'll come with.
WILLOW We'll be right quick.
BUFFY I'm sorry ... you have to go through all of this.
TARA You don't have to worry about me.
BUFFY Everybody wants to help. I don't even know if I'm ... here. I don't know what's going on. Never done this. That's just an amazingly dumb thing to say. Obviously ... I've never done this before.
TARA I have.
TARA My mother died when I was seventeen.
BUFFY I didn't know. I'm sorry.
TARA No, no, I didn't mean to ... I'm only telling you this because ... I know it's not m-my place, but ... There's things ... thoughts and reactions I had that ... I couldn't ... understand ... or even try to explain to anyone else. Thoughts that ... made me feel like I was losing it ... or, like I was some kind of ho-horrible person. I know it's different for you ... because it's always different, but ... if you ever need....
BUFFY Was it sudden?
TARA What?
BUFFY Your mother.
TARA No. Yes. It's always sudden.
WILLOW We panicked.
BUFFY Uh-huh.
WILLOW Have anything you want.
ANYA The sandwiches are meat.
BUFFY I'm just not hungry.
WILLOW What about Dawnie?
XANDER Is she still in the bathroom?
BUFFY I guess. You guys wait here.
BUFFY Dawn?
DAWN Is she cold?
BUFFY It's not her ... it's not her ... she's gone.
DAWN Where'd she go?
