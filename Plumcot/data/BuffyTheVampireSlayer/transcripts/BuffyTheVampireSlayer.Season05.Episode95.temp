BUFFY What are you doing?
GILES_VOICEOVER Previously on
PARAMEDIC Your mother's dead.
BUFFY She just wouldn't believe me.
DAWN Oh god.
BUFFY I still don't think she does.
DAWN I'm not real.
BEN You're the key. Go, before she finds you. She's here.
GILES Buffy, you're here.
GILES You all right?
BUFFY Yeah.
DIRECTOR Did you find something?
BUFFY This one.
DIRECTOR It's a fine choice. It speaks of your deep feeling for the deceased.
BUFFY You don't like it?
DAWN No, it's not that. It's just ... what if Mom ... what if she'd like something else better?
BUFFY Dawn...
DAWN I mean, how do we know for sure? She's the one who has to be in it forever.
BUFFY Dawn, maybe it wasn't such a good idea you coming along.
DAWN It's fine. It's just ...
BUFFY I'm serious. Y-you shouldn't have to deal with this stuff.
DIRECTOR If you'd like a few more minutes to decide-
BUFFY No. I, it's done, it's fine. Okay?
BUFFY Okay.
GILES I checked prices at different florists, and the funeral home seems to be fairly competitive.
BUFFY Let's just go with that, it's easier.
DAWN What color flowers?
BUFFY Uh, white. They're nice.
GILES Yeah.
BUFFY Uh, what about an announcement? People are gonna be expecting a wake after the burial unless we say something.
GILES Um, well, we could put a, a line in the program expressing your mother's preference not to have one.
WILLOW There's no wake?
BUFFY Mom didn't like them. She said that potlucks are depressing enough as it is.
DAWN She said that? When?
BUFFY Uh, right before she went in for the operation. We had a talk about what she wanted ... in case.
DAWN She never said anything to me.
XANDER I'm sure she just didn't wanna upset you, Dawnster. Now you better get to work on that dinner. You barely touched it.
BUFFY You really should eat something.
DAWN Why should I? You're not.
BUFFY This isn't about-
BUFFY I'm all phoned out. Will you? Unless it's my dad.
GILES Of course.
GILES Hello? Yes, yes they did. Thank you. The, uh, funeral is at, uh, three tomorrow. Do you know the Brown Brothers mortuary?
BUFFY Can't believe he still hasn't called.
XANDER Your dad's still AWOL, huh?
BUFFY The number he left for us in Spain is no good, and I've left messages everywhere. Um, how about a line that just says, 'Following the burial, there will be no wake'? Or gathering? 'At the request of Joyce, there will be no gathering'? Uch, that sounds lame.
DAWN What are we gonna do? After, I mean. Are we just gonna ... come back here?
BUFFY Uh ... I, I don't know. I guess so. Um, how about 'At the request of the family, there will be no wake.'
XANDER Good, yeah, it's got, uh...
DAWN I don't wanna be here.
BUFFY Should I put it at the top, or just a small line at the bottom?
DAWN Can I go to your place tomorrow?
WILLOW Tomorrow?
DAWN After everything.
WILLOW Um, well, maybe you and Buffy should ... I-I don't mind.
DAWN Can I?
BUFFY Huh?
DAWN Can I go to Willow's tomorrow after the service?
BUFFY Um ... i-if you want to. I guess so.
DAWN I'll, uh, get my sleeping bag out of the attic.
XANDER You going home?
WILLOW I'm gonna stop by my mom's first. Been doing that a lot lately.
XANDER Yeah. I actually might stop by your mom's too. Well, I'm not going to *my* place. Those people are scary. Speaking of.
XANDER You have got to be kidding.
SPIKE I'm not going in.
XANDER And you're not leaving those.
XANDER You actually think you're gonna score points with Buffy this way?
SPIKE This isn't about Buffy.
XANDER Bull. We're all hip to your doomed obsession.
SPIKE They're for Joyce.
XANDER Like you care about her.
WILLOW Guys, guys, not here.
SPIKE Care? Joyce was the only one of the lot of you that I could stand.
XANDER And she's the only one with a daughter you wanted to shag. I'm touched.
SPIKE I liked the lady. Understand, monkey boy? She was decent. She didn't put on airs. She always had a nice cuppa for me.
SPIKE And she never treated me like a freak.
XANDER Her mistake.
SPIKE Think what you want.
XANDER Un ... believable.
XANDER The guy thinks he can put on a big show and con Buffy into being his sex monkey.
WILLOW Xander... He didn't leave a card.
Fade_to graveyard, daylight. Aerial shot of a group of people standing around the coffin. Fade to a shot of Buffy and Dawn standing together. We can see Xander and Giles behind them. Fade to a shot of the coffin.
MINISTER We commend to almighty God...
MINISTER ...our sister, Joyce Summers...
MINISTER ...and we commit her body to the ground.
MINISTER Earth to earth... ...ashes to ashes... ...and dust to dust.
MINISTER The Lord bless her and keep her.
MINISTER The Lord makes his face to shine upon her and be gracious to her.
MINISTER The Lord lift up his countenance upon her...
MINISTER ...and give her peace.
TARA Hey, um, Dawn's kind of ready to go. Can we take her with us?
BUFFY Yeah. She should probably get out of here.
TARA What about you? We can wait if you want.
BUFFY I'm fine. Thank you.
ANGEL I'm sorry.
ANGEL I couldn't come sooner.
WILLOW Oh, Dawn. I wish I could ... help more. The only thing is ... it'll get better. I promise.
DAWN You don't know that.
TARA Sure she does. We're witches. We know stuff.
DAWN What? Life goes on, and I forget Mom? Is that what you're saying?
WILLOW Not forget, no! I, you...
TARA You make a place for her in your heart. It's sort of like she becomes a part of you. Does that make sense?
WILLOW Dawn ... hey, we don't have to talk about this now, uh, you could just go to sleep.
DAWN No. I don't wanna sleep.
TARA Okay, we can just ... sit, or, or whatever you want.
DAWN Good. 'Cause I know ... what I wanna do now.
WILLOW Great. What are you up for?
DAWN You guys are witches ... and you do ... magic and ... stuff.
WILLOW You want us to teach you something? Uh, like a-a glamour, or, or, I could ... make a stuffed animal dance.
DAWN I wanna do a spell. I wanna bring Mom back.
ANYA Mm. That was different.
XANDER Yeah. It was more ... intense.
ANYA It's because of Joyce.
XANDER Right. Huh?
ANYA Well, she got me thinking ... about ... how people die all the time, and ... how they get born too, and how you kind of need one so you can have the other. When I think about it that way, it ... makes death a little less sad, and ... sex a little more exciting.
XANDER Again I say, huh?
ANYA Well, I just think I understand sex more now. It's not just about two bodies smooshing together. It's about life. It's about *making* life.
XANDER Right, when ... two people are much older, and ... way richer, and far less stupid.
ANYA Breathe. You're turning colors. I'm not ready to make life with you, but I could. *We* could. Life could come out of our love and our smooshing, and that's beautiful. It all makes me feel like I'm part of something bigger. Like I'm more awake somehow. You know?
XANDER Yeah, I do.
TARA Of course you wanna bring your mother back, and ... I wish we could, but it's not possible.
DAWN Why? You guys do magic for all kinds of things.
WILLOW We do, but...
TARA This is different. Magic can't be used to alter the natural order of things.
DAWN But all you do is mess with the natural order of things. You, you make things float, a-and disappear, and-
TARA But we don't mess with life and death. Dawn, I know how bad you hurt.
DAWN You don't. They put her in the ground.
TARA They did, and it's awful and unfair, but this isn't the way.
WILLOW I'm not even sure it's possible, Dawn. I mean, I've ... seen things on resurrection, but ... there's books and stuff ... but I guess ... the spells ... backfire?
TARA That's not the point.
WILLOW That's not the point. The, the point is it's bad ... because ...
TARA Because witches can't be allowed to alter the fabric of life for selfish reasons. Wiccans took an oath a long time ago to honor that.
DAWN So it's possible ... to bring someone back? They wouldn't have taken an oath if thy didn't know they could do it.
TARA Maybe they could, but we can't.
WILLOW She's right, Dawn. It's too dangerous.
DAWN You said you wanted to help me.
WILLOW Dawn...
BUFFY The funeral was ... it was brutal, but it's tomorrow that I'm worried about.
ANGEL What's tomorrow?
BUFFY That's exactly what I don't know. Up until now, I ... I've had a road map. Things to do every minute, having to do with Mom.
ANGEL Tomorrow the stuff of everyday living resumes.
BUFFY And everybody expects me to know how to do it, because ... I'm so strong.
ANGEL You just need some time. I'm sure everybody understands that.
BUFFY Time's not the issue. I can stick wood in vampires ... but Mom was the strong one in real life. She always knew how to make things better ... just what to say.
ANGEL Yeah ... you'll find your way. I mean, not all at once, but...
BUFFY I don't know. I keep thinking about it ... when I found her. If I had just gotten there ten minutes earlier...
ANGEL You said they told you it wouldn't have made a difference.
BUFFY They said ... probably ... wouldn't have made a difference. The exact thing they said ... was probably. I haven't told that to anyone.
ANGEL Doesn't make it your fault. You couldn't have done anything different.
BUFFY I didn't even start CPR until they told me. I fell apart. That's how good I am at being a grownup.
ANGEL Buffy...
BUFFY And it'd be okay if it was just me I had to worry about. But Dawn...
ANGEL Look, it's okay. I know you don't feel like it now, but you are strong, Buffy. You're gonna figure this out. And you have people to help you. You don't have to do this alone.
BUFFY It's gonna be light soon.
ANGEL I can stay in town as long as you want me.
BUFFY How's forever? Does forever work for you?
BUFFY That's a bad idea. I'm seriously needy right now.
ANGEL Let me worry about the neediness. I can handle it.
BUFFY I told you. You better go.
ANGEL I'm sorry.
BUFFY No. I'm so grateful that you came, Angel. I didn't think I was gonna be able to make it through the night.
ANGEL Well, we still have a few more minutes until I have to go.
BUFFY Good.
BUFFY Good.
BEN Tell my sister I'm sick of running into her Jawa rejects.
JINX She ... bade me come to you. The news of your relationship with the Slayer-
BEN We don't have a relationship.
JINX But ... you attempted to court her, did you not?
BEN You're more fun when I hit you.
JINX It's just, Glory ... would like to encourage this interest of yours in the Slayer. It might lead to more information about the key.
BEN And why would I share that with the most unstable one?
JINX Time ... is running short, sir. Every moment you fight Glory, you're only fighting yourself, you see?
BEN Fine. Let the best me win. Let Glory understand this: I won't help her find the key. I would never do that to an innocent-
JINX An innocent? The key? That's an interesting choice of words.
BEN No, that, that's not what I-
JINX I understand, sir. I'm sorry to have bothered you, I'll ... take my leave.
BEN You understand what? When I said it's innocent, I didn't mean that the key is ... it's not a person.
JINX Of course not.
BEN You're gonna run and tell her, aren't you? Do you understand what's going to happen if she finds the key? How many people are going to die?
JINX Please, I heard nothing.
BEN I can't let that happen.
BEN Don't you see?
BEN I can't.
WILLOW We're heading down to breakfast.
DAWN I'm not hungry.
WILLOW Oh. Okay. It's just, we have class after that, and I, I didn't know if you want to go home, or...
DAWN I was gonna sleep some more. Giles said he'd pick me up whenever.
WILLOW Oh, okay, great. Sure, uh, hang out. I have a, a break around lunchtime. I can come back.
DAWN I might not be here.
WILLOW Well, I'll try my luck.
TARA Take care, Dawn.
DAWN 'Age of Levitation ... War of the Warlocks...' 'Resurrection A Controversy Born.'
GILES You don't have to do that, Dawn, just, just relax.
ANYA Yes, sit down. We have some very amusing chicken feet you can play with.
DAWN That's okay.
ANYA Don't you watch television? I thought all children despise effort and enjoy cartoons.
DAWN Um, I like being useful. It keeps my mind off things.
GILES Then useful you shall be. I can always use a hand.
ANYA But you have a hand. A paid hand. A hand that isn't the hand of illegal child labor.
GILES Anya.
ANYA But of course, it's wonderful that you find doing my job so distracting. I am unthreatened. Proceed.
GILES Yes, uh, carry on, Dawn.
DAWN Is there anything I should know, like, um, off-limits stuff? Willow told me that some of the books and things are ... kind of dangerous?
GILES Quite right. Um, but they're all labeled, and, and, and, uh, kept off the floor. Most of our, uh, more potent texts and potions are all up there.
GILES If anyone asks you about anything in that area, just come and get me.
DAWN Okay. Anything else?
GILES Oh, um, well, if you like, uh, I could teach you how to ... work the cash register, you can ring up sales.
DAWN Cool.
ANYA Ring up sales? With the money? She gets to fondle the money?
ANYA Customer! Hello, customer!
GILES I'll just be a moment.
ANYA I'll help you!
DAWN No problem.
GILES Dawn.
DAWN Uh-huh?
GILES Do you wanna come watch this, uh, transaction that Anya's doing? Then I'll let you try.
DAWN You got it.
SPIKE I hope it's just dirt you're after.
SPIKE If the spell calls for anything more than that, you're into zombie territory, and that's bad news.
DAWN Spike, I-I wasn't...
SPIKE I know good and well what you're up to. That book you've got is infamous.
DAWN Please ... don't tell Buffy. I just ... I have to get her back. I have to.
SPIKE I'm not gonna tell, little bit.
SPIKE I'm gonna help.
SINGER ...
SPIKE I've never used this bloke's services myself, but there's talk. Word is he knows everything there is to know about resurrection spells.
SPIKE Come on now, no worries.
DAWN You don't have to be all nice to me. I know why you're doing this.
SPIKE Do you now? Enlighten me.
DAWN Spike, I'm not stupid. You're, like, stalking my sister. You'd do anything to get in good with her.
SPIKE Buffy never hears about this, okay? Found out what I was doing, she'd drive a redwood through my chest.
DAWN Then, if you don't want credit, why are you helping me?
SPIKE I just don't like to see Summers women take it so hard on the chin, is all. And I'm dead serious. You breathe a word of this to Buffy, I'll see to it that *you* end up in the ground. Got it?
DAWN Yeah. Got it.
GLORY Where is he? He should have been back hours ago.
MURK I'm sure Jinx is on his way, your ... new and improvedness. He's most loyal to-
GLORY Hey! He better be loyal.
GLORY Jinxie?
GLORY Oh, no, no! Oh, mind the rug, honeys, blood's a bitch. Was this the Slayer, I'll pull her wings off!
JINX No.
JINX It was Ben.
GLORY Ben? Ben? Oh god, you pointless, stupid lout! Oh, I hate you, I hate you, I hate youuuuu!
JINX The key! He told me.
GLORY The key?
GLORY What about the key?
JINX He indicated that it was a person, most ... ... highest ... you.
GLORY The key's in human form?
JINX I believe so ... good one.
GLORY Ahh!
GLORY Jinx, you robed stud, you're my man! I'm even gonna let you slide on the lame toadying on account of your dying and stuff.
GLORY So, the key's all secreted away in a flesh wrapper! This narrows the search from now on in a serious way, I mean we didn't have a clue. It could have been a log, or, or a bicycle pump, or whatever, am I right?
GLORY Uch, get him fixed, would ya? I wanna hear the whole story again, without all that annoying moaning.
DAWN This place belongs to a magic guy? It smells like grandpa.
SPIKE Hey!
SPIKE Anybody home?
DOC I know you.
SPIKE I don't think so, mate.
DOC No, no, you're that guy, that, that guy, hangs around down at the corner mart. Big into dominoes, aren't you?
SPIKE Can't say as I am. Look, we came here because-
DOC That's crazy, isn't it? I mean, I, I, I'd swear, you were that guy. I mean, your hair's a different color and you're a vampire, but uh, other than that...
DAWN Maybe we should just go.
DOC No. Now, just because the lights are dim doesn't mean the juice is all gone. What can I do for you?
SPIKE This one's mum kicked it a few days back.
DOC Ohh. I'm so sorry.
SPIKE So we were wondering, what's to be done about it. Heard you were the one to ask.
DOC Ohh ... no, no, that's, uh, you don't wanna mess with that. Uh, I know some tonics, uh, make the grieving fly by-
DAWN I don't want any tonics.
DOC Either one of you witches? Got any experience with, uh, spells of this magnitude?
DOC Didn't think so.
DAWN Ow!
DOC Well, your mother's a good candidate, at least. Strong DNA.
DAWN Right.
DAWN I've gathered some ingredients. But the spell I found ... there's things on it I don't understand.
DOC We've got the ghora demon standing between you and success, that's the translation you were missing.
SPIKE Ghora, I've heard of those. They local?
DOC Yeah, they like to stick close to the hellmouth. Egg of the ghora gives life. It's key to the spell.
DAWN Can you buy it, this ... egg, or-
DOC If it was as easy as making an omelet, everyone would try it. No. You have to steal the egg from the nest of the demon. And the ghora won't be happy about it.
SPIKE Where do we find this demon?
DOC First things first. We'll need an image of your mother. A photo, a painting.
DAWN No problem.
DOC Once you get all the ingredients together, put them in the center of a sacred circle. With the photo of your mother. Then... say this incantation... three times. She won't appear, you know, poof. It'll take ... a while, but she will come to you. Got it?
DAWN Got it.
DOC Oh. Anything goes wrong, the only way to reverse the spell ... is to destroy the image of your mother, understand?
DAWN I'll do it right.
DOC It's a tricky spell, girl. I can't say for sure your mother will come back exactly like she was. Sometimes these ... things ... get a little off.
DAWN But she'll still be my mother. Won't she?
DOC More or less.
DAWN Good. Good.
SPIKE And the ghora?
DOC Oh, right, sorry. Um, go in the sewer entrance near Tracy Street. The opening's, um, on the left. Can't miss it. Just follow that down.
DOC No, no. Keep your money.
DAWN Oh. Thank you.
DOC You just keep in touch now. Let me know how it goes.
DAWN I-I-I will.
DAWN It's here. Just like he said.
SPIKE Well, at least we know the old coot isn't completely daft. Look, you better let me snatch this egg thing on my own.
DAWN No way. I'm going.
SPIKE No ... you are not. I've got no idea what's down there.
DAWN You need me, Spike. Somebody's gotta get the egg while you distract the ghora. Now come on.
SPIKE Well, what do you know. Bitty Buffy.
DAWN Doesn't look so bad.
SPIKE Wait till it wakes up. That's usually when the bad starts.
DAWN I can't get to the eggs unless it moves. No way.
SPIKE I'll make it move. You just be ready.
SPIKE Hey! Ghora! Heads up.
SPIKE Right then. Heads it is.
SPIKE ???
SPIKE Hey, get away from her!
DAWN Spike, come on!
SPIKE That's it.
SPIKE Leave it, Dawn.
DAWN I can't. Mom.
SPIKE It's too dangerous and I haven't got-
SPIKE -a weapon!
SPIKE No, that's it.
DAWN Spike!
DAWN Sorry!
SPIKE Did you get it?
SPIKE Don't be sorry then.
DAWN_VOICEOVER Osiris... giver of darkness...
DAWN Taker of life ... god of gods... accept my offering. Bone, flesh, breath ...
DAWN Yours ... eternally.
DAWN_VOICEOVER Bone...
DAWN_VOICEOVER Flesh, breath...
DAWN_VOICEOVER I beg of you...
DAWN ...return to me.
WILLOW What did I have for breakfast this morning? Do you remember?
TARA Hmm?
WILLOW I-I wanna say bagel, but I think that was yesterday. You had two eggs sunny-side-up. I remember 'cause they were wiggling at me like little boobs.
TARA Sassy eggs. What are you writing this for?
WILLOW My journal.
TARA That's new.
WILLOW Yeah. I-I figured, life goes by so fast, if you don't write stuff down it just gets ... lost. And I wanna remember.
TARA Down to every last bagel.
WILLOW Down to every last everything I do with you.
TARA Huh.
WILLOW What?
TARA What happened to
WILLOW I, uh, i-it isn't there?
TARA Dawn must have taken it.
WILLOW No she didn't! Did she?
TARA This is bad, this is really bad.
WILLOW But, i-it's just a history book. I-it might answer some of her questions. I-I don't think she could do any ... harm with that stuff, could she?
TARA Well, it's not a how-to guide, but it refers to specific resurrection spells and potions.
WILLOW But I-I didn't ... I mean ... hey! How'd she know that?
TARA I-I don't know, but ... god, what else did she take?
WILLOW Nothing! I-I think. I think n... she took nothing else. But maybe she did, and we should probably look. Because who knows? I-I don't.
TARA No, no, we can't waste time on that now. We don't know what she's up to.
WILLOW We have to call Buffy. Now.
BUFFY Hello?
DAWN Bone ... flesh ... breath ... yours eternally. Bone, flesh, breath, I beg of you, return to me.
BUFFY Dawn.
BUFFY What have you done? What have you done?
DAWN She's coming. She's coming home.
BUFFY Dawn! Dawn!
BUFFY You have no idea what you're messing with. Who knows what you actually raised, what's gonna come through that door!
DAWN No, I-I know. It'll be her.
BUFFY No. Now, Tara told me that these spells go bad all the time. People come back ... wrong.
DAWN Not Mom. He told me her DNA-
BUFFY Who told you? Who helped you?
DAWN Nobody, let me go.
BUFFY You have to stop it. Reverse it.
DAWN No!
BUFFY Dawn, you know this is wrong. You know you can't let this happen. Not to Mom.
DAWN But I need her. I don't care if she...
DAWN_VOICEOVER I'm not like you, Buffy.
DAWN I don't have anybody.
BUFFY What?! Of course you do. You have me!
DAWN No, I don't. You won't even look at me. It's so obvious you don't want me around.
BUFFY That's not true.
DAWN Yes it is. Mom ... died, and it's like you don't even care.
BUFFY Of course I care. How can you even think that?
DAWN How can I not? You haven't even cried. You've just been running around like it's been some big chore or something. Cleaning up after Mom's mess.
BUFFY Dawn ... I've been ... working. I've been busy, because I have to-
DAWN No! You've been avoiding me.
BUFFY I'm not! ... I have to do these things, 'cause ... 'cause when I stop, then she's really gone.
BUFFY And I'm trying. Dawn, I am, I am really trying to take care of things, but I don't even know what I'm doing. Mom always knew.
DAWN Nobody's asking you to be Mom.
BUFFY Well, who's gonna be if I'm not? Huh, Dawn? Have you even thought about that? Who's gonna make things better? Who's gonna take care of us?
DAWN Buffy...
BUFFY I didn't mean to push you away, I didn't. I just, I couldn't let you see me.
BUFFY Oh god, Dawnie...
BUFFY I don't know what we're gonna do. I'm scared.
DAWN Buffy...
BUFFY Mommy?
DAWN Buffy.
BUFFY Mom.
BUFFY Dawn.
DAWN It's okay.
DAWN It's okay.
