GILES_VOICEOVER Previously on
GLORY Did you know your sister took my key, Dawnie, and she won't give it back. I bet you know where she put it, don't you?
SPIKE They had to be certain the Slayer would protect it with her life, so they sent the key to her, in the form of a sister.
BEN Let Glory understand this: I won't help her find the key. I would never do that to an innocent-
JINX An innocent?
BEN It's not a person.
GLORY What about the key?
JINX He indicated that it was a person.
SPIKE Oh God, no.
SPIKE I love you.
BUFFY The only chance you had with me was when I was unconscious.
APRIL You are not my boyfriend!
BUFFY I kinda got the impression that she was a-
TARA Robot.
XANDER Oh yeah, robot.
WARREN She's a robot.
WARREN I made her to love me. I didn't make a toy. I made a girlfriend.
SPIKE I'm placing an order.
WARREN No, I'm not making any more girls.
SPIKE Sure you are. Here's your specs.
BUFFY Mom? What are you doing?
BUFFY Mommy?
MINISTER We commend to almighty God our sister, Joyce Summers.
BUFFY It's tomorrow that I'm worried about.
ANGEL What's tomorrow?
BUFFY That's exactly what I don't know.
BUFFY Giles, you don't have to help. You cooked.
GILES Oh, come on, I quite like to cook. Helping you two out makes me feel useful.
DAWN Wanna clean out the garage on Saturday? You can feel indispensable.
GILES Hmm, how tempting.
BUFFY Dawn, if there are any plates in your room, let's have them before they get furry and we have to name them.
DAWN Hey, I was like five then.
GILES How's she doing? And you?
BUFFY I'm okay. Well, some minutes are harder than others.
GILES I'm so sorry. All I can say is i-it will get better.
BUFFY It has to. We're holding up though, you know, getting into a routine.
GILES Good, routine's good. In fact I was thinking that we might ... return to our training schedule.
BUFFY I don't know. I was, um, thinking about ... maybe ... taking a break or something.
BUFFY Just ease off for a while. Not get into full slay mode.
GILES But you were doing so well.
BUFFY A-and you were great, helping me with everything. I'm just ... starting to feel ... uneasy about stuff.
GILES Stuff?
BUFFY Training. Slaying. All of it. It's just ... I mean ... I can beat up the demons until the cows come home. And then I can beat up the cows ... but I'm not sure I like what it's doing to me.
GILES But you've mastered so much. I mean, your strength and resilience alone-
BUFFY Yeah. Strength, resilience ... those are all words for hardness. I'm starting to feel like ... being the Slayer is turning me into stone.
GILES Turning you into stone? Buffy-
BUFFY Just ... think about it. I was never there for Riley, not like I was for Angel. I was terrible to Dawn.
GILES At a time like this-
BUFFY No.
GILES You're bound to feel emotionally numb.
BUFFY Before that. Riley left because I was shut down. He's gone. And now my mom is gone ... and I loved her more than anything ... and ... I don't know if she knew.
GILES Oh, she knew. Always.
BUFFY I don't know. To slay, to kill ... i-it means being hard on the inside. Maybe being the perfect Slayer means being too hard to love at all. I already feel like I can hardly say the words.
GILES Buffy...
BUFFY Giles ... I love you. Love ... love, love, love, love, Giles, it feels strange.
GILES Well, I shouldn't wonder. How serious are you about this?
BUFFY Ten. I'm serious to the amount of ten.
GILES There is something ... in the Watchers' diaries ... a quest.
BUFFY A quest? Like finding a grail or something?
GILES Not a grail. Maybe answers. It would take a day, perhaps two.
BUFFY I'm not leaving Dawn. Not with Glory looking for her.
DAWN Sure you can. What's the deal?
GILES Some Slayers before Buffy found it helpful in ... regaining their focus, learning more about their role. There's a sacred place in the desert. It's, it's not far.
BUFFY But I can't go. I'm not leaving you, Dawn.
DAWN If you have to go learn ... I mean, if it'll help you out ... I think you should do it. I can hang with the gang. I'll be okay.
BUFFY I love you, Dawn. You know that, right?
DAWN Yeah. I love you too.
BUFFY I love you ... *really* love you.
DAWN Gettin' weird.
BUFFY Sorry. But it's important that I tell you. Weird love's better than no love.
SPIKE Some say it's better'n the real thing.
WARREN Better than the real thing.
SPIKE She looks good, but what about the rest?
SPIKE A little walk, a little talk...
SPIKE ...perhaps a zippy cartwheel...
WARREN Hey, she's, uh, great. You'll be real happy, I swear, she's got everything you asked for. All the extra programming, tons of real-world knowledge, the profiles you gave me about her family and friends.
SPIKE *All* the extra programming, right?
WARREN Ah, the, the stuff that you wanted, the, uh, scenario responses, you know, the, uh, uh, special ... skills ... All of it. Now, you said that I could leave-
SPIKE Wait. I'm not sure I'm a satisfied customer. She looks a little shiny to me, you know, uh...
SPIKE ...touch of plasticine...
BUFFYBOT Spike?
BUFFYBOT Oh, Spike!
SPIKE She'll do.
GLORY He's getting stronger. I'm losing him, I'm losing control of him.
JINX You're speaking of Ben, most glamorous yet tasteful one?
GLORY He stabbed you in your body.
MURK Jinx is all right, your highness. And we do have the new knowledge that the key is a human being.
GLORY If time runs out on us and all we're left with is info? Then we're screwed.
JINX Oh, surely not!
GLORY No, we're screwed!
MURK But you are a god. The sacred Glorificus!
GLORY I'm a god in exile. Far from the hellfires of home and ... sharing my body with an enemy that stabs my boys in their fleshy little stomachs.
GLORY Uhh! I'm in pain.
JINX How can we help? We'll lay down our lives.
GLORY The Slayer and the key are connected. She's going to have contact with it. Find out who's new in her life, who's ... special, who's different. Watch her.
MURK We can do that, O ... thou.
GLORY I want to hear about everyone she has contact with! That girl has my key ... and I'm trusting you boys to get it for me. If you love me ... get it for me.
BUFFY What's in the trunk?
GILES Supplies.
BUFFY Supplies? I was wondering about that. Like, food, water, maybe a compass?
GILES What about a book, a gourd, and a bunch of twigs?
BUFFY I don't think I'll be that hungry.
GILES They're for me. Come on, this way.
GILES You see, the location of the sacred place is a guarded secret. I can't take you there myself. I'll have to perform a ritual to ... transfer my guardianship of you, temporarily, to, to a guide. This'll do.
BUFFY A guide but no food or water. So it leads me to the sacred place, and then a week later it leads you to my bleached bones?
GILES Buffy, please. It takes more than a week to bleach bones.
BUFFY So, how's it start?
GILES I, uh, jump out of the circle and then jump back in it, and then, um ... I shake my gourd.
BUFFY I know this ritual! The ancient shamans were next called upon to do the hokey-pokey and turn themselves around.
GILES Go quest.
BUFFY And that's what it's all about.
SPIKE What you searching for, Slayer, a weak spot? Hmm?
SPIKE Try me, give me the best you've got.
BUFFYBOT Ooh!
BUFFYBOT Oh...
SPIKE Is that your best, Slayer?
BUFFYBOT No.
SPIKE Why not?
BUFFYBOT I, I wanna hurt you, but I can't resist the sinister attraction of your cold and muscular body.
SPIKE Maybe I should repay you for your gentleness. Maybe I should let you go.
BUFFYBOT No! No, Spike. Never let me go.
SPIKE You know you should be afraid of me. I'm bad.
BUFFYBOT You are. You're very, very bad.
SPIKE Are you gonna do it that way?
BUFFYBOT No.
BUFFYBOT This way.
SPIKE You can't do it.
BUFFYBOT I could never do it. I'm helpless against you, you fiend.
BUFFYBOT Oh!
SPIKE Buffy...
BUFFY Hello, kitty.
BUFFY I know this place.
TARA Okay. Warning spell's all set.
XANDER So that's it? We're all protected up for the night?
TARA Well, i-it's probably not as good as Willow could do. She's a natural with magic. In just the time I've known her, she's already blown right past me.
XANDER So, when the whiz kid gets back from chem lab, can you have her ... you know, bulk up the spell a little? If you want, maybe, while Anya and I go do a quick patrol?
ANYA I don't see why we have to patrol just 'cause Buffy's away. I'd rather stay home and watch television.
TARA Oh yeah, Willow wants to watch this thing on the history channel tonight, Salem Witch Trial stuff, which is only gonna get her all upset.
ANYA Oh, I was there, it really wasn't that bad. See, if you were really a witch, you could do a spell to escape.
ANYA ...so really it was only bad for the falsely accused, and, well, they never have a good time.
XANDER No.
DAWN So, guys, if this is a real slumber party, where's the pizza?
BUFFYBOT You're evil.
SPIKE And that excites you?
BUFFYBOT It excites me, it terrifies me ... I try so hard to resist you and I can't.
SPIKE Yeah?
BUFFYBOT Darn your sinister attraction.
SPIKE Are you afraid of me?
BUFFYBOT Yes.
SPIKE You know I can't lie to you.
BUFFYBOT I think you can. I think you can if I let you, and I want to let you. I want you to bite me and devour me until there's no more.
SPIKE Like this?
BUFFYBOT Oh, Spike, devour me!
SPIKE All right.
BUFFYBOT Spike, I can't help myself. I love you.
SPIKE You're mine, Buffy.
BUFFYBOT Should I start this program over?
SPIKE Shh! No programs. Don't use that word. Just be Buffy.
WILLOW It's got last week's notes too. Just get it back to me by Thursday.
WILLOW And, uh, don't write in it or, or, uh, put a coffee mug down on it, or anything. And, and, just don't spill. Okay. Oh, oh, and don't fold the page corners down. Bye!
BUFFYBOT Time to slay.
SPIKE Yeah...
BUFFYBOT Vampires of the world, beware.
BUFFYBOT Hey there!
XANDER Buffy!
BUFFYBOT Xander!
BUFFYBOT And ...
BUFFYBOT Anya!
BUFFYBOT How is your money?
ANYA Fine. Thank you for asking.
BUFFYBOT Isn't it a beautiful night for killing evil things?
XANDER I guess.
ANYA You're back very early.
XANDER Yeah, how was the whole vision-quest experience?
BUFFYBOT I don't understand that question. But thank you for asking.
BUFFYBOT You're my friend, and a carpenter.
XANDER Are you all right? You're all...
SPIKE Hey! Wait up!
BUFFYBOT Spike! It's Spike. And he's wearing a coat.
SPIKE Yes. Uh ... hello all.
SPIKE Uh, Buffy's back early, I see. Lots of patrolling all around tonight, then, is it?
SPIKE Ow! Hey. Give a fella a break there, Slayer.
SPIKE Uh, I'm glad you're all here, uh, 'cause, uh, 'cause ... the place is crawling with vamps tonight. Uh, tons of 'em. I, uh, think we oughta split up.
XANDER We haven't seen any vamps, are you sure there's...
ANYA You're right.
SPIKE Yep, guess so.
BUFFYBOT Spike, be careful!
BUFFYBOT No, get away from him.
SPIKE I think that was probably the big action for the night. You two can toddle on home if you want.
XANDER Uh ... Buffy?
BUFFYBOT Yes. Spike and I will do it alone. You guys head home.
BUFFYBOT Hmm. I don't understand this. I-I did the slaying. I should be...
SPIKE Satisfied?
BUFFYBOT But I'm not. I-I'm all ... my skin is all hot. Do I look hot to you?
SPIKE Always.
BUFFYBOT You better feel me to make sure.
SPIKE I can do that.
ANYA I breathed in like a quart of vampire dust. That can't be good.
XANDER I wish Giles told us they were back from the desert. I wish I knew what went on there.
ANYA Oh, you know, Slayer-Watcher stuff. Probably some silly ritual with an enchanted prairie dog or something.
XANDER Whatever it was, I think she's still a little spacy.
ANYA She fought okay.
XANDER Yeah. Hey, she never asked about Dawn.
ANYA That's true.
XANDER Something's wrong.
XANDER I hear something.
BUFFYBOT Oh Spike. You're the big bad.
BUFFYBOT You're the BIG bad!
WILLOW Those darn Salem judges. With their less-satanic-than-thou attitude.
TARA Oh, honey, let's change it. The Discovery channel has koala bears.
XANDER Where's Dawn?
TARA She, she's in the bedroom, she fell asleep.
XANDER Good.
WILLOW What's goin' on?
XANDER Buffy's gone insane.
WILLOW What? What'd she do?
XANDER Brace yourself. You're not gonna believe it.
TARA Everyone, before we jump all over her, people do strange things when someone they love dies. When I lost my mother, I-I did some pretty dumb stuff, like lying to my family and staying out all night.
ANYA Buffy's boinking Spike.
WILLOW Oh ... well, Ta-Tara's right. Grief can be powerful, and we shouldn't judge-
TARA What are you, kidding? She's nuts!
WILLOW Well, it's not healthy, we're all agreeing there.
TARA What can we do?
ANYA Sometimes in the movies when they go crazy they slap 'em.
XANDER I'm gonna go find her and talk to her. If she's losing it, we gotta help her before she gets herself hurt.
TARA You aren't really gonna slap her, are you?
XANDER No, but if I have to see her straddle Spike again, I will definitely knock myself unconscious.
BUFFY Hello? Who's there?
BUFFYBOT Who's that?
SPIKE Uh ... Down there. And, uh, no matter what, don't come out till I get you, okay?
BUFFYBOT Okay.
SPIKE Oh, it's you.
XANDER I saw you ... in the cemetery with Buffy.
SPIKE Yeah? Can't see how it's any business of yours.
XANDER It is my business because Buffy's my friend .. and she's gone through some stuff lately that ... well, it's affected her, and you're taking advantage of her.
SPIKE She's upset about her mum. And if she turns to me for comfort, well, I'm not gonna deny it to her. I'm not a monster.
XANDER Yes. You are a monster. Vampires are monsters. They make monster movies about them.
SPIKE Well, yeah, you got me there.
XANDER Spike, Buffy has lost of friends, and we love her very much, and we'll do whatever it takes to protect her. Now if that means killing you, then, well, that's just a bonus.
JINX Gentlemen! I'm so sorry to intrude, but I wondered if I might beg a moment of your time.
SPIKE Friends of yours?
SPIKE Guess not.
JINX Tie his hands! Glory will want him restrained.
SPIKE Let me go!
JINX Careful with him. She will want the key intact.
SPIKE Key? Who's a key? I'm not the-
BUFFY I know you. You're the first Slayer.
FIRST_SLAYER This is a form. I am the guide.
BUFFY I have a few questions ... about being the Slayer. What about ... love? Not just boyfriend love.
FIRST_SLAYER You think you're losing your ability to love.
BUFFY I-I didn't say that. Yeah.
FIRST_SLAYER You're afraid that being the Slayer means losing your humanity.
BUFFY Does it?
FIRST_SLAYER You are full of love. You love with all of your soul. It's brighter than the fire ... blinding. That's why you pull away from it.
BUFFY I'm full of love? I'm not losing it?
FIRST_SLAYER Only if you reject it. Love is pain, and the Slayer forges strength from pain. Love ... give ... forgive. Risk the pain. It is your nature. Love will bring you to your gift.
BUFFY What?
BUFFYBOT Spike? I waited like you said, but then I missed you. Spike?
WILLOW Xander, did you-
BUFFYBOT Spike's gone!
WILLOW Bu-Buffy. Uh, come in. Shh! It's late!
WILLOW Wait.
WILLOW We can talk out here.
WILLOW Did Xander find you? He-he was looking for you.
WILLOW He hasn't come back. Anya sat up waiting.
BUFFYBOT I don't know where Xander is. I haven't seen him. And when I came out of the tunnel, Spike was gone. I need to find him.
WILLOW Um ... Buffy, this thing with Spike, i-i-it isn't true, is it? You didn't, you know, sleep with Spike?
BUFFYBOT No.
BUFFYBOT I had sex with Spike. I'm sorry if it bothers you. You're my best friend.
WILLOW I-I am. And I, I always will be, no matter what you do. I, I'm just trying to figure out why this happened, and I, I think with ... your mom and everything ... everyone was being all sympathetic, and, and making you feel weak. A-and Spike wasn't like that. So, just this one time, you just ... did something kinda ... crazy.
BUFFYBOT It wasn't one time. It was lots of times. And lots of different ways. I could make sketches.
WILLOW No! Buffy, there is something seriously wrong here! I ... Okay, yeah, you've been with a vampire before, but Angel had a soul.
BUFFYBOT Angel's lame. His hair grows straight up, and he's bloody stupid.
WILLOW Okay ... look, I just wanna help you. Let me help you.
BUFFYBOT You're my best friend.
WILLOW Yeah. Again, I ... really am, but...
BUFFYBOT You're recently gay.
WILLOW Um...
XANDER Guys! Guys, wake up.
ANYA Oh, Xander, I was scared, are you hurt? What happened?
XANDER Guys ... demony kinds of guys. Buffy.
BUFFYBOT Yes, that's me.
XANDER The guys that work for Glory, you said they're kind of like hobbits with leprosy? Well this was a whole flock of hobbits, and they just grabbed Spike. I think they're taking him to Glory.
WILLOW But he, he knows about Dawn.
BUFFYBOT We have to get him back.
XANDER So how do we find him?
BUFFYBOT I fight with weapons.
XANDER Yeah. I got nothin'. Let's hit your place, we'll stock up.
WILLOW Uh, Tara, can you stay here a-and watch Dawn?
TARA Of course.
BUFFY I-I'm sorry, I, I'm just a little confused. I'm full of love, which is nice, and ... love will lead me to my gift?
FIRST_SLAYER Yes.
BUFFY I'm getting a gift? Or, or do you mean that, that I have a gift to give to someone else?
FIRST_SLAYER Death is your gift.
BUFFY Death ...
FIRST_SLAYER Is your gift.
BUFFY Okay, no. Death is not a gift. My mother just died. I know this. If I have to kill demons because it makes the world a better place, then I kill demons, but it's not a gift to anybody.
FIRST_SLAYER Your question has been answered.
GLORY What the hell is that, and why is his hair that color?
MURK Stunning one, we believe he is...
MURK_AND_JINX The key!
GLORY Really? That's fantabulous! And impossible. He can't be the key, because, see, the key ... has to be pure.
GLORY This is a vampire. Lesson number one, vampires equal impure.
SPIKE Yeah, damn right I'm impure. I'm as impure as the driven yellow snow. Let me go.
GLORY You can't even brain-suck a vampire. He's completely useless.
SPIKE So, I'm just gonna let myself out.
JINX But, your holiness, we observed the Slayer. She protected this one above all others. She treated him as precious.
GLORY Really? Precious-ss-ss?
GLORY Let's take a peek at you, precious.
SPIKE Sod off.
GLORY Oh...
GLORY He doesn't look very fancy to me.
SPIKE Hey, watch the lip!
GLORY But if the Slayer protects him, maybe appearances are deceiving.
GLORY Maybe there's something on the inside.
GLORY Shhh. What do you know, precious? What can I dig out of you?
BUFFYBOT This is my house.
XANDER If we're gonna stop Spike from blabbing about Dawn, we're gonna need these.
ANYA Ooh, the big guns.
ANYA Saddling up. Shouldn't we have guns?
BUFFYBOT Those are my weapons. Give me something big and sharp.
WILLOW Um, Buffy, where do we go? Where should we look for Glory?
BUFFYBOT She's a god. She wants the key.
XANDER Yeah, so we should look...
BUFFYBOT I don't know. Why are you all looking at me?
XANDER Okay, Buff, it's okay, you're right, you shouldn't have to know everything.
BUFFYBOT We need to rescue Spike.
WILLOW Um ... Buffy, I, I think you have more weapons upstairs. Why don't you go get those?
ANYA And maybe change your clothes, you know, something more ... fighty.
BUFFYBOT I can do that. I'll be right back.
XANDER Okay, this has gone way too far. She thinks we're going to rescue Spike.
WILLOW What *are* we gonna do?
XANDER Find him, keep him from talking, whatever it takes.
ANYA What do we do with Glory?
WILLOW Whatever we do, we're gonna need Buffy's help.
XANDER Then we're gonna have to talk to her.
WILLOW Intervention time again?
XANDER Yeah, 'cause what we need right now is a sane Buffy.
BUFFY Whoa. Group hang time?
WILLOW Tha-that was quick.
BUFFY Didn't seem like it to me. Death is my gift.
XANDER Buffy, we need to talk.
BUFFY What's wrong? Is Dawn okay?
WILLOW Dawn's fine.
XANDER Buffy, we care about you, and we're worried about you. The way you're acting, the things you're doing-
ANYA It's wrong.
WILLOW Wait. This shouldn't be about blame.
BUFFY Blame? There's blame now?
WILLOW No, there's only love. And ... some fear.
ANYA Which is kind of thrown by the you having sex with Spike.
BUFFY The ... who whating how with huh?
ANYA Okay, that's denial. That usually comes before anger.
BUFFY I am not having sex with Spike!
ANYA Anger.
XANDER No one is judging you. It's understandable. Spike is strong and mysterious and sort of compact but well-muscled.
BUFFY I am not having sex with Spike! But I'm starting to think that you might be.
XANDER Buffy, I saw you. Anya too. We saw you and Spike ... with the straddling.
BUFFYBOT Spike's mine. Who's straddling Spike?
BUFFY Oh my god.
XANDER And so say all of us.
BUFFYBOT Say, look at you. You look just like me! We're very pretty.
WILLOW Two of them!
XANDER Hey, I know this! They're both Buffy!
BUFFY No, *she*'s a robot. She acts just like that girlfriend-bot that Warren guy made. You guys couldn't tell me apart from a robot?
BUFFYBOT Oh, I don't think I'm a robot.
ANYA She's very well done.
XANDER Spike must have had her built so he could program her t-
BUFFY Oh god.
WILLOW Yikes. Imagine the things-
BUFFY No! No, no imagining. Any of you.
XANDER Already got the visual.
BUFFYBOT People. Friends of mine. You're forgetting the most important thing. Glory has Spike and she's going to harm him.
BUFFY Glory has Spike?
XANDER We were gonna bring that up.
ANYA We were getting weapons.
BUFFY Grab 'em. We're going now. I have to kill him.
WILLOW We don't even know where to look.
BUFFY I know where to start.
GLORY I have a riddle for you, precious. How is a vampire that won't talk ... like an apple?
GLORY Think I can do you in one long strip?
SPIKE Enough. No more. I'll tell you who the sodding key is.
BUFFY Glory's key-sniffing snake was about here when I killed it. It was headed back to her.
WILLOW Do you think she lives around here?
XANDER It's not a lot to go on.
BUFFY It's all we got.
GILES Quite extraordinary really.
BUFFYBOT Thank you. But I really think we should be listening to the other Buffy, Giles. She's very smart and she's gonna help us save Spike.
GILES Guy-les? Spike didn't even bother to program my name properly.
BUFFY Listen, skirt girl, we are not going to save him. We're going to kill him. He knows who the key is, and there's no way he's not telling Glory.
BUFFYBOT You're right. He's evil. But you should see him naked. I mean really.
BUFFY Okay, guys, split up and spread out. Check the priciest-looking places first. Xander, you come with me. Willow, Anya, stick together, and Guy-les ... Giles- you can watch ... it.
GLORY Is that better? Do you think you can try to talk again now? Good. Because I'm tired of these games!
GLORY I need time, I need a drink, you're a very needy little bloodsucker, and it's not very attractive.
GLORY So start talkin'.
SPIKE Yeah. Okay. The key. Here's the thing...
SPIKE It's that guy... on TV ... what's his name?
GLORY On the television?
SPIKE That show ... the prize show ... where they guess what stuff cost?
MURK The Price Is Right?
JINX Oh, Bob Barker!
MURK We will bring you Bob Barker! We will bring you the limp and beaten body of Bob Bark-
GLORY It is not Bob Barker, scabby morons! The key is new to this world ... and Bob Barker is as old as grit. The vampire ... is lying to me.
SPIKE Yeah ... but it was fun. And guess what, bitch. I'm not telling you jack. You're never gonna get your sodding key, 'cause you might be strong, but in our world, you're an idiot.
GLORY I am a god.
SPIKE The god of what, bad home perms?
GLORY Shut up! I command you, shut up!
SPIKE Yeah, okay, sorry, but I just had no idea that gods were such prancing lightweights. Mark my words, the Slayer ... is going to kick your skanky, lopsided ass back to whatever place would take a cheap, whorish, fashion victim ex-god like you.
SPIKE Good plan, Spike.
GLORY Bring him back.
DEMON Here!
SPIKE Oh, god.
MURK You do not insult Glory by escaping.
MURK Slayer!
GILES Buffy, we're here.
BUFFYBOT Spike! Spike's in there!
GILES Buffy!
JINX The Slayer was there.
MURK A lethal fighter.
JINX She seemed to be everywhere at once.
MURK She had friends. With many weapons!
JINX They may have been demons.
GLORY And where's my vampire?
TARA Is it weird?
BUFFY Oh yeah. At least it's not a very good copy. I mean...
BUFFY ...look at it.
WILLOW Uh ... yeah.
BUFFY What'd you guys do with Spike? And please let the story have a dusty ending.
XANDER We dumped him back in his crypt.
GILES Tried to find out if he'd ... told her anything, but he was too badly beaten to make much sense.
ANYA Well, even if he told her, he'd just lie to us about it anyway, right?
BUFFY Yeah, you can count on it. But I have to know. Now. If he did give us up, Dawn and I need to get out of town. I mean, she could be on her way right now.
GILES But, uh, not to worry, you know, I'm sure we'll all be perfectly safe.
DAWN We're safe, right. And, uh, Spike built a robot Buffy to play checkers with.
TARA I-it sounded convincing when I thought it.
WILLOW Hey! I-I think I found somethin'.
ANYA Uch! Looks very complicated in there. Personally, I'd rather look at guts.
WILLOW I found where she's broken. Some of these wires got fried extra crispy. It's an easy fix.
WILLOW I mean ... not that I would.
XANDER God, I feel ... kind of bad for the guy. Gets all whupped and his best toy gets taken away.
BUFFY Xander. Please don't be suggesting what I'd have to kill you for suggesting.
XANDER No, no, travesty, completely on board, it's just ... the guy was so thrashed.
BUFFYBOT Spike! You're covered in sexy wounds.
SPIKE Yeah. I feel real sexy. Where you been?
BUFFYBOT I fell down and got confused. Willow fixed me. She's gay.
SPIKE Will fixed you? I thought they'd melt you into scrap.
BUFFYBOT They were confused too. Do you wanna ravage me now?
SPIKE Give us a minute. Got some bones need mending.
BUFFYBOT Why did you let that Glory hurt you?
SPIKE She wanted to know who the key was.
BUFFYBOT Oh, well, I can tell her, and then you'll-
SPIKE No! You can't ever. Glory never finds out.
BUFFYBOT Why?
SPIKE 'Cause Buffy ... the other, not so pleasant Buffy ... anything happened to Dawn, it'd destroy her. I couldn't live, her bein' in that much pain. Let Glory kill me first. Nearly bloody did.
SPIKE And my robot?
BUFFY The robot is gone. The robot was gross and obscene.
SPIKE It wasn't supposed to-
BUFFY Don't. That ... thing, it ... it wasn't even real.
BUFFY What you did, for me, and Dawn ... that was real.
BUFFY I won't forget it.
