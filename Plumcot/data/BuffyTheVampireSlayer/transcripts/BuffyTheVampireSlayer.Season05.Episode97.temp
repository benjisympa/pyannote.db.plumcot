GILES_VOICEOVER Previously on
BUFFY_VOICEOVER Tell me what kind of demon I'm fighting.
QUENTIN_TRAVERS_VOICEOVER Glory isn't a demon, she's a god.
MONK We had to hide the key ... made it human...
MONK ...and sent it to you.
BUFFY_VOICEOVER Dawn.
DAWN I'm not real.
BEN You're the key. Go. Before she finds you, she's here!
BEN I won't help her find the key. I would never do that to an innocent-
JINX An innocent?
BEN It's not a person.
GLORY What about the key?
JINX He indicated that it was a person.
SPIKE I'll tell you who the sodding key is.
GLORY The vampire is lying to me.
SPIKE The Slayer is going to kick your lopsided ass.
BUFFY Professor Lillian?
PROFESSOR Buffy.
BUFFY I'm sorry that I missed the lecture today. Was it good?
BUFFY Um, of course it was. D-do you want me to try?
PROFESSOR Yes, thanks, the ... slide is stuck in the ... thing.
BUFFY Okay. Um, I just ... came by to tell you that ... I have to drop this class. Um, all my classes actually. I'm not finishing the semester. I wish it ... um ... I just, I can't be in school right now. I, I have to take care of my sister.
PROFESSOR Yes, I, I thought you might. I was very sorry to hear about your loss.
BUFFY Um, I have these forms from the registrar's office that I need you to sign.
PROFESSOR Oh ... yes.
BUFFY Thanks.
PROFESSOR Is there something else?
BUFFY No. Yes. Yeah. Um ... I wanted to tell you ... how much I enjoyed this class. I mean, I know that I wasn't the best student, but ... I really learned a lot. Uh, and I really like poetry. I really do.
BUFFY Oh, sorry.
PROFESSOR I'm glad you like poetry, Buffy.
BUFFY I wish I had time for it. But I just ... don't right now.
PROFESSOR Well, maybe short poems.
BUFFY Yeah! Like, like those, those Japanese ones that, that, um, sound like a sneeze?
PROFESSOR Haiku?
BUFFY Right. Maybe those. A-and hopefully I'll be back next semester.
BUFFY_VOICEOVER When I'm more myself again.
DOCTOR Benjamin. This is a pleasant surprise.
BEN I'm sorry I'm late.
DOCTOR You're not late.
BEN But sir-
DOCTOR You can't be late to a job that you don't have. Interestingly enough, I've decided to give your job to someone who'll actually do it. Honest to God, Ben! I've been calling you for two weeks. Where the hell have you been? I didn't wanna ... I'm sorry to fire you, but I need somebody I can count on.
BEN I haven't been here... I haven't been here in two weeks. There's an explanation for this. Which ... I ... can't exactly give you. I - can I just tell you it's not my fault?
DOCTOR Sure. You can also tell me that the dog ate your homework, or maybe eating Twinkies made you do it, or ... maybe yeah, that there's really a wicked demonic creature living inside you that takes control of your body and forces you to do its bidding. Take responsibility for your actions, Ben!
BEN I ... this ... you know, forget it. Just forget it.
BEN This is so unfair. You're taking everything away from me. Everything I worked for, I earned, I care about. These are my choices, this is my life, and you're ruining it! No. No. Not here. Not now, please. I'm Ben. I'm Ben. I'm Ben.
GLORY I'm hungry.
GLORY We got this part right, that's for sure. Lot of sucky things in this dimension bubble baths? Not one of 'em. Know what I mean?
JINX I am in thunderous agreement, oh glittering, glistening Glorificus.
GLORY I wasn't talking to you.
MURK Uh, begging your pardon, and begging in general, but ... were you talking to me?
GLORY Eww. Yeah, right. Like any of you have ever bathed, anyway.
MURK Oh, but we do, your scrumptiousness. We bathe in your splendiforous radiance, your aromatic-
GLORY How about you shut up and listen to me, you disgusting little fools? Okay. Now, I asked for the key, and you brought me a vampire. A pulseless, impure, follicly-fried vampire. Loofah!
GLORY So, what I think we have here is a failure for you to do your frickin' jobs, pardon my French. Mimosa.
GLORY Mmm ... Vitamins. So I think you better rack your little minion brains, and tell me everything that you saw when you were spying on Buffy and her wacky pals. Everything. Mm. Then I'll figure out who the key is.
BUFFY_VOICEOVER You lied to me?
DAWN Didn't ... lie ... e-exactly.
BUFFY Really.
BUFFY What about all the times I asked you how school was and you said fine?
DAWN Well, it was! You didn't ask if I was in it when it was fine.
BUFFY I-I don't know what to say. I-I'm sure you're aware that the past few months, you know, have been kind of hard for Dawn. Not that I'm saying that's an excuse.
PRINCIPAL I understand. Your mother was a lovely woman and we'll all miss her very much. I know how difficult it must be.
BUFFY It is. Especially for Dawn. She-she's just a kid.
PRINCIPAL Well ... I think we both know that Dawn is a lot more than just a kid.
PRINCIPAL She's a talented young girl ... with a sharp mind ... when she puts the effort in.
BUFFY Look. I realize that there's been some ball-dropping, but I'm sure this will all-
PRINCIPAL Dawn, why don't you wait outside for a few minutes?
XANDER Honey.
XANDER Old saying. A watched customer never buys.
ANYA They would if they were patriotic.
XANDER Okay, I'm goin' in. Patriotic?
ANYA Yes. I've recently come to realize there's more to me than just being human. I'm also an American.
GILES Yes, I suppose you are, in a manner of speaking. You were born here your mortal self.
ANYA Well, that's right, foreigner. So I've been reading a lot about the good ol' us of A, embracing the extraordinarily precious ideology that's helped to shape and define it.
WILLOW Democracy?
ANYA Capitalism. The free market depends on the profitable exchange of goods for currency. It's a system of symbiotic beauty apparently lost on these old people. Look at 'em. Perusing the shelves. Undressing the merchandise with their eyeballs all ogle, no cash. It's not just annoying, it's unAmerican.
GILES Appalling. Almost as if they no longer think money can buy happiness.
ANYA Totally unAmerican. Oh, and you know what else is unAmerican? French people.
WILLOW You don't say.
ANYA From what I hear, they don't tip. Now, French old people? That's *really* the bottom of the barrel, you know?
XANDER Ahn, how's about we try being a bit less prejudiced, and a bit more inclusive? Not us, just you.
ANYA Fine. I'm gonna make those fogeys buy things.
XANDER Hey, what's up? It's Dawn Giovanni and the Buffster.
DAWN Hi.
BUFFY Hey everybody.
GILES I trust everything went well at the university?
BUFFY Yep, I'm, uh, all dropped out.
XANDER Good on you. Welcome to the real world. Lot of fun to be had on the outside. You'll see.
BUFFY Well, it's just for now. I mean, I'm thinking that I'm probably gonna go back next semester.
XANDER And that's cool too. Whatever you choose, you've got my support. Just think of me as ... as your ... You know, I'm searching for supportive things, and I'm comin' up all bras, so... something slightly more manly, think of me as that.
XANDER Seriously. Whatever you need.
BUFFY Thank you. Actually, I need to talk to Giles alone for a minute.
XANDER Cool, that's cool.
BUFFY Uh, Dawn, why don't you get started on your homework? Uh, if you need help, Will, could you? Okay.
BUFFY I just don't know what I'm gonna do. I mean, she's messing up ... I'm messing up ... it's a mess.
GILES You're just going to have to put your foot down with her.
BUFFY I try. It's just ... my foot's not used to being put down. I want you to do it. You can be the foot-putting-downer.
GILES No, Buffy, I don't think I can.
BUFFY Please? Pretty please? I mean, your foot is way bigger than mine! And you're so much more a grownup than me. Dawn needs an authority figure. A strong guiding hand. She'll listen to you.
GILES Just like you always have.
BUFFY I listen!
BUFFY I do.
GILES Well, then perk up your ears. I may be a grownup, but you're her family. Her only real family now. She needs you to do this.
BUFFY Right. She needs me. Me, the ... grownup. The authority figure. The, the strong guiding hand and, and stompy foot that is me.
GILES That's the spirit.
BUFFY Okay. I can do this.
GILES I know you can.
BUFFY Please?
GILES No.
BUFFY Okay. Here we go.
BUFFY Early to bed, early to rise, balanced breakfast, hospital corners. It's a new beginning.
BUFFY Discipline. Authority. Order.
BUFFY What is this? I thought I told you to do your homework!
DAWN I was.
BUFFY Please don't lie to me.
DAWN I'm not.
WILLOW We were acting out a geometry problem, 'cause I read this really neat article that said kids learn math better if you, you stimulate their, uh, visual learning pattern. You know, using the right side of the brain instead of just the left?
WILLOW Stuff like that.
BUFFY Uh-huh.
WILLOW So we made a triangle with our bodies, and that's when I called Xander obtuse, and he got really grumpy and then Dawn said we were acute triangle, and, well, hilarity ensued.
BUFFY Right. Well, you know what I think? I think maybe Dawn should do her homework at home.
DAWN B-but it was working. I was really learning.
BUFFY Please get your stuff.
DAWN Fine. Don't listen to me.
WILLOW Please don't be grouchy with her. Who among us can resist the allure of really funny math puns?
BUFFY It's really important that Dawn finishes her schoolwork right now.
WILLOW Yeah, I know, but...
WILLOW We were having good clean educational fun, and then all of a sudden it was all gloom and doom and the outlawing of human triangles.
BUFFY It's *really* important that Dawn finishes her schoolwork right now.
WILLOW I know it is, and I'm a big fan of school. You know me! I'm like, Go school! It's your birthday! Or something to that effect.
BUFFY Look, Willow, I know that you mean well, but you just don't understand, and there's no way that you could.
WILLOW I do so understand, it ... you're stressed out.
BUFFY I'm more than stressed out. I'm freaked out.
WILLOW Yeah, well, maybe you need a break to de-freak. Hey, you could go to the World's Culture fair if you want to, with me and Tara.
BUFFY I don't think so.
WILLOW Come on. You can bring Dawn. It'll be fun. Good, educational-type fun in a discipline-y sort of way.
BUFFY I can't do it, Will. Don't worry. It's not like I don't have a life. I do. I have Dawn's life.
BUFFY Ready?
GLORY So it's her. Under our noses all this time. I like the detail work those monks did. Quirks, foibles, passions ... it's all so cute, so ... human. You know?
GLORY Pretty convincing really. But not convincing enough.
GLORY You all know your assignments. I think it's time to collect the key.
WILLOW It wasn't anything really. Buffy was just a little crabby at Dawn about her schoolwork.
TARA Well, it's understandable.
WILLOW Yeah, sure it is. I'd totally be blowing off classes if I were in Dawnie's shoes.
TARA Sweetie, you wouldn't blow off a class if your head was on fire. And, I meant Buffy.
WILLOW Buffy what?
TARA Understandable about the crabby. She has to look after Dawn now.
WILLOW Yeah, but not in a Miss Minchin's Select Seminary For Girls way. I mean, she's just gonna make Dawnie more rebellious.
TARA I had to deal with my brother's problems after ... I mean, you can't really know what it's like to-
WILLOW Yeah, I know that.
TARA I, I didn't mean to-
WILLOW No, I just ... I ... I know I can't know what you went through. But I just ... It's no big.
TARA I made you mad.
WILLOW No. No.
TARA All I meant was-
WILLOW No, it's okay. This whole Buffy thing, let's just forget it.
TARA No, please. I mean, I mean, tell me if I said something wrong, otherwise I know I'll say it again. Probably often and in public.
WILLOW No, I was snippy gal. It's just ... I know I can't ... on some level ... it's like my opinion isn't worth anything because I haven't been through ... I didn't lose my mom, so I don't know.
TARA Well ... I-I'm not the expert. I mean, I've only lost the one.
TARA Do ... I act like ... the big knowledge woman?
WILLOW No.
TARA Is that no spelled Y-E-S?
WILLOW S-O-R-T of. I mean, I just feel like the-the junior partner. You've been doing everything longer than me. You've been out longer ... you've been practicing witchcraft way longer.
TARA Oh, but you're way beyond me there! In just a few- I mean ... it frightens me how powerful you're getting.
WILLOW That's a weird word.
TARA Getting?
WILLOW It frightens you? *I* frighten you?
TARA That is *so* not what I meant. I meant i-impresses - impressive.
WILLOW Well, I took Psych 101. I mean, I took it from an evil government scientist who was skewered by her Frankenstein-like creation before the final, but I know what a Freudian slip is.
WILLOW D-don't you trust me?
TARA With my life.
WILLOW That's not what I mean.
TARA Can't we just go to the fair?
WILLOW I don't feel real multicultural right now. Wh ... what is it about me that you don't trust?
TARA It's not that. I worry, sometimes. You're, you're changing so much, so fast. I don't know where you're heading.
WILLOW Where I'm heading?
TARA I'm saying everything wrong.
WILLOW No, I think you're being pretty clear. This isn't about the witchcraft. It's about the other changes in my life.
TARA I trust you. I just ... I don't know where I'm gonna fit in ... in your life when...
WILLOW When ... I change back? Yeah, this is a college thing, just a, a little experimentation before I get over the thrill and head back to boys' town.
WILLOW You think that?
TARA Should I?
WILLOW I'm really sorry that I didn't establish my lesbo street cred before I got into this relationship. You're the only woman I've ever fallen in love with, so ... how on earth could you ever take me seriously?
TARA Willow, please!
WILLOW Have fun at the fair.
BUFFY Okay, so, I-I think the next step is to make a chart. A schedule. I'll write down all the things you're supposed to do, and when you have to do them, and then I'll leave a box next to it, which you can mark with an X when you've accomplished the task.
BUFFY What? You want gold stars? Okay. You can have gold stars.
DAWN I don't want gold stars. I don't want any of this.
BUFFY I'm just trying to give you a normal life.
DAWN Well, good luck.
DAWN What? What am I doing wrong now?
BUFFY This is for real, Dawn.
DAWN No, it's not. I'm not real, so why would my exciting graph of chores be real? Who cares if a key gets an education anyway?
BUFFY It's a chart. Not a graph. And you are real.
DAWN Yeah? Those monks put grades K through eight in my head. Can't we just wait and see if they drop nine in there too?
BUFFY Damn it, Dawn. This is serious.
DAWN Why? Why should I care about any of this?
BUFFY Because they'll take you away!
DAWN Take me away? What do you mean?
BUFFY They'll take you away from me. That's what your principal told me when you weren't in the room. If I can't make you go to school, then I won't be found fit to be your legal guardian.
DAWN Where would I go?
BUFFY I don't know. Dad maybe ... or foster care ... I, I didn't really want to ask.
DAWN You could've told me that.
BUFFY I just did.
GLORY Is this seat taken?
GILES I hope this isn't a return. Everyone wants petrified hamsters and they're never happy with them.
GILES You all right?
WILLOW Yeah.
GILES Ah yes, because your good mood is both obvious and contagious.
WILLOW I had a fight with Tara. It was awful.
GILES Oh, I'm sorry.
WILLOW Me too.
GILES You two don't quarrel much, do you?
WILLOW Never. Until today.
GILES Well, now it's over.
WILLOW Over? How can it be over? I just found her!
GILES The quarrel is over.
WILLOW Oh. Yeah.
GILES Uh, you'll feel better when you've made your apologies and you'll know that you can fight without the world ending. I know it all seems bleak now, but as they say, this too...
GILES ...shall pass.
ANYA Wow!
GILES Now, what do we have here?
ANYA Oh, he's one of those things that work for Glory!
GILES Yes. How helpful.
SLOOK I do indeed work for the god. Let me go if you do not wish to incur her anger.
GILES Well, she's not here. What a marvelous opportunity for you and me to talk.
SLOOK I will not betray Glorificus. I will never talk, no matter what heinous torture-
GILES Actually, you're talking quite a lot, just not about the right things. Tell us why you're here.
SLOOK No words shall pass my lips that will bring peril to Glorificus.
GILES Girls, get the twine that's on the counter, let's tie him up.
SLOOK No, no! I'll tell you! Anything! Please! Whatever you want! Just, I'll, anything!
ANYA What happened?
GILES He changed his mind.
SLOOK I'm ... I'm supposed to watch. We're watching the Slayer's people ... while Glory fetches the key.
WILLOW Glory knows who the key is?
GILES Oh god.
ANYA We've got to call Buffy.
SLOOK Too late. Too late. Glorificus will find the witch, and there's nothing you can do to stop her.
ANYA Witch? What do you mean?
WILLOW Tara!
SLOOK She's the new one among you. It wasn't hard to figure out. The glorious one will have found her by now.
GILES Willow, wait! I'll go with-
WILLOW No! Call Buffy a-and go look in Tara's room, I'm gonna check the fair.
GLORY Oh, this is nice. Just hangin' out, just us girls. You like that sort of thing, don't you?
TARA Aah...
GLORY Don't ... make a sound.
GLORY Nah. They won't help you. I'd kill them. You know that.
GLORY There's no one here that can stop me.
GLORY I'll kill her and ... and them I'll kill him, and her and her, and it'll all be your fault.
GLORY Kinda funny, isn't it? All these people here and ... no one who can do a thing. Not a person who can help you.
GLORY But that's people for ya. They're pretty worthless. But keys, on the other hand ... keys are worth a very lot.
GLORY You lying little tramp! You're not the key, you're nothing! Just another worthless human being!
TARA I didn't-
GLORY I hate being lied to. It makes me feel so betrayed. Hey! You wanna make it all better?
GLORY If you tell me who the key really is ... I'll let you go.
GLORY Think about it. You think your hand hurts? Imagine what you'd feel with my fingers wiggling in your brain. It doesn't kill you. What it does ... is make you feel like you're in a noisy little dark room ... naked and ashamed ... and there are things in the dark that need to hurt you because you're bad ... little pinching things that go in your ears ... and crawl on the inside of your skull. And you know ... that if the noise and the crawling would stop ... that you could remember how to get out.
GLORY But you never, ever will.
GLORY Who ... is ... the key?
GLORY Fine. Let's get crazy.
WILLOW Tara!
WILLOW Tara!
WILLOW By force of heart and mindful power, by waning time and waxing hour ...
WILLOW I echo Diana, um, when I decree ... uh, what is it, what is it?
WILLOW No! No!
WILLOW That she I love must now be free!
WILLOW Tara!
WILLOW No!!
WILLOW Tara, Tara, are you okay?
TARA It's dirty. It's all dirty. And all over me!
TARA Dirty. Dirty. I'm bad. Bad.
WILLOW Tara. Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
WILLOW Can she go home now?
DOCTOR Unfortunately, no. Hospital policy dictates we keep her for the night.
WILLOW But does she have to? I-I can take care of her at home.
TARA It's poisoned. Why don't I tell you that? It, it has to be checked, though.
DOCTOR She your sister?
TARA I-i-it has to be verified, of course. Anyone can tell you that. Of course. Of course, of course.
WILLOW She's my everything.
DOCTOR Well, you can get her released first thing in the morning. But she's gotta spend one night in the psych ward. Just for observation. We'll keep an eye on her, do a couple basic tests, then you can take her home. Does that sound fair? Well, sit tight then, and I'll send a nurse by in a few minutes to pick up Tara.
XANDER Man, words cannot express how much I hate this place.
GILES It's dreadful.
ANYA It's like communism.
BUFFY Hey. Will, I'm so sorry.
TARA They kill mice.
BUFFY Tara.
BUFFY I'm sorry it took me so long, but Dawn's safe with Spike, so I-I can stay as long as you need.
WILLOW I'm so scared.
SPIKE_VOICEOVER Nothin' to be worried about, kid.
SPIKE No one's gonna hurt you.
DAWN Oh yeah? Same no one who did that to you?
SPIKE What, these? It's just a few bruises.
SPIKE Nothin' to write home about.
SPIKE Hey, chin up, platelet. Don't get scared. Maybe Glory doesn't wanna kill you, maybe it's something-
DAWN Worse?
SPIKE Hey.
DAWN You wanna know what I'm scared of, Spike? ... Me. Right now, Glory thinks Tara's the key. But I'm the key, Spike. I am. And anything that happens to Tara ... is 'cause of me. Your bruises, your limp ... that's all me too. I'm like a lightning rod for pain and hurt. And everyone around me suffers and dies. I ... must be something so horrible ... to cause so much pain ... and evil.
SPIKE Rot.
DAWN What do you know?
SPIKE I'm a vampire. I know somethin' about evil. You're not evil.
DAWN Maybe ... I'm not evil. But I don't think I can be good.
SPIKE Well, I'm not good, and I'm okay.
TARA Don't! Please don't with that treachery!
TARA I told the cat. And now I beg my mother sitting all alone.
WILLOW Bye, Tara. I'll see you tomorrow. I love you.
XANDER Willow. No. It's just for one night.
WILLOW Yeah, I-I know, but ... it's a whole night. I don't think I can sleep without her.
ANYA You can sleep with me.
ANYA Well, now that came out a lot more lesbian than it sounded in my head.
BUFFY Will, you just have to rest. Okay? Right now there's nothing you can do.
WILLOW Yes there is.
BUFFY No. No way.
BUFFY You cannot even think about taking on Glory.
WILLOW You saw what she did to Tara. I can't let her get away with it.
BUFFY No. You *have* to let her get away with it. Even I'm no match for her, you know that.
WILLOW But maybe I am.
BUFFY You're not. And I won't let you go.
WILLOW This is not your choice. It's mine.
BUFFY This is not the time.
WILLOW When, Buffy? When is? When *you* feel like it? When it's someone *you* love as much as I love Tara? When it's Dawn, is that it?
BUFFY When we have a chance. We'll fight her, when we have a chance. You wouldn't last five minutes with her, Willow. She's a god.
WILLOW Fine. I'll wait.
BUFFY It's the only way.
WILLOW Yeah.
BUFFY Can I do anything?
WILLOW Just let me be alone.
GLORY You know, I think I'm a little buzzed from eating that witch! What a mind she has. Mmm, nummy treat.
JINX Is your grace not the slightest bit concerned about-
GLORY What, about the Slayer? Don't be stupid. I know I'm closing in. The key's as good as mine. Girl like Buffy's got just so many friends. All I gotta do it rip through 'em one by one until I finally...
GLORY Did anybody order an apocalypse?
WILLOW Kali, Hera, Kronos, Tonic...
WILLOW Air like nectar, thick as onyx...
WILLOW Cassiel by your second star...
GLORY Uhh. It's the lover. That's so cute.
WILLOW Hold mine victim as in tar.
WILLOW I ... owe ... you ... pain!
DAWN It's all my fault.
BUFFY No. Sweetheart, it is *not* your fault.
DAWN How's Willow?
BUFFY She was looking to go all payback-y on Glory for a minute. But I cooled her down a little. Actually a lot.
SPIKE So she's not gonna do anything rash then.
BUFFY No. I explained that there was no point.
SPIKE Mm-hmm.
BUFFY What?
SPIKE You - so you're saying that a ... powerful and mightily pissed-off witch ... was plannin' on going and spillin' herself a few pints of god blood until you, what, explained?
BUFFY You think she'd ... no. I told Willow it would be like suicide.
SPIKE I'd do it.
SPIKE Right person. Person I loved. I'd do it.
DAWN Think, Buffy. If Glory had done that to me.
WILLOW Shatter.
GLORY Is that it? Is that the best you can do? You think I care about all this, the apartment, the clothes?
GLORY Now, sucking on your girlfriend's mind?
GLORY That was something to treasure.
GLORY What's this? Bag of tricks?
WILLOW Bag of knives.
WILLOW Spirit of serpents now appear.
WILLOW Hissing, writhing, striking near.
GLORY Now this is getting weak.
GLORY And so are you, honey. Aren't ya?
WILLOW No!
GLORY Know what they used to do to witches, lover? Crucify 'em.
BUFFY They used to bow down to gods.
BUFFY Things change.
GLORY That witch barely slowed me down.
WILLOW Thicken.
GLORY This isn't over, you hear me? It isn't over!
BUFFY Chicken salad?
WILLOW Right here.
BUFFY Eggplant, that's me ... salami with ... ew, peanut butter? Dawn.
DAWN Yeah, like eggplant is normal. It's what, half egg, half plant? 'Cause that's just unnatural.
WILLOW What's Tara got?
DAWN Oh. I ... got her tuna. Does she like...?
DAWN Tara?
TARA Plastic and their six sisters. Six sick sisters. Willow?
WILLOW It's okay. Let's just start slow today. Um, Buffy, could I have that?
WILLOW Here you go.
WILLOW That's my girl.
DAWN Can I help?
BUFFY What are you gonna need?
WILLOW I don't know. They gave me a lot of stuff to ... keep her calm.
WILLOW They said I might have to restrain her at night. But ... sometimes she's fine. She looks at me, and ... she's fine.
BUFFY I'm sorry I couldn't-
WILLOW It's okay. I can do this. I'm gonna take care of her. Even if she never...
WILLOW She's my girl.
BUFFY I understand.
WILLOW I know you do.
WILLOW Hear that, baby? You're my always.
GLORY I told you this wasn't over.
TARA No. The place is cracking! It's cracking! Cracking, no, no, no!
DAWN No, Tara, it's okay.
TARA Oh, look at that, look at that. The light!
TARA Oh, it's so pure! Such pure green energy!
TARA Oh, it's so beautiful.
