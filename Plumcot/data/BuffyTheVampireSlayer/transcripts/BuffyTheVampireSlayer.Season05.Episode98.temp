GILES_VOICEOVER Previously on
MONK We had to hide the key ... made it human...
MONK ...and sent it to you.
BUFFY_VOICEOVER Dawn.
BUFFY_VOICEOVER Tell me what kind of demon I'm fighting.
QUENTIN_TRAVERS_VOICEOVER Glory isn't a demon, she's a god.
GLORY Did you know your sister took my key, Dawnie, and she won't give it back. I bet you know where she put it, don't you?
SPIKE They had to be certain the Slayer would protect it with her life, so they sent the key to her, in the form of a sister.
BEN You're the key. Go. Before she finds you, she's here!
SPIKE I love you.
BUFFY The only chance you had with me was when I was unconscious.
BUFFY Let's see what you are.
BUFFY Or who you are.
ORLANDO One soldier in a vast army.
KNIGHTS The key is the link. The link must be severed.
GLORY Where ... is ... the key?
ORLANDO I'd die a thousand deaths before I'd tell you.
WILLOW No!
WILLOW Tara! No!
WILLOW Tara, I'm so sorry.
BUFFY What are you gonna need?
WILLOW They gave me a lot of stuff to keep her calm.
GLORY I told you this wasn't over.
TARA Oh, look at that, look at that. Such pure green energy!
DAWN Buffy!
BUFFY We have to keep moving!
DAWN I can't!
GLORY I really hate it when people touch my things.
GLORY Last words, slay-runt?
BUFFY Just one. Truck.Glory looks to her right, too late, as a huge semi smashes into her.
GLORY No! Not now, you idiot! Let go-
BEN -of my body!
BEN Oh, god.
DAWN A-and then whoosh! All of a sudden Glory's standing right there in front of us, all skanky and blonde and thinkin' she's all that just 'cause some bumpy heads kiss her stinky feet ... She does have nice feet. A-and she's comin' right at us, and- Buffy's just standing there not even blinking, like Bring it on, and then, wham! Hell-bitch in orbit.
XANDER Go, Buff!
GILES I knew you'd best Glory eventually, I mean all-all our years of training-
BUFFY A truck hit her.
GILES Oh.
ANYA You threw it at her?
DAWN Well, no. She more kind of waited for it to hit Glory. Uh, but then Buffy ran really fast and we got away.
BUFFY I don't know how we got away. That truck couldn't have slowed her down for more than a second.
GILES Well, how isn't important, all that matters is that the two of you are safe.
BUFFY Safe? We've barely been able to manage not getting seriously dead every time we've crossed paths with Glory. Now that she knows that Dawn is the key?
GILES There must be something in the
ANYA Piano!
XANDER Because that's what we used to kill that big demon that one time!
XANDER No wait, that-that was a rocket launcher. Ahn, what are you talking about?
ANYA We should drop a piano on her. Well, it always works for that creepy cartoon rabbit when he's running from that nice man with the speech impediment.
GILES Yes, or perhaps we could paint a convincing tunnel on the side of a mountain. Let's just keep thinking, everyone. Perhaps we should reassemble at the magic shop, see if there's anything-
BUFFY We can't fight her.
GILES W-well not yet, no, but-
BUFFY No, not ever. She's too strong, Giles. We're not gonna win this with, with stakes, or spells, or pulling out some uranium power core. She's a god and she's coming for us. So let's just not be here when she starts knocking.
ANYA Run away?
ANYA Finally, a sensible plan.
XANDER That's not what she meant. Is it?
BUFFY Well, we can't stay here! She'll just kill us off one by one until there's no one left standing between her and Dawn.
GILES Buffy, we all understand the severity of the situation, but there must be another way.
BUFFY No. We stay, we die. Show of hands for that option.
BUFFY All right. Nobody goes home, nobody tells anybody we're leaving. Just pack up whatever supplies we need and that's it, we're gone.
DAWN Cool. Don't have to study for that geometry test.
XANDER What about wheels? I don't think everybody's gonna fit in the Xandermobile.
BUFFY Just get your stuff together. I'll handle the rest.
GRONX This is, this is terrible. I'll never be able to mend this.
BEN Not really my color anyway.
GRONX Oh, yes. Inappropriate humor. Most amusing. Don't suppose you know what led to this sartorial tragedy.
BEN That's not how it works, you know that.
GRONX Yes, of course. I just thought maybe after her magnificent incandescence was returned to this ... manly and ... painfully handsome assemblage ... you might have noticed something interesting? A key in human form, perhaps? Lounging about unattended?
BEN If I did, do you really think I would tell you?
GRONX Why do you insist on fighting the inevitable? No one can stand against her blindingly scrumptious luminescence.
BEN Glory. Her name is Glory, and she's your god, you little scab, not mine.
GRONX With all due respect and-and fear of sharp objects, you exist, sir, only because of her divine greatness.
BEN You mean her divine failure, don't you?
BEN I didn't ask for any of this. I just want to be normal.
GRONX We play the hand we're dealt.
BEN Nothing's mine, is it? This life, this body, it's all infected. The only thing I ever cared about she's taken away from me. You know why I wanted to be a doctor?
GRONX Flattering drawstring pants?
BEN To be close to people. To witness their lives and their deaths, to be there alongside them, a part of everyday humanity. Maybe it's the drugs.
GRONX Drugs, sir?
BEN Find the right combination, keep her buried where she belongs.
GRONX Impossible! Her magnificence can never be fully contained! She is a perfect, all-encompassing light, one you should feel honored to be bathed in.
BEN Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled. Especially with the part where she gets her key back and I cease to exist.
GRONX True, this oh-so-appealing form will of necessity be shrugged off.
BEN Not if I get the key first.
GRONX And if you did ... what then? Could you do it? Take a human life with your own hands? Oblivion is such a small inconvenience in the service of a deity. Accept your fate. I mean, you said it yourself. This life was never really yours anyway, was it?
BEN It doesn't matter how I came by it. It's mine. And I plan on keeping it.
ANYA Anybody else feel that?
WILLOW What?
ANYA Cold draft of paralyzing fear.
GILES We just need to stay calm.
WILLOW Calm, right.
XANDER Hey, we gotta be like Sergeant Rock. Cool and collected in the face of overwhelming odds.
ANYA *Over*whelming? How much more than whelming would that be exactly?
GILES Look, everything will be all right, we just need to stay here calmly. As soon as Buffy arrives-
GILES -we'll feel oddly worse.
GILES What's he doing here?
SPIKE Just out for a jaunt. Thought I'd swing by and say howdy.
GILES Out.
BUFFY He's here because we need him.
XANDER The hell we do.
BUFFY If Glory finds us, he's the only one besides me that has any chance of protecting Dawn.
XANDER Buffy, come on-
BUFFY Look, this isn't a discussion! He stays. Get over it.
SPIKE Buckle up, kids. Daddy's puttin' the hammer down.
NURSE Sign here.
NURSE Okay, that should do it.
DANTE See. Did I not tell you how easy it would be for us to-
NURSE Hey!
NURSE My pen.
ORLANDO The trees are singing water.
GREGOR You have him.
DANTE Yes, General.
DANTE Our brother has returned to the fold.
GREGOR Welcome home, Orlando. I swear by my sword your sacrifice ... will not go unavenged.
ORLANDO Shiny.
GREGOR Yes, I suppose it is.
ORLANDO Pretty little girl, she's shiny too.
GREGOR Watch him, make sure he's comfortable.
ORLANDO So shiny. Pretty little shiny key.
GREGOR The key? You've seen it?
ORLANDO Pretty ... little shiny girl.
GREGOR The monks, they've made it human.
DANTE We know the Slayer's protecting the key. If what Orlando says is true...
GREGOR Prepare to advance!
KNIGHT Yes sir.
GREGOR We end this now.
ANYA Shouldn't somebody be asking, Are we there yet?
ANYA Isn't that what small entertaining children do?
DAWN That kinda only works if you know where you're going.
ANYA Do we know where we're going yet?
SPIKE We'd already be somewhere if Captain Slowpoke would give up the wheel. Hey! Gramps! Bloody step on it!
GILES Step on what? I've driven tricycles with more power.
XANDER Is anybody else queasy?
ANYA He doesn't travel well. He's like fine shrimp.
SPIKE I shoulda nicked that Porsche I had my eye on. There's just enough room for me, you, and big sis.
SPIKE What?
XANDER Would you give it a rest, or...
SPIKE Or what, you're gonna toss your cookies on my shoes?
XANDER Or you can be undead man walking. See how fast you can hitch a ride with a flaming thumb.
SPIKE Fine. Shrimp.
XANDER That guy is bloodsuckin' the last nerve right outta me.
GILES Well, Buffy has a point. In a confrontation, Spike may prove...
GILES ...useful.
XANDER I don't know if Buffy's thinkin' too clear on that one, or anything else right now. I've never seen her so...
GILES She's ... been through more than her fair share of late. She just needs a chance to catch her breath, regroup. She'll be all right.
XANDER Yeah. She'll ... Yeah.
DAWN Any luck?
WILLOW Uh, if you define luck as the absence of success, plenty. There's a couple barrier spells, but... they only work on a fixed locus. Haven't found anything that'll work while we're still moving.
TARA So pretty, can I have one?
WILLOW Come on.
DAWN Anyone hungry?
ANYA Ooh! Snacks! The secret to any successful migration.
ANYA Who's up for some tasty fried meat products?
SPIKE Hey! Aah!
WILLOW Tara, no! What did I tell you?
WILLOW Shh.
WILLOW I'm sorry. She, she didn't mean to.
WILLOW She doesn't know what she's doing.
DAWN We know.
SPIKE No biggie. Look, the skin's already stopped smoking. You go ahead and play ... peek-a-boo with Mister Sunshine all you like. It keeps the ride from getting boring.
TARA All the light is gone.
WILLOW No, shh, baby. The light's still outside, okay?
TARA All dark. All dark.
GRONX It's coming. The signs are in alignment, and soon victory will be in our grasp. All we need do is seize the moment ... and squeeze until it bleeds.
DAWN Hey. I think Anya's gonna try to cook. Wanna come watch the tears and recriminations?
BUFFY Maybe later.
DAWN Thanks.
BUFFY For what?
DAWN You know. Pretty much everything.
BUFFY Yeah. I'm doin' a great job.
DAWN You are.
BUFFY I'm the Slayer. The chosen one. All mythic and defender-y. Evil nasties are supposed to flee from me. Not the other way around.
DAWN You're not fleeing. You're ... moving at a brisk pace.
BUFFY Quaintly referred to in some cultures as the big scaredy runaway.
DAWN It's the most amazing thing anyone's ever done for me.
BUFFY It just keeps coming. Glory ... Riley ... Tara ... Mom.
DAWN I know. But there's a bright side.
BUFFY There is?
DAWN At least things can't get any crazier. Right?
BUFFY You know this is your fault for saying that.
KNIGHT Come on now!
KNIGHT Bring up the rear! Let's go!
BUFFY Giles!
GILES I see them.
SPIKE See who?
XANDER Arrows!
SPIKE Bloody hell!
XANDER They're throwing arrows!
BUFFY Dawn, get down under the table.
TARA Horsies!
WILLOW Tara!
GILES Weapons?
SPIKE Hello! You're driving one!
WILLOW Don't hit the horsies!
BUFFY Oh, we won't!
BUFFY Aim for the horsies.
XANDER Did we shake 'em?
BUFFY Stay low!
BUFFY Watch out for the-
SPIKE Now might be a good time for something heroic.
BUFFY Xander! Hatch!
DAWN Keep the pressure on.
SPIKE I always do, sweet bit.
ANYA Not a piano, but hey.
GILES Everyone all right?
XANDER_VOICEOVER We gotta find shelter.
SPIKE_VOICEOVER Yeah, right bloody quick. I'm burning up out here.
BUFFY Careful.
BUFFY Spike.
XANDER Careful. Up.
BUFFY Okay, Will?
WILLOW I'm on it.
WILLOW Oh, careful!
BUFFY Are you sure you're okay?
DAWN Yeah. B-but Spike's hurt.
SPIKE Ow! Easy with the delicates.
BUFFY They'll heal.
SPIKE Florence bloody Nightingale to the rescue.
ANYA Um, you have another plan, right? One that doesn't involve pointy knives and a Winnebago?
BUFFY We-we-we'll rest here for a minute, but then we have to keep moving.
XANDER Where?
BUFFY I don't know! We just, we, we, we can't, can't stay here. I-it's too close to the wreck, we're too easy to find.
WILLOW Buffy!
BUFFY Will, how is he?
BUFFY Will?
WILLOW I-I think I slowed the bleeding, but...
BUFFY Okay. Okay, just-just give me a minute.
BUFFY Dawn, get down!
XANDER We got company.
XANDER And they brought a crusade.
BUFFY Willow!
WILLOW I'm working on it!
KNIGHTS Go! Go! Go! Let's move! Come on, move it!
DAWN Buffy!
KNIGHT It's clear!
GREGOR The key.
WILLOW Enemies, fly and fall.
WILLOW Circling arms, raise a wall.
DANTE They have the general. Clerics!
CLERIC Energy barrier. A most powerful one.
DANTE Can it be breached?
CLERIC The witch's magic pales to the might of our god. The infidels' wall ... shall tumble before us.
BUFFY Will? How long will it hold?
WILLOW Half a day maybe.
WILLOW Or till Heckle and Jeckle punch a hole through it.
SPIKE So. What's the story with these role-playing rejects?
BUFFY Let's find out.
SPIKE You sure Scarface here can habla the English?
BUFFY He understands me. Don't you?
GREGOR You were warned we would return, Slayer.
BUFFY Took you long enough. What are you supposed to be, some kind of chief?
GREGOR General.
BUFFY General. In charge of what, getting captured?
GREGOR You do not frighten me, child. The instrument of chaos must be destroyed.
BUFFY Look at her that way again, and she will be the last thing you ever see.
GREGOR As I've been told, you protect the key of the beast.
BUFFY It's not that simple.
GREGOR Yes. The key has been transformed, given ... breath, life. Yet, this makes no difference. The key is the link. The link must be severed. Such is the will of god.
BUFFY She doesn't remember anything about being this key you're all looking for. The only thing that she remembers is growing up with a mother, and a sister that love her. What kind of god would demand her life for something that she has no control over?
BUFFY We are not your enemy. Tell your men to stand down.
GREGOR No.
BUFFY It is not her fault! She's human now!
GREGOR The key is too dangerous ... to be allowed to exist. No matter what form it has been pressed into.
BUFFY I will not let anyone tell me-
WILLOW Shh, shh, shh.
BUFFY What happened?
ANYA I-I don't know, she just went nuts.
TARA Time! Time, time!
WILLOW Tara! We have to do something! She, she can't stay this way. Buffy!
TARA Time... time... time...
PATIENTS Time. Time.
NURSE No, it's not time for your meds, just lie back-
NURSE Doctor! Doctor McCarthy!
ORLANDO It's time. It's time.
DANTE No, no, shh. There's nothing to fear, my brother.
DANTE The beast may have taken your mind, but I swear to you, she will never know the taste of your heart.
DANTE Clerics! I want the witch's barrier down. NOW!
BUFFY I'm sorry.
GILES For what?
BUFFY We should have stayed. If we had, none of this would have happened.
GILES Don't. What you did ... w-was necessary ... what I've always admired.
BUFFY Running away?
GILES Being able to place ... your heart ... above all else.
GILES I'm so proud of you. You've come so far. You're everything a Watcher ... everything I could have hoped for.
BUFFY Willow.
BUFFY Open a door.
DANTE Speak.
BUFFY One of my friends was hurt when you attacked us.
DANTE And ten of my men are dead. Honorable men. Shall we balance the scale?
BUFFY Will you let someone come and help him or not?
DANTE Give quarter to an agent of the beast? What madness would move me to such action?
BUFFY I'm done asking.
XANDER Whoa, whoa, hey! Uh ... this is war, isn't it? And if there's one thing I've learned from Sergeant Rock, it is in war ... there are rules.
XANDER Or at least there should be, if you're as honorable as you think you are. Plus, we do have your general forehead guy.
WILLOW Discharge and bring life.
SPIKE Handier than a Swiss knife. Look, the door to my crypt's got this nasty squeak, maybe you could...
BUFFY Hey, uh, i-it's Buffy. I need to ask you a really big favor.
BEN You, uh, forgot to mention the costume party outside.
BUFFY Sorry. I-I didn't know who else to call.
BEN No, it's okay. I mean, yeah, not ... how I pictured seeing you again, but, uh ... I'll take what I can get.
BUFFY Thank you ... for coming.
BEN My pleasure.
BEN All right, I think I got him stabilized, but there's a lot of damage. We need to get him out of here.
BUFFY Well, I think the guys with the pointy swords kinda have other ideas.
BEN Don't they always.
BUFFY Look, I know this must seem extra Outer Limits to you.
BEN This? Naah. I've seen things you wouldn't believe.
BEN You know, emergency room, full moon on a Saturday night.
BUFFY Look, if this gets too weird, just tell me. I'll understand.
BEN Don't worry about me. I won't leave until I've worn out my welcome.
SPIKE Ow.
SPIKE Thanks.
XANDER You know, those things'll kill you.
XANDER Oh. Right.
XANDER I mention today how much I don't like you?
SPIKE You mighta let it slip in ... once or twice.
XANDER How're your feelers?
SPIKE Nothing compared to the little bits we're gonna get chopped into when the Renaissance Faire kicks the door in. And here we bloody sit.
XANDER It's not like we got much of a choice.
SPIKE Could make a break for it! Use General Armor-All as a shield get to the doc's car, and-
XANDER Great plan. And while all the hacking and slashing's going on, what are you gonna be doing, huh? Throwing migraines at 'em?
SPIKE Look, we stay here, we all die! At least this way, some of us might get-
BUFFY No.
BUFFY We're all gonna make it. I'm not losing anyone.
BUFFY Check the supplies. See if anyone's hungry.
GREGOR Dissention in the ranks. Seldom a harbinger of glad tidings.
BUFFY Shut up.
GREGOR Poor frightened girl. You've no idea what you've gotten yourself into.
BUFFY Why don't you tell me?
GREGOR Would it make a difference?
GREGOR What do you know of the beast?
BUFFY Strong. Fast. Hellgod.
GREGOR From a dimension of unspeakable torment.
BUFFY A demon dimension. I know. She ruled with two other hellgods, right?
GREGOR Along with the beast they were a triumvirate of suffering and despair. Ruling with equal vengeance. But the beast's power grew beyond even what they could conceive. As did her lust for pain and misery. They looked upon her, what she had become ... and trembled.
BUFFY A god afraid?
GREGOR Such was her power. They feared she would attempt to seize their dimension for herself, and decided to strike first. A great battle erupted. In the end, they stood victorious over the beast ... barely. She was cast out. Banished to this lower plane of existence, forced to live and eventually die trapped within the body of a mortal ... a newborn male, created as her prison. That is the beast's ... only weakness.
BUFFY Kill the man ... and the god dies.
GREGOR Unfortunately, the identity of the human vessel has never been discovered.
BUFFY I don't understand. Now, I've seen Glory. Not a whole lot going on in the hairy chest department.
GREGOR You have seen a glimpse of the true beast. Her power was too great to be completely contained. She's found a way to escape her mortal prison ... for brief periods, before her energies are exhausted and she's forced back ... into her living cell of meat and bone.
DAWN What about me?
DAWN What about the key?
BUFFY Dawn.
DAWN I want to know.
GREGOR The key ... is almost as old as the beast itself. Where it came from, how it was created ... the deepest of mysteries. All that is certain is that its power is absolute. Countless generations of my people have sacrificed their lives in search of it, to destroy it before its wrath could be unleashed.
DAWN But the monks found it first.
GREGOR Yes, and hid it with their magicks.
BUFFY Why didn't they just destroy it? If the key is as dangerous as-
GREGOR Because they were fools. They thought they could harness its power for the forces of light. They failed, and paid with their blood.
DAWN What do I do? What was I created for?
GREGOR You were created ... to open the gates that separate dimensions. The beast will use your power ... to return home and seize control of the hell she was banished from.
BUFFY That's it? That's Glory's master plan ... to go home?
GREGOR You misunderstand. Once the key is activated, it won't just open the gates to the beast's dimension. It's going to open all the gates. The walls separating realities will crumble. Dimensions will bleed into each other. Order will be overthrown and the universe will tumble into chaos ... all dark ... forever.
GREGOR That ... is what you were created for.
BUFFY Dawn.
DAWN You think it's true ... what he said?
BUFFY I don't know.
DAWN Destroyer of the universe. I guess cutting school doesn't seem so bad now, huh?
BUFFY It's not you. You know that.
DAWN But it's in me ... isn't it? It's inside me.
DAWN What are we gonna do?
BUFFY I won't let anything happen to you. I promise.
TARA Wriggling!
WILLOW Come on, Tara, you have to eat something.
ANYA Want me to try?
WILLOW I don't know. I'm gettin' used to pickin' fruit out of my hair.
GREGOR You!
GREGOR You are not a part of this, are you?
BEN Just a friend of the family.
GREGOR Would you die for them?
GREGOR Because that is what your future holds if you align yourself with the Slayer and her misguided people.
BEN It's my life, and I'll do what I please with it.
GREGOR It's not just your life. Unimaginable legions will perish, including everyone here. You can stop this. You can save all their lives by ending one. The little girl. The key. Destroy it, and the will of the beast will be broken, she will fade, a distant memory ... and all of this madness will end.
BEN Sorry.
DAWN Is ... is he gonna be okay?
BEN He was hurt pretty bad, Dawn.
DAWN It's because of me. It's all my fault.
BEN No it isn't.
DAWN You don't know what's happening.
BEN I don't have to. I just know that sometimes terrible things happen to good people. It shouldn't, but ... it does.
BEN It's nobody's fault.
BEN It's just the way life is.
DAWN Is that gonna help?
DAWN Ben?
BEN You have to let me out.
DAWN Ben?
BEN You don't understand, I gotta get out, open a door now!
BUFFY What happened?
DAWN I-I don't know, he just freaked out.
BEN Let me out!
BUFFY Okay, W-Will, open a door.
BEN No! Ha!
GLORY Well, what do you know. Little Ben finally did something right.
GREGOR The beast.
GLORY Hey, it's Gregor.
GLORY Now it's not.
DAWN Buffy!
GLORY Yeah, right!
BUFFY Dawn!!
BUFFY Willow!
BUFFY Get it down, now!
WILLOW Hear, hear my plea.
WILLOW Circling arm protecting me.
WILLOW We have to-
DANTE The beast.
SPIKE The car. Get the keys.
WILLOW Buffy! Buffy, we have to find Dawn. We, we can't let Glory-
WILLOW Buffy? Buffy!
WILLOW Buffy, you have to get up! We need you!
WILLOW Buffy, please! Buffy...
