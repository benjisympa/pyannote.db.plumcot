WATCHER You are the chosen one.
WATCHER You alone can stop them.
BUFFY Who?
WATCHER The vampires.
WATCHER You see your power.
BUFFY Why can't you people just leave me alone?
GILES Into each generation a Slayer is born.
WILLOW You're the Slayer, and we're like the Slayerettes.
XANDER The three of us have been together from the beginning. We've always gone on patrols, and, uh, done demon research with her and everything.
BUFFY We're talking about two very powerful witches and a thousand-year-old ex-demon
XANDER Anya, you wanna marry me?
BUFFY Angel.
ANGEL I love you.
BUFFY So don't go.
SPIKE Home sweet home.
DOCTOR That chip was deeply imbedded in your cerebral cortex.
SPIKE I can't bite anything. I can't even hit people.
GILES What are you saying?
SPIKE Spike had a little trip to the vet, and now he doesn't chase the other puppies any more.
SPIKE I know you'll never love me. I know that I'm a monster, but you treat me like a man.
SPIKE They had to be certain the Slayer would protect it with her life, so they sent the key to her in the form of a sister.
GREGOR You were created to open the gates that separate dimensions.
GREGOR The little girl. The key.
GREGOR Destroy it, and the will of the beast will be broken.
DAWN No!
DAWN I have to jump.
BUFFY It'll kill you.
DAWN Look at what's happening!
DAWN Buffy, no.
BUFFY Dawnie, I have to.
BUFFY_VOICEOVER You have to take care of each other. You have to be strong. Be brave. Live.
BUFFY_VOICEOVER For me.
TARA Willow, Xander!
TARA They're not here.
ANYA Thank god. No, I mean, my store hasn't been looted.
TARA Yet.
ANYA Xander.
TARA They're all right.
ANYA Then where are they? Why aren't they here?
TARA I don't know.
ANYA They could be hurt. Xander could be lying somewhere broken and bleeding, calling out my name.
TARA Anya.
ANYA Like that, oh god! What if, what if they're really hurt, what if they're dead?
TARA They're not.
ANYA How do you know?
TARA Because he's with Willow. And if something ... happened, I'd know. And so would you.
ANYA You think?
TARA I'm sure of it. They're fine.
TARA They're both fine.
TARA Maybe they got lost, in the woods.
ANYA The woods? Are we going back to the woods? I hate the woods. All those woodsy trees.
TARA No, it's okay. Lost is good. Willow and I always know how to find each other!
ANYA With yoga?
TARA Ssh! Aradia, hear my words.
XANDER Okay, this is really starting to grate my cheese. These woods aren't that big. Now, I know we've been going straight because I've been following the North Star.
WILLOW Xander. That's not the North Star. It's an airplane.
XANDER Nah, that's not an airplane, it's definitely ... ...a blimp! But I can see how one ... could make that airplane mistake.
WILLOW I, I can't walk any more. I need to rest.
XANDER It can't be much further.
WILLOW You said that an hour ago. I just ... that spell took a lot out of me.
XANDER As for example, snakes? How come you didn't tell us how much-
WILLOW No. Not now.
XANDER What were we into back there, Will?
WILLOW It doesn't matter anyway.
XANDER Do not get all avoidy on me.
WILLOW I'm not avoidy, I just ... we have bigger problems. Demons?
XANDER Demons! Ah. There's something you don't see every day. Unless you're us.
WILLOW Yeah, and now we're lost, so can we - What's that?
XANDER See? Avoidy.
WILLOW Over there, that-that light.
XANDER That one moving towards us?
XANDER Incredibly fast?
WILLOW Hello?
XANDER Hello? We're being hunted, and you're hello-ing a strange fast-moving light in the dark? It could be anything.
XANDER It's a motorcycle headlight.
WILLOW No, too small.
XANDER Stay behind me.
WILLOW Xander, I don't-
XANDER Stay down. I'll take care of this.
WILLOW Xander, it's-
XANDER A bug! A big fiery bug!
WILLOW Xander-
XANDER Get off! Do fireflies bite? No, they probably burn, don't they? They - yaa!
WILLOW Xander, it's not a bug. It's Tara.
WILLOW Come on.
XANDER And how long have you known that your girlfriend's Tinkerbell?
HOMEOWNER What are you doing?
HOMEOWNER Get away from there!
HOMEOWNER Do you hear me? I said get off my property!
HOMEOWNER Leave us alone. Get outta here!
SPIKE Get back.
DAWN I-it looks like they're just ... wrecking stuff. No thought other than just destruct-o-rama.
DAWN What?
SPIKE Uh, oh, nothing, just, uh ... looked like fun. I'm just sayin'. Yeah, it's just ... with this kind of frolicking going on all around town, we're not gonna get very far without...
SPIKE Let's fly, pigeon!
ANYA Already been looted, sorry! Uh, try the appliance store down the block, they've got great toasters.
XANDER Anya!
ANYA Xander?
ANYA I knew you weren't dead.
XANDER Wow, then why was I so worried?
TARA Are you-
WILLOW Uh, not yet. But, but I will be.
WILLOW Where's Dawn and Spike?
TARA We've been calling the house, but-
XANDER Maybe they're on their way here. I mean, this place is NORAD, and we are at DefCon One.
XANDER Okay, I so need male friends.
WILLOW We have to go out and look for them.
XANDER There's this guy at work I kind of hit it off with. Tito. I mean, he seems like a good...
XANDER You were talking about Dawn and Spike, of course.
ANYA Um, question. You want us to go back out there?
WILLOW Well, yeah. Uh, unless somebody's got a better idea.
ANYA Well, um, it's just ... we're minus a Buffybot. And, uh, Spike is missing in action somewhere with Dawn, and Giles flew away, and, uh, well you, you're looking a little magicked-out.
XANDER Ahn honey, we're nearing your point, right?
ANYA It's just, how are we supposed to fight these guys? I mean, we can take a vampire or two, sure, but there's a whole cavalcade of demons out there ... I mean, I think this, you know ... it, it takes, um ... I mean, I ... we need...
XANDER Buffy.
ANYA Buffy.
WILLOW Buffy...
WILLOW ...is not coming back. We failed.
WILLOW So ... we're it, gang. Xander, grab the weapons. We're gonna look for Dawn and Spike.
TARA If we're gonna go, we should go now, they're just getting more and more worked up by the moment.
XANDER Well, they can't keep it up forever. I mean, maybe they'll party themselves out, you know, tire of this place and move on.
RAZOR Say hello to your new home, boys.
RAZOR This here is a momentous occasion, the beginning of a new era.
RAZOR Now, no question, the open backroads and highways have been good to us. But we've got ourselves a juicy little burg here, just ripe for the picking. And I ain't in no hurry to leave it, you?
RAZOR So I figure, what better way to kick off our ... semi-settling-down, than with a little christening?
RAZOR A symbolic act commemorating the new order around here ... and ridding ourselves of any not-so-pleasant reminders of the old.
RAZOR All in one quick, really, *really* violent fell swoop.
RAZOR Gentlemen, start your engines.
RAZOR Bye-bye, slayer!
BUFFY No!
RAZOR Another one for the fire, boys.
RAZOR Tear it up.
DEMON Sorry. Sorry.
TARA It wasn't your fault. We, we don't know if the spell would have worked, even if the demons hadn't-
WILLOW It would have worked.
TARA Well ... maybe...
WILLOW What?
TARA Maybe it wasn't supposed to. I mean, those demons showing up at the exact wrong time? Maybe we really were in over our heads. Invoking forces that we have no right to. Maybe the fates sent down all that destruction on us to stop us. I mean...
WILLOW You mean, maybe it was my fault.
TARA No. No.
ANYA I'm not saying we announce it this second.
XANDER Anya!
ANYA Well, I think it would please them to know we're engaged. And I think Willow in particular could use a real morale-booster right now.
XANDER Can we talk about this later?
ANYA Well, but it's just all the excuses for not telling everyone we're engaged are gone now. I mean, aside from hell bikers, there's nothing standing in our way. This is it. No more surprises.
XANDER Watch it!
ANYA It ... it's the Buffy Bot.
XANDER Ah, peachy. No doubt to lead the wild bunch right to us again. Hey Will, next time this thing's damaged, couldn't ya program it to find the nearest Radio Shack, or...
WILLOW Buffy?
WILLOW Buffy!
XANDER Buffy!
WILLOW Buffy!
ANYA Where is she?
WILLOW Buffy? Buffy, are you...
WILLOW It's Willow. Can you hear me?
ANYA What's wrong with her?
WILLOW Nothing! She - she's ... she's in shock.
TARA Her hands are bleeding. Her fingers.
ANYA Oh, she's filthy.
XANDER Oh no.
WILLOW What?
XANDER No. How could we ... so stupid!
WILLOW Xander!
XANDER Our spell. Our resurrection spell worked like a magic charm. We brought you back to life, Buffy. Right where we left her.
WILLOW Oh god.
XANDER In her coffin.
TARA She had to ... dig out of her own grave.
XANDER Buffy.
XANDER Buffy, it's Xander.
XANDER We're sorry. We didn't know.
XANDER Buffy.
TARA You aren't reaching her, she's too traumatized.
ANYA Hey, Buffy. Uh, here's some good news that might perk you right up. Uh, Xander and I have an announcement.
XANDER Anya!
ANYA What? Just trying to help.
XANDER Buffy .... it's gonna be all right. We brought you back. You're home now.
XANDER Yeah, that's it. You're home.
RAZOR Yeah, welcome home, Slayer.
RAZOR Alive and kickin' after all!
RAZOR Well, alive, anyway.
RAZOR Not looking too good, though, is she?
XANDER I don't see you winning too many beauty contests.
XANDER ...unless the Miss My Face Fell Off pageant gets going.
RAZOR Big axe you got there.
XANDER The better to cut you down to size, grandma.
TARA Incindere.
RAZOR Ah. So you got a witch in the mix.
TARA More than one.
XANDER I happen to be a very powerful man-witch myself. Or ... male... Is it a warlock?
XANDER Warlock.
ANYA Plus, we have a Slayer here, uh, who might actually be looking to eat some brains, so, I think a little quiet moseying, no hard feelings, and I'm sure your demon horde won't think any the less of you.
RAZOR Now, my boys, see, that's tricky. They came looking for a massacre...
RAZOR ...and I think you got exactly enough magic between you for a kiddie birthday party.
WILLOW Then you'd be wrong.
RAZOR Whoa. Well, I better back off, or you might, what? Pull a rabbit out of a hat?
ANYA Don't, don't do that! Why would she do that?
WILLOW We don't want trouble ... you don't want trouble.
RAZOR Of course we want trouble, we're demons. We're really all about trouble.
WILLOW Not this kind.
RAZOR Oh. I get your point.
RAZOR Now let me tell you something, children. We're not gonna fight you. We're just gonna hold you down and enjoy ourselves for a few hours.
RAZOR You might even live through it. Except that certain of my boys got some...
RAZOR ...anatomical incompatibilities that, uh, tend to tear up little girls. So, who wants to go first?
RAZOR I was really hoping it'd be you.
ANYA Does this mean we win?
DAWN There. What's that?
SPIKE It's just a machine, Dawn.
DAWN I know.
BUFFYBOT Dawn. You're my sister Dawn.
BUFFYBOT Where did I go?
DAWN What?
BUFFYBOT Where did I go? I was here. Here. But then I ran away.
DAWN I-I don't...
BUFFYBOT No. Not me. The other Buffy.
BUFFYBOT Yes. The other Buffy.
DAWN Buffy?
BUFFYBOT I don't ... I don't ... know where she ran off to. Maybe-
SPIKE Tsk. Look what those filthy buggers done to you. Willow's slap-and-paste job's not gonna do the trick this time. Robot's done.
SPIKE Hey. Little bit? Dawn!
SPIKE Dawn!
TARA Well, they wanted a massacre.
XANDER She's Buffy. She's herself again. You're back, Buffy, you really are.
XANDER Whoa. Whoa.
WILLOW Buffy!
ANYA Where's she going?
TARA Should we follow her?
WILLOW I don't know.
XANDER She just ... needs some time is all.
XANDER The important thing is that she's back. She'll be fine.
ANYA Xander, look out!
RAZOR Now what kind of Slayer is it runs out on her buddies just when they need her the most?
WILLOW Obfuscate.
WILLOW Fragilis.
RAZOR So, witch, got a little power after all. Well, let's see what tricks you can manage while I choke the life outta-
WILLOW Tara!
TARA Nobody messes with my girl.
XANDER Tara, nice axing.
TARA My first.
WILLOW Buffy.
DAWN Buffy, no.
BUFFY Dawnie, I have to.
DAWN Buffy?
DAWN Buffy...
DAWN Buffy ... how....
DAWN Is it you? I mean really?
DAWN What are you do-
DAWN No!
DAWN Don't!
DAWN Don't jump, Buffy, don't move! Just walk to me. Please!
DAWN Please?
DAWN I'm your sister. Dawn. We were up here ... together, and then ... you went away. And you don't wanna do that again. I don't know how you're back, but you are, and please, just stay still.
DAWN Or-or move. But-but towards me. Because the tower was built by crazy people and I don't think it's holding up very well.
DANW Talk to me. Say something!
BUFFY Is ... this hell?
DAWN What?
BUFFY Is this hell?
DAWN No! Buffy, no! You're here ... with me. Whatever happened to you, whatever you've been through, it's ... it's over now. You're-
DAWN We have to get off this tower!
BUFFY It was so ... clear ... on this spot. I remember ... how ... shiny ... and clear everything was. But ... now ... now...
DAWN Buffy ... please ... listen to me.
DAWN You told me I had to be strong ... and I've tried. But it's been so hard without you.
DAWN I'm sorry. I promise I'll do better, I will! If you're with me. Stay with me ... please. I need you to live. Live! For-
DAWN Buffy!
BUFFY Dawn.
DAWN Buffy!
BUFFY Dawn!
DAWN Buffy?
DAWN Buffy. You ... you ... ...you're really here.
DAWN You're alive, and you're home. You're home.
