XANDER Anya! What's wrong with you?
ANYA First you, you give me this beautiful ring, and then I can't wear it in public. I mean, don't you wanna get married?
XANDER Yes.
DAWN Come on, Tara. I am so old enough to do research.
BUFFY You do research now? Want a cappuccino and a pack of cigarettes to go with it?Dawn and Buffy in their house.
DAWN Why should I care about any of this?
BUFFY Because they'll take you away! If I can't make you go to school ... then I won't be found fit to be your legal guardian.
WILLOW Since you've ... been back, you haven't exactly been big with the whole range of human emotions thing.Spike and Buffy in the house.
SPIKE I know you'll never love me. But you treat me like a man.
ANYA Um, everything on this table's half off. Including the table.
ANYA Buy one eyeball, get the second one free!
XANDER Arrr! Careful, me mateys! These be fireflies spat from a volcano off the coast of Katmandu. Arr!
LITTLE_BOY You're not a real pirate! Real pirates live on boats and don't look stupid!
XANDER Oh, a salty swabbie! Maybe you be fishin' for the taste ... of me hook!
GILES Uh, hello, Ahab, a little help please?
XANDER Arr, and help ye shall have, arr!
DAWN So what are you supposed to be?
ANYA An angel.
DAWN Oh. Shouldn't you have wings?
ANYA Oh no, this is a special kind of angel called a Charlie. We don't have wings, we just skate around with perfect hair fighting crime. Where's your costume?
DAWN Like I'm six years old? Halloween's so lame.
ANYA But you get to dress up, and play games! Xander's gonna teach me a new one after work called Shiver Me Timbers. Ever play?
TARA Uh, Dawn, Willow could use some help in magical texts.
DAWN I'm all over it.
ANYA How 'bout you, ever play Shiver Me Timbers?
TARA I'm not really much for the timber.
WILLOW I'm just saying you might wanna rethink the stereotype before someone turns *you* into a toad.
WILLOW And while you're at it, why don't you try removing that broomstick from your-
WILLOW Dawn!
DAWN Hey. Don't stop the invective on account of me.
WILLOW If I see one more idiot that thinks witches are all hairy moles and rotted teeth-
WITCHY-POO Excuse me, do you have any candy corn?
WILLOW Oh, look at you! You are just the cutest thing!
DAWN I-I thought you said-
WILLOW I know, but look, with the hat, and the, the wart! Oh! Let's go fill your tummy up with sugary niblets, okay?
ANYA Buffy!
ANYA We're running low on mandrake root. Check the basement.
BUFFY Don't blame me if we have this conversation over and over...
BUFFY ...and over ... and over, and over.
BUFFY Oh!
BUFFY Bell. Neck. Look into it.
SPIKE Come with a nice leather collar, does it?
BUFFY What are you doing lurking down here?
SPIKE Came through the tunnels. Running low on burba weed. Stir it in with the blood. Makes it all hot 'n spicy.
SPIKE What? I was gonna pay for it.
SPIKE I mean, no. I was gonna nick it, 'cause that's what I do. I go where I please and I take what I want, and what's your excuse anyway? I thought you'd had it to the brim with customer disservice.
BUFFY One-time deal to help out. And I mean straight time. No loop-de-loop mummy hand repeat-o-vision.
BUFFY Where's the mandrake root?
SPIKE Um ... here. Only three to a jar. Tend to ... go a bit wonky if you cram them too close.
BUFFY Thanks.
SPIKE Feel like a bit of the rough and tumble?
BUFFY What?
SPIKE Me ... you...
SPIKE Patrolling? Hello?
BUFFY Oh. Uh ... I ... should stay. Maybe tomorrow.
SPIKE It's not like I don't already have plans.
BUFFY So much easier to talk to when he wanted to kill me.
ANYA Ooh! Go help Giles.
BUFFY What happened to Xander?
GILES He kept poking me with his hook. I sent him over to charmed objects. With any luck he'll poke the wrong one and end up in an alternative dimension inhabited by a 50-foot Giles that squishes annoying teeny pirates.
GILES We've got a ton of bagging to do here.
BUFFY Actually, Spike had a really good idea. You know, maybe I should patrol.
GILES Buffy, you've been patrolling every night this week. Besides, it's Halloween, it's the one time of the year that supernatural threats give it a well-deserved rest. As should you.
BUFFY Yeah, what about costumes that take over your personality? Or, wee little Irish fear-demon-y thingies?
GILES Yes, well, if anything calamitous should happen, history suggests it'll happen to one of us.
BUFFY Right, exactly, so I should patrol to avoid any of that- and I'm bagging.
KALTENBACH Da da da da da-da da da, happy Halloween.
KALTENBACH Ha ha! Give you ... something ... special this year.
DAWN Come again!
DAWN Uhh! In a zillion years.
XANDER Store go boom. Arr.
ANYA That was the most incredible thing I have ever experienced.
ANYA Except for that.
ANYA What you all did for me tonight ... the astounding heaps of money you helped me- ...us acquire. All I can say is, I hope we make as much tomorrow.
BUFFY Tomorrow?
ANYA Oh, post-holiday clearance. The cornerstone of retail.
GILES Brooms all around, then.
WILLOW Or I could whip up a jaunty self-cleaning incantation, it'll be like
GILES We all know how splendidly that turned out for Mickey.
WILLOW I think I'm a little more adept than a cartoon mouse.
TARA And you have more fingers, which is good, 'cause... ...there's no need to wear those big white gloves to overcompensate.
BUFFY You know, if you had a real peg leg, you wouldn't just have a lame costume, you'd actually be lame. Which is completely different.
DAWN You do this every night?
ANYA Every time I close out the cash register. The dance of capitalist superiority.
XANDER I'm gonna marry that girl.
BUFFY What?! She's fifteen and my sister, so don't ev- Oh.
XANDER Hey, everybody. Can I, um ... uh ... there's something Anya and I ... wanna tell you.
ANYA Now?
XANDER Now.
XANDER We're getting married.
DAWN Oh my god.
TARA Congratulations!
WILLOW That ... that's ... wow.
XANDER It's a big wow.
ANYA I ... I thought you were waiting for the right moment.
XANDER I did.
ANYA Here, have some money!
BUFFY Did you know about this?
GILES No. Unless I blocked it from my memory, much as I will Xander's vigorous use of his tongue.
BUFFY Is that why you're always cleaning your glasses? So you don't have to see what we're doing?
GILES Tell no one.
BUFFY Giles, this is...
BUFFY ...we have to do something.
ANYA And he said he couldn't imagine the rest of his life without me, and then he gave me this!
XANDER Which I'll be paying for the rest of my life.
DAWN Can I try it on?
ANYA Oh, absolutely not.
GILES Where I come from, this sort of thing requires much in the way of libation.
XANDER God save the queen!
BUFFY Sorry we couldn't do the big fancy. You kinda caught us with our parties down.
ANYA Oh, that's okay. This is just the first premarital celebration. There'll be lots more. With gifts.
TARA Sure, maybe we'll even have time to decorate for the next one.
WILLOW Why wait?
ANYA This is so much better than the way it usually looks. Thank you.
TARA The grocery store's still open, we ... could've bought decorations there.
WILLOW Why bother? These are perfect. And extra biodegradable-y. In a couple of hours, poof!
TARA No, they're, they're great, it's just ... why use magic when you can do something naturally?
WILLOW Well, you can fight monsters naturally, with sticks and stones. Don't recommend it though.
TARA It's different.
WILLOW How?
TARA Becau- Because you're protecting people. Keeping them from being hurt.
WILLOW Which makes them happy. Like pretty decorations made Anya happy.
TARA That's not the point, Will.
WILLOW Why are you being like this?
TARA This isn't about me!
WILLOW This is so about you. You're always coming down on me for, for doing magic that couldn't harm a fly. What's your problem?
TARA Willow, I j-just wish that you would stop and think about what you're-
DAWN Sorry. Just checkin' on the chips.
WILLOW It's okay. We're done.
BUFFY You're getting married! You!
XANDER Me. Choking.
BUFFY Oh, sorry. I just, I can't believe it. Seems like only yesterday you had to pay a girl to date you.
XANDER Like I'd ever pay. Define 'date.'
BUFFY I was only out of commission for three months. How many other things have changed since I've been away?
DAWN Ooh, I got a tattoo!
BUFFY What?!
WILLOW Which is why we told her no.
DAWN Just a little one?
BUFFY Over my dead body. The kind that doesn't come back.
DAWN Fine. Congratulations.
DAWN You're very lucky. Finding a guy like him.
XANDER Not as lucky as me.
DAWN See you guys tomorrow?
BUFFY Whoa! Tomorrow?
DAWN Yeah. I'm sleeping over at Janice's, remember?
BUFFY That's tonight?
DAWN No. It's on the other Halloween. Come on, you said I could.
BUFFY Uh ... Well ... I know I did, it's just, you know, now with Xander's party, I-
XANDER Ah, we're good. But you have to get us some extra gifts for our reception.
ANYA Yes please.
BUFFY I-I don't know. Giles?
GILES Uh, it's really not up to me.
DAWN Come on. It's four blocks away, I'll walk straight over. Not like I'm gonna be roaming the streets. Please?
DAWN Hello?
GUY Hey!
DAWN Ooh!
GIRL Perv.
DAWN Sorry. I thought-
JANICE Hey Summers. Did you get over the wall okay?
DAWN Yeah. My sister thinks I'm staying at your house.
JANICE Ahh. The Mominator thinks I'm staying at yours. Can't believe they fell for that one, like, own a TV.
DAWN So where're we meeting?
JANICE The park. That's where all the monsters gather on Halloween.
ZACK Woohoo!
ZACK To infinity and- ow!
JUSTIN Oops.
JANICE Nice shot.
ZACK Hey baby.
JANICE Hey.
ZACK What took you so long?
JANICE Ah, we stopped for crimes and misdemeanors. Zack, this is my friend Dawn I was telling you about.
ZACK Hel-loooo.
ZACK Ow.
JUSTIN Hey. Justin.
DAWN I know. I've seen you around at a couple of parties.
JUSTIN I've seen you too.
BOY Hey, we'll catch you guys later.
ZACK Alone at last.
JANICE So! What do you guys wanna do?
ZACK Yeah, three points! Woo!
DAWN Uh, witches don't really look like that.
JUSTIN You got a lot of witch friends?
DAWN No! I mean, from stuff ... that I've read ... and stuff. Um, some of them are supposed to be really pretty, and you don't wanna get them mad-
ZACK New target, come on!
JUSTIN Woo-hoo!
JANICE So?
DAWN He's okay.
JANICE Ho-hum okay, or like ... 'oh my god I think I'm gonna pee my pants' okay?
DAWN Pee.
ZACK So what's the verdict, cap'n? Is little Justin in love?
JUSTIN I don't know. She's cute.
ZACK Well, congratulations for having eyeballs. But what about, uh, you know, going all the way? Do you think-
ZACK ...that the moon and the stars look lovely tonight?
JANICE Hey, you think when we're done with this juvie crap maybe we can do something else? I'm gettin' kinda bored.
ZACK Just one more.
GILES Anya is a wonderful former vengeance demon, I'm sure you'll spend ... many years of ... non-hell-dimensional bliss.
GILES Is she moving in with you?
XANDER Um...
GILES You know, with your combined incomes, you might think about a down payment on a house.
XANDER Like the kind you *live* in?
GILES No rush. I'm sure you have plenty to think about with the arrangements for the wedding and so on. You've got the rest of your lives to plan the rest of your lives.
XANDER Yeah, yeah.
JANICE No way.
JANICE You know who lives there?
JUSTIN Old man Kaltenbach.
ZACK Crusty old bastard.
DAWN Isn't he supposed to be ... mental or something?
ZACK Total looney-tunes. Pumpkins...
ZACK Very dangerous.
ZACK You go first.
JANICE Wha - huh - screw that!
ZACK Come on, show us how brave you are. Let's see those cute little girlie guts.
JUSTIN Hey, lay off, man. If she doesn't wanna-
DAWN I'll do it.
ZACK Go Dawn!
JUSTIN Look. You don't have to do this.
DAWN It's okay. I want to.
KALTENBACH Shouldn't oughta mess with those. Sometimes they bite.
JUSTIN Get away from her!
ZACK Don't make me go kung-fu on you, man!
KALTENBACH Come on inside, kids, got somethin' special for ya.
KALTENBACH Daddy's got a treat!
ZACK Cool.
JANICE No no no. We are so not going in there. Dawn, tell them!
ZACK Dude, where'd you get the cool toys?
KALTENBACH Used to design 'em back in '58. Nothing would give me more pleasure ... than to see a child's face... light up when he'd open one of mine ... on a Christmas or a birthday. I was good. Jeepers, I was the best.
KALTENBACH And then that thing happened. One little mistake ... and they took it all away from me, they... they took my toys.
KALTENBACH Time for the treats! Who wants to help Daddy in the kitchen? How 'bout you, Sally?
JUSTIN Uh, Sally's not much for the cookin'. Why don't I give you a hand.
KALTENBACH Hands are good. Always use more hands. More hands.
JANICE Okay, I say we get the funk out of here before Satan Claus tries to stuff us up the chimney.
ZACK What, and miss the big treat? That would break the old guy's little heart! Assuming it's still beating.
DAWN She's right, we should just get Justin and go.
ZACK Come on, the dude's a thousand years old. What's he gonna do, drown us in his drool cup?
DAWN Hey. Where's its head?
JUSTIN Boo.
JANICE What the hell was that?
DAWN Justin?
DAWN Justin?
JUSTIN Let's go.
DAWN Wh-what happened?
JUSTIN I swiped his wallet when he wasn't looking. Come on!
DAWN Oh my god. Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
JUSTIN Dude, that guy was rank.
ZACK Bet a spritz of Dawn would wash that right out. So what do you think? Lunchables? Or should we go all the way and turn 'em?
ANYA So I was thinking maybe a June wedding. But then I remembered that they always had the highest percentage of calls for vengeance.
ANYA So now I'm leaning towards as soon as damn possible. I mean, mortal life being so short, we gotta get in as much marital bliss as we can before we wither and die.
ANYA I mean, there's just so much to consider, though, I mean, planning the wedding, and, and new cars, house and babies. You *have* to plan for babies, or they just run roughshod over your entire existence.
XANDER Yeah, y...you gotta know what to call 'em before they hit college.
GILES Ah. Rupert is an exceptionally strong name.
ANYA Ha ha ha! Yeah, if we want our progeny to eat paste and have their lunch money stolen.
BUFFY Look, all that matters is that they're happy. Everything else is thick gravy goodness.
ANYA I know.
ANYA I mean, I am the luckiest ex-demon in the world. I mean, to be able to find the one person in all dimensions that I was meant to be with, and have everything work out exactly as I dreamed. I mean, how often does the universe allow that to happen?
XANDER Air. Sweet mother oxygen.
BUFFY You okay?
XANDER Yeah. I just ... it's just, I didn't think it would be so much.
BUFFY But this is good. I mean, this is ... love and celebration and moving forward. Anya's right. This is the way life's supposed to work out.
XANDER Right. Deep pools of ooey delight. I'm wallowing, not drowning.
BUFFY Definite wallow action.
XANDER Okay. So, once more into the breach?
BUFFY Oh. I think my breaches are wearing a little thin. I'm gonna take Spike up on that offer to patrol. Gotta be something out there cruisin' for a smackdown.
JUSTIN So you're like, what, a sophomore?
DAWN I wish.
JUSTIN Uhhh, freshman.
DAWN Yep, way down there at the bottom of the rung. Actually? Kinda under those little rubber feet they use to keep the ladder steady.
JUSTIN Hey, those are important. Here. The spoils of war. You earned it.
DAWN I did?
JUSTIN Yeah, for keepin' me steady.
JUSTIN And so begins your life of crime.
DAWN Hmm. You're a little late. I steal all the time.
JUSTIN Really.
DAWN Totally. I haven't paid for lipstick since ... forever.
JUSTIN Oh, be still my heart, cute *and* bad.
DAWN Yeah, bad to the bone.
JUSTIN More like frozen! Here.
DAWN Thanks.
JUSTIN My pleasure, Miss Summers.
JANICE Hey. Where's Zack?
JUSTIN He went to get the car.
DAWN You guys got a car?
ZACK Thanks for the ride!
PARAMEDIC_1 I'm losing her pulse.
PARAMEDIC_2 Let's get her in!
GILES Summers residence. ... Oh, Mrs. Penshaw, yes, uh ... No, Dawn said she was staying the night at your house. Well, ye-yes, I realize that now, but I don't believe that you called to check all right, le-let's just, um, if I, if I hear anything I'll let you know.
WILLOW Hey, we were just gettin' our dance on.
GILES That was Janice's mother on the telephone. Apparently Janice said that she was staying here tonight.
XANDER Ahh, they're dipping into the classics. You gotta respect that.
GILES Is Buffy still outside?
XANDER Uh, no, no, she was gettin' antsy, she went to find Spike to patrol.
GILES Well, it's nice to be kept in the loop. Um ... Xander, Anya, you stay here in case Mrs. Penshaw calls again. Willow, Tara, you check downtown. I'll, uh, swing by Spike's, see if I can catch Buffy.
ZACK Don't do nothing I would, dude.
JANICE You're it.
ZACK I love it when they run.
DAWN So.
JUSTIN Yeah.
DAWN Ooh. It's cold. You okay? You want this back?
JUSTIN Nah. Cold doesn't really bother me.
DAWN What are you, Superman?
JUSTIN No, but ... I do have a few special powers.
DAWN Hey ... um ... does this work?
JUSTIN You gotta ... turn the ignition.
DAWN I love this one.
JUSTIN Another thing we have in common.
JUSTIN You're shaking.
DAWN It's cold.
JUSTIN You ... wanna go?
DAWN N-no. It's just, um ... what do you expect-
JUSTIN Shhh. I just wanna taste you.
DAWN Shiver me timbers.
JUSTIN What?
DAWN Um ... nothing. Just ... wow.
JUSTIN Oh, my god. That was your first.
DAWN What? No.
JUSTIN It was! That was your first kiss.
DAWN I've been kissed before. I, I kiss all the time. Not that I'm a kiss slut. Just, you know, with, with the lips and, and the pressing together and stuff? Big expert here.
DAWN Okay, okay, it was my first kiss. I know, I know, I suck, my ... my lips are dry and my tongue's all horrible and sticky and I'm pretty sure I drooled on you ... so just please tell me how awful it was.
JUSTIN It was perfect.
WILLOW Do they know they're brother and sister?
TARA Do you think she's here?
WILLOW What?
TARA Do you think Dawn might have come here?
WILLOW It's where I'd be if I were fifteen and on the lam.
TARA Really?
WILLOW Well, not me at fifteen, 'cause, hello, spaz.
TARA You?
WILLOW Yeah. Hard to believe such a hot mama-yama came from humble, geek-infested roots?
TARA Infested roots, trying to turn me on?
WILLOW I have to try now?
WILLOW Come on, let's look over here.
TARA Do you see her?
WILLOW No, there's too many people.
TARA Maybe we can have security-
WILLOW No, that'll take too long.
WILLOW One among many, many fade to one-
TARA What are you doing? Will?
WILLOW I'm just gonna clear the crowd.
TARA How?
WILLOW I'll just shift everyone who isn't a fifteen-year-old girl into an alternate dimension.
TARA What?
WILLOW No, it'll be for like a fraction of a second. They won't even notice.
TARA Will, no, you can't!
WILLOW Why?
TARA Well, what if something went wrong?
WILLOW Well, it won't!
TARA But w-what would Giles say?
WILLOW Are you taking his side now?
TARA This isn't about sides.
WILLOW You two have been talking about me behind my back.
TARA No! God.
WILLOW You know how that makes me feel?
TARA Willow, you are using too much magic. What do you want me to do, just, just sit back and keep my mouth shut?
WILLOW Well, that'd be a good start.
TARA If I didn't love you so damn much I would!
WILLOW Tara!
DAWN Ow!
JUSTIN Sorry.
DAWN It's okay. Long as it's not bleeding.
DAWN Justin ... could we...
JUSTIN It's just ... God, you are so beautiful.
BUFFY Get your gear together. We need to...
BUFFY Spike?
SPIKE You know...
SPIKE ...in civilized cultures, that's called trespassing.
BUFFY Good thing you're uncivilized. We got trouble.
SPIKE Giles found you?
BUFFY Giles? No. Was he looking for me?
SPIKE Yeah, it's Dawn.
BUFFY Dawn? Why, what happened?
SPIKE No, it's okay, Giles was by here earlier looking for you. Dawn and her little friend pulled a Houdini. Up to a bit of candy-corn mischief, I suspect.
BUFFY Wait, she's out there running around by herself?
SPIKE Yeah, kids these days, eh?
SPIKE I did a sweep of the tunnels, Giles is poking about the cemetery.
BUFFY We have to find her.
SPIKE I don't think she's in there.
GILES Mist ... cemetery ... Halloween. Should end well.
GILES Bloody brilliant.
GILES Dawn!
GILES Dawn, are you all right?
GILES Janice?
JANICE He bit me. That jerk bit me!
ZACK Like you weren't asking for it.
GILES I feel certain she wasn't.
ZACK What do you know about it, grandpa?
GILES Quite a bit actually.
ZACK Dude, that sucks.
GILES Dawn. Where's Dawn?
JUSTIN Dawn!
DAWN Get off me!
JUSTIN Dawn, wait! Wait!
JUSTIN I thought we could, you know, like hang out or something.
DAWN Hang out?
JUSTIN Yeah. I mean ... you're not like other girls. You're different. There's something special about you. I knew it the first time I saw you.
JUSTIN I just wanna be close to you.
JUSTIN Shh. It's okay. It'll only hurt for a second.
GILES I bet you say that to all the girls.
DAWN Giles?
GILES Now, you have a choice, son. We can do this the easy way, or we can do this the ha-
JUSTIN What were my choices again?
SPIKE So. This a private game, or, uh, can anyone join in?
BUFFY Dawn, are you...
BUFFY Were you parking?! With a vamp?
DAWN I-I didn't know he was dead!
JUSTIN Living dead.
DAWN Shut up!
BUFFY How could you not know?
DAWN I just met him!
BUFFY Oh! Oh, so you were parking in the woods with a boy you just met.
JUSTIN We've seen each other at parties.
BUFFY Shut up. I don't believe you!
DAWN Oh, like you've never fallen for a vampire?
BUFFY That was different.
DAWN It always is when it's you.
VAMP_1 Uh, excuse me! Can we fight now?
BUFFY Hey, didn't anyone come here to just make out?
BUFFY Aw, that's sweet. You run.
BUFFY You scream.
VAMP_2 Die, slayer!
BUFFY Mm-hmm.
JUSTIN Your sister's the slayer? I totally get it! I knew there was something about you.
BUFFY Giles!
VAMP_1 What is your malfunction, man?!
SPIKE It's Halloween, you nit! We take the night off. Those are the rules.
VAMP_1 Me and mine don't follow no stinkin' rules! We're rebels!
SPIKE No. I'm a rebel. You're an idiot.
SPIKE Give the lot of us a bad name.
JUSTIN Trick or treat.
JUSTIN Give me something good to eat.
DAWN I thought you really liked me.
JUSTIN I do. And you like me too.
DAWN I do.
BUFFY Sorry about the party.
XANDER Aah, don't worry about it.
ANYA It gave me more time to plan the bridal shower. Where do we order obscenely muscular male strippers?
XANDER Anya.
ANYA Well, I'm kidding, geez.
SPIKE Guess I should bugger off. Something about big bads not venturing far from their crypts on Halloween.
BUFFY Good fight.
WILLOW So, uh, big monster mashing? Sorry we missed it.
TARA As long as Dawn's all right.
WILLOW Yeah, that's what's-
TARA I, I think I'm gonna turn in. Good night.
WILLOW Tara ... Tara.
BUFFY How's your face?
GILES Oh, still ruggedly handsome. 'Grandpa,' indeed. Ow.
BUFFY She's taking it pretty hard.
GILES Well, it's not surprising. Still, we can't ignore this kind of behavior. Something needs to be done before it spins out of control.
BUFFY You're right. I'm glad you're here to take care of it. Don't ... be too hard on her, okay?
GILES We need to have a conversation.
DAWN This the part where you tell me you're not angry ... just disappointed?
GILES Pretty much. Except for the bit about not being angry.
WILLOW I, I'm sorry, okay?
TARA It's not that easy.
WILLOW Well, what do you want me to do? Reverse time and take it back? 'Cause I could probably-
WILLOW Joke. I don't think I could really-
TARA You know what, can, can we not do this now? I'm tired.
WILLOW Okay. Let's just forget it ever happened.
WILLOW Forget.
TARA Ooh, your feet are cold.
WILLOW Better warm me up.
TARA Mmm.
TARA This is how every day should always end ... and start. And all the stuff in the middle.
WILLOW So, uh ... you're not mad?
TARA 'Bout what?
