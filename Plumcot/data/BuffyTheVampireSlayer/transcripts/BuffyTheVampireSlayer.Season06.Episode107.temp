GILES_VOICEOVER Previously on
SPIKE I love you.
BUFFY Oh my god.
WILLOW Here lies the warrior of the people. Let her cross over.
BUFFY I think I was in heaven. I was torn out of there, by my friends. They can never know.
GILES We can't ignore this kind of behavior.
GILES Something needs to be done before it spins out of control.
BUFFY I'm glad you're here to take care of it.
XANDER We're getting married.
TARA Congratulations.
TARA Willow, you are using too much magic.
TARA Can we not do this now?
WILLOW Just ... forget it ever happened.
WILLOW Forget.
Song Alive
GILES Good morning, Buffy!
WILLOW Oh, hey, did Dawn get off to school all right?
BUFFY What? Oh, uh, yeah. I think so.
XANDER Respect the cruller. And tame the donut!
ANYA That's still funny, sweetie.
BUFFY So, uh, no research? Nothing going on? Monsters or whatnot?
BUFFY Good! Good. Uh, so, did anybody ... uh ... last night, you know, did anybody, um ... burst into song?
XANDER Merciful Zeus!
WILLOW We thought it was just us!
GILES Well, I sang but I had my guitar at the hotel...
TARA It was bizarre. We were talking and then it was like-
BUFFY Like you were in a musical!
TARA Yeah!
GILES That would explain the huge backing orchestra I couldn't see and the synchronized dancing from the room service chaps.
WILLOW We did a whole duet about dish washing.
ANYA And we were arguing and, and then everything rhymed and there were harmonies and the dance with coconuts.
WILLOW There was an entire verse about the cous-cous.
XANDER It was very disturbing.
GILES What did you sing about?
BUFFY I don't remember. But i-it seemed perfectly normal.
XANDER But disturbing. And not the natural order of things, and do you think it'll happen again?
GILES I don't know. I should look into it.
WILLOW With the books.
TARA Do we have any books on this?
XANDER Well, we just gotta break it down. Look at the factors before it happens again. Because I for one-
Song I've Got A Theory
XANDER See, okay, that was disturbing.
WILLOW I thought it was neat.
BUFFY So what is it? What's causing it?
GILES I thought it didn't matter.
BUFFY Well, I'm not exactly quaking in my stylish yet affordable boots, but there's definitely something unnatural going on here. And that doesn't usually lead to hugs and puppies.
ANYA Well, is it just us? I mean, is it only happening to us? 'Cause that would probably mean a spell or-
BUFFY It's not just us.
DAWN Oh my god. You will never believe what happened at school today.
BUFFY Everybody started singing and dancing?
DAWN I gave birth to a pterodactyl.
ANYA Oh my god, did it sing?
DAWN So, you guys too, huh?
XANDER So what'd you guys sing about?
DAWN Math.
TARA Tha-That's right! The, the volume. The text.
GILES What text?
WILLOW The volume-y text. You know? The, the report.
XANDER The what now?
TARA Oh, there's just a few volumes back at the house that deal with mystical chants, bacchanals.
TARA It might be relevant.
WILLOW Yeah, we could, um-
GILES Well, I'm a hair's breadth from investigating bunnies at the moment, so I'm open to anything.
WILLOW Great, we'll, uh, go check it out and uh, we'll give you a call.
TARA Yeah, this could blow the whole thing wide open.
TARA Do we have any books at all at home?
WILLOW Well, who wants to be cooped up on a day like this? The sun is shining, there's songs going on...
WILLOW ...those guys are checking you out.
TARA What? Wh-What are they looking at?
WILLOW The hotness of you, doofus.
TARA Those boys really thought I was hot?
WILLOW Entirely.
TARA Oh my god. I'm cured! I want the boys!
WILLOW Do I have to fight to keep you? 'Cause I'm not large with the butch.
TARA I'm just ... not used to that. They-they were really looking at me?
WILLOW And you can't imagine what they see in you.
TARA I know exactly what they see in me. You.
Song I'm Under Your Spell
XANDER I bet they're not even working.
BUFFY Who now?
XANDER Willow and Tara. You see the way they were with each other? The get-a-roominess to them? I bet they're- Singing. They're probably singing right now.
GILES I'm sure Willow and Tara are making every effort.
XANDER Oh, yeah.
BUFFY Xander.
DAWN Buffy, it's okay. I do know about this stuff. Besides, it's all kinda romantic.
BUFFY/XANDER No it's not!
DAWN Come on! Songs, dancing around. What's gonna be wrong with that?
SWEET That's entertainment.
XANDER_VOICEOVER You want some breakfast, baby?
ANYA You don't have to go to work?
XANDER Nah, I shut the crew down for the day. My guys start dancing around me, I don't know if I can deal. It's a flab thing. So, waffles?
ANYA Will you still make me waffles when we're married?
XANDER No, I'll only make them for myself, but by California law, you will own half of them. Hey, how about omelettes? I could do an omelette. I've almost got that-
Song I'll Never Tell
ANYA Look at me! I'm dancing crazy!
XANDER It's a nightmare.
ANYA It has to be stopped.
XANDER It's a plague. It's like a nightmare about a plague.
ANYA It was like we were being watched.
XANDER It's like, I didn't wanna be saying things-
ANYA Like there was a wall missing-
XANDER -but they just kept pouring out.
ANYA -in our apartment.
XANDER And they rhymed and they were mean and
ANYA Like there were only three walls and not a fourth wall and
XANDER My eyes are not beady!
ANYA My toes are not hairy!
XANDER Giles, you've got to stop it.
GILES Well, I am looking into some leads, and I-
ANYA It's just, clearly our number is a retro pastiche that's never going to be a breakaway pop hit.
XANDER Work with me, British man. Give me an axe and show me where to point it.
GILES Well now, Xander, it's not quite that simple. But I have learned about some disturbing things. Basically-
XANDER As in burnt up? Somebody set people on fire? That's nuts!
ANYA I don't know. One more verse of our little ditty and I would've been looking for a gas can.
GILES Well, clearly emotions are running high. But as far as I can tell these people burnt up from the inside, spontaneously combusted. I've only seen the one. I was able to examine the body while the police were taking witness arias.
XANDER Okay, but we're sure that the things are related: the singing and dancing, and burning and dying.
GILES We're not sure of much. Buffy's looking for leads at the local demon haunts, at least ... in theory she is, but ... she doesn't seem to-
XANDER She's easing back into it. We pulled her out of an untold hell dimension. Ergo the weirdness. The important thing is to be there for her.
GILES I'm helping her as much as I can, but, uh...
SPIKE The sun sets and she appears. Come to serenade me?
BUFFY So you know what's going on.
SPIKE Well, I've seen some damn funny things in the last two days. A 600 pound Chirago demon making like Yma Sumac, that one will stay with you. I remain immune, happy to say. Drink?
BUFFY A world of no. So any idea what's causing this?
SPIKE Oh. So that's all. You've just come to pump me for information.
BUFFY What else would I wanna pump you for? I really just said that, didn't I?
SPIKE Yeah, well ... don't wanna bore you with the small talk.
SPIKE Don't know a thing.
BUFFY What's up? You're all bad moody.
SPIKE Nothing. Glad you could stop by.
SPIKE It's nothing.
BUFFY What?
Song Rest In Peace
SPIKE So ... you're not staying then?
TARA Lotta homework?
DAWN Ah, math. It seemed cool when we were singing about it.
TARA Willow said they have a lead on the whole musical extravaganza evil. This demon that can be summoned, some sort of Lord of the Dance. Oh, but not the scary one. Just a demon.
DAWN Um ... do they know who summoned it?
TARA They don't even know its name yet. But Willow will find out. She's the brainy type.
DAWN Hm. I'm glad you guys made up.
TARA What?
DAWN That fight you guys had about magic and stuff? It gives me belly rumblings when you guys fight.
TARA Dawn, Willow and I never fought about-
DAWN It's okay. It's just ... you guys are so great together. I just hate it when you-
DAWN But that was the only fight I've seen you guys have anyway. But I'm still glad it's over.
TARA Dawn, I, um ... there's something I need at the shop. Will you be okay for a little while?
DAWN Yes. The fifteen-year-old can spend a half an hour alone in her locked house.
TARA I-I won't be gone long.
Song That's What It's All About.
DAWN So ... you're like a good demon? Bringing the fun in?
SWEET The Slayer?
DAWN Yuh-huh.
SWEET Find her. Tell her ... tell her everything. Just get her here. I want to see the Slayer burn.
GILES Good. Good.
BUFFY I feel like I should ... bow, or ... have honor or something.
GILES It may seem hokey, but we need to work on precision and concentration as much as power. We're still not sure what we're facing.
BUFFY Oh, you'll figure it out. I'm just worried this whole session's gonna turn into some training montage from an 80's movie.
GILES Ah. Well, if we hear any inspirational power chords, we'll just lie down until they go away. Anyway, I don't think we need to work that much on your strength.
BUFFY Yeah, I'm pretty spry for a corpse.
GILES Have you spoken to Dawn about that incident at Halloween?
BUFFY Oh. I thought you took care of that.
GILES Right.
BUFFY What would I do without you?
BUFFY Okay. I'm ready.
Song Standing In The Way
BUFFY Did you just say something?
Song Wish I Could Stay
SPIKE Lookie lookie what I found.
TARA Is-is this the demon guy?
WILLOW Tara!
SPIKE Works for him. Has a nice little story for the Slayer, don't you? Come on, then. Sing.
MINION My master has the Slayer's sister hostage at the Bronze because she summoned him and at midnight he's going to take her to the underworld to be his queen.
GILES What does he want?
MINION Her.
SPIKE If that's all you've got to say, then-
SPIKE Strong. Someday he'll be a real boy.
BUFFY So. Dawn's in trouble. Must be Tuesday.
TARA I-I just left her for a few minutes.
BUFFY Oh, it's not your fault. So what's the plan?
XANDER Plan, schman. Let's mount up.
GILES No.
ANYA Uh, Dawn may have had the wrong idea in summoning this creature, but ... I've seen some of these underworld child bride deals and, and they never end well. Well, maybe once.
WILLOW We're not just gonna stay here.
GILES Yes we are. Buffy's going alone.
SPIKE Gah! Don't be a stupid git. There is no-
GILES If I want your opinion, Spike, I'll- I'll never want your opinion.
WILLOW A little confusion spell could-
TARA No! I mean, I don't think it'll help.
SPIKE Look, forget them, Slayer. I've got your back.
BUFFY I thought you wanted me to stay away from you. Isn't that what you sang?
XANDER Spike sing a widdle song?
ANYA Would you say it was a breakaway pop hit or more of a book number?
XANDER Let it go, sweetie.
SPIKE Fine. I hope you dance till you burn. You and the little bit.
BUFFY You're really not coming.
GILES It's up to you, Buffy.
BUFFY What do you expect me to do?
GILES Your best.
Song Walk Through The Fire
SWEET I love a good entrance.
BUFFY How are you with death scenes?
BUFFY You got a name?
SWEET I've got a hundred.
BUFFY Well, I ought to know what to call you if you're gonna be my brother-in-law.
DAWN Buffy, I swear I didn't do it.
BUFFY Don't worry. You're not going anywhere. I am.
DAWN What?
BUFFY Deal's this. I can't kill you? You take me to Hellsville in her place.
SWEET What if I kill you?
BUFFY Trust me. Won't help.
SWEET Hm, that's gloomy!
BUFFY That's life.
SWEET Come now, is that really what you feel? Isn't life a miraculous thing?
BUFFY I think you already know.
Song Life
GILES She needs backup. Anya, Tara.
DAWN The hardest thing in this world ... is to live in it.
SWEET Now that was a show-stopping number. Not quite the fireworks that I was looking for.
WILLOW Get out of here.
SWEET Mm, I smell power. I guess the little missus and I should be on our way.
GILES That's never going to happen.
SWEET I don't make the rules. She summoned me.
DAWN I so did not. He keeps saying that.
SWEET You have my talisman on, sweet thing.
DAWN Oh, but, no, I, I, um, uh, this, at, at the Magic Box, on the floor, I was, I was cleaning, and I ... forgot ... but ... I didn't summon anything.
SWEET Well now, that's a twist.
GILES If it was in the shop ... then one of us probably...
ANYA Xander?!
XANDER Well, I didn't know what was gonna happen! I just thought there were gonna be dances and songs. I just wanted to make sure we'd... we'd work out. Get a happy ending.
SWEET I think everything worked out just fine.
XANDER Does this mean that I have to... be your queen?
SWEET It's tempting. But I think we'll waive that clause just this once.
SWEET Big smiles everyone! You beat the bad guy.
Song See You In Hell
Song Where Do We Go From Here?
SPIKE Bugger this.
BUFFY Hey.
SPIKE You should go back inside. Finish the big group sing. Get your kum-ba-yayas out.
BUFFY I don't want to.
SPIKE The day you suss out what you do want, there'll probably be a parade. Seventy-six bloody trombones.
BUFFY Spike...
SPIKE Look, you don't have to say anything.
