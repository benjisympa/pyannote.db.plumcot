GILES_VOICEOVER Previously on
XANDER We're getting married.
BUFFY Did you know about this?
ANYA He couldn't imagine the rest of his life without me. And then he gave me this.
DEMON Ante up.
BUFFY You play for kittens?!
GILES Have you spoken to Dawn about that incident at Halloween?
BUFFY I thought you took care of that.
GILES Right.
BUFFY What would I do without you?
TARA Willow, you are using too much magic. What do you want me to do, just ... sit back and keep my mouth shut?
WILLOW Well, that'd be a good start.
WILLOW Let's just forget it ever happened.
WILLOW Forget.
BUFFY I think I was in heaven. I was torn out of there.
BUFFY Pulled out, by my friends.
SPIKE Can we talk?
BUFFY Vocal-cord-wise, yes. With each other? No.
SPIKE We have to talk.
BUFFY About what?
SPIKE We kissed, Buffy.
BUFFY So?
SPIKE We ... we kissed, you and me. All
BUFFY A spell?
SPIKE Oh, don't get all prim and proper with me.
SPIKE I know what kind of girl you really are. Don't I.
BUFFY What we did is done. But I will never kiss you, Spike. Never touch you ever, *ever* again.
SHARK_DEMON Easy, boys. No need to get physical-like.
SHARK_DEMON Is there, Mister Spike?
BUFFY You know this guy?!
SPIKE Yeah. Whadda you want?
SHARK_DEMON You know me, uh ... there are a lot of things I would like, Mister Spike. A house in Bel Air ... with a generously sized swimming pool ... and of course, the forty Siamese that you owe me.
SPIKE Take it easy, you'll get your kittens.
SHARK_DEMON Oh, I trust you, Mister Spike.
BUFFY Oh god, what is it with you guys? Why kittens? Why can't you just use money like everybody else?
SHARK_DEMON She's funny. I like funny in a girl.
SPIKE I just need a little more time.
SHARK_DEMON Time, time, time! Is what turns kittens into cats! Look, I don't wanna see anyone get hurt. Boys.
BUFFY Then you'd better close your eyes.
VAMP_1 I said she was the Slayer, boss.
SHARK_DEMON Ahh, good for you. The vampire slayer. Have you ever given any thought to, uh, freelance work? A little debt collecting, perhaps?
BUFFY No thank you.
VAMP_1 Boss, he's gone. Spike has split.
SHARK_DEMON Well, that's what I get for socializing. All right, come on, boys, we'll locate Mister Spike and, uh, *talk* to him a little more.
SHARK_DEMON Oh. It was a genuine pleasure.
BUFFY If I were to stop saving his life, it would simple things up *so* much.
ANYA Do you think she ... walked around on clouds, wearing like ... Birkenstocks and played a harp? 'Cause those are just not flattering. You know, the clonky sandals, not a harp. I mean, who ... doesn't look good with a harp?
ANYA What? I'm just saying what everyone's thinking, right baby?
XANDER You are attractive and have many good qualities.
TARA It's totally not stupid to wonder what it was like for Buffy. But it could have been any one of a zillion heavenly dimensions. All we know is that ... it was a good place and she was happy there.
WILLOW And we took her away from that. We wrecked it for her.
XANDER We didn't wreck. We didn't know.
WILLOW We didn't wanna know. We were so selfish. *I* was so selfish.
XANDER Maybe we were. I just feel weird feeling bad that my friend's not dead. It's ... too mind-boggling. So I've decided to simplify the whole thing. Me like Buffy. Buffy's alive, so, me glad.
TARA Not to be Miss Psycho Pep Squad, but we have *got* to stop obsessing about what we did and start trying to make things better for Buffy.
ANYA I'm with Miss Psycho Pep Squad.
XANDER Ah, we need to spend more time with her, just hang out. Maybe have ... weekly dinners over here, or, uh ... a book club. Short books. Videos.
WILLOW I can fix it. I know a spell.
TARA No! No more spells.
WILLOW Then what? This isn't something that's gonna be fixed by a video club. I know I messed up, okay, and ... I wanna fix it.
TARA I can't believe that we are talking about this again. You know how powerful magic is, how dangerous. You could hurt someone, you ... you could hurt yourself.
WILLOW I know a spell that will make her forget she was ever in heaven.
TARA God, what is wrong with you?!
XANDER I'm gonna go get that ... phone you probably don't hear. High-pitched ring, ears like a dog.
ANYA I'm gonna help you with that.
TARA Do you think I'm stupid? I know you used that spell on me.
WILLOW Tara, I'm sorry, I-
TARA Don't! Just ... don't. There's nothing you can say.
WILLOW Tara, I didn't mean to-
TARA To what? Violate my mind like that? How could you, Willow? How could you after what Glory did to me?
WILLOW Violate you? I ... I-I didn't ... mean anything like that, I-I, I just wanted us not to fight any more. I love you.
TARA If you don't wanna fight, you don't fight. You don't use magic to make a fight disappear.
WILLOW But I-I just wanted to make things better. Better for us.
TARA But you don't get to decide what is better for us, Will. We're in a relationship, we are supposed to decide together.
WILLOW Okay. I'm ... I realize I, I did it wrong.
TARA You did it the way you're doing everything. When things get rough, you ... you don't even consider the options. You just ... you just do a spell. It's not good for you, Willow. And it's not what magic is for.
WILLOW But I ... I just wanna help people.
TARA Maybe that's how it started, but ... you're helping yourself now, fixing things to your liking. Including me.
WILLOW Tara, no!
TARA I don't think this is gonna work.
WILLOW Hey. It is, i-it's working. Tara, please. I need you, baby. I need you. I don't need magic, I-I don't, I ... let me prove it to you, okay? I, I will go a month without doing any magic. I won't do a single spell. I swear.
TARA Go a week. One week without magic.
WILLOW Fine. Fine, that's easy!
TARA Go a week, and then we'll see.
TARA I don't know, I just ... think we both need some ... I don't know, space. Oh, I can't believe I'm saying this.
WILLOW Are you saying you're gonna leave me?
GILES I have to.
BUFFY Uh-huh.
GILES You have to be strong. I'm, I'm trying to-
BUFFY Trying to, to what? Desert me? Abandon me? Leave me all alone when I really need somebody?
GILES I don't want to leave-
BUFFY So don't. Please don't.
BUFFY I can't do this without you.
GILES You can. That's why I'm going. As long as I stay you'll always turn to me if there's something comes up that you feel that you can't handle, and I'll step in because, because ... Because I can't bear to see you suffer.
BUFFY Me too. Hate suffering. Had about as much of it as I can take.
GILES Believe me, I'm loathe to cause you more, but this...
GILES I've taught you all I can about being a slayer, and your mother taught you what you needed to know about life. You ... you're not gonna trust that until you're forced to stand alone.
BUFFY But why now? Now that you know where I've been, what I'm going through?
GILES Now more than ever. The temptation to give up is gonna be overwhelming, and I can't let-
BUFFY So I won't! No giving up. You can be here, and I can still be strong.
GILES Buffy, I've thought this over ... and over. I believe it's the right thing to do.
BUFFY You're wrong.
DAWN Willow, come on, you ready?
WILLOW Not so much. You go ahead, tell Giles to hold up. I'll be there in a sec.
TARA Fine.
DAWN Hurry up. You don't wanna miss the lowdown on our latest featured creature.
WILLOW For Buffy and Tara, this I char.
WILLOW Let Lethe's Bramble do its chore. Purge their minds of memories grim, of pains from recent slights and sins.
WILLOW When the fire goes out, when the crystal turns black, the spell will be cast. Tabula rasa, tabula rasa, tabula rasa.
DAWN_VOICEOVER So whadda we got?
GILES Sorry?
DAWN What kind of oogly-boogleys? Lizardy types, or um, zombies, or, or vampires, or what?
GILES There are no oogly-boogleys, Dawn.
WILLOW Thanks for the jacket. It's cold out there.
XANDER Not a problem, the cold only makes me stronger and more macho-like.
GILES I'm glad you're here, um...
GILES I have something I really have to tell you all. Um ... I know it feels like we've been through this before-
BUFFY Why don't you just jump to the chase? Tell them that you're-
GILES Spike?
ANYA Holy moly.
SPIKE You need to give me asylum.
XANDER I'll say.
XANDER No need to get cute. It's a disguise. Happens there's a bloke I'd rather not see just now.
SPIKE You met him, I believe. Toothy bloke with the baby-seal breath?
SPIKE Nasty fellow, him. And ugly too.
SPIKE He's got a mouthful of choppers just waiting to be yanked out and worn as necklaces.
GILES Well, now that we've recovered from Spike's ... sartorial humor, I'll jump to the chase. Um ... I'm headed back to England and I plan to stay ... indefinitely.
XANDER Now? Not now, I mean, not after ... everything.
GILES Yes, now.
ANYA For real this time? 'Cause honest to Pete, a young shopkeeper's heart can only take so much ... I mean, not that I want you to go-
BUFFY I can't do this.
BUFFY I just, I don't think...
WILLOW Buffy, listen.
WILLOW I know this must be awful for you, and I, I'm sorry, I ... I'm so sorry for...
BUFFY Sorry. Everybody's sorry. I know that you guys are just trying to help ... but it's just, it's too much. And, and I, I can't take it any more. If you guys ... if you guys understood how it felt ... how it feels. It's like I'm dying, it-
BUFFY Huh?
XANDER Hey.
WILLOW Hey?
GILES Hello?
DAWN Who, who are you people?
BUFFY Don't worry.
DAWN Please don't hurt me!
BUFFY Oh, it's okay. I don't know anyone here either.
DAWN Yeah? Who are you?
BUFFY I, uh....
XANDER Okay, who are you freaks?
WILLOW You don't know me?
XANDER Not a clue.
WILLOW But you were just all like, 'oh, hey.'
XANDER Yeah, 'cause I thought you were a girl and I'd remember, but...
WILLOW Well, I am a girl! I'm ... not sure ... who I am exactly, but...
XANDER Okay, why was I on the ground? And why are you all staring at me? Is this some kind of psych test? Am I getting paid for this?
GILES It's not just you. Does anyone remember anything?
SPIKE Nope.
GILES Well, maybe we all got ... terribly drunk and this is some sort of, uh, blackout.
DAWN I don't think I drink.
ANYA I-I don't see any booze. I don't feel any head bumps. I don't see Allen Funt.
GILES Who?
XANDER Okay. I'm not panicking. I'm not. I'm not. Stop looking at me like I'm panicking!
BUFFY Hey, hey, take it easy, guy. Okay, no one's hurt, right? And, and none of us look all hatchety-murdery, so ... we're probably safe. Here. Wherever here is.
WILLOW Look at this stuff on these shelves. Weird jars of weird stuff.
WILLOW Weird books with weird covers, like
TARA This is a magic shop. A-a-a real magic shop.
BUFFY Well, maybe that's it. Maybe something magic happened-
GILES Magic! Magic's all balderdash and chicanery. I'm afraid we don't know a bloody thing. Except I seem to be British, don't I? Uh, and a man. With ... glasses. Well, that narrows it down considerably.
DAWN I don't like this.
BUFFY It's okay, don't worry. We'll take care of each other.
GILES We'll all get our memory back, and it'll all be right as rain.
SPIKE Oh, listen to Mary Poppins. He's got his crust all stiff and upper with that nancy-boy accent. You Englishmen are always so... Bloody hell! Sodding, blimey, shagging, knickers, bollocks, oh God! I'm English!
GILES Welcome to the nancy tribe.
SPIKE You don't suppose you and I ... we're not related, are we?
ANYA There is a ruggedly handsome resemblance.
GILES And you do inspire a, um ... particular feeling of ... familiarity and ... disappointment.
GILES Older brother?
SPIKE Father. Oh, god, how I must hate you.
GILES What did I do?
SPIKE There's always something, and what's with the trollop?
ANYA Hey!
GILES Her?
SPIKE I saw you! Sleeping together.
GILES Resting together.
ANYA Look! It's okay. We're engaged.
GILES Oh.
ANYA It's a lovely ring.
SPIKE Oh, great, a tarty stepmom who's half old Daddy's age.
ANYA Tarty?
GILES Old? You little twerp, I'm young enough to still get carded.
WILLOW Carded! Driver's licenses!
XANDER It's me! 'Alexander Harris.' Cute picture. Hey, I exist.
WILLOW I'm Willow Rosenberg. Heh, Willow. Funny name.
TARA I think it's pretty.
WILLOW Whadda you got?
TARA Tara, and look, I'm a student at U.C. Sunnydale.
WILLOW Me too! Hey, maybe we're study buddies.
DAWN I don't have a wallet.
BUFFY Don't worry. Me neither. But here, look.
BUFFY You're Dawn.
DAWN Or, Umad.
GILES I'm, uh, called Rupert Giles.
ANYA Rupert.
SPIKE Rupert!
GILES You're not too old to put across my knee, you know ... sonny. Anyway, what did I call you?
SPIKE Um...
SPIKE 'Made with care for Randy.' Randy Giles? Why not just call me 'Horny Giles,' or 'Desperate for a Shag Giles'? I knew there was a reason I hated you!
GILES Randy's ... a family name, undoubtedly.
WILLOW Oh, hey, I have a name on my jacket. Harris.
XANDER Harris? That's my last name. Maybe I have a brother and you go out with him. Or maybe you go out with me.
WILLOW Well, we did wake up all snuggly-wuggly. Maybe you're my boyfriend.
XANDER Either that, or I got one pissed-off brother out there somewhere.
ANYA I'm Anya!
ANYA Um, this key fits this lock. And, uh, the forms ... next to the cash register say that, uh, Rupert and, and Anya own the shop together.
GILES This is *our* magic shop? Uh, well, that's very, uh, uh, progressive of me.
DAWN So you don't have a name?
BUFFY Of course I do. I just don't happen to know it.
DAWN You want me to name you?
BUFFY Oh, that's sweet, but I think I can name myself. I'll name me ... Joan.
DAWN Ugh!
BUFFY What? Did you just 'ugh' my name?
DAWN No! I just ... I mean, it's so blah. Joan?
BUFFY I like it. I feel like a Joan.
DAWN Fine, that's your purgative.
BUFFY Prerogative.
DAWN Whatever, Joan.
BUFFY Whatever, Umad.
DAWN/BUFFY Boy, you're a pain in the/Boy, you're bossy!
DAWN Do you think we're-
BUFFY Sisters?
SPIKE You never showed me affection like that!
SPIKE ...I'd wager.
BUFFY Well, we need to figure out what's going on. We need to get help.
SPIKE Looks like Joan fancies herself the boss.
BUFFY We have a kid here-
DAWN A teenager.
BUFFY A teenager. And we have no idea what's wrong with us. I think a hospital's our best bet.
GILES Uh, yes, let's, um, let's head out.
BUFFY Any suggestions on how we're gonna get there?
SPIKE Dad can drive. He's bound to have some classic midlife-crisis transport. Something red, shiny, shaped like a penis.
BUFFY Did you guys see that?
SPIKE Vampires!
TARA Maybe it's Halloween.
DAWN It doesn't feel like Halloween.
XANDER Even if it is, those guys are definitely not kids, and those are definitely not costumes. Randy's right. Looks like we have vampires.
VAMP Slayer!
XANDER They're definitely not knocking for candy.
WILLOW Okay, doors, we need to check to see if there's other doors, a-and make sure they're locked and put large objects in front of them. Come on.
BUFFY Monsters are real. Did we know this?
TARA I don't know, but we n-need our memories back. We have to get to a hospital.
GILES As, uh, proprietor of a magic shop, I propose we fight them. We can use things here in the shop, you know, magic ... tricks or whatever.
VAMP_2 Send out Spike!
GILES They seem to want spikes.
SPIKE Oh!
SPIKE Let's give 'em these.
GILES Well done.
DAWN But wait, what are they going to do with them?
VAMP Slayer, come out and play!
TARA 'Slay her,' that's just what they said before. Th-th-they're gonna use the spikes to-
BUFFY To slay someone? A female someone! Who do those jerks think they are?
ANYA Bloodsuckers. They kill by sucking blood. Take it easy, Joan.
WILLOW You guys!
XANDER Trap door in the basement, it seems to lead to the sewer.
ANYA Let's go!
XANDER Now I'm not sure what I am so bear with me here. Now I lay me down to sleep, uh, shabat Israel, uh, om, om.
VAMP_3 You owe us!
SPIKE Fine! Take your damn spikes!
VAMP_3 Don't be stupid.
BUFFY Get your hands off me, you son of a-
VAMP_3 I said you owe us.
SPIKE Who, me?
VAMP_3 You've got the boss's kittens.
SPIKE Kittens?!
BUFFY Hey! Stay away from Randy!
DAWN Whoa!!
WILLOW What did you just do?
BUFFY Uh ... I....
BUFFY I don't know. But it was COOL!
VAMP_1 The boss ain't gonna like this! I'll be back. And I won't be alone!
BUFFY I think I know why Joan's the boss. I'm like a superhero or something!
VAMP_1 The boys want to taste blood, boss. They wanna break down the door.
SHARK_DEMON The boys are barbarians. There's no need to do that. The humans will turn on him soon enough.
SHARK_DEMON And if they don't, we'll burn the place to the ground.
BUFFY Okay. I've got a plan.
XANDER I'm all ears.
BUFFY They seem to want Randy. And I seem to be pretty strong. Wicked strong. So, you guys go through the sewers to get to the hospital, and Randy and I'll give the monsters a run for their money.
SPIKE That's your plan?
BUFFY Yes.
SPIKE Right.
ANYA I'm not leaving the shop. I have to protect the cash register, and ... do some spells.
GILES Oh. Well, magic might help, yes, it's worth a shot.
BUFFY All right. You work on that then. We need to go. Ready, Randy?
SPIKE Ready, Joan.
GILES Um, son. Come here. Um, please.
SPIKE Um...
GILES Yes, um...
SPIKE Right.
GILES Good, then.
BUFFY Randy!
SPIKE Hey, I'm a superhero too!
SPIKE Joan, where're you going?
SPIKE Hey! Joan! Wait up!
XANDER Almost there, come on. There we go.
DAWN Thanks.
DAWN The ants go marching one by one, hurrah, hurrah. The ants go marching one by-
ANYA This must be nice for us.
GILES Sorry?
ANYA I mean ... I know there's...
ANYA ...the vampire problem, and our memory loss, and all that, but still...
ANYA ...to spend this time together alone? Must be nice.
GILES Uh, yes, yes, um, I'm sure that's right. Um, which, uh, which book shall we start with?
ANYA This is the book for us.
GILES Oh, good. Does it focus on mind control, or-or memory loss?
ANYA Not exactly, I just, um ... my intuition tells me this is the book. And I figure being a magic shop owner and a natural at the supernatural, I should trust my intuition.
GILES Y-yes, fine, but as you recall, I too am a magic shop owner.
ANYA True, but my intuition says that you're not so much the magic guy and more of a paperwork type. Okay, here we go.
GILES But you don't even know-
ANYA Bara bara himble gemination.
SPIKE Wait up!
SPIKE Bloody hell, what are you doing?
BUFFY You don't know who you are.
SPIKE Right, none of us do, and we're being chased by-
BUFFY You're a vampire!
SPIKE How can you say - I, me, a vampire? No.
BUFFY Check the lumpies. And the teeth.
BUFFY I kill your kind.
SPIKE And I bite yours. So how come I don't wanna bite you? And why am I fightin' other vampires?
SPIKE I must be a noble vampire. A good guy. On a mission of redemption. I help the hopeless. I'm a vampire with a soul.
BUFFY A vampire with a soul? Oh my god, how lame is that?
GILES Perhaps we should try another book.
ANYA No!
ANYA This book made the little fluffers, and this book's gonna send 'em back. I've got it this time, okay. 'Himble abri, abri voyon.'
GILES Yes, dear.
SPIKE I'm a hero really. I mean, to be cast such an ugly lot in life and then to rise above it. To seek out better, nobler things. It's inspirational, isn't it? And the two of us... natural enemies, thrown together to stand against the forces of darkness. Utter trust. No thought of me biting you, no thought of you staking me.
BUFFY Depends on how long you keep on yapping.
TARA Come on. This way. Up the ladder.
XANDER He's coming!
GILES Clearly that is not a helpful book, *darling.*
GILES Come down, and we will go about fixing this in a sensible fashion!
ANYA Sensible! You think it's sensible for me to go down into that pit of cotton-top hell, and let them hippity-hop all over my vulnerable flesh?
GILES Fine, then just stay up there and keep making bunnies! That's a capital plan!
ANYA What capital? I never know what you're talking about. Loo, shag, brolly, what the hell is all that?
GILES What? There's no way that you could remember me saying any of those words.
ANYA Oh, bugger off, you brolly.
BUFFY Note to self: learn to duck.
GILES Get a different book! Put that book down, do you hear? Not ... that... book!
WILLOW How you doin', Dawn?
DAWN Uh, I'm okay. It's scary ... but, weirdly? Kind of familiar.
WILLOW I know what you mean.
DAWN How are you?
WILLOW A little confused. I mean, I'm ... all sweaty ... and trapped, no memory, hiding in a pipe from a vampire...
WILLOW And I think I'm kinda gay.
GILES Look what you've done, you lunatic woman!
ANYA Don't blame me, you snobby, snotty, thinks he's so great kind of jerk ... and I feel compelled to take some vengeance on you.
GILES Ow!! God, no wonder I'm leaving you!
ANYA What?!
GILES Look! One-way ticket to London, and out of this engagement!
ANYA Of all the nerve!
ANYA Now look at what you've done! That thing is gonna eat my ring.
VAMP_1 I smell fear ... and it smells good.
GILES Fatas ... venga ... mata ... waray!
GILES Oh ... that's better.
ANYA Oh, thank goodness.
GILES I'm so sorry, dear.
ANYA No. Rupy, I'm sorry. You were right. That was the wrong book.
GILES Oh ... um ... Yes, it was. But I'm, I'm still sorry.
ANYA Don't leave me.
GILES Oh, Anya.
XANDER Hey! Over here, big guy!
XANDER Check out this throbbing jugular!
DAWN Alex!
BUFFY Don't mess with Joan the v-
SPIKE Buffy! Buff-
XANDER Sorry, I just got back the memory of seeing
XANDER We should get back.
GILES Well, this place certainly needs a good tidying.
ANYA Oh, yes. Yes. Yes.
SPIKE From dust...
SPIKE ...to dust.
SHARK_DEMON You're an odd duck, Mister Spike. Fighting your own kind ... palling around with a Slayer. And whoa, that suit! Chutzpah must be your middle name. Uh, hey, look, um ... about our little debt problem, it's okay, I don't need the kittens.
SPIKE You'll get paid. I'm no welsher.
SHARK_DEMON Right, sure. You're good for it, I know that. I'm just going to, uh ... yeah.
SPIKE You all right?
