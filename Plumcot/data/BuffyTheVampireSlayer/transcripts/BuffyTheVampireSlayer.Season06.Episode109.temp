GILES_VOICEOVER Previously on
AMY All right! You wanna fry a witch? I'll give you a witch! Before thee let the unclean thing crawl!
WILLOW She's a perfectly normal girl. Then, she's a rat.
BUFFY Maybe we should get her one of those wheel thingies.
TARA Can, can we not do this now?
WILLOW Forget it ever happened.
WILLOW Forget.
TARA What is wrong with you? I know you used that spell on me.
WILLOW I'll go a month without doing any magic.
TARA Go a week.
WILLOW Fine, that's easy!
WILLOW When the fire goes out, when the crystal turns black, the spell will be cast.
TARA I don't think this is gonna work.
WILLOW Are you saying you're gonna leave me?
SPIKE I'm placing an order.
WARREN Oh no no, I'm not making any more girls.
SPIKE Sure you are. Here's your specs.
WARREN So ... you guys wanna team up and take over Sunnydale?
JONATHAN/ANDREW Okay.
WARREN The Trio versus the Slayer.
JONATHAN We're like supervillains.
BUFFY I can't do this without you.
GILES You can. That's why I'm going.
GILES I'm heading back to England.
GILES ...and I plan to stay.
SPIKE We have to talk.
BUFFY About what?
SPIKE We kissed, Buffy.
HUSBAND I'm sure we can work something out.
WIFE A deal of some sort. Anything you want.
BUFFY I always wanted a pony.
BUFFY Oh. You weren't really speaking to me, were you? My bad. Well, as long as I'm here...
BUFFY Wow. A mugging. Haven't gotten one of those in a while.
BUFFY Usually it's blood, and with the horror ... just a good old-fashioned mugging. Kinda sweet actually.
BUFFY Oh, uh, probably not for you. Here. Go. Now.
BUFFY Not too sweet for you either, huh? But come on, rush me. It'll be funny.
SPIKE Yaah!
BUFFY No!
BUFFY Gah! Oh!
BUFFY What the hell are you doing?
SPIKE I thought they were demons.
BUFFY Way to go with the keen observiness, Jessica Fletcher.
SPIKE Remind me not to help you.
BUFFY *More* often?
SPIKE Hey. Little sympathy for the man with the migraine here, can we?
BUFFY Well, that's what you get for attacking a human.
SPIKE Yeah. You'd think if the government was gonna put a chip in my head, they'd at least make it so I could attack criminals and that sort.
BUFFY Yes, because muggers deserve to be eaten.
BUFFY Just have to get your rocks off fightin' demons.
SPIKE There are other ways.
BUFFY And to that, an extreme 'see you later.'
SPIKE Buffy.
BUFFY Spike ... it's late, okay, can we just finish this another time?
SPIKE Oh, so you wanna jump right to the kissing then, eh?
BUFFY I am not kissing you, Spike. Once was-
SPIKE Twice.
BUFFY But not again.
SPIKE You're a tease, you know that, Slayer? Get a fellow's motor revving, let the tension marinate a couple-a days, then bam! Crown yourself the ice queen.
BUFFY Need a few more metaphors for that little mix?
SPIKE It's only a matter of time before you realize I'm the only one here for you, pet. You got no one else!
WILLOW What's the matter, Amy? You lonely? Oh, we need to get you a nice companion rat that you can love ... play with ... and grow attached to, until one day they leave you for no good reason.
WILLOW Won't that be fun? Relax, Amy. I'm just kiddin'. I swear, if I could figure out how to turn you back... Any way ...
WILLOW '
WARREN Dude, what are you doing?
JONATHAN We're not breaking into Langley here. It's Sunnydale.
ANDREW Well, you never know what new stuff they have, better safe than-
WARREN Okay, the security system here is a guy named Rusty.
WARREN Now get up.
ANDREW Whoa, head rush. Cool.
WARREN Guys, come on, quit jerking around.
ANDREW See, that's cool. How come he gets to play with all the cool stuff?
JONATHAN Because I'm allergic to methane and you're still afraid of hot things?
ANDREW I know.
JONATHAN Besides, the tank kept making both of us tip over, remember?
WARREN Got it!
JONATHAN It's beautiful.
WARREN Boys, congratulations, Phase One of the plan is now complete. Let's get the hell outta here.
RUSTY What are you boys doing?
WARREN Um, we're with a tour group. The Get-The-Freeze-Ray tour group. Musta gotten separated.
RUSTY Museum closed five hours ago.
WARREN Really?
RUSTY Uh-huh.
WARREN Huh! Guess we just lost track of time, we should probably get the *freeze ray* out of here now.
WARREN 'Cause we love the learning, Rusty. Museums, libraries, Disney Hall of Presidents ... not boring. But more to the point? Good-bye.
WARREN Dude, that is so cool!
ANDREW The freeze ray totally worked.
JONATHAN Yeah, uh, not exactly.
WARREN So there's a kink or two. It's just a prototype. I mean, soon we'll have-
JONATHAN Hey, that's really neato and stuff, but in the meantime, you know ... ow!
WARREN Be a bigger wuss.
JONATHAN Can we just go back to the lair? Because ... I can't ... really feel my fingers.
WARREN Yeah, yeah, come on.
ANDREW Is he gonna like-
WARREN Oh, he'll be fine. Yeah, he'll defrost in a couple of days, no harm, no foul.
ANDREW Won't he tell on us?
WARREN And say what? 'Two guys and a mime took me out with their freeze ray'? That's likely.
WARREN Come on!
WILLOW Hey. Here's some hot chocolate, you want-
AMY No, thanks. Still ... kinda queasy.
WILLOW Okay. Maybe later.
WILLOW Hey, no, i-it's okay.
WILLOW It's, it's just a siren. It's o-it's all right. Okay? You okay?
AMY Mm-hm. Yeah. Just ... you know. Everything feels weird. I mean, it's like ... I felt like I was in that cage for weeks. But it can still be okay ... right? I-I can still get into the swing of things, like ... prom's coming up. I-I'm so hoping Larry would ask me. We would make such a splash at- Oh. Oh god. He hasn't asked someone else, has he?
WILLOW Uh, Amy ... three things we have to talk about. One, Larry's gay. Two, Larry's dead. And three, high school's ... kinda over.
AMY How long was I in the cage?
AMY How long?!
BUFFY Willow?
BUFFY Hey. How you doin'?
WILLOW Oh. Uh ... okay.
BUFFY Yeah?
WILLOW Yeah. Not parades and cotton candy, but ... okay.
BUFFY Will, um ... can I talk to you about something?
WILLOW Of course.
BUFFY Right. Okay. Um ... You know how we all make choices? And sometimes they're good, and ... sometimes they're ... less good.
WILLOW Uh-huh...
BUFFY Well, lately, I, uh...
BUFFY Oh, Tara, hey- Amy?!
AMY The whole school?
AMY By a giant snake thing. Okay, still adjusting. Hi Buffy.
BUFFY Hi. How've you been?
AMY Rat. You?
BUFFY Dead.
AMY Oh.
BUFFY Well, I should ... let you guys catch up, I can-
AMY No no no, stay. Do you have any cookies?
BUFFY Uh, yeah, w-what kind?
AMY Any kind. Not cheese.
BUFFY Um, sure, in the, the kitchen, I'll just get 'em-
AMY Oh no, I'll grab 'em.
BUFFY Okay, well, at least, you know, let me make up the, the couch for you? It's late, you should stay here. Everybody does.
AMY Thank you.
BUFFY Wow.
WILLOW I know.
BUFFY Is ... she gonna be okay?
WILLOW Don't know. She's kinda freaked out. I mean, I would be too.
BUFFY Wow.
WILLOW I, I just realized I could. Thought of the right thing, and ... it's nice, having another magically-inclined friend around.
WILLOW So, w-what were you gonna tell me? You were sounding all serious.
BUFFY Huh? Oh. Uh, it's nothing. I mean, the whole Amy, rat, Amy thing ... no way I'm toppin' that.
BUFFY Hey. How you doin'? Need anything?
AMY No, thanks. Good cookies.
AMY Sorry about your mom.
BUFFY Thanks.
AMY It's crazy, all the things that've happened since I went away.
BUFFY No kidding.
AMY Snyder got eaten by a snake ... high school got destroyed...
BUFFY Oh, Gatorade has a new flavor. Blue.
AMY See? Head spinning. People getting frozen ... Willow's dating girls ... and did you hear about Tom and Nicole?!
BUFFY People getting frozen?
TV_REPORTER ...in critical yet stable condition as local authorities continue their investigation into the robbery that left one man frozen solid.
REPORTER Live from the museum, Ryan Morris, KOUS.
AMY Weird.
BUFFY Excuse me, excuse me, thanks.
BUFFY Great.
SPIKE Well, well, well. Look who decided to show up.
BUFFY What are you doing here, Spike?
SPIKE Well, you know, a man was frozen alive in there. A little compassion, luv.
SPIKE Uh, you know, as long as we're both here, you might as well tag along. I mean, as a team we could-
BUFFY Yeah, that never really ends well, does it?
SPIKE It did the other night.
BUFFY You really seem awfully fixated on a couple of kisses, Spike.
SPIKE And you seem awfully quick to forget about them.
BUFFY Look. I'm sorry, okay? I'm-I'm sorry if you thought that it meant more.
SPIKE But...
BUFFY But ... when I kissed you ... you know I was thinking about Giles, right?
SPIKE You know, I always wondered about you two.
BUFFY What? Oh, gross, Spike! He left. I was depressed. Ergo vulnerability and, and bad kissing decisions. Okay, but, that's all that it was. You have to let it go.
SPIKE Did it work?
BUFFY What?
SPIKE You convince yourself?
BUFFY Please, stop.
SPIKE A man can change.
BUFFY You're not a man. You're a thing.
SPIKE Stop walking away.
BUFFY Don't touch me!
SPIKE Ahh, ahh, ohh!
BUFFY You're a thing. An evil, disgusting, thing.
SPIKE Look at all the goodies.
SPIKE That's right, you should scream.
SPIKE Creature of the night here, yeah? Some people forget that.
WOMAN Please.
SPIKE She thinks I'm housebroken. She forgot who she's dealing with.
WOMAN Anything you want, please-
SPIKE Just 'cause she's confused about where she fits in, I'm supposed to be too? 'Cause I'm not. I know what I am. I'm dangerous. I'm evil.
WOMAN I-I'm sure you're not evil.
SPIKE Yes, I am. I am a killer. That's what I do. I kill. And, yeah, maybe it's been a long time, but ... it's not like you forget how.
SPIKE You just ... do it. And now I can, again, all right? So here goes.
SPIKE This might hurt a little.
SPIKE What the hell is going on?
TARA Good god, that's a lot of shake. I mean, I know, part of our ... big ... movie and milkshake fun day, but ... good god, that's a lot of shake.
DAWN Helps to wash down the Raisinettes.
TARA Promise me that you will eat something green tonight. Leafy green, not ... gummi green.
TARA The movie was fun.
DAWN Yeah. It was ironic when all those cute inner-city kids taught their coach a valuable lesson.
TARA You know that I will always be there for you, right? There, there was actually more of a lead-in when I practiced that at home.
DAWN I know.
TARA It's just ... I wanted you to know that ... my moving out had nothing to do with you, and I, I will never stop loving you.
DAWN I know. Do you think you'll ever get back together?
TARA I wish I knew.
DAWN But you still love her.
TARA Very much. I just ... sometimes ... other things get in the way.
DAWN I know. Uh, she's been doing a lot better lately, though. Uh, she's been really good about ... being careful ... a-about stuff.
TARA Well, good. Great, that's ... that's great.
WILLOW Here. Says the guard's definitely gonna live.
XANDER He's all thawed out, says they used hair-dryers. Huh.
WILLOW Everything slowed down. His nervous system, circulatory system. He's still unconscious.
BUFFY Anya?
ANYA It's such a pain. The text I wanted, Giles took it with him. He has this thing that ... owning a book makes it like his property.
BUFFY What should we do, should we call him? It's like the middle of last night there. Or maybe it's tomorrow. Anyone remember how that works?
WILLOW That's okay, no one freak. We'll just do it another way.
BUFFY I-I don't think we need to resort to ... I mean...
BUFFY Oh. Hey, cool.
XANDER All right, back to basics. A little old-fashioned state-of-the-art hacker action.
BUFFY That's great, Will, I haven't seen you do that in a long time.
BUFFY I-I don't remember that part.
WILLOW It's quicker. It'll just take me a sec to go through the files. Okay. Internal police report.
WILLOW A diamond was stolen from the museum last night. A big one. On loan from the British museum. They're withholding information to smoke out the criminals. Oh! It's pretty. There's a picture.
BUFFY Well, is it a, a supernatural diamond? You know, like, healing powers, or, or good-lucky?
ANYA Maybe it's cursed. Diamonds are excellent for cursing.
WILLOW Well, we'll keep checking, shall we?
XANDER Well, you know, I am kinda beat, and I bet you that's tiring, that ... thing you're doing there...
WILLOW Guys, I'm fine. What's the deal with-
ANYA Oh, for crying out loud. This is bizarre. You're all, 'la la la!' with, with the magic, and the not talking, like everything's normal, when we all know that Tara up and left you and now everyone's scared to say anything to you. Except me. Is this that thing I do that you were commenting-
WILLOW Guys ... it's okay. It's hard ... but i-it's better this way. Little things just ... starting taking over, things that didn't matter, but we saw them differently, so ... they got blown out of proportion. And, this time away will help us sort through things. Really. Now, let's just keep working on this. I don't wanna leave Amy alone in the house so long.
XANDER Amy, is she ... how is she adjusting?
WILLOW It's hard to say. It's a lot to take in. I keep expecting her to do, like, ratty stuff, you know, licking her hands clean, shredding newspaper, leaving little pellets in the corner.
BUFFY Let's definitely not leave her alone in the house too long.
JONATHAN I didn't know it'd be so sparkly.
ANDREW It's so big.
WARREN Yes, gentlemen, it turns out, size is everything. No offense, man.
ANDREW It makes colors with the light.
WARREN All right, I think we've finished the first part, now it's time for Phase Two.
WARREN Is the van fired up?
JONATHAN Check.
ANDREW Hello, it's called knocking.
SPIKE Knock knock, robot boy. Need you to look at my chip.
JONATHAN Is that like, British slang or something? 'Cause we're not-
SPIKE In my head, the chip in my head.
WARREN We're kind of in the middle of something.
SPIKE Well, you can play holodeck another time. Right now, I'm in charge.
WARREN Yeah, what are you gonna do if we don't especially feel like maybe playing your-
WARREN What are, wait, what are you doing?
SPIKE Examine my chip, or else Mister... ...Fett here is the first to die.
JONATHAN Hey, all right, let's not, let's not do anything crazy here.
ANDREW That's a limited edition, 1979 mint condition Boba Fett.
WARREN All right, dude ... chill. You can still make it right. You know you don't wanna do this.
SPIKE What I want ... is answers, nimrod.
WARREN Right. But you don't wanna hurt the Fett, 'cause man, you're *not* comin' back from that. You know, you don't just do that and walk away.
SPIKE That right? Let's find out.
WARREN Wah, uh, one second.
ANDREW Dudes, I think that's Spike.
JONATHAN Of course it is, and he's evil. Completely capable of removing that head.
WARREN I'm gonna help him out.
JONATHAN Are you sure we can trust him? I mean, we all have heads too.
WARREN See, we help him, and he owes us one. See, we get Spike on our side, we get info on Buffy. And maybe, maybe we can even find a way to keep her out of Phase Two.
ANDREW Jonathan's right, can we trust him?
WARREN 'Course not. But alliances aren't about trust. See, he needs us, we need him. Well, that's how these things work.
WARREN I think we're ready. Agreed?
JONATHAN Agreed.
ANDREW Do what you need to do.
WARREN I think we can work something out. I'll take a look at your chip. It'll be a deal. We scratch your back, you scratch-
SPIKE I'm not scratching your anything. You do what I tell you, that's the deal. Deal?
WARREN Deal.
SPIKE Then let's go.
ANDREW Oh! It's okay, it's okay. It'll be fine.
WILLOW Amy?
AMY Oh god, you're back. I thought you said you wouldn't be gone that long.
WILLOW I wasn't. I mean, I thought it was-
AMY Let's go somewhere.
WILLOW Don't you wanna go see your dad?
AMY No. Can't. Not yet. Too many questions.
WILLOW About where you were.
AMY No, about how I got there. I wish there was a way that I could make him forget about the last three years.
WILLOW Oh, well hey, I can help you with that. Only, you might wanna sew your name into your clothes first or something.
AMY No ... I just don't wanna deal with him right now. I think I would be... ...bored.
WILLOW Well.
AMY Come on, let's get outta here.
WILLOW Oh, well, what do you wanna do?
AMY I don't know. Something fun. Anything ... not involving a big wheel. Or ... maybe ... you'd rather sit home all night, alone, like in high school.
WILLOW No! No, you know what? I can have fun. Heck, I, I deserve some fun.
AMY Yeah you do!
WILLOW I can party! Not like I owe anyone anything. I am totally free. So, let's make with the fun.
ANDREW You're English, right?
SPIKE Yeah.
ANDREW I've seen every episode of
JONATHAN 'Cause it's not out yet on DVD.
ANDREW Right. It's not out on ... DVD.
SPIKE Warren!!
WARREN Here I am, here.
SPIKE Bloody hell. Get on with it then.
SPIKE Help me out here, Spock, I don't speak loser.
WARREN Okay, right, um ... your chip works fine, yeah.
SPIKE There's gotta be something wrong-
WARREN No, no, listen. I don't know what that thing does ... I'd like to...
SPIKE Hey.
WARREN But whatever it is, it works fine. There's no deterioration of the signal, it still is coming through on a steady pulse. Which it's supposed to.
SPIKE If you're lying to me-
WARREN No! It's all right here. I, I mean, it is. It's really not that hard to figure out, if you just... What?
SPIKE You tell anyone about this...
WARREN No, I promise. Who would I tell, I don't even know what this is about!
SPIKE It's about the rules having changed.
SPIKE Everything's different now.
SPIKE Nothing wrong with me. Something wrong with her.
DAWN Hello! We're home!
TARA Looks like no one's here.
DAWN Well, I'm sure they'll be back soon. Um, I know Willow and Buffy were meeting up with Xander to do some research.
TARA Well then I, I should really get back.
DAWN Or, you can stay and wait for them. Then you can get a chance to catch up with ... everyone.
TARA Yeah, I-I don't think that's such a great idea.
DAWN Okay. Your call. I have the TV to keep me company until they get back.
DAWN You notice how it's been getting dark so much earlier these days?
DAWN Talking cat.
TARA Fine. I'll stay, but just until they get back. And only to make sure that you're not alone, this ... has nothing to do with ... anyone else.
DAWN Sure. Cool. Up to you.
WILLOW I know. Xander engaged, I couldn't believe it either.
AMY It's just so weird. So what's she like?
WILLOW Thousand-year-old capitalist ex-demon with rabbit phobia.
AMY Well, that's so his type.
GUY_1 Hey.
WILLOW Hey.
AMY Hey.
AMY Well, let's go then. We're gonna go dance. Do you wanna come?
WILLOW Oh, uh, no, you go. I'll keep an eye on our drinks.
AMY Okay. I mean, because, if you want something a little more your style...
AMY I'm sure we can swing that.
WILLOW No, really, no.
BREE Hi. Bree.
WILLOW Willow. Nice ... um ... top.
WILLOW No. Thanks, but no.
AMY You sure?
WILLOW I'm not, she, I'm still-
AMY It's cool.
BREE Oh, uh, sorry.
GUY_1 So, uh, are we gonna go?
AMY You sure you're gonna be okay?
WILLOW Yeah, go. I'm all kinds of good.
WILLOW No use looking at me like that. It's the gullet for you, mister.
AMY Hey! Sorry, I kinda got caught up.
WILLOW No, it's okay.
AMY You know ... if rats could dance ... they probably wouldn't gnaw so much.
GUY_1 Hey, come on. We're just getting started.
AMY I think I'm gonna sit this one out.
GUY_2 Nuh-uh! You can't, you can't just work us up like that and then just-
AMY Hey!
WILLOW I think she said no.
GUY_2 Well, nobody asked you ... Ellen.
AMY You wanna dance?
GUY_1 That's all. Nice, slow ... relaxing dance.
WILLOW Gee.
AMY I think I do feel more relaxed.
XANDER Aha! I got it! Uh, here's our villain right here!
XANDER What?
ANYA That's a D&D; manual, sweetie.
XANDER No, but it could- Oh.
ANYA Let's face it, we're not gonna find this thing because it doesn't exist. There's no such thing as a frost monster who eats diamonds.
BUFFY Well, maybe he doesn't eat them. You know, maybe he just ... thinks they're pretty.
BUFFY We suck.
XANDER We need new brains. What's up with Willow?
BUFFY Out with Amy, I guess.
ANYA Great, someone to do more magic with.
BUFFY But at least she's not all cooped up and crying. That's forward momentum. Now, I know that I don't ... know everything that happened with her and Tara, but it-
XANDER Tara thinks Willow is doing too much magic. And she's not the only one.
BUFFY I know. But I-I think she'll be fine. You know, it's, it's Willow. She of the level head.
ANYA Well, those are the ones you have to watch out for the most. Responsible types.
BUFFY Right, she might go crazy and start alphabetizing everything.
ANYA I'm serious. Responsible people are ... always so concerned with ... being good all the time, that when they finally get a taste of being bad ... they can't get enough. It's like all kablooey.
BUFFY That's not true.
ANYA Okay, not kablooey, more like bam.
XANDER It's human nature, Buff. Will's getting a taste of something powerful, way bigger than her.
ANYA Yeah, she was getting out of control with it before Tara left, and now that she's gone...
XANDER It's gotta be seductive.
XANDER Just giving in to it. Going totally wild.
XANDER We need to keep an eye on her.
BUFFY Okay. Okay, we'll, we'll keep an eye. But we can't assume that everybody's getting seduced, you know, sometimes-
BUFFY Hello, Magic Box.
SPIKE Slayer.
BUFFY Spike?
SPIKE Meet me at the cemetery. Twenty minutes. Come alone.
BUFFY Spike?
SPIKE Bloody hell. Yes, it's me.
BUFFY You're ... calling me on the phone?
SPIKE Just be there.
BUFFY Why? Are you ... helping again? You have a lead on this frost monster thingie?
SPIKE Something like that, yeah. Thought you might be up for a little grunt work.
BUFFY What?! No, no-no grunting!
SPIKE I was talking shop, luv, but if you got other ideas ... you, me, cozy little tomb with a view...
XANDER So, what did Captain Peroxide want?
BUFFY Nothing! You know, he just, you know, wanted to see if I-I wanted to patrol, for, for the, the monster. But I, I told him that I ... would ... not.
BUFFY I'm telling you, I, I think there's something about this thing.
XANDER Well, I don't know, Buff. It seems like we've been through every book.
ANYA Yeah, even the ones that weren't so boring you wanted to kill yourself.
XANDER We have those?
BUFFY I'm just saying, all the things that have happened lately? Okay, the, the bank robbery, the jewelry heist...
XANDER The exploding lint.
BUFFY I-is it me, or do these things seem really-
ANYA Lame?
BUFFY Well, I was gonna go with unusual, but, yeah.
BUFFY I don't know. You know, I'll do a quick patrol tonight, and after a good night's sleep, we can solve this tomorrow.
ANYA Optimism. I remember optimism.
XANDER That's because you're like a thousand.
BUFFY Good night, guys.
ANYA/XANDER Good night.
SPIKE Slayer.
BUFFY And so my night is now complete.
SPIKE You never showed.
BUFFY Sorry. Little busy actually doing stuff.
SPIKE You shouldn't be so flip, luv.
BUFFY What are you gonna do, walk behind me to death?
SPIKE I'm just saying things might be a little different.
SPIKE You oughta be careful.
BUFFY Enough.
BUFFY Get out of my way.
SPIKE Or what?
SPIKE Oh, the pain! The pain! Is gone.
SPIKE Guess what I just found out. Looks like I'm not as toothless as you thought, sweetheart.
BUFFY How?
SPIKE Don't you get it? Don't you see? You came back wrong.
BUFFY It's a trick. You did something to the chip, it's a trick.
SPIKE It's no trick. It's not me, it's you. Just you, in fact, that's the funny part. 'Cause you're the one that's changed. That's why this doesn't hurt me.
SPIKE Came back a little less human than you were.
BUFFY You're wrong.
SPIKE Then how come you're so spooked, luv? And why can I - do that?
BUFFY You're wrong.
WILLOW You know, this music isn't quite...
SPIKE Oh, poor little lost girl.
SPIKE She doesn't fit in anywhere. She's got no one to love.
BUFFY Me? I'm lost? Look at you, you idiot! Poor Spikey. Can't be a human, can't be a vampire. Where the hell do you fit in?
BUFFY Your job is to kill the slayer. But all you can do is follow me around making moon eyes.
SPIKE I'm in love with you.
BUFFY You're in love with pain. Admit it. You like me ... because you enjoy getting beat down. So really, who's screwed up?
SPIKE Hello! Vampire!
SPIKE I'm supposed to be treading on the dark side.
SPIKE What's your excuse?
WILLOW So, we've kinda played this scene.
AMY Yeah.
WILLOW Return.
WILLOW I, I just keep thinking ... there's gotta be someplace, like, bigger than this.
AMY Besides, it's way too early to go home yet.
SPIKE I wasn't planning on hurting you. Much.
BUFFY You haven't even come close to hurting me.
SPIKE Afraid to give me the chance?
SPIKE You afraid I'm gonna-
