GILES_VOICEOVER Previously:
SPIKE Looks like I'm not as toothless as you thought, sweetheart.
BUFFY How?
SPIKE You came back wrong.
TARA Willow, you are using too much magic. What do you want me to do, just ... sit back and keep my mouth shut?
WILLOW Well, that'd be a good start.
WILLOW Forget.
TARA I know you used that spell on me. What is wrong with you?
TARA I don't think this is gonna work.
WILLOW Are you saying you're gonna leave me?
BUFFY Amy? How've you been?
AMY Rat. You?
BUFFY Dead.
AMY Oh.
WILLOW It's nice, having another magically-inclined friend around.
WILLOW There's gotta be someplace, like, bigger than this.
AMY It's way too early to go home yet.
JONATHAN It's beautiful.
WARREN Boys, congratulations, Phase One of the plan is now complete.
SPIKE I'm in love with you.
BUFFY You're in love with pain.
SPIKE Afraid I'm gonna-
DAWN What time is it?
TARA Almost seven. God, I just closed my eyes for a minute.
DAWN Hm. And now there's cartoons. Plus, a mother of all night-wedgies.
TARA Uh-oh.
DAWN It's not tragic. I'm sure as soon as I stand up-
TARA No, Dawn ... why didn't anybody wake us up? Where is everyone?
DAWN Willow didn't come home either. They were out all night.
DAWN Where are they?
TARA I'm sure they're fine, Dawnie. I'm sure they just ... lost track of time.
BUFFY When ... When did the building fall down?
SPIKE I don't know. Must have been sometime between the first time and the, uh...
BUFFY Oh. Oh my god.
BUFFY Shoe, need my shoe.
SPIKE What's the hurry, luv?
BUFFY The hurry is I left Dawn all night. And don't call me love.
SPIKE You didn't seem to take issue with that last night. Or with any of the other little nasties we whispered.
BUFFY Can we not? Talk?
SPIKE I just don't see why you have to run off so quick. Thought we could-
BUFFY Not gonna happen. Last night was the end of this freak show.
SPIKE Don't say that.
BUFFY What did you think was gonna happen? What, we're gonna read the newspaper together, play footsie under the rubble?
SPIKE Not exactly what I had in mind.
BUFFY Stop!
SPIKE Make me.
BUFFY No! No!
BUFFY No, no, I-I have to-
SPIKE Stay. I'm stuck here. Sun's up.
SPIKE I knew. I knew the only thing better than killing a slayer would be f-
BUFFY What?!
BUFFY Is that what this is about? Doing a slayer?
SPIKE Well, I wouldn't throw stones, pet. You seem to be quite the groupie yourself.
BUFFY Shut up.
SPIKE I'm just sayin' ... vampires get you hot.
BUFFY *A* vampire got me hot. One. But he's gone. You're just...
BUFFY You're just convenient.
SPIKE So, what now? You go back to treating me like dirt till the next time you get an itch you can't scratch? Well, forget it. Last night changed things. I'm done being your whipping boy.
BUFFY Nothing's changed. It was a mistake.
SPIKE Bollocks! It was a bloody revelation.
SPIKE You can act as high and mighty as you like ... but I know where you live now, Slayer. I've tasted it.
BUFFY Get a grip. Like you're god's gift.
SPIKE Hardly. Wouldn't be nearly as interesting, would it?
BUFFY No! Let me go!
SPIKE I may be dirt ... but you're the one who likes to roll in it, Slayer. You never had it so good as me. Never.
BUFFY Uhh, you're bent.
SPIKE Yeah, and it made you scream, didn't it?
BUFFY I swear to god, if you tell *anyone* about last night, I will kill you.
SPIKE Right.
SPIKE You're gonna want these, too.
TARA Pancakes?
DAWN Uh, sure. Um, should we call Xander? What if they're all in a ditch somewhere? Ditches are bad. Mom always used to talk about the ditches.
TARA Nobody's in a ditch. We'll call, but ... we'll give them some time before we wake them up.
TARA Funny shapes, or...?
WILLOW It'll wear off in a day or-
WILLOW Hey.
TARA Hey. I just ... B-Buffy didn't come home last night ... either, so...
WILLOW Uh, hey, uh ... this is Amy. Amy, Tara, Tara, Amy.
AMY How you doin'?
TARA Fine, I ... I'd b-better g-get going.
WILLOW Amy! Amy the rat? Sorry.
AMY No, that's fair. I was a rat.
TARA When...
AMY Last night. It's nuts, everything's different. I mean ... the Bronze, for one thing. And Willow! She's a freaking amazing witch now. I couldn't even keep up with her last night.
WILLOW Amy.
AMY No, it's true! I mean, I can do some transmography, but she is messing with dimensions and everything, it was awesome! This blowhard dude, first she made his mouth disappear? Thank god. And then-
AMY I'm talking too much. Sorry. It's just been ... you know ... me and a bag of pellets for the last few years, so...
TARA No, it's, it's fine. It's just, um, I, I re-really need to go.
WILLOW Tara, uh, you left some stuff upstairs, it's in-
TARA I'll get them later.
WILLOW Tara!
DAWN Buffy! Uh, where were you, are you okay?
BUFFY I'm fine.
DAWN You're not, you're all sore and limpy.
BUFFY I, I'm not ... sore, I just... ... I had a fight, you know, the ... all-nighter kind.
DAWN Figured. I knew that's why you didn't call. So, what's the big bad? Uh, should we be worried?
BUFFY No. I mean, I, I think you guys are, are safe. Tara was here?
WILLOW I guess she stayed over with Dawn.
BUFFY You guess? Where were you?
WILLOW We went out, kinda lost track of time.
BUFFY Oh.
WILLOW I never would have if I knew you weren't coming home.
BUFFY No, o-of course, I mean, you know, it wasn't ... intentional. And, you know, everyone's safe. You are, right? You're okay?
DAWN Oh, yeah. I mean, um, I think my pancakes are burning, but...
DAWN Tara was making...
WILLOW I've, uh ... I've gotta get some sleep.
BUFFY Me too.
AMY Yeah. I should go home. Dad's expecting me.
WILLOW Okay. I'll call you later.
AMY Yeah, good.
BUFFY You sure you're all right? I'm sorry about everything.
DAWN It's okay. You should rest. You're beat from monster-wrestling all night.
BUFFY Yeah. Right. Thanks.
WILLOW Yeah, I'm gonna crash too. Night Dawnie.
DAWN No problem. I'll just ... go find some awake people.
XANDER All these demons are starting to look alike. You got reptiles ... reptiles with horns ... reptiles with gills.
XANDER And I'm still finding nothing of the 'steal a diamond, freeze a guy' variety.
XANDER Ahn, would you hand me that one next to you?
XANDER Great, we're not even married yet and already you've stopped listening to me.
XANDER Anya!
ANYA I'm sorry, but this is pointless! We've been researching forever, and we're not even close to finding out who robbed that museum.
BUFFY What's up?
XANDER Anya has a theory. She thinks that Martha Stewart froze that guy.
ANYA Don't be ridiculous. Martha Stewart isn't a demon. She's a witch.
XANDER Please, she- Really?
ANYA Of course. Nobody could do that much decoupage without calling on the powers of darkness.
BUFFY Guys, while this is fascinating, we still have work to do.
ANYA I know I do! I can't decide whether to put my bridesmaids in cocktail dresses ... ...or the traditional burlap with blood larva.
XANDER The traditional what?
ANYA Well, I was a demon for a thousand years, you don't expect me to turn my back on all the ways of my people.
BUFFY Uh, can I weigh in on this whole me wearing larva-
ANYA/XANDER No.
ANYA At least I'm not asking you to perform the groom's rite of self-flagellation.
BUFFY Uh, guys! There's something out there?
XANDER There is. And as much as I hate to admit that my ... bizarre bride-to-be has a point ... we're gettin' nowhere here, Buff. Maybe it's time to try something new. You know? Hit the streets, get Spike on it.
BUFFY No! No, no Spike. And no hit the streets, we, we, we stay put, you know? Away from distractions. We'll figure this out.
ANYA What about Willow, can't she do something?
BUFFY Maybe. But she's home sleeping.
XANDER Sleeping? She sick?
BUFFY No, she was out late. With Amy.
ANYA And I'm bizarre. At least I didn't dump you to hang out with an ex-rat.
BUFFY No, it's not like that, you know, she's just ... helping Amy through a transition.
XANDER And making herself a playmate to do magic with. Someone who won't monitor her like Tara.
BUFFY No, Willow's a grownup. You know, maybe she doesn't need to be monitored.
BUFFY You know, she's going through something, but we're not her. I mean ... m-maybe she has reasons for acting this way. And, so what if she crossed a line? You know, we all do stuff. Stupid stuff. But, then we learn. And, and we learn, and, and we don't do it again. Okay, so, you know, who are we to get all judgey?
XANDER Not judgey, Buff. Just, observey.
ANYA Yeah, all we're saying is, she's acting different. You know, she's not herself.
AMY So what do you wanna do? It's gonna be hard to top last night.
WILLOW Yeah, I don't know if I can. I felt awful today, and I couldn't do magic. Took me all day to get my powers back. I think we should just take it easy.
AMY I have a better idea.
WILLOW What?
AMY I know this guy ... and he knows spells that last for days. And the burnout factor is like, nothing.
WILLOW Really? He's a warlock?
AMY I guess. Look, I am not kidding you. This guy ... will blow your mind. He will take you to places that you can't even imagine.
WILLOW Is it dangerous?
AMY Would that stop you?
AMY This is it.
WILLOW Where? I thought you said the guy lived around here.
AMY He does. You can't feel it?
WILLOW What do you-
AMY Here.
WILLOW It's hot.
AMY Come on.
AMY It's cool, isn't it? The place is cloaked.
WILLOW Yeah.
AMY Moves around a lot too. Keeps Rack out of trouble.
WILLOW Rack, who's-
GIRL Rack, Rack, it's my turn.
GUY No, man, you said I was up.
GIRL Bull, I've been here for hours!
RACK I believe these two are next.
AMY Thanks, Rack, for taking us. I know it's been a while. You'll never believe-
RACK You were a rat.
AMY How did you know?
RACK I hope that taught you not to mess with spells you can't handle. You should leave that in the hands of a professional.
RACK Oh. This one's givin' off vibes.
WILLOW I don't mean to ... vibe at you, I, if it's in a negative way.
RACK No, no, I-I mean you ... have power, girl, it's just coming off you in waves.
WILLOW Not so much.
WILLOW I mean, I-I can do stuff, but, I get tapped out quick, and I've used practically every spell I know.
RACK And what do you want me to do about that?
WILLOW I-I don't know, I, I thought- Amy said-
RACK Amy said. Amy said I could help you. But did Amy say how you could help me?
WILLOW No, I-I have some money, a-a bit-
RACK Not money.
WILLOW Well, I could help you with your computer, I'm really handy-
RACK Just relax, I'm not gonna hurt you. You gotta give a little to get a little, right?
AMY It's okay. It's over fast.
RACK That's right. I'm just gonna take a little tour.
RACK You taste ... like strawberries.
DAWN Ow.
DAWN Ow, ow! Ow.
WILLOW Or you could do it the hard way.
DAWN Spatulas are for wimps. I'm making peanut-butter-and-banana quesadillas. You want?
WILLOW No thanks. I'm, uh, more in water mode.
DAWN Ow. Ow. Ow. You sure? It's my own brand-new invention.
WILLOW I'm sure. No, my ... tummy's feeling kinda rumbly.
DAWN Your loss. Very delicious.
DAWN Buffy called. She said she was going straight from the Magic Box to do some patrolling.
WILLOW Oh, did she need help?
DAWN No, she was just calling to check in. For like the tenth time today. I think she's feeling all Joan Crawford 'cause of the other night.
WILLOW Yeah, about that, I'm ... I'm really sorry. I shouldn't have assumed Buffy would be here.
DAWN Right. Assume would make you an ass out of me. Heh, um, or, uh, something. Anyway, please, it's cool. I mean, it's not like I even needed Tara to stay over. I'm so totally fine on my own.
DAWN But, you are gonna be around tonight, right?
WILLOW Right, totally! Uh, we can do something if you want. A movie maybe?
DAWN Really? But I thought you weren't feeling so good.
WILLOW Well ... nothing a little Dawnie time won't fix. If you feel like baggin' the peanut butter, I'll even buy you dinner.
DAWN Thank god! Remind me never to invent that again. Yecch.
WILLOW Great, this'll be great. I'll just grab the paper and see what's playing.
DAWN I'll leave a note for Buffy on the refrigerator. That's the first place she goes after patrolling. She's such a pig after she kills things.
BUFFY Hello?
BUFFY Willow?
BUFFY Dawn?
BUFFY What's going on?
AMY Uh-oh. Busted.
BUFFY Where's Willow?
AMY She said - she said I, I-I could- -wait!
BUFFY What is this?
AMY It's not what you think it is, it's sage!
BUFFY That is what I think it is. What's going on? Where's Willow and Dawn?
AMY I ... I saw - I saw her, but that was - I like your coat. When does the slayer find time to shop?
BUFFY So they didn't let you in?
AMY Not that they know of.
BUFFY What else did you take?
AMY Nothing. Ow!
BUFFY What else?!
AMY Please! Please, I need this stuff. Willow wants me to have it, she understands.
BUFFY Understands what? Breaking into someone's house for kitchen spices? No, I don't think so.
AMY You should. She's as bad as I am, worse. Bet she's at Rack's right now.
BUFFY Rack's?
AMY A place. He does spells, heavy stuff. Willow's his new favorite.
BUFFY She's there? With Dawn?
AMY Ohh, don't shake me again, super strength. I think I'm gonna boot.
BUFFY Then tell me where this place is, and I won't.
AMY Well, it's downtown, but it moves.
BUFFY What do you mean, it moves?
AMY It's downtown, I'm, I'm not sure where it would be tonight exactly-
BUFFY Tell me how to find it.
AMY You just kinda have to feel it out ... oh god, I think I'm gonna-
WILLOW So, uh, the burger was good? You liked it?
DAWN Are you kidding? It was like a meat party in my mouth. Okay, now I'm just a kid, and even *I* know that came out wrong. Uh, it was good. But you should have had something.
WILLOW I will. I'll eat. I'm ... saving myself for popcorn. The other day, you had fun?
DAWN Mm, what other day? Give me a Mon or a Fri here, something to work with.
WILLOW The other day with Tara.
DAWN Oh! Uh, yeah. I-I mean, it was, it was nice. Uh, but it wasn't a laugh riot. She's sad and everything.
WILLOW Did she say something?
DAWN Uh, not exactly. I can just tell, by the way she was acting.
WILLOW Oh.
DAWN Uh, are you sure you're okay? You look a little-
WILLOW No, I'm fine. And Tara's in her new place and everything, she's all settled in?
DAWN Um ... we really didn't get into ... well... Is this right? I-is this the way to the movies?
WILLOW Oh yeah, I'm, uh, I just, uh, took you the long way around. But we're almost there. I, uh, just have to make one quick stop first.
DAWN What is this place? Why is it hidden?
WILLOW I don't know, it's cool, isn't it? Okay, you just hang here for a minute ... and I'll, I'll be back. You want me to conjure you a magazine or something?
DAWN Well, what about the movie? It starts at nine.
WILLOW We'll make it. I, I'll just be a minute. And it doesn't matter if we miss the trailers.
DAWN I like the trailers.
RACK What do you think, strawberry? Can you handle some more?
BUFFY God, do you sleep through anything? I was like yelling, and nothing.
SPIKE I'm a bit knackered. Had a long night.
SPIKE Someone should teach you how to use candles in foreplay, luv.
BUFFY Get dressed. Dawn's missing.
SPIKE Again? Ever think about a Lojack for the girl? What's the story?
BUFFY She went out with Willow.
SPIKE Willow? That's kind of a sorry excuse to come by. If you want the touch all you need to do is-
BUFFY Spike. Willow's into something. Okay, her and Dawn have been missing for hours. There, there's some guy named Rack.
SPIKE Rack?
BUFFY Yeah, he's, uh, some sort of-
SPIKE I know who he is, he deals in magic. Black stuff, dangerous.
BUFFY I've been all over downtown and I can't find his place.
SPIKE Because he cloaks it. You can't feel it unless you're into the big bad - a witch or a vampire or-
BUFFY So let's go!
SPIKE Oh, that's right. Hide your blushing eyes.
SLEAZY_CIGARETTE_GUY Hey, wait your turn.
WILLOW Hey Dawnie. It's movie time.
DAWN Do you know how long I've been out here? It's too late for the movie. And that guy smells like-
DAWN Are-are you, are you okay?
WILLOW Fine. Let's get outta here.
WILLOW So, what do you wanna do, cutie?
DAWN It's late. I just wanna go home.
WILLOW Uch! No way! I said we were gonna have fun, and we're gonna have fun.
DAWN I'm serious, I think we should just get out of here.
WILLOW ' I think we should just get out of here.' Come on, Dawnie, it's grownup time, do you wanna play with the grownups or not?
DAWN Why are you acting this way?
WILLOW Oh, don't get all weird on me, we're fine. Everything's fine.
BUFFY Anything?
SPIKE Not yet. I might pick up on it if you stop asking me about every two seconds.
BUFFY Spike, if you're dragging this out...
SPIKE What, so I can linger near your precious self? Get a grip.
BUFFY Like you've never drawn things out before.
SPIKE Maybe, but we've been through this, haven't we? Things have changed.
BUFFY Will you quit that? The only thing that's different is that I'm disgusted with myself. That's the power of your charms. Last night ... was the most perverse ... degrading experience of my life.
SPIKE Yeah. Me too.
BUFFY That might be how you get off, but it's not my style.
SPIKE No, it's your calling. Gave me a run for my money, Slayer.
SPIKE Now, I admit it. You've had me by the short hairs. I love you. You know it. But I got my rocks back. You felt something last night.
BUFFY Not love.
SPIKE Not yet. But I'm in your system now. You're gonna crave me, like I crave blood. And the next time you come crawling, if you don't stop being such a bitch, maybe I will bite you.
BUFFY That, that's it! I want you out of my life! Out of my work, out of my home-
SPIKE Too late for that. You invited me in already. And as for your work, you need me. Like tonight.
BUFFY I'll find Dawn myself.
SPIKE You really gonna put your little sis in danger just to spite me?
DAWN Willow. I'm serious. I'm going home.
WILLOW Uch, then go! God, I thought we were gonna hang.
DAWN Well, you're not coming with me?
WILLOW Well, I don't know. Maybe I could just, uh, pop you back!
DAWN With magic?
DAWN What's that?
WILLOW What? I didn't-
DAWN Uh ... I'm getting out of here.
WILLOW Aw, Dawnie, don't. It was probably a cat or something like that.
WILLOW Oh, it's okay, he's not real.
DAWN Seems real! Very! Real!
DEMON You summoned me, witch.
WILLOW I, I didn't-
DEMON Did. You raised hell with your magicks.
DEMON Fresh.
WILLOW Don't! She has nothing to do with it, it was me!
DEMON Yessss.
DAWN He's coming! He's too fast!
WILLOW Open!
WILLOW Get in!
WILLOW Close!
WILLOW Drive!
DAWN What are you doing?!
WILLOW Woo!
WILLOW Take that, scuz-
DAWN Oh god.
BUFFY Dawn!
BUFFY *Now* you're scared? Better late than never.
DAWN No, no!
BUFFY Dawn.
BUFFY What happened? Are you okay?
DAWN Uh ... He was after Willow, she made the car drive, don't! No, don't!
BUFFY I need to see, okay, let me see your arm.
WILLOW Dawn? Oh god, there's blood.
BUFFY Okay, we need to get her to a doctor.
WILLOW Is she okay? Is she okay?
BUFFY Back off, Will, I got her.
WILLOW No, Dawnie!
BUFFY I mean it, stay away from her!
WILLOW Dawnie! Dawnie, I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry, it was an accident! I didn't see, I'm so, so sorry.
WILLOW Dawnie! Dawnie, don't!
WILLOW Dawnie, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
WILLOW I'm sorry! I'm sorry...
BUFFY Get up.
WILLOW I screwed it up, everything, Tara...
BUFFY Yeah, you know what, you did screw up, okay? You could have killed her! You almost did!
WILLOW I know! I know! I can't stop, Buffy! I tried and I can't.
BUFFY You can.
WILLOW I can't! I can't, I ju ... god, I need help. Please! Please help me, please.
WILLOW Please.
WILLOW Is she okay?
BUFFY She's sleeping. The E.R. doc gave her something for the pain, it knocked her out.
WILLOW But she's gonna be all right?
BUFFY It's a fracture. You know, it's gonna take some time.
WILLOW God, I'm ... sorry. I'm so...
BUFFY I just don't understand. I don't understand why you'd go to see somebody like Rack, and I certainly don't understand why you'd drag Dawn into it.
WILLOW I don't know. The magic, I ... I thought I had it under control, and then ... I didn't.
BUFFY Because of Tara?
WILLOW No. It started before she left. It's why she left.
BUFFY Seemed like things were going so well.
WILLOW It was. But I mean ... if you could be ... you know, plain old Willow or super Willow, who would you be? I guess you don't actually have an option on the whole super thing.
BUFFY Will, there's nothing wrong with you. You don't need magic to be special.
WILLOW Don't I? I mean, Buffy, who was I? Just ... some girl. Tara didn't even know that girl.
BUFFY You are more than some girl. And Tara wants you to stop. She loves you.
WILLOW We don't know that.
BUFFY I know that. I promise you.
WILLOW I just ... it took me away from myself, I was ... free.
BUFFY I get that. More than you- But it's wrong. People get hurt.
WILLOW If something had happened to Dawn tonight ... something worse...
BUFFY I know.
WILLOW No, I don't think you do. I-I ... I was out of my mind, I ... I did things I can't even...
WILLOW It won't happen again, I promise. No more spells. I'm finished.
BUFFY Good. I think it's right. To give it up. No matter how good it feels.
WILLOW It's not worth it. Not if it messes with the people I love.
WILLOW The magic wasn't all great. I won't miss the nosebleeds and the headaches and stuff.
BUFFY There you go.
WILLOW Or ... keeping stinky yak cheese in my bra. Don't ask.
BUFFY Now I don't have to.
WILLOW 'Cause it's over.
BUFFY Exactly. It's over.
