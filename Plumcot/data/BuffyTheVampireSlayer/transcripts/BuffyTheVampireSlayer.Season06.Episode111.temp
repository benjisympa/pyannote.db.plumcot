DAWN Candles?! We can't have candles?
BUFFY Dawn, it's magic clearance. Everything must go.
DAWN B-but they're just candles!
BUFFY Well, yeah, you know, to you and me they're just candles, but to ... witches they're ... like bongs.
BUFFY So, no candles, no charms ... no-
WILLOW Bird.
BUFFY No bird?
WILLOW That peacock on the table. It has two crystals in it.
WILLOW Tara, she... she left them.
BUFFY I'll make sure she gets them.
BUFFY Dawn, do me a favor, can you grab the fertility god statue on the desk over there?
DAWN Kokopelli?! No! I love him! And he was Mom's.
DAWN Why do we have to get rid of so many things I like?
BUFFY Dawn, I explained this to you. Willow has a problem. The next few weeks are gonna be ... crazy hard on her as it is.
BUFFY Any reminder of, of what it is that she's trying to stay away from, you know, could cause her to ... give in to temptation.
BUFFY And that would be bad.
WARREN Okay, that's it. It's finally done.
WARREN I mean, it still needs a trial run, but it's-
JONATHAN Kind of clunky-looking.
WARREN What?!
ANDREW I pictured something cooler. More ILM, less Ed Wood.
WARREN You wanna see cool? I'll show you cool.
JONATHAN Mama!
JONATHAN Did it ... is it...
ANDREW Yeah.
JONATHAN I'd call that a successful test.
WARREN Well, that's just half the test.
JONATHAN Hey! Hey!
JONATHAN You penis!
WARREN Oh, cheer up, Frodo. Because thanks to my brains, and our mystical gem, we got ourselves an invisibility ray. And I'd say that makes us pretty much unstoppable.
BUFFY Dawn, come on, you gotta eat breakfast! Xander's gonna be here any second.
BUFFY She's gonna be late for school again.
BUFFY How are you doing?
WILLOW I'm okay. Not 'ready to head back to classes, face the world' okay, but ... the shakiness is only semi now. I thought I'd spend the day fishing the net, for more poop on the, uh, stolen diamond.
BUFFY I called you before.
DAWN Didn't hear you.
WILLOW Hey Dawnie, uh, I'm making you a nice omelet.
DAWN Not hungry.
BUFFY Dawn, you need to eat something.
DAWN Thanks for your concern.
WILLOW Okay, I deserve the wrath of Dawn, but ... why is she taking it out on you?
BUFFY Because I let it happen.
WILLOW Buffy, I was the one who-
BUFFY Who was drowning. My best friend. And I was too wrapped up in my own dumb life to even notice.
SPIKE Morning.
BUFFY What are you doing? And, here?
SPIKE Just, uh, took a stroll. Found myself in your neck of the woods.
BUFFY Couldn't find a less flammable time of day to take a stroll?
SPIKE Yeah, well, the fact is my lighter's gone missing. Thought it might have, uh, dropped outta my pocket the last time I was here.
BUFFY Haven't seen it.
WILLOW I'm, uh, gonna head back to my room, get dressed.
BUFFY Oh, I...
BUFFY Lame.
SPIKE What?
BUFFY You. Making up excuses.
SPIKE Oh, don't flatter yourself, luv. Bloody fond of that lighter.
BUFFY Stop trying to see me. And stop calling me that.
SPIKE So, um ... what should I call you then? Pet?
SPIKE Sweetheart? My, uh ... little goldilocks?
SPIKE You know I love this hair. The way it bounces around when you-
SPIKE Ah-ah-ah! This flapjack's not ready to be flipped.
BUFFY What the hell is that supposed to-
BUFFY Stop that.
XANDER Good Godfrey Cambridge, Spike!
XANDER Still trying to mack on Buffy? Wake up already. Never gonna happen! Only a complete loser would ever hook up with you. Well, unless she's a simpleton like Harmony, or a, or a nut sack like Drusilla-
BUFFY Hey! You really need to get Dawn off to school. Let's go, go fetch her, okay?
BUFFY You can let yourself out, right Spike?
BUFFY Dawn! You better get going, Xander's here!
DAWN Here.
BUFFY Okay, you have everything you need?
DAWN Yep.
BUFFY And after school, you-
DAWN Yeah yeah. Let's go, Xander.
BUFFY You will come straight home.
DAWN Sure. Maybe we can find some time for you to get me into another car accident.
MS._KROGER Oh, good morning. You must be Dawn.
BUFFY Can I help you?
MS._KROGER I'm Doris Kroger, from Social Services. We had an appointment?
BUFFY Oh, for Wednesday.
MS._KROGER This is Wednesday.
BUFFY Right! Well ... Dawn, you better...
BUFFY And, and Xander, you'll drive safely?
XANDER Yes ma'am.
MS._KROGER Little bit on the tardy side, isn't she?
BUFFY Yeah, well, uh, it's been one of those mornings, you know. Hey, come on in.
BUFFY Sorry about the mess, you know, doing a little house-cleaning.
SPIKE So, we gonna chat this out, or what?
BUFFY Uh ... now's really not a-a good time. Um, I have company.
SPIKE No worries. I'll wait.
MS._KROGER Um, Miss Summers, if you and your boyfriend would like to-
BUFFY He is NOT-
BUFFY Not my, my boyfriend, he's, um, just ... a...
BUFFY Spike ... this nice woman is, uh, from Social Services?
SPIKE Oh, right! Uh ... hey! Buffy's a great mom. She takes good care of her little sis. Like, um, when Dawn was hanging out too much in my crypt, Buffy put a right stop to it.
MS._KROGER I'm sorry, did you say-
BUFFY Crib! He said crib. You know kids today and their buggin' street slang.
BUFFY Uh, Spike, didn't you have to go now, you know, because of that thing?
SPIKE Uh, thing, yeah. Uh, my blanket.
MS._KROGER He sleeps here?
BUFFY What? No! No. Oh, uh, the, the, the blanket. That's, um, uh, it's a security thing, you know. He ... has issues. Nope, just me and Dawn living here.
WILLOW Buffy, I'm not feeling hot, so uh, I'm gonna take a quick nap, okay?
BUFFY Okay, Will!
BUFFY That's Willow. She, uh, she kind of lives here too, actually.
MS._KROGER Oh, so you live with another woman.
BUFFY Oh! Oh, it's not a, a gay thing, you know, I mean, well...
BUFFY ...she's gay, but, but we don't ... gay. Not that there's anything - Oh! Wrong with... You know, I know what that looks like, but I, I swear, it's not ... what it looks like. It's *magic* weed.
BUFFY It's not mine.
MS._KROGER I think I've seen enough.
BUFFY No, a-actually, I really don't think that you have. It's just ... i-it's been kind of, kind of a, a bad time.
MS._KROGER It's been a bad time now for a while, hasn't it, Ms. Summers? Your sister's grades have fallen sharply in the last year, due in large part to her frequent absences and lateness.
BUFFY But there-there are good reasons.
MS._KROGER Oh, I'm sure there are. But my interest is in Dawn's welfare. And the stability of her home life, something I'm just not convinced that an unemployed young woman like yourself can provide.
BUFFY I can. I, I do!
MS._KROGER Well, we'll just have to see about that then, won't we?
MS._KROGER Oh, and I'm, uh, going to recommend immediate probation in my report.
BUFFY What does that mean?
MS._KROGER It means that I'll be monitoring you very closely, Ms. Summers. And if I don't see that things are improving, well, I'll be forced to recommend that you be stripped of your sister's guardianship.
BUFFY You can't do that.
MS._KROGER I do what is in Dawn's best interest ... as should you. Have a nice day.
SPIKE Didn't go well, huh?
BUFFY Why won't you go?
SPIKE I just thought you'd want-
BUFFY Get out of here!
SPIKE Just getting what I came for, luv.
SPIKE So long, goldilocks.
CLEO Well, I-I think I can work with this.
CLEO What exactly would you like me to do?
BUFFY Just make me ... different.
ANDREW I'm scared, what if we get caught?
JONATHAN No way, we'll be invisible. Plus their security's gotten lax.
WARREN You should know. You've cased this joint enough.
WARREN Okay, this is it.
WARREN Remember...
WARREN ...we're professionals.
ANDREW Uh, Slayer!
WARREN What? Wh-where?
ANDREW There. Headed this way.
JONATHAN Give it!
ANDREW No, I need to be invisible!
JONATHAN I need it more, Buffy can't see me!
WARREN Hey, watch it, don't you-
ANDREW Oopsie.
XANDER What happened to Buffy? She's gone.
ANYA She's right here.
ANYA Table four. I put her with your family.
XANDER Great. Except, we don't hate Buffy.
XANDER Let's put her back at table one.
ANYA Well, where do I put D'Hoffryn?
XANDER We're not inviting D'Hoffryn.
ANYA We have to, he's my ex-boss! You're inviting your work buddies.
INVISIBLE_BUFFY She's got a point.
XANDER Hey, Buffy...
XANDER Where ... where are you?
INVISIBLE_BUFFY At table four, apparently.
ANYA Well, that remains to be seen. Like you.
INVISIBLE_BUFFY Don't strain yourself looking, Xander. I'm invisible girl.
INVISIBLE_BUFFY Uh, Xander?
XANDER Sorry! Her clothes are ... invisible ... too. Buffy, how did this hap ... wait a sec, have you been feeling ... ignored lately?
INVISIBLE_BUFFY Yeah, ignored. I wish. No, this isn't a Marcie deal. I don't know what happened. I left Main Street after getting my hair cut, and-
ANYA You cut your hair?
INVISIBLE_BUFFY Oh, yeah!
ANYA Really? How short?
INVISIBLE_BUFFY Um, about up to here ... well, if you could see my hand, it's kind of above my shoulders.
ANYA Ahh, that sounds so adorable! I was thinking about getting my hair cut before the wed-
XANDER Can we get back to freaking out about no-show Buffy? This is serious.
INVISIBLE_BUFFY I know. It kind of fits the day I've had.
INVISIBLE_BUFFY Willow's still a wreck, Dawn's mad at both of us, and the social services lady put me through a wringer. Says she's gonna watch me. I'd like to see her try now.
INVISIBLE_BUFFY You know, there may be an upside to no-see-me.
XANDER Buff, did you say anyone, or ... anything suspicious before you ... cleared out?
INVISIBLE_BUFFY Nope, didn't see nothin'. See what I did there, with the eyeballs?
ANYA Why would anyone make her invisible anyway? I mean, invisible Slayer's gotta be way more effective than the standard variety.
XANDER Yeah, I'm less with the why and more with the how. We get the how, then we got how to make her unseen sight seen again, right?
INVISIBLE_BUFFY 'Saright!
XANDER Buffy, could you focus please?
INVISIBLE_BUFFY I am! Just ... this is kind of fun.
ANYA Well, it would help if we had a little bit more to go on. Or ... anything to go on.
XANDER Well, I could go check the spot where Buffy disappeared. Snoop for clues.
INVISIBLE_BUFFY Yeah, right. Uh, hey, you know what? I'm just gonna ... go for a walk.
XANDER A walk?
INVISIBLE_BUFFY Yeah. Um, clear my head. You guys keep working on those whats and hows. Clear my head.
XANDER Buffy!
ANYA Well, seems pretty obvious it's some kind of spell that's done this to her.
XANDER Spell from who? You said it yourself, it makes no sense for one of her enemies to make her invisible.
ANYA Maybe it's a mistake.
XANDER A magical mistake. Who'd be messing with that kind of pow-
XANDER Willow.
WILLOW Xander!
XANDER How's it going?
WILLOW Um ... good. I, I, uh, found ... out some stuff about the diamond stolen from the museum. It's called the Illuminata, and there's rumors of it having quasi-mystical quantum properties.
XANDER Willow, we need to talk.
WILLOW We ... are talking. Well, I'm talking and you're looking at me funny.
XANDER Is there something you wanna tell me?
WILLOW It was nothing, I ... I-I didn't slip.
XANDER Will, nobody's mad. Relapse is a part of recovery, we understand that. We just have to figure a way to fix it.
WILLOW Fix what?
XANDER Fix Buffy.
WILLOW Buffy's broken?
XANDER Will, you know what I'm talki - You don't know.
XANDER Rhymes with ... 'blinvisible'?
WILLOW What?
XANDER Buffy was in town, leaving the haircutting place, when she suddenly just-
WILLOW Buffy got her hair cut?
XANDER Yeah! Adorable, apparently. I personally couldn't tell, since she's all 'blinvisible.'
WILLOW And you think I had something to do with this?
XANDER Uh, no ... not ... Well, come on, Will. Some of the spells you've done have caused some weird stuff to happen to each of us at one time or another. And let's not forget the recent forgetting.
WILLOW Oh. I see, so now when anything nasty happens, I get conveniently blamed for it?
XANDER No one's blaming!
WILLOW So ... I guess it wouldn't matter if I just jump off the wagon completely ... since you already think I'm making pit stops.
XANDER Well, look, if you said you didn't do it - Willow, where you going?
WILLOW For a walk.
WARREN Couple of circuits are burned out, and the wiring's all fried.
ANDREW But we had so many plans. Naked women, and all ... well, all-all the naked women. This is all your fault, if you hadn't grabbed it from me-
JONATHAN Hey, we got a lot bigger problems here, bonehead. The Slayer's invisible now?
ANDREW He's right. She could be anywhere. Even here, right now.
ANDREW Watching. Listening to every word we say. For all we know, she could be one of us!
ANDREW Oh, wait, no, guys, that isn't true.
WARREN I wouldn't sweat the Slayer too much.
JONATHAN Says you. In my book an invisible slayer means a whole world of trouble.
INVISIBLE_BUFFY I am the ghost of fashion victims past. Studded caps? Not a good idea.
INVISIBLE_BUFFY Hey! I'm doing you a favor!
INVISIBLE_BUFFY Naah ... too easy.
INVISIBLE_BUFFY Hmm...
INVISIBLE_BUFFY So long, copper!
COP Hey ... Hey! That's mine! Stop!
INVISIBLE_BUFFY Hello, Mrs. Kroger.
MS._KROGER What - Where's my...
MS._KROGER Losing my mind.
MS._KROGER Okay, who's the-
INVISIBLE_BUFFY Kill, kill, kill!
MS._KROGER What?
COWORKER I didn't say anything.
MS._KROGER Not you! The mug, it's-
MS._KROGER But I ... I heard something.
INVISIBLE_BUFFY Kill, Doris. Kill everybody.
INVISIBLE_BUFFY You know you want to.
MS._KROGER Shut up, shut up, just shut up!
INVISIBLE_BUFFY Okay ... no ... no...
INVISIBLE_BUFFY Yahtzee!
BOSS Uh, Doris!
BOSS I've, uh, got a few, so if you wanna discuss that case file now...
MS._KROGER What? Oh! Oh yes, the, um, Summers file, it's, uh, it's right over here.
MS._KROGER Uh, it's a fifteen-year-old girl, living under her older sister's guardianship. The house is a complete-
BOSS What is this? 'All work and no play make Doris a dull girl'?
MS._KROGER What?
BOSS 'All work and no play make Doris' - the pages are filled with it.
MS._KROGER I ... I...
MS._KROGER I, I, I didn't do this, I ...
MS._KROGER It was the voice.
BOSS Excuse me?
MS._KROGER There was a voice, before. It made my coffee dance. It told me to-
BOSS To ... what?
MS._KROGER Nothing.
BOSS Doris ... take the rest of the day off. See your doctor.
MS._KROGER But what about my cases?
BOSS We'll, uh ... put someone else on them. And have them redo the Summers interview.
MS._KROGER I'm not crazy. I am not crazy!
BOSS Well, no one said that you were.
XANDER Hey Will. Whatcha doin'?
WILLOW Look, Xander, I - I figured out this was where Buffy disappeared from what you told me, so don't start jumping to any conclusions.
XANDER No jumping, look, feet firmly planted.
WILLOW I'm not feeling like myself right now, sorry.
XANDER Me too. Sorry. So! What have we found out so far?
WILLOW Well, take a look at that!
WILLOW Something sped outta here pretty dann quick to, to make that kind of tread mark.
XANDER Well, this could have been made any time.
WILLOW Yeah, but this ... wasn't.
XANDER What is it?
WILLOW Paint that I scraped off the fire hydrant.
XANDER What fire hydrant? Ow!
WILLOW That one.
WILLOW Whatever hit this fire hydrant hit it after it was made invisible. And betcha by golly wow, that something was the same something that shot out of that alley.
XANDER Black paint? Buffy's phantom van. We gotta let Buffy - whoa!
XANDER There's something there.
WILLOW I-it's a pylon, one of those orange traffic cones. You should take it to the Magic Box. It might help you and Anya figure out what kind of spell was used.
XANDER What about you?
WILLOW Well, I got paint scrapings... ...and a tire mark. I'm gonna find this van that's been stalking Buffy. By the way, where *is* Buffy?
WOMAN_ON_TV Oh my god, the blood! Look at all the blood!
SPIKE Whatever beastie you are, I know you're here. And I hurt beasties.
Invisible_Buffy's_POV moving past Spike from behind, looking down toward his butt and then onward.
SPIKE Hey, watch it.
SPIKE A ghost, is it? Go and haunt the living, like a good spook.
SPIKE Buffy?
INVISIBLE_BUFFY I told you ... stop trying to see me.
ANYA Oh, I got it!
XANDER Really?
ANYA Yeah, we'll put D'Hoffryn at your parents' table, and move your Uncle Rory to table five near the bar.
XANDER Ahn honey, we're looking for invisibility spells here.
ANYA Well, obviously I haven't found anything yet. At least nothing that would explain why things near Buffy become invisible.
ANYA Ew! Xander!
XANDER What happened?
ANYA An unpleasant tactile experience, like putting my hand in pudding.
XANDER Ew!
ANYA Like pudding, am I right? Rice, or tapioca, lumpy like that.
XANDER We have to find Buffy, she's gotta know.
ANYA I don't think Buffy's gonna be too broken up over a pylon.
XANDER Anya, whatever's happening to the pylon will probably happen to her. If we don't find Buffy, I-I mean ... if we don't figure out how this was done...
ANYA She's pudding?
JONATHAN What do you mean she's gonna fade away?
WARREN The Slayer got slammed with a big-ass dose of radiation when the gun overloaded. Her cells are mutating at an accelerated rate. Eventually her molecular makeup will start losing its integrity and then ... pfft.
ANDREW But, wouldn't that kill her?
WARREN Well, lemme think. Yeah!
JONATHAN Wait a minute! We're not killing anybody. Especially not Buffy!
WARREN You guys are so immature! We're villains! When are you gonna get that through your thick skulls?
JONATHAN We're not killers, we're crime lords!
ANDREW Yeah! Like, like Lex Luthor. He's always trying to take over Metropolis, but he doesn't kill Superman!
WARREN Because it's Superman's book, you moron!
ANDREW But Lex doesn't kill him, does he?!
JONATHAN Listen, Warren ... you get that ray working and the first thing we're gonna do is find Buffy and re-visible her before it's too late!
JONATHAN You got me?!
WARREN Fine.
WARREN Whatever you guys say.
XANDER Spike?
XANDER Spike?
XANDER What are you doing?
SPIKE What am I ... What does it look like I'm doing, you nit? I'm exercising, aren't I?
XANDER Exercising. Naked. In bed.
SPIKE A man shouldn't use immortality as an excuse to let himself go. Gotta keep fit for the killing.
XANDER Yuh-huh. Looks like you had a little trouble upstairs. Mini-disaster area.
SPIKE So what, you just come here to criticize my housekeeping?
XANDER No, uh, no. I'm looking for Buf-
SPIKE Haven't seen her.
XANDER Well, uh, you wouldn't. The fact is, she's come down with a slight case of invisibility.
SPIKE Yeah? How did, uh...
XANDER We don't know yet.
XANDER Anyway, she's not at the house, and I really, really need to find her.
SPIKE Uh, tell you what, I'll ... take a peek around first chance I get... and if we bump into each other, I'll clue her that you're on the lookout.
XANDER After your ... exercises.
SPIKE Yeah, right.
XANDER You know, kidding aside, Spike ... you really should get a girlfriend.
SPIKE That was bloody stupid.
INVISIBLE_BUFFY What's the matter? Ashamed to be seen with me?
INVISIBLE_BUFFY Come on. He had no idea I was here. This is perfect.
SPIKE Perfect for you.
INVISIBLE_BUFFY Well, picture me confused. I thought this was what you wanted.
SPIKE What I want...
SPIKE This vanishing act's right liberating for you, innit? Go anywhere you want. Do anything you want. Or anyone.
INVISIBLE_BUFFY What are you talking ab-
SPIKE The only reason you're here, is that you're not here.
INVISIBLE_BUFFY Right. Of course, as usual there's something wrong with Buffy. She came back all wrong. You know, I didn't ask for this to happen to me.
SPIKE Not too put off by it though, are you?
INVISIBLE_BUFFY No! Maybe because for the first time since ... I'm free.
INVISIBLE_BUFFY Free of rules and reports ... free of this life.
SPIKE Free of life? Got another name for that. Dead.
INVISIBLE_BUFFY Why do you always have to ... I thought we were having fun.
SPIKE Yeah, now! But sooner or later your chums are gonna work out a way to bring you back to living color. You need to go. Get dressed if you can find your clothes, and push off. 'Cause if I can't have all of you, I'd rather-
SPIKE Okay, that's cheating.
INVISIBLE_BUFFY I don't believe this.
INVISIBLE_BUFFY He threw *me* out? He threw *me*. Did I, like, fall into some ... backward dimension here? Is this Bizarro World? And after he's always going on and on about being the only one that understands me. 'We're alike, you and me. Birds of a bloody feather.' Uh! He's so ...
INVISIBLE_BUFFY Hey, I'm walking here!
INVISIBLE_BUFFY Insensitive! That's what he is.
INVISIBLE_BUFFY Willow? Willow! Dawn? Hey, Dawn, come here. You wanna see something neat?
INVISIBLE_BUFFY There you are!
DAWN Buffy? W-where are you?
INVISIBLE_BUFFY I'm invisible. Check this out.
INVISIBLE_BUFFY Wooo, wooo! Unidentified flying pizza, comin' in for a landing.
DAWN W-what are you talking-
INVISIBLE_BUFFY Okay, not the most clever ad lib, but come on! Points for spontaneity.
DAWN Stop it! Just ... stop.
INVISIBLE_BUFFY Sorry Dawn. I'm, I'm sorry. I-I didn't mean to freak you out.
DAWN Well, what did you think would happen? You're freaking invisible, Buffy.
INVISIBLE_BUFFY I know. Xander and Anya are working on it. Muldering out what happened.
DAWN Well, what about you? Shouldn't you be working on it?
INVISIBLE_BUFFY Of course I-
DAWN Do you even care about, about who did this to you, or, or if you're gonna be stuck this way? You're making jokes and flying pizzas.
INVISIBLE_BUFFY I don't think that's-
DAWN I can't talk to you like this. I can't see you! How can I talk to you if I can't see you?
INVISIBLE_BUFFY Dawn! Dawn!
XANDER Buffy, it's Xander. Where are you? Listen ... we got a new problem here.
ANYA Tell her!
XANDER I'm trying to. Anya and I think whatever made you invisible is slowly killing you.
ANYA Tell her about the pudding!
XANDER Anya! Buff, if we don't ... if this isn't reversed, you're gonna ... well, dissolve, or ... fade ... into nothing.
INVISIBLE_BUFFY Wow.
WARREN Now!
WILLOW Hey! Let go of me!
INVISIBLE_WARREN Congratulations. You're our first hostage.
INVISIBLE_BUFFY Dawn, I'm going out to find Xander. If he calls me-
INVISIBLE_BUFFY Xander?
JONATHAN Don't talk. Just listen, Slayer. You don't have a lot of time.
INVISIBLE_BUFFY Who is this? You sound familiar.
JONATHAN I'm ... nobody. No one you know. We've got your friend Willow, and if you don't want anything nasty to happen to her, you better meet us. Alone.
INVISIBLE_BUFFY Where?
INVISIBLE_WARREN Just stay still, and you won't get hurt.
INVISIBLE_BUFFY You okay, Will?
WILLOW Buffy?
INVISIBLE_BUFFY Where are the bad guys?
INVISIBLE_WARREN All around you, Slayer, so don't try anything.
WILLOW He's bluffing, Buffy, there, there's just three of them, I think.
INVISIBLE_WARREN More than enough to cause some serious carnage, right guys? ... Guys? Guys!
INVISIBLE_JONATHAN Kick! Use the kick!
INVISIBLE_ANDREW I tried that, he keeps blocking it with his drunken monkey fist!
INVISIBLE_BUFFY Ooh, scary video carnage.
INVISIBLE_WARREN Hey! Slayer's here.
INVISIBLE_ANDREW Sorry, didn't see her.
INVISIBLE_WARREN Why don't we continue this in a less crowded area, like, over there.
ALL Where?
INVISIBLE_WARREN Over ... follow me.
WILLOW Ow!
INVISIBLE_BUFFY I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess you guys are the ones who did this to me?
INVISIBLE_JONATHAN It was an accident!
INVISIBLE_BUFFY Who's that?
INVISIBLE_JONATHAN Nobody you know.
WILLOW They're the ones from your mystery van.
INVISIBLE_BUFFY Oh. You. So what annoying thing are you gonna do to me now?
INVISIBLE_WARREN Save your life, make you visible.
INVISIBLE_BUFFY Right. I'm supposed to believe that?
WILLOW They told me everything, Buffy. Something's happening to you that, you're-
INVISIBLE_BUFFY Fading away. I know.
INVISIBLE_WARREN I can fix that.
INVISIBLE_WARREN Pick up that air hockey mallet on the table.
INVISIBLE_BUFFY What for?
INVISIBLE_WARREN It'll give me a target to aim at.
INVISIBLE_WARREN Okay, now hold still, and all your troubles will soon be gone.
WILLOW You're on the wrong setting!
INVISIBLE_WARREN What?
WILLOW The gun, it's not set for reversing the particle ionization. It'll accelerate her molecular dissolution, I saw the plans!
INVISIBLE_WARREN Mind your own business.
INVISIBLE_JONATHAN What's she talking about?
INVISIBLE_BUFFY That's what I'd like to know.
WILLOW Buffy, he's trying to kill you!
INVISIBLE_BUFFY Willow!
INVISIBLE_WARREN Ow!
INVISIBLE_BUFFY Okay, play time's over.
INVISIBLE_WARREN You haven't won yet, Slayer.
INVISIBLE_BUFFY No, that part comes after I beat the snot out of you.
INVISIBLE_WARREN You'll have to find me first! There's three of us, against just one of you.
INVISIBLE_JONATHAN Hey, you lied to us!
INVISIBLE_ANDREW Fight her yourself!
INVISIBLE_WARREN Think she cares about that? I go down, we all go down!
INVISIBLE_BUFFY And I promise, you're all going down.
INVISIBLE_WARREN We may not have your powers, Slayer, but you'll find that we are not so easy to- Ow! Get her!
INVISIBLE_JONATHAN Wait a minute, wait a minute! Who's biting my leg?
INVISIBLE_ANDREW Sorry! Where is she?
INVISIBLE_BUFFY Here.
INVISIBLE_WARREN She can't find us if we split up.
INVISIBLE_WARREN You go that way.
INVISIBLE_JONATHAN Which way?
INVISIBLE_WARREN That way! Over-
INVISIBLE_BUFFY Just keep talking, boys.
INVISIBLE_JONATHAN Ow! Watch the chest hair!
INVISIBLE_BUFFY I know that voice. You-you're-
BUFFY Jonathan?!
BUFFY You have chest hair?
BUFFY Warren?
BUFFY Who are you?
ANDREW Andrew.
ANDREW I summoned the flying monkeys that attacked the high school?
ANDREW During the school play, you know?
WARREN It's Tucker's brother.
JONATHAN Yeah, it's Tucker's brother.
BUFFY/WILLOW Ohh.
BUFFY So you three have, what, banded together to be pains in my ass?
WARREN We're your arch-nemesises ... ses. You may have beaten us this time, Slayer, but next time ... um ... uh, next time...
JONATHAN Maybe not!
WARREN What do you mean, it's locked? You were supposed to check it!
ANDREW I forgot!
BUFFY I give you my arch nemesises...ses.
GUARD What's going on in here? I got a bunch of scared kids saying this place is haunted!
WILLOW Oh my god, Buffy!
BUFFY I know, they're gone. I guess we should chase them.
WILLOW No, your hair! It *is* adorable.
BUFFY Pretty neat, you finding the van. So ... how did you manage to ... do it exactly? I mean, to locate it?
WILLOW The hard way. The spell-free way. The oh-my-god-my-head's-gonna-fall-off, my-feet-are-killing-me way.
WILLOW I don't know how I got through this day.
BUFFY Well, the important thing is that you did. It's a ... good first step.
WILLOW How are you doing, post-invisibleness?
BUFFY Okay. I still have to do some damage control from my giddy-fest. Dawn was pretty freaked out. The whole taking-a-vacation-from-me thing didn't work out so well.
WILLOW Tell me about it.
BUFFY Except ... when I got Xander's message ... you know, that I was ... fading away ... I actually got scared.
WILLOW Well, yeah. Who wouldn't?
BUFFY Me. I wouldn't. Not too long ago I probably would have welcomed it. But I realized ... I'm not saying that I'm doing back-flips about my life, but... I didn't ... I don't ... wanna die. That's something, right?
WILLOW It's something.
WILLOW So I guess we both made good first steps.
BUFFY I guess.
WILLOW Yay for us.
BUFFY Yay.
