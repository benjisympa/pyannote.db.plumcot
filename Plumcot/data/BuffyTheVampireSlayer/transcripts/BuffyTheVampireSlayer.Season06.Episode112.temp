XANDER Now I get Warren being the supervillainy type, but I thought Jonathan completely learned that lesson. I never even heard of this other guy.
WILLOW You should have seen their headquarters. It was like the nerd natural habitat.
ANYA Well, if we know where they are, shouldn't we do something?
WILLOW We tried. Buffy was gonna go in there and bust them on the spot.
XANDER I'm sensing a 'not so completely.'
WILLOW Yeah, well, she went in, and then-
ANYA Speaking of Buffy, isn't she ready? She's gonna be late for her first day.
WILLOW Hey, respect the narrative flow much?
ANYA Please continue the story of failure.
WILLOW So, Buffy went in, but they'd cleared out. And she brought back the stuff that they left... ... spell books, some parchments, a couple of rare things, charmed objects, and a conjurer's harp...
WILLOW A-and they had other stuff, you know, Razor scooters, and pictures of the Vulcan woman on Enterprise.
XANDER Ooh! I mean ... nerds.
ANYA Okay. See, this is why demons are better than people.
WILLOW Interesting turn.
ANYA When I was a vengeance demon, I caused pain and mayhem, certainly. But I put in a full day's work doing it, and I got compensated appropriately.
XANDER Welcome to today's episode of 'Go Money Go!' I hear it daily.
WILLOW Yep, for the rest of your life.
ANYA But supervillains ... want reward without labor, to make things come easy. It's wrong. Without labor there can be no payment, and vice versa. The country cannot progress. The workers are the tools that shape America.
BUFFY Good to know.
BUFFY I was kinda feelin' like a tool.
BUFFY And now I know why.
NARRATOR You've seen us in your city or small town across the American West...
NARRATOR ...you've ordered our delicious food...
NARRATOR ...from our happy employees!
NARRATOR But now you're seeing it all from a different way, you're seeing it from behind the counter!
NARRATOR ...because you've just become part of the DoubleMeat experience!
BOY I'm part of it!
WOMAN I'm part of it!
MAN I'm a part of it too!
NARRATOR This cow... and this chicken... ...don't know it yet, but they're destined to become part of it as well! So what happens when a cow and a chicken come together?
NARRATOR Why, that's a DoubleMeat Medley! Let's take a look now at the process of harvesting these two special meats.
BUFFY Holy crap!
NARRATOR ...washing your hands thoroughly after each visit to the restroom.
NARRATOR Follow these rules and you'll be a happy part of the DoubleMeat family for a long time!
MANNY Interesting, isn't it?
BUFFY Oh yes! Like how the cow and the chicken come together even though they've never met. It's like
MANNY I'm Manny the manager. It's not a joke, it's just my name.
BUFFY Right. Y-you mentioned that a couple of times when I filled out the application.
MANNY Why do you want to work here, Buffy? You seem like a sharp young woman, and there are a lot of other jobs.
BUFFY Well, I-I kinda need money pretty quickly, like, today, and, and so I didn't want to go through a lengthy interview process, and I figured this was probably the fastest... way... to...
BUFFY Be...cause I ... wanted to be part of the DoubleMeat experience?
MANNY Come on, let's take a tour.
MANNY Philip, Timothy, this is Buffy. She's going to work the counter.
BUFFY Hi.
PHILIP What happened to the other one? Catherine?
MANNY Emily?
PHILIP Yeah.
TIMOTHY She's gone.
BUFFY What happened?
TIMOTHY Whatever always happens.
MANNY You can use this one.
BUFFY Uh ... there's, there's someone's stuff in there.
MANNY They must have left it. You can toss it, or keep what you want.
BUFFY Sure they're not coming back?
MANNY We have a lot of turnover here.
MANNY Watch these two.
BUFFY Are they gonna do something?
MANNY They're solid. Follow their example and you won't go wrong.
MANNY They're lifers.
BUFFY Lifers?
MANNY In it for life. Like me. You wanna get something out of this, Buffy? You'll do the same. You put the work in, and ten years from now, you'll be where I am.
MANNY I promise you.
MANNY Congratulations. You're on the clock.
MANNY This is the kitchen. The beating heart of the DoubleMeat Palace.
BUFFY Wow. They're all so ... identical.
MANNY Yeah. They all start to look the same to me too.
BUFFY Oh, no, not the employees, the, the chicken slices.
MAN Uh yeah, Medley meal number 2, uh, double-size it...
MANNY Drive-through station's over there. High pressure job, you won't need to go in there. Over there's the grills, the fryers, the walk-in freezer...
MANNY You don't need to go in there either!
MANNY That's the dehydrated pickle storage. Those are locked!
MANNY Now I want to show you this.
MANNY Look. The DoubleMeat Medley.
BUFFY Oh, I know the Medley! It's just, uh, the video was ... kind of graphic, with the slaughter.
MANNY The classic double-decker with a twist. A pure beefy patty above the mid-bun ... and a slice of processed chicken product below the mid-bun. Plus pickles, and the secret ingredient. Eat it.
BUFFY Oh, you know, I had a-a big breakfast. I'll just wait for...
BUFFY Uh ... but it smells so good.
BUFFY Mm. So, what *is* your secret ingredient?
MANNY It's a meat process.
MANNY Now I think it's time to start earning your money, don't you, Buffy?
BUFFY Mm-hmm.
BUFFY So ... what's the deal with Manny the manager? If I ask him really nice can I write a children's book called that?
GARY Fill this while I get the fries.
BUFFY Fill this? I didn't know there was gonna be drug testing on this job.
GARY You're funny. You better stop that.
BUFFY Why?
GARY Productivity. One of Manny's watch-words. 'Levity is the time-thief that picks the pocket of the company.'
BUFFY I prefer the one that goes, 'Manny's a humorless dolt who picks the pocket of he-should-bite-me.'
GARY You really need to be quiet with that.
GARY Here you go.
CUSTOMER Thanks.
WIG_LADY I'd like a small coffee, and cherry pie.
GARY That's a dollar ninety-two, ma'am.
BUFFY You hit so many buttons, it's like, button-palooza.
GARY No, it's easy, I - look.
GARY There are little pictures of the food on the buttons. I hit the coffee button, then I hit the small button. And then cherry pie. There's a picture of a little fried pie.
BUFFY Uh-huh.
GARY Then, I hit the total button... I put the money in the drawer, I close it, and it resets the system. A cocker spaniel could do it. Here, why don't you take the next one, the family? They're regulars.
BUFFY Hi. I'm new.
WIG_LADY I come here every day.
BUFFY That's nice.
WIG_LADY Oh, you really might make it, dear. Not like some of them, where suddenly you never see them again. I can see you here a long time.
BUFFY That's great.
WIG_LADY Thank you.
BUFFY Hi. Welcome to the DoubleMeat Palace, may I help you?
FATHER Yeah. We need two Number Four Medley Meals, a junior Medley, a Fisherman's Medley with bacon, and a kid's meal. Plus three fries, a chocolatey shake, and extra pickles on one of the Medleys.
BUFFY Excuse me. Um, this button. Does it look chocolatey to you?
MANNY You don't need to be in there.
BUFFY Sorry. I was just curious.
MANNY Curiosity killed the cat.
BUFFY Theory number five. Cat burgers.
DAWN Hey Buffy!
ANYA We're here to support your subsistence-level employment. Bravo.
BUFFY Thank you. This is cool of you guys.
XANDER So, Buff, how's it going?
BUFFY I don't know. I-I've waitressed before, but ... this is different.
DAWN Uh, when have you waitressed?
BUFFY That summer in L.A. It was a diner, and ... we had, you know, lots of people who didn't tip, and funny funny health code violations ... but ... it, it wasn't like it is here. I think there's something wrong, here. W-Will, are you okay?
WILLOW Uh, sorry, I, uh... Yeah, uh ... something's wrong?
BUFFY There's, there's this manager, right, and he's all scary and mysterious, you know? And then there's the secret ingredient. And, and the people that work here? They're, they're kind of strange, you know? They just ... just stare into space ... plus they disappear.
ANYA Disappear poof?
BUFFY No, not poof. Well, I don't think so.
XANDER It's fast food. I have swum these murky waters, my friend. There's the assorted creepiness, there's staring, there's the enthusiastic not showing up at all. I think you're seeing demons where there's just life.
BUFFY I, I didn't say demons. It's just a vibe. I mean, you guys still haven't seen this manager.
ANYA Well, isn't that him over there, getting the pickles wet?
XANDER Yeah, with the saddle shoes...
WILLOW ...and the glasses?
BUFFY I don't know. Maybe it's just the video that's freakin' me out. With the cow, and the chicken, all swirly together.
XANDER Mm, make me hungry, why don't you? How's about one of those delicious Medley Meals?
BUFFY Okay, you got it. On me.
XANDER Hey, thanks! See, I think she'll be fine once she settles into the routine. And by ordering, I'm helping.
DAWN And getting a free meal?
XANDER Well, yeah.
ANYA Well, if you like the food here, honey, maybe we should get it for the reception.
DAWN You're serving burgers? Cool!
ANYA Well, time is running very short. After Willow gave us the 'whoosh' engagement party, I got slack on the planning 'cause I figured she'd help, but, well, now that's all been blown to hell.
WILLOW Hey, standing right here! Standing right exactly here.
ANYA Sorry. Didn't mean to tempt you.
ANYA Everyone's so delicate. Anyway, I still have to select the bridesmaids' dresses, and, well, then there are the guests from out of town and the ones from the demon realm you wouldn't believe how many of them have yet to let us know either way.
BUFFY There you go, and I double-sized it for ya.
XANDER Oh, thank you!
BUFFY And cut way back on the cat.
XANDER Cat?!
BUFFY Just kidding. Probably.
BUFFY Sloooow night.
BUFFY Gina.
BUFFY Since it's slow, do you think they'll mind if I take another break?
GINA We're not allowed. Downtime robs us all.
BUFFY Mm, thus quoth Manny. There's no one here.
GINA Sure there is. Look.
BUFFY This'll make my day complete. What?
SPIKE What's in the DoubleMeat nuggets?
BUFFY I'm working. Go away.
SPIKE Yeah, and you chose to be in the consumer service profession, and I'm a consumer. Service me.
BUFFY Order something or go.
SPIKE Give a bloke a chance for his eyes to adjust. Damn fluorescent lights. Makes me look dead.
SPIKE Some demons love 'em. The way they vibrate makes the skin twitch. That the kinda demon you are, luv?
BUFFY I am not a demon. I don't know why you can hit me, but I am not a demon.
SPIKE Oh. I see. That why you took this job? Prove something to yourself? A normal job for a normal girl? Good way to drive yourself crazy, that is.
BUFFY I'll be fine.
SPIKE Buffy.
SPIKE You're not happy here.
BUFFY Please don't make this harder.
SPIKE You don't belong here. You're something ... you're better than this.
BUFFY I need the money.
SPIKE I can get money. Walk with me now, come on.
BUFFY I ... I need to go help Gary with the fries.
SPIKE You gotta get outta here, this place'll do stuff to you.
SPIKE This place'll kill you!
GARY Someone there?
GARY Oh, hi, what are you doing? What, what-
BUFFY Feels like I just left, you know?
TIMOTHY You came back.
BUFFY I came back.
MANNY Gary's gone.
BUFFY Gary. Oh, the guy that helped me out at the counter yesterday?
MANNY He didn't show up this morning.
BUFFY Well, shift's just starting.
MANNY He was supposed to unlock early this morning. Didn't show. Pull his card.
BUFFY Well, I'm, I'm sure, you know, he's just late. He didn't seem like he was leaving.
MANNY I'm moving Timothy to counter. You're on grill.
BUFFY Me?
MANNY I've been watching you.
BUFFY B-but I-I don't know how to grill.
MANNY Just think. This is the last day you'll ever be able to say that.
PHILIP You put the beef on the grill, you hit the button, then it beeps. You flip the beef, hit the other button, then it beeps. You put it on the bun... There's not a button for that.
BUFFY Repeat until insane.
PHILIP It eliminates variation. Every burger at every DoubleMeat Palace is the same. People don't like variation.
BUFFY Got it. Variety is the spice of bad.
PHILIP Mm.
BUFFY So ... what's the secret ingredient?
PHILIP It's a meat process.
BUFFY Well, what does that mean?
PHILIP It's a process, they do it to the meat.
BUFFY But, what *is* it?
PHILIP It's just the name of the process.
BUFFY Oh. Yeah.
BUFFY So, I ... guess we're gonna get ... kinda greasy, huh?
PHILIP Mm.
PHILIP Skin ... hair ... eyelashes ... nostrils...
PHILIP ...inside your ears... You wanna look inside my ears?
BUFFY No. No, that's okay.
PHILIP Once I noticed I couldn't hear and went to the doctor. He said it was grease ... that made a plug.
BUFFY Ohh.
PHILIP Mm. They gave me a kit. Kit for cleaning my ears. It's got this little bulb mechanism.
BUFFY Imagine that.
MANNY Buffy?
BUFFY Yay! It's Manny!
MANNY You're working a double shift.
BUFFY What? A...nother eight hours? Right after these eight hours? But that's ... so many hours.
MANNY You get paid for it. Plus an extra free DoubleMeat Medley.
BUFFY What happened? Why the double shiftiness?
MANNY Gary didn't show. And now one of my grinder guys is late too.
BUFFY But they could still show up, right? I mean, they could be anywhere.
TIMOTHY Your meat's here.
XANDER Yeah, okay, bye. Ahn, that was Buffy, she's working late, so I might have to go- yah!
HALFREK I have been called, and vengeance shall I wreak. Cower, masculine one ... tremble as you face my wrath!
ANYA Xander, I'm starting to think that maybe we should do a pot-luck thing.
XANDER Honey?
HALFREK Hello. I am here to tear this man apart. How many pieces do you wish?
ANYA Halfrek!
HALFREK Anyanka? Oh my god!
ANYA How are you, how are you?
XANDER You two ... you know each other?
ANYA Funny, Halfrek, I didn't summon you to kill Xander, I called to invite you to our wedding.
HALFREK Y- Oh my ... what an embarrassing mistake! Oh my god, gorgeous!
XANDER Wow, um, you two clearly have some catching up to do. So I'll, uh ... I'll not be in the apartment.
ANYA Gosh, it's swell to see you again, Hallie, I didn't mean to have you materialize all the way here, I mean, not-not till the ceremony, I mean.
HALFREK I guess I got the message garbled. You know how it is, half the time I have no idea if I'm maiming the right guy.
HALFREK So, um ... you're marrying that man with the large upper arms?
ANYA Yes.
HALFREK Why?
ANYA Well, because I love him.
HALFREK Hmm.
ANYA Oh, we're gonna be very happy together.
HALFREK Hmm.
ANYA What?
TIMOTHY It's boiling with nothing in it. Sometimes it does that.
TIMOTHY They say bugs fall in there. Oh, I'm back. You can go on your break now.
WILLOW Come in.
AMY It's me. Dawn said I could come up.
AMY So, is she pissed at you too, or just me? What did you tell her about me?
WILLOW D'you want something?
AMY Um ... yeah ... actually. I mean, I, I don't, don't know if you wanted to keep it, or...
WILLOW You want it? Really?
AMY Well, yeah, you know, I mean ... it's not much, but it's home. Or it was. I don't know, I guess it's stupid, but...
WILLOW No, i-it's not stupid. You can have it, of course.
AMY Hey. So I hear you got this whole cold-turkey thing goin' on. How's that going?
WILLOW It's good. It's really good. I mean, i-it was hard at first ... frustrating ... doing everything the slow way. It was like, 'is everything gonna take forever, forever?'
AMY Yeah.
WILLOW But, uh, it's better now. I'm ... getting my focus back.
AMY Mm. I can see that.
WILLOW It's a pivotal page.
AMY So this is it, huh? This is ... gonna be your life from now on?
WILLOW What? No.
AMY Well, you're never gonna do it again. Ever. You're never gonna ... feel how it made you feel.
WILLOW Don't think that's the way to look at it.
AMY Hey Will? It's your birthday.
WILLOW Um, no it isn't. But now that you mention it, Buffy's is coming...
._(latin_translation power or you have the power.)
WILLOW What?
WILLOW Amy...
AMY It's a gift. It's magic ... and it didn't come from you. It came from me. Completely legal. Enjoy.
BUFFY Look! Look what I found under the meat grinder!
MANNY Oh my god.
BUFFY Wanna tell me what's going on?
MANNY I'm not sure.
BUFFY Try again.
MANNY Well... there was an accident, maybe six weeks ago, a grinder incident.
BUFFY Right, but see, *this* isn't six weeks old. This, is new.
MANNY It is? Oh... well, maybe Gary did come in this morning, or, I don't know, late last night, maybe there was an accident. Got himself to the hospital.
BUFFY Right. Maybe he's in the hospital. Or maybe, he's in the grinder! Huh? Huh? Meat process, secret ingredient? Maybe, Gary's on the grill! Or maybe he's under the pickle chips!
MANNY Buffy. Buffy!
BUFFY Stop! Stop! Everyone, you have to stop! Stop eating!
BUFFY No, you can't have this! It's not beef! It's people!
BUFFY The DoubleMeat Medley is people!
BUFFY The meat layer is definitely people! It's people! It's people! Probably not the chickeny part. But who knows? Who! Knows!
WIG_LADY What about the cherry pie?
MANNY What are you doing? I thought you were part of the team!
MANNY You are fired.
HALFREK Tell me more about Xander.
ANYA You keep asking about him. Do you think I'm making a mistake?
HALFREK Do you?
ANYA Well, no! Xander, he... He's very kind, and brave ... he has the sweetest smile and the nicest body, and ... he loves me. I mean, sometimes it isn't easy, but, he does.
HALFREK Who told you that it isn't easy to love you?
ANYA Well, you know, I'll do something, or say something, and, and then he has to say stuff like, 'it's incorrect for you to appreciate money so much,' or, or, 'Observe: here is how a real human would behave.'
HALFREK Oh, so he corrects you?
ANYA Well, no, it's just ... um ... well, no, I mean, now I'm all confused, I mean, wha, do you think there's something wrong with, with the way he treats me?
HALFREK Do you?
ANYA Okay, you have to stop doing that. I love Xander.
HALFREK Even though he thinks he knows better than you?
ANYA B-but he doesn't, he doesn't think that.
HALFREK Okay. I'm sorry. I was just curious. You know, you don't have to say another thing about it if you're not comfortable.
ANYA B-but I am! I mean ... it's not like I'm hiding any deficiencies or anything.
HALFREK Hmm.
XANDER I have absolutely no threes. Go fish.
BUFFY I call an emergency meeting, and this is it? Where's Willow? Where's Anya?
DAWN I-I couldn't find Willow. I knocked and knocked on her door.
XANDER And Anya's entertaining a vengeance demon named Hallie. Say Buff, did you ever see Anya as a demon? 'Cause if that's it ... whoa.
BUFFY There's something wrong at the DoubleMeat Palace. Really wrong.
DAWN Have you been demon-fighting? Is that why you smell funny?
BUFFY No! I'm talking about...
BUFFY Ucch. That's great. That's, that's just great. I try to do the simplest thing in the world, get an ordinary job in a well-lit place, and look, I'm right back where I started. Blood and death and funky smells. Look. Look what I found near the grinder.
DAWN Ew. Whose is it?
BUFFY I don't know. It might be this guy named Gary, the only one in the whole place who didn't seem all brain-dead. He didn't show up this morning. Except now I think he was there the whole time. As the secret ingredient. We need to analyze that burger. We need to find out if it used to be people.
XANDER What?!
XANDER People?
BUFFY Xander, you ate the burger?!
XANDER Well, first you say it's cat, then you come in and hand me a burger, blah blah blah, five minutes later 'oh and by the way, it happens to be hot delicious human flesh'!
BUFFY I needed that burger to analyze it. Now I'm gonna have to get another one.
XANDER *That's* your problem with this scenario? You getting seconds?
WILLOW Late! Late, sorry, I ... I was reading for school, well, highlighting anyway. Anyway, late.
XANDER Yeah, you just missed the Gary burger.
WILLOW What are we doing? Let's jump right in. Did Xander say something about food?
DAWN You wouldn't want any. Apparently the DoubleMeat Medley is people.
WILLOW Whoa. Bad.
BUFFY I bet it's not even just this one time. Or even this one town. There are DoubleMeat Palaces all over California.
DAWN I've eaten there a lot.
BUFFY Well, everyone has! They've got the perfect deal. Everyone expects high turnover of the employees, they get the meat for nothing, and ... And they have us disposing of the bodies! How sick is that? We need to bring down the whole corporation. Will, Xander ate the burger, is there any way for sure to figure out what it was?
WILLOW Well, yeah, I can start analyzing it with science, not ... I can use science. You ate it?
DAWN Um, we have the wrapper. There's little scribbles of meat on the wrapper.
BUFFY Okay, good, you guys get working on that. It's after closing, so I'm gonna go there and see what I can find out.
WILLOW Cool, you go. We'll be good.
DAWN Are you okay?
WILLOW I'm just worried about Buffy.
WILLOW_VOICEOVER She could be walking into anything.
BUFFY Manny?
BUFFY Ohh. Manny?
BUFFY Guess you really were a lifer.
WILLOW Don't need magic. Don't need it. Don't need it.
DAWN My friend Janice? Her sister's a lawyer.
XANDER You think I should sue over the burger? That's interesting.
DAWN No, I just mean... Buffy's never gonna be a lawyer, or a doctor. Anything big.
XANDER She's a Slayer. She saves the whole world. That's way bigger.
DAWN But that means she's gonna have like crap jobs her entire life, right? Minimum wage stuff. I mean, I could still grow up to be anything. But for her ... this is it.
XANDER Okay, but maybe you'll be a lawyer or a doctor, and you can use all your money to support your deadbeat sister.
DAWN Oh, that's terrifically better. Thanks.
WILLOW Hey, guys, I-I think I've got it.
XANDER Good job, Will. Those aren't, like, potions, are they?
WILLOW No, no potions. It's not magic, it's chemistry. You can tell by how damn slow it is.
WILLOW I made a solution that reacts to the proteins in human blood. So we're pretty close to knowing for certain.
ANYA I'm here! I'm here.
DAWN We're doing chemistry.
ANYA Oh. So sorry I hurried.
XANDER Hey, did your friend have a good time? And then leave?
ANYA She's gone.
XANDER So, Ahn, the way she looked, with ... the face... That wasn't what you used to look like, was it?
ANYA Is there something wrong with that? I mean, did you think she was unattractive?
XANDER Okay, is there any answer to that question that won't make you nuts?
ANYA Halfrek was always considered to be a great beauty.
XANDER Well, hon, she was a little... ...there was some veinyness.
WILLOW Hold this. Okay. If the solution reacts to the proteins, then I'll be able to see it. I mean, I'll be able to look through the microscope and, and then see it.
ANYA It's not like you're so perfect either, what with your ... strangely large upper arms and your tendency to criticize.
XANDER Huh?
DAWN What do you see?
WILLOW There's no reaction.
XANDER Oh god, no! No reaction!
WILLOW Which means it's not human.
XANDER It's not human! It's not human?
ANYA Well, is it demony? I mean, maybe someone's ... you know, killing demons and using them as a cheap source of meat. I mean, we've all heard of that.
ANYA And by the way, I'm opposed to using demon meat, no matter how much money it saves. Does that surprise you?
XANDER Again, I say 'huh?'
WILLOW No, I'm not sure what I'm seeing. Cellulose?
WILLOW There's something weird here.
BUFFY Scalp?
BUFFY Wig! Wig lady?
WIG_LADY Oh dear.
WIG_LADY Wig lady, is that what they call me?
WIG_LADY I don't care for that. I mean, I have to do something to hide this.
WIG_LADY It's paralyzing. Don't try to move, dear. You really can't, much.
WIG_LADY The paralysis spreads upward, by the way. You may want to flail your arms a bit while you still can.
WIG_LADY Did I tell you? You're my favorite.
WIG_LADY DoubleMeat workers. You're all so full of DoubleMeat burgers, and you just slide down so smooth.
WIG_LADY Oh, I just love the paralysis. It means I can eat you slowly.
WIG_LADY I know you're under there.
WILLOW Buffy? Are you in there?
WILLOW I can't see you inside.
WILLOW Buffy, if you're in there, the burger isn't people.
WILLOW They aren't even meat, it's all processed vegetables. Isn't that weird?
WILLOW Buffy, there's more. Something happened today ... i-it wasn't my fault. It was Amy's fault, but I feel so bad about it.
WILLOW It was Amy's power, but, but it felt like I was doing everything myself. And I couldn't stop. And now it's gone and I feel kinda shaky and ... like I, I need it ... Buffy?
WILLOW Buffy, something fell.
WILLOW Buffy!
WIG_LADY Visitors! How nice.
WILLOW Missed me.
WILLOW Buffy!
WILLOW Buffy, are you all right?
BUFFY Para...lyzed, but ... I think it's wearing off.
WILLOW I did it! I killed it, Buffy, look!
BUFFY/WILLOW Ewwwww.
AMY Hey.
WILLOW Amy.
AMY Can I come in? My new place isn't set up, and I wanted to borrow some stuff like detergent.
WILLOW You really can't.
AMY I can't borrow detergent? Well, when they start calling me 'stinky Amy,' I'm just gonna say, 'hey, not my fault...'
WILLOW I can't spend time with you anymore.
AMY What?
WILLOW You can't come in here again.
AMY What's up, y-you didn't like your birthday present?
WILLOW That's right.
AMY You're telling me that you didn't have a genuine blast? Come on, that was a sweet spell. That was like a trip to Disneyland without the lines.
WILLOW You don't get it. What you did to me was wrong. Do you have any idea how much harder that makes, just, everything?
AMY You know what I notice? You're not denying that you had fun.
WILLOW Shut up.
AMY Oh, yeah. Sharp argument you got there. Were you on the debate team? I forget. I forgot a lot while you were failing to make me be not a rat.
WILLOW Amy. If you really are my friend ... you better stay away from me. And if you really aren't...
WILLOW ...you *better* stay away from me.
LORRAINE Yeah?
BUFFY Hi. Uh, you must be the new manager. I-I'm Buffy Summers.
LORRAINE I'm Lorraine Ross. They called me in when Manny did his disappearing act. You hear about that? Guy just disappeared.
BUFFY Yeah. I think ... I think that used to happen a lot around here.
LORRAINE Buffy Summers. I heard about you. Caused a big scene.
BUFFY Oh, yeah. Practical jokes not really right for the workplace. I so get that now. Anyway, I just wanted to return my uniform.
LORRAINE Oh. Most people don't even bother.
BUFFY The DoubleMeat Medley ... is vegetables?
LORRAINE How do you know that?
BUFFY So I guess it's true.
LORRAINE Um, close the door? Have a seat.
LORRAINE It's a formed and texturized vegetable-based meat-like product, suitable for grinding. It's blended with large amounts of rendered beef fat for flavor.
BUFFY Wait, the secret ingredient in the beef is ... beef?
LORRAINE Buffy. You know something powerful here, do you understand that? The DoubleMeat reputation is built on a foundation of ... well, meat. You can't spread this around.
BUFFY I get that. It's a valuable secret, isn't it?
LORRAINE Is there something you want?
BUFFY I really need money.
LORRAINE You want money?
BUFFY No! Well, I mean, yes, but, but no, I ... well, I, I want to work. See, I-I have zero money coming in, and there are expenses, and by the time I interview for a new job and get hired and go through a training process, it... well, I'd ... I'd really like to not be fired anymore.
LORRAINE Well, I don't want any more practical jokes. I mean it.
BUFFY I promise.
LORRAINE Well, I'm a little short-handed right now, and you're already trained ... I think you can not be fired.
BUFFY Thank you. That's, that's great. And I can do the job, I promise that too.
LORRAINE I certainly hope so. I don't like short-timers, Buffy. I like people who *want* to be here. Maybe you didn't take this job seriously before, but from now on?
LORRAINE See this? I want you to be shooting for this from here on out.
BUFFY Right. Here on out.
