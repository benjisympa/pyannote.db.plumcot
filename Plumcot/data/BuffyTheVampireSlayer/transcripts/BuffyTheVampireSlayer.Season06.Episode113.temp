BUFFY Uh ... we missed the bed again.
SPIKE Lucky for the bed.
BUFFY Is this a new rug?
SPIKE Mm...no. Just looks different when you're under it.
BUFFY You know, this place is okay for a hole in the ground. You fixed it up.
SPIKE Well, I ate a decorator once. Maybe something stuck.
BUFFY I've been thinking about doing something to my room.
SPIKE Yeah?
BUFFY Yeah, I think the New Kids On The Block posters are starting to date me.
SPIKE Well, if you want, I can...
SPIKE Are we having a conversation?
BUFFY What? No! No. Maybe.
SPIKE Hmm.
BUFFY What?
SPIKE Well, isn't this usually the part where you ... kick me in the head and run out, virtue fluttering?
BUFFY That's the plan ... ...soon as my legs start working.
SPIKE You were amazing.
BUFFY You got the job done yourself.
SPIKE I was just trying to keep up. The things you do ... ...the way you make it hurt in all the wrong places. I've never been with such an animal.
BUFFY I'm not an animal.
SPIKE You wanna see the bite marks?
BUFFY You know, it's late, I-I should ... get home before Dawn goes to sleep.
SPIKE And she's off.
BUFFY Have you seen my underwear?
SPIKE What is this to you? This thing we have.
BUFFY We don't have a ... thing, we have ... this. That's all.
SPIKE Do you even like me?
BUFFY Sometimes.
SPIKE But you like what I do to you.
SPIKE Do you trust me?
BUFFY Never.
ANDREW How can I trust you not to touch my stuff?
ANDREW Actually living with supervillains was not part of the deal.
JONATHAN We're on the lam, moron, it's not like we have a choice.
ANDREW This sucks. Couldn't we have at least gotten a lair with a view?
JONATHAN Stop whining! Get your sissy crap out of the way.
ANDREW Hey, quit it!
ANDREW Don't you curse me!
JONATHAN Hey, my bone!
ANDREW Ow!
WARREN Hey!
WARREN When you girls are done touching each other, the cerebral dampener's ready to be charged.
ANDREW Cool.
JONATHAN Got the thing?
ANDREW Musk gland of a Homja-Maleev demon.
ANDREW Fresh.
JONATHAN All right. Stand back.
JONATHAN Okay ... ow!
WARREN Gentlemen, the cerebral dampener ... is online. And with this baby, we can make any woman we desire our willing sex slave.
WARREN I know just where to start.
BUFFY Double meat is double sweet. Enjoy!
CUSTOMER Thank you.
BUFFY Just something I'm trying.
TARA Hey, sorry I'm late.
BUFFY Oh, time has no meaning here. Gina, I'm taking a break.
TARA I have this sudden urge to dedicate my productive cooperation.
BUFFY Well, if you close your eyes and repeatedly smash yourself in the head with frozen meat, it'll go away. Eventually. I'm hoping.
BUFFY Thanks for coming by.
TARA Is it bad?
BUFFY I was sort of hoping you could tell me.
TARA I knew this was gonna happen. What did Willow do now? Did she ... she hurt anyone?
BUFFY Wha... uh, no, no, um... Ta-Tara, this isn't about Willow.
TARA I-I thought that's why you didn't want to meet at the house.
BUFFY Uh, sorry, it's, um ... Willow's fine, uh, she, she's been doing really well. You'd be proud of her.
TARA Good, that's ... that's good. So, so what do you want to talk about?
BUFFY I-it's Spike. He can hurt me.
BUFFY Without his head exploding.
TARA Oh my god. Hi-his chip stopped working?
BUFFY No, it still works. Just not on me. I-I need to know about the spell. The one that ... brought me back. I, I'd ask Willow, but...
TARA You think it's you.
BUFFY I don't know. I feel ... different. There are things...
BUFFY I-I think ... maybe ... I came back wrong.
TARA No, Buffy, that's n-not ... no. You didn't.
BUFFY Can you check out the spell? Just see if there's something that ... Could you just check? Please?
JONATHAN Right there! That's got it.
JONATHAN Mad Dog Two to Mad Dog One.
ANDREW I thought I was Mad Dog Two.
JONATHAN Mad Dog *Three* to Mad Dog One.
JONATHAN_VOICEOVER Signal's coming in strong and clear. Over.
WARREN Roger that. Beginning preliminary sweep.
WARREN Keep your potatoes peeled for the Slayer. I don't want any surprises.
ANDREW We can really have anyone we want.
JONATHAN It's like candy.
ANDREW Juicy, pulsating candy.
JONATHAN Oh! Oh, the one with the neck! Put the whammy on the neck!
ANDREW No! The redhead! I want the redhead!
JONATHAN The redhead's too tall.
ANDREW So get a step ladder. No, no, ow!
ANDREW Get off of me!
JONATHAN Take it back!
WARREN Target acquired.
JONATHAN What?
WARREN Initiating contact.
JONATHAN The brunette?
ANDREW Oh, she's kinda cute Ow! Oh, no, go for the leather skirt!
ANDREW Oh, bazoombas!
ANDREW Go for the one with the bazoombas!
JONATHAN Yeah, go for the one with the bazoombas.
WARREN So how did you get so beautiful?
KATRINA Okay, does that line usually work...?
KATRINA What the hell are you doing here?
WARREN It's nice to see you again too, Katrina.
KATRINA Yeah, it's the seeing you part that's throwing me here, Warren, because I thought I was pretty clear with the never wanting that to happen again.
WARREN Never's a long time, baby.
KATRINA Apparently not long enough.
WARREN Oh, you're not still sore about that thing, are you?
KATRINA What *thing* would that be exactly? What, the wind-up slut you tinkered together? Or when Little Miss Nuts and Bolts tried to choke me to death?
WARREN Okay, so I've made a few mistakes.
KATRINA No. No, I did. For ever lowering myself to be with a jerk like you.
WARREN Don't say that.
KATRINA Well, what did you expect, to just ... waltz in here and sweep me off my feet with your cheesy lines and fancy suit?
WARREN No, I ju- I just thought ... we could talk. I thought maybe we could work things out.
KATRINA There's nothing to work out. What you did was sick. And just looking at you makes me want to vomit.
WARREN You sure about that?
KATRINA Yes, god yes, I'm sure.
KATRINA I love you, Master.
WARREN I love you, too, baby.
BUFFY I'm home! Who wants to help scrape the grease off my...
BUFFY Is there singing?!
BUFFY Are we singing again?
XANDER Nope, just the dancing.
ANYA We're teaching Dawn perfectly synchronized dance steps for the wedding reception.
XANDER Wanna go for a spin?
BUFFY Uh, think I'm heading more towards an ungainly collapse.
WILLOW Aw, rough day?
BUFFY Kinda.
XANDER You've been going at it too hard, Buffy. We hardly ever see you, what with slinging the double meat and pounding the big evil.
ANYA You are looking a little pounded. Just around the eyes.
WILLOW Hey, we're thinking of heading to the Bronze later. Wanna come, get all unwindy?
XANDER Tall glasses of frosty relaxation on me. Nectar of the working man.
BUFFY No, thanks. I think I'll stay here with Dawn. Curl up on the couch with a big bowl of popcorn and-
BUFFY ...listen to the cars honk? Where are you going?
DAWN I'm ... sleeping over at Janice's?
BUFFY And I'm falling for that again because of the surprise lobotomy?
WILLOW It's okay, I checked it out. Janice's mom is picking her up.
BUFFY Oh.
DAWN I didn't think you'd care. You're never home, so...
BUFFY I know. I'm sorry. You know, but I, I'm here now. All visible and everything. Couldn't you just stay at Janice's another night?
DAWN Her mom's cooking Mexican. She's gonna teach me how to make real tortillas. Not like I knew you'd be around.
BUFFY Frosty nectar. Now please.
WARREN Thank you, baby.
KATRINA My pleasure, Master.
ANDREW That is so cool.
JONATHAN I really could've used one of these in high school.
WARREN Gentlemen? To crime.
ANDREW/JONATHAN Crime!
ANDREW Crime tastes funny.
JONATHAN Wow. I still think I would have gone with the bazoombas, but...
JONATHAN ...wow.
ANDREW Yeah, she's ... really cute.
WARREN Cute?
WARREN Look at her, man! The the shape of her lips. The smooth, silky skin. The way her nose- the way her nose crinkles when she laughs... She's perfect.
JONATHAN Yeah.
ANDREW She's totally hot.
KATRINA So are you, Master.
ANDREW You think so?
KATRINA Oh yes, Master.
JONATHAN Okay ... so ... how do we ... you know.
ANDREW Who gets to...
WARREN I do.
ANDREW That's not fair.
JONATHAN Dude, you didn't call it.
WARREN Oh, I don't have to call it, Sparky. She's mine. But don't worry. You can play with her all you want ... after I'm done with her.
WARREN I missed you so much. You never should have left me. Say it.
KATRINA I never should have left you, Master.
WARREN Tell me you love me.
KATRINA I love you, Master.
WARREN Again.
KATRINA I love you, Master.
WARREN I love you too, baby. Get on your knees.
KATRINA Yes, Warren.
WARREN Wait, what'd you just say?
KATRINA I said yes, War-
KATRINA What the f-
KATRINA What did you do to me?!
WARREN Get the Dampener!
KATRINA Who the hell are you?
ANDREW Um, your masters?
KATRINA My what?!
JONATHAN Where'd you put it?!
ANDREW You had it last!
KATRINA Are you kidding me?!
WARREN Get the Dampener!
KATRINA You were gonna share me with these two dorks?!
ANDREW Hey! We're supervillains!
ANDREW Call us Master!
JONATHAN Wait!
ANDREW Aw, crap.
JONATHAN It's out of juice!
KATRINA Is that what you used on me?! Oh my god! First the skankbot and now this?! What is wrong with you!
WARREN I just, I wanted us to be together!
KATRINA There is no us, Warren! Get that through your big meaty head! I am not your girlfriend anymore!
JONATHAN She's your ex?
ANDREW Dude, that is messed up.
KATRINA Oh, you think? You bunch of little boys, playing at being men. Well, this is not some fantasy, it's not a game, you freaks! It's rape!
JONATHAN What?
ANDREW No ... we didn't-
KATRINA You're all sick. And I'm going to make sure you get locked up for this. And then we'll see how you like getting raped.
WARREN Stop her!
KATRINA Get off me!
WARREN Charge the Cerebral Dampener.
JONATHAN Warren...
WARREN Charge the Dampener! Andrew ... get her up.
WARREN We'll give her another dose. A strong one.
WARREN Everything's all right. Everything's ... gonna be all right.
ANDREW I don't think so.
ANDREW She's dead.
ANDREW Oh god, oh god, oh god.
WARREN Her neck. It just...
JONATHAN No, that's ... not...
JONATHAN This isn't happening.
WARREN I just, I gotta ... I gotta, lemme think.
JONATHAN What did you do? What the hell did you do?!
WARREN *We* did this. Me, and Andrew, and you. It's on all of us.
ANDREW ...oh god oh god oh god...
WARREN Shut up!
WARREN We, uh, we have to get ... we have to get r-rid of it.
JONATHAN How?
WARREN Uh, uh, may-maybe a spell. Can you teleport it out of here?
JONATHAN No, she's ... It's too big.
WARREN Andrew.
WARREN Andrew!
ANDREW What?
WARREN Is there any ... thing that you can, uh, summon, something that... something that can devour that much?
ANDREW Maybe a Jarvlen Flesh Eater, but ... they're hard to control. It'd go for us, too.
JONATHAN Oh, well that's it, man. We're screwed.
WARREN No, we just have to stay calm.
JONATHAN Tell that to your girlfriend!
WARREN Ex-girlfriend!
JONATHAN It doesn't matter! There's a link. You knew her, so there's a link. You don't think Buffy'll be able to put that together? That's what she does, she'll figure it out!
ANDREW It was an accident. Maybe if we turn ourselves in-
WARREN No.
JONATHAN He's right. If we go to the police now-
WARREN I'm not going to jail.
JONATHAN We can't hide this! Sooner or later, the Slayer's gonna find out she's dead.
WARREN Well, then maybe it should be sooner.
JONATHAN Are you insane?
WARREN Listen to me.
JONATHAN No!
WARREN Listen! We have two problems. The body, and the Slayer. Well, what if there was a way that we could take care of them both ... with one big stone.
WILLOW_VOICEOVER What are they doing?
WILLOW We're not going to have to do that at the wedding, are we? 'Cause there's this last thread of dignity I've been desperately clinging to.
BUFFY You're still doing okay, right?
WILLOW Yeah. You know. Some days are harder than the really hard days. It's easier like this, though, when I'm not alone.
BUFFY I'm sorry I haven't been around that much.
WILLOW No, that's not it's okay. We know you've been all tied up.
BUFFY What?
WILLOW With your job, and the slaying.
XANDER Hey, I see sitting where there should be dancing.
ANYA Come share in the joy of our groove thang.
WILLOW And despite that, I succumb to the beat.
BUFFY I think I'll catch the next Soul Train out.
XANDER You sure?
BUFFY Oh, yeah, you know, glass all the way empty. More nectar required.
XANDER Cool, well, shimmy on out when you're done lubricating.
SPIKE You see ... you try to be with them...
SPIKE ...but you always end up in the dark ... ...with me.
SPIKE What would they think of you ... if they found out ... all the things you've done?
SPIKE If they knew ... who you really were?
BUFFY Don't.
SPIKE Stop me.
SPIKE No ... don't close your eyes.
SPIKE Look at them.
SPIKE That's not your world. You belong in the shadows... with me.
SPIKE Look at your friends ... and tell me ... you don't love getting away with this... ...right under their noses.
XANDER Oh! I think I pulled a jive muscle last night.
WILLOW The Funky Monkey claims another victim.
WILLOW Tara. What are you doing here? I mean ... uh, it's okay for you to be here if you have things that ... you have to be here for.
XANDER Yeah, I'm gonna go bring Anya up to speed on that monkey situation.
TARA There's a monkey problem?
WILLOW Only if you don't stretch first. The
TARA Uh, yeah, I was just...
WILLOW No, it's okay. I, I didn't expect you to stop doing magic just because ... You don't have to hide it. I'm not - I'm, I'm doing better. No spells for thirty-two days. I can even go to the magic shop now. As long as someone's with me at all times. But, uh, but it's better now, it really is. You know, if you were checking on me.
TARA No, I wouldn't ... I was just looking for Buffy.
WILLOW Oh. Well, I-I haven't seen her since last night. She's not around much these days. We kinda miss her.
TARA I'm sure she feels the same way. If you see her, c-can you tell her that I need to talk to her? It's important.
WILLOW Yeah. Of course I will.
TARA Thanks.
TARA Will? I'm ... I'm glad you're doing better.
BUFFY Don't think about the evil bloodsucking fiend. Focus on anything but the evil bloodsucking fiend.
BUFFY Thank you!
BUFFY Huh?
BUFFY It's okay. I'm going to get you out of here. Can, can you walk? Are you hurt?
CREEPY_VOICES What did you do? What did you do? Buffy... Buffy...
SPIKE Ow!
SPIKE Bloody hell, what'd you do that for?
BUFFY Spike?
SPIKE Buffy!
BUFFY Spike. What's happening?
SPIKE So you thought you could just slip away, then? Vampire, remember?
SPIKE I could feel you.
SPIKE Ow! Bloody hell, what'd you do that for?
SPIKE Buffy!
SPIKE Buffy!
SPIKE Do you mind?
SPIKE Buffy?
BUFFY She's dead.
BUFFY I killed her.
SPIKE We have to go.
BUFFY What happened?
SPIKE There's nothing you can do now. We have to go before someone sees you.
BUFFY What did I do?
SPIKE We have to go, now!
SPIKE All right. Listen to me. Buffy. Buffy!
BUFFY She's dead.
SPIKE It was an accident.
BUFFY I killed her.
SPIKE I'm gonna get you home.
BUFFY No!
SPIKE I'm gonna get you home, and you're gonna crawl in your warm comfy bed and stay there! We're gonna sort this out. Trust me.
WARREN Two problems...
WARREN ...one stone.
WARREN Nice job. She totally bought it.
KATRINA Yeah.
JONATHAN Some of my best work.
ANDREW What happens now?
JONATHAN Well, the night's young. Gotta be some more girls we could kill.
WARREN We stick to the plan! Buffy thinks she killed Katrina. Well, it's her problem now.
CREEPY_VOICES What did you do... Buffy... What did you do...
SPIKE It's all right, luv.
SPIKE Shh, it's all right. It'll be our little secret.
BUFFY Do you trust me?
BUFFY Hey.
DAWN What time is it?
BUFFY It's late. I just wanted...
BUFFY I love you. You know that, right?
DAWN What's wrong?
BUFFY I know I haven't been everything I should be ... everything Mom was... ...but I love you. I always will.
DAWN Why are you talking like this? Buffy?
BUFFY There was an accident. In the woods. A girl ... she was hurt. I hurt someone.
DAWN Oh my god. Is she all right?
BUFFY No.
BUFFY I'm sorry.
BUFFY There's something I have to do. I have to tell what I did. I have to go to the police.
DAWN The police?
BUFFY Dawnie, I have to.
DAWN But ... what's going to happen?
BUFFY I don't know.
DAWN They'll take you away. Won't they.
BUFFY I'm sorry.
DAWN No, you're not. You're never here. You can't even stand to be around me.
BUFFY That is not true.
DAWN You don't want to be here with me. You didn't want to come back. I know that. You were happier where you were. You want to go away again.
BUFFY Dawn...
DAWN Then go! You're not really here anyway.
SPIKE What do you think you're doing?
BUFFY The right thing. For once.
SPIKE Sorry, luv. Can't let you do that.
BUFFY I have to tell them what happened.
SPIKE Nothing happened.
BUFFY I killed that girl.
SPIKE Demons in the woods? Time going wonky? They won't believe you.
BUFFY I'll show them.
SPIKE Show them what?
BUFFY What did you do?
SPIKE I took care of it.
BUFFY What ... did you do?!
SPIKE What I had to. I went back and I took care of it. It doesn't matter now. No one will ever find her.
COP_#1 Where'd they find her?
COP_#2 The river. She washed up half a mile from the cemetery.
SPIKE Oh ... balls.
SPIKE There still isn't anything to connect this to you.
BUFFY It doesn't matter.
SPIKE It wasn't your fault!
BUFFY I killed her!
SPIKE It was an accident. It just happened.
BUFFY Nothing just happens.
SPIKE You're not going in there.
BUFFY I have to do this. Just let me go.
SPIKE I can't. I love you.
BUFFY No, you don't.
SPIKE You think I haven't tried not to?
BUFFY Try harder.
SPIKE You are not throwing your life away over this.
BUFFY It's not your choice.
SPIKE Why are you doing this to yourself?
BUFFY A girl is dead because of me.
SPIKE And how many people are alive because of you? How many have you saved? One dead girl doesn't tip the scale.
BUFFY That's all it is to you, isn't it? Just another body!
SPIKE Buffy-
BUFFY You can't understand why this is killing me, can you?
SPIKE Why don't you explain it?
SPIKE Come on, that's it, put it on me. Put it all on me. That's my girl.
BUFFY I am not your girl!
BUFFY You don't ... have a soul! There is nothing good or clean in you. You are dead inside! You can't feel anything real! I could never ... be your girl!
SPIKE You always hurt ... the one you love, pet.
SPIKE Buffy?
SPIKE Buffy...
DESK_SERGEANT No, no statements. Not until I get confirmation.
BUFFY Excuse me. I-I need to...
DESK_SERGEANT Uh, I'll be with you in a sec.
DESK_SERGEANT Sunnydale PD. Yeah, the phone's ringing off the hook here.
DESK_SERGEANT Listen, you got an ID on that body yet? Yeah? Okay, shoot.
DESK_SERGEANT Katrina ... Silber. S-i-l-b-e-r.
KATRINA_VOICEOVER Warren, just tell her to go away.
WARREN_VOICEOVER I can't.
KATRINA You're keeping secrets from me. Other girls, and who knows what else!
WARREN Trina ... shut up.
BUFFY Warren.
DESK_SERGEANT Thanks. Now what's the problem, Miss...
ANYA Is this what you saw?
BUFFY Yeah, that's it.
ANYA Mm. The Rwasundi. Very rare. Um, its presence in our dimension causes a sort of ... localized temporal disturbance.
BUFFY So that's why time went all David Lynch?
ANYA Right. Uh, human perception is based on a linear chronology. Being exposed to the Rwasundi for more than a few seconds can cause, uh, vivid hallucinations. And a slight tingly scalp.
WILLOW So that's it. These things just made you think you killed her.
XANDER She was probably dead long before you stumbled across her.
BUFFY It wasn't the demons. It was Warren. He knew Katrina. He had something to do with it, I know it.
WILLOW How can you be sure?
BUFFY You always hurt the one you love.
DAWN Does this mean you're not going away?
BUFFY Yeah. I'm not going anywhere.
BUFFY We need to find Warren, and the others. Whatever they've done, they're not gonna get away with it.
WARREN We're gonna get away with it. Injuries consistent with a fall.
WARREN The coroner's ruling it a suicide.
JONATHAN What about Buffy?
WARREN Well, it wasn't that hard messing her game up. If she figures it out ... we'll take care of her.
ANDREW We really got away with murder.
ANDREW That's ... kinda cool.
JONATHAN Yeah. Cool.
BUFFY_VOICEOVER Are you sure?
TARA I-I've double checked everything. There's nothing wrong with you.
BUFFY Then why can Spike hurt me?
TARA Well, I said that there was nothing wrong with you, but ... you are different. Shifting you out of ... f-f-from where you were ... funneling your essence back into your body ... i-it, it altered you on a basic molecular level. Probably just enough to confuse the sensors or whatever in Spike's chip. But it's all just surfacey physical stuff. It wouldn't have any more effect than ... a bad sunburn.
BUFFY I didn't come back wrong?
TARA No, you're the same Buffy. With a deep tropical cellular tan.
BUFFY You must have missed something. Will you check again?
TARA Buffy, I-I promise, there's nothing wrong with you.
BUFFY There has to be! This just can't be me, it isn't me. Why do I feel like this? Why do I let Spike do those things to me?
TARA You mean hit you.
TARA Oh.
TARA Oh, huh. Really.
BUFFY He's everything I hate. He's everything that ... I'm supposed to be against. But the only time that I ever feel anything is when ... Don't tell anyone, please.
TARA I won't.
BUFFY The way they would look at me ... I just couldn't...
TARA I won't tell anyone. I wouldn't do that.
BUFFY Why can't I stop? Why do I keep letting him in?
TARA Do you love him?
TARA I-It's okay if you do. He's done a lot of good, and, and he does love you. A-and Buffy, it's okay if you don't. You're going through a really hard time, and you're...
BUFFY What? Using him? What's okay about that?
TARA It's not that simple.
BUFFY It is! It's wrong. I'm wrong. Tell me that I'm wrong, please...
BUFFY Please don't forgive me, please... Please don't...
BUFFY Please don't forgive me...
