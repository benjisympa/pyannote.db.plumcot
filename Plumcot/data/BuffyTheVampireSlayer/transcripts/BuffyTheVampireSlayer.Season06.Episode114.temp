BUFFY I'm sorry.
DAWN It's okay.
BUFFY No, we're gonna sit down and have a real dinner. Someday. I hate having to run out in the middle, it's just, you know, there's this thing out there. Definitely non-vampire.
DAWN I understand.
DAWN Well, maybe when you get back we can set up for your party tomorrow.
BUFFY Yeah. Uh, this could take a while though, I-I wouldn't wait up. Besides, Willow promised to be on birthday patrol, so there's nothing left for us to do.
DAWN Right.
BUFFY Okay, so, finish dinner, homework, and don't stay up too late, all right?
DAWN Okay.
BUFFY Okay.
BUFFY Run off, huh? Afraid to face a true warrior?
BUFFY Ooh, shiny.
ANYA Do you think we should set up lots of candles for Buffy's party tomorrow?
XANDER Not if they're that horrible slug kind you keep trying to unload.
ANYA I don't know why people get so turned off by slug.
XANDER Honey, slugs get turned off by slug. Oh, actually, I wanted to talk to you about that.
WILLOW Slugs?
XANDER No, the party. Or, Tara ... at the party.
WILLOW Oh.
XANDER It's just ... Buffy really wants her there. It seems important to her, so I told her I'd ask you.
WILLOW Oh ... yeah, of course, she should totally be there. It'll be great.
DAWN Hey!
WILLOW Hey, Dawnie. Buffy, uh, out patrolling already?
XANDER So, uh, anything new about Warren and the Nerd Herd?
DAWN No, just a big monster hunt.
XANDER Man, a nerd goes into hiding, he really goes into hiding.
DAWN Does anybody want to come to the mall with me for birthday presents?
WILLOW Oh, I would, honey, but ... I've got my group. You know, the whole Spellcasters Anonymous thing? We're still looking for a better name.
DAWN Oh. Well, yeah, uh, no, that-that's good. You should ... do that. So what about you guys?
ANYA Stuck in doing-the-books-ville.
XANDER Aw, I'd love to go with you, but I gotta finish this new shift schedule for the crew by tomorrow morning.
WILLOW Sorry, it just looks like one of those nights. You know?
DAWN Yeah.
WILLOW You okay going on your own?
DAWN Yeah. Somehow I'll, uh, manage to pull it off.
DAWN Buffy?
TEACHER ...if we can come up with things Jim lost during his years in Shanghai, and things he gained.
STUDENT Excuse me.
TEACHER Who wants to-
TEACHER Dawn.
TEACHER They need you in the guidance office.
GUIDANCE_COUNSELOR_VOICEOVER I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
GUIDANCE_COUNSELOR Just a follow-up after your ... your loss. And since I'm new here, I thought it would give us a chance to know each other.
DAWN Great.
GUIDANCE_COUNSELOR So, I've been looking through your file and, um ... your grades have slipped a little.
DAWN I have really hard classes this quarter.
GUIDANCE_COUNSELOR Yeah, still. Teachers say that you seem a little distracted lately.
DAWN I'm not. I-I'm fine.
GUIDANCE_COUNSELOR Okay. It's just, you know, I know it must seem weird, talking to a stranger about stuff, but, um ... I want you to know that if something's going on, something's up, my job ... the most important part of my job ... is looking out for you.
DAWN I'm really okay.
GUIDANCE_COUNSELOR I know there's been ... a lot of loss.
DAWN Yeah. Kinda. I-I mean, yes. People keep ... people have a tendency to go away ... and, I miss them. And sometimes ... I wish I could just make them stop. Going away.
DAWN But seriously, it's, it's no big deal. I'm fine.
XANDER We're feeding an army!
BUFFY No, they couldn't make it.
XANDER So, who's coming, you invite anyone else?
BUFFY Just you guys. Willow, Tara. The gang. Oh, and Sophie from work.
BUFFY What? Like I'm one of those losers who can't make friends outside her tight little circle? No. I'm friendly. We bonded instantly. Peas in a pod. Bonded peas.
ANYA Really? Um, what's Sophie's last name?
BUFFY Okay, shut up.
XANDER Don't worry about it, we're all over the new friend thing.
BUFFY What ... new friend thing?
ANYA Well, well ... we invited someone for you.
ANYA A guy.
DAWN For Buffy? Really?
XANDER Ahh, don't worry, it's not a setup.
ANYA Right. No. Just an attractive single man, with whom we hope you find much in common. And if you happen to form-
XANDER Ahn-
ANYA -a romantic relationship leading to babies-
XANDER Ahn-
ANYA -and many double dates with us so we have someone else to talk to, yay!
BUFFY I assume this was an act of kindness? That'll help with the not throttling.
XANDER Hey, I'm just gonna get this stuff out there, people should be here soon.
BUFFY Hey! You made it!
TARA Of course, sweetie. So, how're you doing?
BUFFY Oh, you know. Better. Mostly. Sometimes.
TARA So, is, um... Spike coming?
BUFFY No. He may be a chip-head, but ... he still doesn't play too well with others.
BUFFY Besides, I'm definitely not ready to, to...
TARA Come out.
BUFFY Yeah. I'm all ... stay-inny.
BUFFY How are you doing?
TARA The word gulp comes to mind.
BUFFY Just remember, we're all here...to...
BUFFY ...I have to, with the thing that I, uh... Coming!
WILLOW Hey.
TARA Hey.
WILLOW Hey. How are you?
TARA Fine, thanks, I'm ... I'm fine. I, how are you?
WILLOW Great! I mean... Fine. I'm, I'm ... finey McFine. Fine.
TARA Y-you look...
WILLOW Thanks.
TARA I mean ... great.
WILLOW Thanks. You do too. Is that a new-
TARA Oh, yeah.
WILLOW It's nice.
TARA Thanks.
TARA I-I'm gonna get something to drink.
WILLOW Oh, yeah, great. You should.
WILLOW You don't wanna get thirsty.
BUFFY Hey, how did it-
TARA Yes please.
BUFFY Spike.
SPIKE Yeah. Willow mentioned the shindig ... figured we're all part of the team.
SPIKE Thought I'd, uh, swing by.
BUFFY Wait, what kind of team is this?
DEMON Hi. We met once before.
BUFFY Yes, yes we did.
SPIKE You know, more, merrier, that whole thing.
DEMON Hi, I'm Clement. Clem.
TARA Tara.
XANDER Buffy, Richard.
BUFFY Hey.
XANDER He was wondering where the best place was to park his car.
BUFFY Oh, that's easy, just-
XANDER Buffy will show ya.
BUFFY Okay, uh... I'll be right back.
RICHARD Uh ... the guy with the...
BUFFY Skin condition. He doesn't like to talk about it.
SPIKE Stupid git!
TARA I don't know. He seemed ... cute. W-was he cute? I mean, I'm not a very good judge, but...
TARA I think he seemed cute.
CLEM I think he seemed cute, yeah.
DAWN If we get Buffy, can, can she start on opening the presents? It's been enough time, hasn't it?
ANYA Not yet, sweetie.
XANDER I think Buffy's busy right now.
ANYA Buffy's making a new friend. A grown-up friend.
DAWN What, you mean the guy you invited to set her up with?
ANYA Nothing.
DAWN It's not like I don't understand why you invited him. I was there, remember? I can hear you when I'm in the room, you know? I do understand these things.
ANYA Yes you do!
DAWN You know I'm in high school, right?
ANYA Yes you are!
SPIKE You wanna slip away for a minute, luv?
BUFFY What?
SPIKE I'll let you blow out my candles.
BUFFY Here. Now? I don't think so.
SPIKE Oh, what, you worried about Richard? You don't wanna make your new boyfriend jealous, huh?
BUFFY Shut up. He's ... sweet.
SPIKE Oh, shut up, he's sweet.
BUFFY Maybe he's not the jealous one.
SPIKE You think he'll take you out on his ten-speed, pet? Maybe he'll let you ride in that little basket in the front. Jealous my ass.
BUFFY Uh...
WILLOW See? i-it's a battery-operated back massager. And it's portable so you can take it with you on patrol.
BUFFY Wow.
WILLOW It's like, instant gratification for all your little acheys.
BUFFY Great! Thanks! Uh, what's next?
DAWN Here, do mine.
BUFFY Dawn.
DAWN Do you like it?
BUFFY It's ... gorgeous.
DAWN I was so nervous. I was afraid you wouldn't like it.
BUFFY I-it still has the security tag on it.
DAWN Huh. That's so weird. I can't believe they didn't take that off.
XANDER Happy birthday, Buffy!
BUFFY Oh my god!
BUFFY Did you guys make that?
ANYA Uh, well, uh, Xander did the building. I offered helpful suggestions while observing from a safe distance.
XANDER Holds basic weapons, plus a few non-basic ones too. Plus, there's a handsome CD holder.
ANYA We wanted you to have something no one else would have.
BUFFY A Xander Harris original.
BUFFY I love it. Thanks, you guys!
TARA Buffy?
BUFFY Oh! Sophie!
BUFFY Welcome! Uh, we're somewhere between, uh, presents and cake. There is gonna be cake eventually, right?
SOPHIE Hey. Uh, my mom told me to say thank you right away, 'cause, otherwise I usually forget. So, thank you.
SOPHIE And, also, um, I can't have any, any chocolate, or, or peanuts or egg yolks.
ANYA Is this the friend you brought from work?
BUFFY Yes.
SOPHIE A-and sometimes dairy.
BUFFY No problem.
ANYA Our friend is better.
BUFFY Uh, we can do official introductions now that everyone's officially here. Dawnie, you mind getting the door?
BUFFY Sophie, this is Anya ... and Willow...
HALFREK Wish granted.
RICHARD Hey.
BUFFY Hi.
RICHARD Great party. Everyone's havin' fun.
BUFFY I hope so.
RICHARD I mean, look what time it is and no one's even thinking about leaving. I, uh ... can't tear myself away.
BUFFY Yeah?
RICHARD Yeah. Can I get you a drink?
BUFFY Uh ... I'm good, thank you.
RICARD Okay.
BUFFY I think I'll just ... head back in.
RICHARD Well ... I'll look for you.
BUFFY Okay.
SPIKE Ooh, Buffy. Can I get you a soda pop? I think I'm in looove.
BUFFY Stop it. Someone's gonna see.
SPIKE Mm-hmm.
SPIKE I had ... a ... muscle cramp. Buffy was, uh, helping.
TARA A muscle cramp? In your ... pants?
SPIKE What, it's a thing.
TARA Right.
ANYA_VOICEOVER No, you go.
XANDER No, you go.
ANYA No, you go.
WILLOW Okay!
WILLOW It's just a beer run, I'll go.
SOPHIE Oh, well, I can't really drink beer, 'cause you know, barley. But I'll go with you to get some.
WILLOW Perfect. Here we go. The beer-gettin'.
BUFFY This sucks. I'm out.
RICHARD No way. I think you're doing fine.
XANDER You wanna try poker?
CLEM Still say it's weird without the kittens.
BUFFY No kittens. He's quirky.
RICHARD Look, we've already been playing for like three hours, it's, you know, it's like two-something in the morning. You can't bail now.
ANYA Yeah, come on, Buffy, stay. I wanna bankrupt somebody.
DAWN Oh! We should totally have a slumber party.
BUFFY Oh, I don't know... I guess, as long as everyone's staying up anyway.
SPIKE Must be some late-night activities to keep us busy till morning.
TARA How's that cramp, Spike? Still bothering you?
SPIKE What? Oh. Yeah.
TARA Maybe you, uh, wanna put some ice on it.
RICHARD Hey Xander, we gotta be at work in a few minutes.
XANDER Okay.
RICHARD I can't be late today.
SPIKE You should definitely go. Let's find your coat and get you on your merry way.
BUFFY Spike.
RICHARD I don't know why I'm not leaving.
SPIKE Me either. Besides, Richie, you can't skip breakfast. Growing boy like you. Me, I used to love breakfast. In the old days, I probably would have eaten by now.
BUFFY Of course, with that new diet of yours, you wanna be careful what you try puttin' in your mouth now, Spikey.
SPIKE Yeah? I don't know. Tummy's making all kinds of gurglies. Maybe I oughta just feed on whatever's around... even if it doesn't go down well. You, uh, work out?
BUFFY Okey-dokey.
BUFFY 'Scuse us.
BUFFY Hey, Mister Passive-Aggressive Guy. Seriously, you wanna take it down a notch or two in there?
SPIKE What, poor dainty Richard can't take a joke?
BUFFY We do not joke about eating people in this house!
SPIKE What are you gonna do, beat me up again?
BUFFY I should have thrown you out the second you got here. I was insane to ever think you could just hang out with my friends.
SPIKE And *I* was insane to think... No, wait. You were right. *You're* insane.
WILLOW Oh, hi.
TARA Hey.
TARA Breakfast. Didn't really plan for a sleep-over.
WILLOW I know, me either. It's weird, I ... I have class, and I know I should go, but...
TARA I know, i-it's like, I wanna leave, but I don't want to.
WILLOW Exactly.
BUFFY I think it's time for you to go.
SPIKE Yeah, well, can't. Daylight.
BUFFY Okay. I'll go.
SPIKE I'll get the door.
BUFFY Fine!
SPIKE Fine!
BUFFY I'm actually trying to move right now.
SPIKE Me too.
BUFFY Well ... this can't be good.
BUFFY There's something keeping us in this house.
XANDER Or someone.
TARA Has everyone tried to get out?
WILLOW What if we just, like, as a group, got up and, and threw ourselves at the door?
XANDER All right. Count of three. One ... two ... three!
XANDER Here we go!
BUFFY Hence the problem.
RICHARD I really need to go. I mean, I have a job to get to.
ANYA I have to open the Magic Box.
SOPHIE I have a shift at the DoubleMeat. Actually, I'm okay here.
CLEM Yeah, I'm, I'm fine.
XANDER Willow and Tara have class, I gotta be at the site.
BUFFY I know, I know, we all have places that we'd rather be.
SPIKE Things we'd rather be doing.
BUFFY I think the first priority has to be to find a way out.
DAWN Sure. Of course you all wanna leave. 'Cause being stuck in here with me, that would really suck, right?
WILLOW No, Dawnie! It's just, we have more important things to do.
DAWN Yeah, I know. Important. Whatever that means, right?
BUFFY Dawn?
DAWN What?
BUFFY Did you do something?
DAWN Me?
TARA Do you know something? 'Cause we want you to feel like you can tell us.
DAWN What would I know?
WILLOW Look, we're not accusing you of anything, it's just ... you were kind of taking it personal down there.
DAWN Oh. Okay. So you've all just decided that somehow I'm responsible. Great. Here's me baskin' in the love.
XANDER No, it's just, you know, you're upset 'cause we all wanna leave. And now we can't leave. Only thing missing is a cornfield. There ... there isn't a cornfield, is there?
BUFFY Dawnie, it's okay. You know, we're not gonna be mad.
DAWN Yeah, only I didn't do anything!
WILLOW You sure?
DAWN You want me to ask my other self?
BUFFY Dawn, we're just trying to figure out what's going on.
DAWN Figure it out yourself. I'm done being talked to like a kid.
XANDER Well, 'cause you know, sometimes we do something that seems like a good idea at the time, like, say, invoke the power of a musical amulet? And it turns out, you know, not so much.
DAWN God! I didn't do anything! I wish I had. I'm glad you're trapped. How else can I get anybody to spend any time with me?
BUFFY Dawn. If you want us to spend time with you-
DAWN I don't. Get out.
DAWN Get out, get out, get out!
ANYA_VOICEOVER I think she's possessed.
XANDER She's a teenager.
TARA Phones are all out, we're totally cut off.
BUFFY She's just so angry.
TARA It happens. We all went through it.
BUFFY I know. I just can't figure out why she didn't come to me.
XANDER Well, you have been a little busy lately.
SPIKE Hey, I don't wanna keep you all from the touchy-feelies, but maybe the encounter group can meet later. Say, when we're not trapped in a house.
TARA Even if Dawn does know something, she's obviously not gonna help us right now. We need another way.
BUFFY I think magic's gonna be our best bet. Something general, you know? Cast a wide net.
XANDER But ... Willow.
TARA No, I'll do it. It's just, o-obviously I didn't bring any supplies.
BUFFY Well, we don't have any in the house. We got rid of everything.
WILLOW Actually ... not everything. I, uh... might have ... kept one or, or two things. Sort of.
WILLOW ...just in case.
XANDER That's great!
XANDER ...in a very bad way.
TARA Just ... bring me what you have. But I'm doing this alone. You need to stay away from it.
ANYA So we're supposed to just wait?
WILLOW It won't take long.
RICHARD All right, somebody wanna tell me what's, what's going on here? We're trapped in a house by ... by what, some unseen force or something. Who knows what she's doing in there. And I have to tell you... I don't think that's a skin condition.
TARA Release.
TARA Try the door!
SPIKE No. Can't.
SPIKE What the bloody hell was that?
BUFFY That's the demon I killed two nights ago.
SPIKE The demon you thought you killed.
XANDER It looks pretty bad.
ANYA Oh god. Oh, god.
TARA Let's get him upstairs. We need to get him to a doctor soon.
BUFFY Hey, i-it's gonna be okay.
BUFFY Just trust me, I promise we'll be out of here soon.
SOPHIE Oh god. Oh god.
BUFFY Okay, so maybe 'soon' was a bit of an overstatement.
SPIKE So, you ever think about *not* celebrating a birthday? Just to try it, I mean.
BUFFY I'm gonna go check upstairs. Keep an eye on things down here?
BUFFY You stay here, okay?
DAWN What's that noise? It's in the walls, isn't it?
CLEM Sorry.
ANYA Why is it so hot in here?
XANDER You're just a little freaked out, that's all. It'll pass.
ANYA He's gonna die. He's gonna die, and we're gonna watch.
XANDER Ahn...
ANYA And we're just sitting here. Why are we just sitting here? Why aren't we doing something?
XANDER We are. We will. We've been through worse.
ANYA Not like this. Not trapped like animals. Seriously, did someone turn on the heat? I can't breathe, I just ... oh, I just can't breathe ... I can't breathe...
XANDER Ahn, stop. Stop, Ahn, stop!
XANDER Listen to me. You're just freaking out, okay? It's normal. You're just ... you're just scared. We all are. We'll come up with a plan ... and we'll get through it, all right? We'll do something.
ANYA What?
XANDER I don't know. Lemme get you some water, okay? It'll cool you down. I'll be back in a second, okay? Stay here, don't move.
ANYA Xander?
BUFFY Grab the sword!
BUFFY Are you hurt?
BUFFY Here, let me see.
ANYA Xander.
XANDER It's okay. I'm okay, see? Shh.
XANDER It's all right. I'm okay.
BUFFY It's getting kinda scary. You okay?
DAWN Do you care?
BUFFY Fine. Stay with Spike.
DAWN It's not like I meant for this to happen.
BUFFY I never said that you did.
DAWN I didn't want this.
BUFFY What did you want?
DAWN Nothing.
BUFFY Dawn, come on.
DAWN No. You don't know! You have this thing you do. You have all these friends. You have no idea what it's like.
BUFFY What are you talking about? I don't know what, what-
DAWN Being alone!
BUFFY You're not alone!
DAWN Then why do I feel like this?
TARA I just think we haven't thought of the right way out yet, that's all.
SPIKE Well, we can't just stay put like cattle, waiting for that thing to pop out every time it gets peckish.
TARA I'd say we do another spell, but I, I think we've tried everything.
ANYA Well ... that's not completely true, is it? I mean, not everything. Not exactly. We're sitting here with an incredibly powerful witch ... much more powerful than you, Tara, I'm sorry ... only no one seems willing to say it.
WILLOW I can't.
ANYA No, see, that's not exactly true either. Not can't, won't.
WILLOW You don't know how much I hate this. I don't know if there's even ... anything I could do.
ANYA Yes ... and a good way to find out is to sit around and try nothing. That was sarcasm, by the way.
SPIKE Look-
WILLOW It's dangerous.
ANYA And so is all of us dying!
XANDER Will ... look, I don't wanna gang up on you ... but Anya kinda has a point. We brought you back from it once. We're all here, it's just one little spell, whatever happens, we can bring you back again.
WILLOW No. I can't. If I start, I ... I might not be able to stop.
ANYA And whose fault is that? You know, if you hadn't gotten so much of this in your system in the first place-
TARA Hey! You're gonna back off!
TARA She said no, and that's it. You're not gonna make her do something that she doesn't want to. And if you try... You're gonna have to go through me first. Understood?
ANYA Fine. If you all aren't willing to get us out of this, then I will do it myself.
BUFFY I wish you would have told me.
DAWN You haven't really been...
BUFFY What? I haven't been what?
DAWN Around.
BUFFY Dawn ... the most important job that I have ... is looking out for you.
DAWN You sound like my guidance counselor. She give you a handbook or something? 'Talkin' to the Troubled Teen'?
BUFFY Counselor?
DAWN It wasn't my idea. I didn't even know we had guidance counselors. She called me out of class like I was a total J.D.
BUFFY And you'd ... never met her before?
DAWN No, not until yesterday.
BUFFY And ... she got you to start talking about things that bothered you at home?
DAWN Uh ... yeah?
BUFFY You didn't, by any chance, happen to ... express like a, a wish, or-or something, to her?
DAWN Um ... maybe just a little.
XANDER Honey, come on, this isn't the way, calm down.
ANYA She knows something. She knows something, we have to find out what it is.
DAWN Hey!
XANDER Ahn, just stop for a second.
ANYA There's gotta be a clue in here somewhere.
DAWN Stop it!
BUFFY Anya, it wasn't her fault.
DAWN No!
ANYA Half this stuff is from the Magic Box.
ANYA How could you do this?
ANYA I work hard at that store, and I helped you! I took care of you. This is how you say 'thank you'?
BUFFY Anya, hold on, okay? Tell her you didn't do this. Tell her it's a mistake.
DAWN No!
BUFFY Oh.
DAWN Buffy...
ANYA How are we supposed to trust you, Dawn? I mean, you ... you say you didn't put us here, but look at this stuff! How are we supposed to believe you?
BUFFY Look, I-I don't think she- I don't think it's all her fault, okay? She ... there was a guidance counselor, or someone pretending to be a guidance counselor, she, she made Dawn make a wish.
ANYA Guidance counselor? You made a wish to someone you've never seen before?
DAWN Yeah?
ANYA Did she wear a pendant with a, with a dark blue stone?
DAWN And little red flecks?
ANYA Uhh, for crying out loud. Halfrek! It's Halfrek, a vengeance demon. You made a wish to a vengeance demon.
DAWN I didn't know.
ANYA Only a vengeance demon can break her own vengeance spell. Nothing else will work. She's the only one who can get us out of here. Hallie, get your ass down here!
HALFREK You rang?
ANYA I hope you die, you stupid jerkface!
XANDER Anya!
SPIKE The sword!
ANYA Her pendant! Get her pendant!
HALFREK There will be no touching of the pendant.
HALFREK What? Did you think I'd be stopped by a sword in the chest?
HALFREK Flesh wound. Honestly, Anyanka, you used to know better.
ANYA How could you? Why would you do this?
HALFREK I told you I was going to take care of some business while I was here in town.
ANYA Yeah, but cursing us? Some of them are in the wedding party.
HALFREK I just go where I'm-
HALFREK William?
SPIKE Hey, wait a minute.
BUFFY You guys know each other?
HALFREK Uh, no. No.
SPIKE Not really.
TARA I thought vengeance demons only punished men who wronged women.
HALFREK Oh, that was Anya's little
ANYA Well-rounded, huh? Is that how you explain your thing for bad parents?
HALFREK Oh, it's not a thing. The children need me.
ANYA Hmm!Daddy issues
HALFREK Sling all the little barbs at me that you want, Anyanka, it doesn't change the fact that this girl was in pain, and none of you could hear it. I could hear her crying out everywhere I went in this town. It was unbearable. And none of you knew.
HALFREK You people deserve to be cursed. Enjoy your time together. From now on ... all you have is time. Time ... and each other. Good luck!
HALFREK Wait ... Wait.
HALFREK Time, and each other.
ANYA It's the curse, Hallie.
HALFREK Oh, for crying out loud. Fine, the curse is lifted! We can all leave now! ... Damn it.
WILLOW Thanks ... for before. And, and for taking this stuff with you.
TARA No problem.
WILLOW Just so you know, I-I was never ... gonna use it. I mean, not really, I ... I just kept it like a safety net. 'Cause ... there was always this ... thing in the back of my head. This, you know, voice, saying, like, 'what if things get bad, I mean really bad? And what if you can't handle it?' A-and it made me panic, so ... that's why I kept a couple of things. I ... kept them so I-I didn't have to think about it, so I could focus on ... on getting better.
TARA I get it. I-I really do. But it's time to work without the net, Will. You know, I don't know if you noticed, but it actually did get bad in there. Really bad, and ... and you still said no.
RICHARD You have some weird friends.
XANDER News from the file marked 'duh.' We're gonna get him to the E.R.
ANYA And then we're gonna talk about payment. And Dawnie, there are two words I want you to get used to...
ANYA Punitive damages.
BUFFY Think it's worn off?
SPIKE Just one thing to do.
ANYA Okay, who's pushing?
TARA Wow, look at the stars!
CLEM Good party!
XANDER I just wanna run barefoot on the grass so I can feel the dew-drops between my... God, look at the stars!
