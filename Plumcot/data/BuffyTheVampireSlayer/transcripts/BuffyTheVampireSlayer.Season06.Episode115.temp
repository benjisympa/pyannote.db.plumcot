TODD_VOICEOVER You see, Buffy...
TODD_VOICEOVER ...the thing you gotta learn about the Palace, and this takes a while...
TODD ...is that job security all boils down to one simple thing.
TODD Politics.
TODD Now, I'm not a political animal, but you learn fast around here or it's wham! Hello glass ceiling.
TODD I mean, it's not like we work at Burger World, or the Happy Bun, where the power structure is simple. No, here at the Palace, you gotta keep your friends close, but your enemies? Closer. It's like Machiavelli says. You know Machiavelli, right?
BUFFY Tall guy, bleached mullet, works day shifts?
TODD I'm sorry. My bad. I keep forgetting you dropped out of college.
BUFFY I'm reapplying.
TODD Good luck with that. Well, gotta motor! Don't wanna be late for night school.
BUFFY You go to night school?
TODD I'm working on my MBA. Think I wanna spend the rest of my life cleaning grease traps? Ooh, don't forget to lock up before you go, and the gum under the tables? Be sure to give it a good scrape before you leave.
BUFFY May I?
TODD See you tomorrow!
BUFFY Yes, you will. And the day after that, and the day after that, and the day after that...
BUFFY 'Get the double treat, that's the double sweet, oh it's hard to beat, when the meat meets-' Oh, why can't I get this stupid jingle out of my head?
VAMP Least of your problems now, little girl.
BUFFY Wait.
VAMP Ooookay.
BUFFY Okay, let's do this. Quickly.
VAMP What's that smell? Geez, Slayer, is that you?
BUFFY I've been working!
VAMP Where, in a slaughterhouse?!
BUFFY Double Meat Palace.
VAMP Ohhh.
VAMP You know what? Let's just call it a night. If it's all the same to you, and you've been eating that stuff, I'm not so sure I wanna bite you.
BUFFY You're dead! You smell like it! How do you get to say I'm the one who's stinky?
VAMP Really, it's, it's cool, I'll just catch you next time.
BUFFY Oh, for pete's sake. Spike?
SPIKE Ah, it's a fair cop, you caught me, Slayer. However, in all honesty, I think we have to say this one doesn't count. After all, I wasn't exactly hiding.
BUFFY No, Spike.
SPIKE No? What kind of answer is that, you haven't even heard the question yet.
BUFFY I don't have to. We both know what you're thinking.
SPIKE And we both know ... that I'm not the only one thinking it.
BUFFY No! Not here.
SPIKE Why not?
BUFFY Dawn. She's inside waiting for dinner, she's counting on me. I'm not letting her down by letting you in.
SPIKE So it's the fear of getting caught, then, is it?
BUFFY Reason number one on a very long list.
SPIKE Needn't be an obstacle.
BUFFY Spike, I mean it. Come on.
SPIKE I hear you're serious. So am I. I want you ... you want me...
SPIKE ...I can't go inside, so ... maybe the time is right ... for you to come outside.
BUFFY Dawn.
BUFFY Hey, hi.
DAWN Rough night?
BUFFY The usual. I-I brought you dinner.
DAWN Oh, great. Oh.
BUFFY I-I know it's not the most original these days, but ... I made it myself. I-I made hundreds, actually, but this is the, the very best one.
DAWN It ... looks kinda squished.
BUFFY Oh, well just, you know, just... give it a sec. Yeah, these babies really bounce back. Literally.
DAWN Buffy ... it's not like I don't appreciate it, I do. It's just that ... I can't eat this stuff another night. I'm sorry.
BUFFY Oh! No, it, it's all good. I get it. Tell you what, tomorrow night, I'll, uh, I'll bring home the fisherman's nuggets with cheese.
WILLOW Hey, workin' lady. Rough night?
BUFFY Why does everybody keep asking me that?
WILLOW Uh, no reason, I just ... thought you were busy with the slayage 'cause of that grass stain.
DAWN Some vamp get rough with you?
BUFFY He's not getting any gentler.
WILLOW He?
BUFFY They. Them. You know. Vampires in the, in the ... general population sense. Now I'm gonna have to wash this.
WILLOW Ready for a bold suggestion? Blow it off! Dawnie and I are headed out to the Bronze.
DAWN Um, do I have your permission and wanna come along? You like how I slipped in that permission request like that?
WILLOW Very smooth.
BUFFY You guys go.
DAWN Really?
WILLOW Buffy, are you sure? I-it might do you good to get away from the Double Meat lifestyle for a night. See your friends.
DAWN Who'd love to see you.
BUFFY I'm sure. I've seen enough action for one night. Home by eleven?
DAWN On the dot.
BUFFY Have a good time.
BUFFY Somebody should.
ANYA See ... this seating chart makes no sense. We have to do it again. We can't do it again. You do it.
XANDER The seating chart's fine. Let's get back to the table arrangements. I'm starting to have dreams of gardenia bouquets. I am so glad my manly coworkers didn't just hear me say that.
ANYA Will you stop wolfing down those chips? One more bag and you'll pop right out of your cummerbund.
ANYA You're not even hungry, you're just nervous.
XANDER Yeah! Wedding, one week! We have friends, family, demons flying in, a to-do list getting no shorter, and do NOT- -take my chips.
DAWN Hey guys! How's the soon-to-be-newlyweds? Nervous?
ANYA/XANDER No!
DAWN Okay. I'll just be over here then.
DAWN Your Arnold Palmer, milady.
WILLOW Thanks. So how are Mr. and Mrs. High-Strung?
DAWN I'm betting they explode.
WILLOW You know, when I was little, I used to spend hours imagining what my wedding to Xander would be like. And now I look at them... I just think... Nee-hee-hee!
DAWN You're awfully chipper tonight.
WILLOW Can't hide it.
DAWN Hmm. Big wedding coming up ... lots of date possibilities ... you and Tara are speaking again. You wanna call her? Invite her over?
WILLOW Oh, no. Too soon for so bold a maneuver. But if I did call? She wouldn't hang up on me.
DAWN That's progress!
WILLOW Hence the happy.
BUFFY Garbage! Uhh...
BUFFY Wait! Wait up, guys!
BUFFY Wait!
BUFFY Don't you want your garbage?
DAWN Hey Buffy. Oh, don't forget, today's trash day.
BUFFY Thanks.
BUFFY 'Dear Ms. Summers, we are sorry to reject...'
DAWN What's that?
BUFFY Nothing.
DAWN Huh. Bronze was fun last night. In a total home-by-eleven-ish way. You should have come.
BUFFY Well, next time. Where are you going?
DAWN School?
BUFFY Oh. That's good. Uh, don't you want breakfast first?
DAWN Already made it. See you this afternoon? Unless you're working. Tonight then. Or, you know, tomorrow's cool. Don't work too hard.
BUFFY Bye.
TODD And that's where even your best political minds can drop the ball.
TODD Zeitgeist! You're not taking the pulse of the public, the next thing you know you're LBJ handing the house keys over to Nixon. Heard back from your college yet?
BUFFY Yeah.
TODD All right. You know, we're out of special sauce.
BUFFY I'll get it.
TODD No no. Your turn up front. I'll deal back here. You take the customers.
BUFFY Welcome to the Double Meat Palace, how may I help...
BUFFY You.
RILEY Hey.
BUFFY Huh?
BUFFY Riley.
RILEY Sorry to just drop in on you like this, Buffy.
BUFFY It's you.
RILEY It's me.
BUFFY You're here.
RILEY I know.
BUFFY And ... were you always this tall?
RILEY Look, this isn't the way I wanted it. But something's come up, something big. We don't have much time. You understand?
BUFFY Not a work you've said so far.
RILEY Right. I should have known, anticipated. You're working.
BUFFY Well, just counter, not grill any more.
RILEY I want to explain, I just don't have time. I've been up for 48 hours straight tracking something bad, and now it's come to Sunnydale.
BUFFY My hat has a cow.
RILEY I know that I'm putting you on the spot, showing up like this, but ... but you know, here we are. I need the best. I need you, Buffy. Can you help me?
TODD Hellooo, Buffy? People are waiting.
TODD Buffy, uh ... Buffy! Wait! Buffy!
RILEY Look, I'm sorry this is all so sudden. You know, if we get a minute, I'd really like to sit down...
BUFFY What is it?
RILEY Suvolte demon. Rare, lethal ... nearly extinct, but not nearly enough. It's close.
RILEY What?
BUFFY Sorry. It's just ... you still carry around all that James Bond stuff.
BUFFY It's so cute! I forgot.
BUFFY Sorry. Carry on.
RILEY We've been tear-assing through every jungle from Paraguay up, taking out nests. As soon as we put one Suvolte down, a dozen take its place. They're breeders, Buffy. One turns into ten, ten becomes a hundred. This gets out of hand and there's a war with humans? Humans are gonna lose.
BUFFY So they're like really mean tribbles. Sorry, I've been dealing with these, these geeks, it's, it's a whole thing.
RILEY You ready for this?
BUFFY Yes please.
RILEY National Forestry Service, we got a wild bear! Everybody stand back! Look out!
RILEY Split.
BUFFY Riley!
RILEY You all right?
BUFFY I'll feel better when we catch it. But it's too fast.
RILEY I wouldn't necessarily say that.
BUFFY Nice wheels.
RILEY Came with the car.
BUFFY Know where we're goin'?
RILEY Got an idea. The tag's on-line. We'll find it.
BUFFY How's your arm?
RILEY It'll heal. How you doin'?
BUFFY Complicated question.
RILEY I just meant-
BUFFY I know.
RILEY I hear ya. Got some, uh ... big stories to tell you to. If we ever get half a second.
BUFFY Did you die?
RILEY No.
BUFFY I'm gonna win.
RILEY Here. No offense, but this is black ops, and you look like a pylon.
BUFFY Ninja wear?
RILEY Battle gear. Lightweight Kevlar, state of the art.
BUFFY What a surprise.
RILEY Boys like toys. Put it on, thank me later.
BUFFY You won't look?
RILEY I'm a gentleman.
BUFFY Okay. So ... the black-ops life, it's workin' out for ya?
RILEY Don't suck.
BUFFY They got dental?
RILEY Yeah, we're covered.
RILEY You know, there's not many people I'd ask to risk their life for me, Buffy. It's really good to see you.
BUFFY Thanks.
RILEY You're welcome. And Buffy ... love the hair.
ANYA_VOICEOVER I think we died in this car on the way to the airport, and now we're stuck in hell.
XANDER The radio said no traffic.
ANYA It's a hell radio, of course it said that. We'll never get to the airport in time to pick up your stupid uncle.
XANDER It just gives my uncle Rory more time at the bar. Trust me, he'll be happy.
ANYA Great. So he can sleep off his drunken stupor on our newly re-upholstered couch.
XANDER He can't afford a hotel.
ANYA Why are you defending him?
XANDER I'm not. I hate my uncle. I hate my whole family. That's why I'm marrying you, to start a new family. Have children, make them hate us, then one day they'll get married, we'll sleep on their couch. It's the circle of life.
ANYA Well, the Gnarals are teleporting in in twenty minutes. If I'm not there to greet them? Somebody's getting incinerated.
XANDER Why did we ever agree to have your friends, who are demons, and my family, who are monsters, stay at our place?
ANYA Well, I can only do so much, Xander. Planning this marriage is like staging the invasion of Normandy.
XANDER Without the laughs. We should have eloped.
ANYA No! I've been through too much planning this wedding, and it is *going* to happen. It is going to be our perfect, perfect day if I have to kill every one of our guests and half this town to do it.
XANDER Mm. Cool Ranch?
ANYA Cajun Fiesta.
BUFFY End of the line? I don't see our demon.
RILEY It's not here.
BUFFY Let me guess.
BUFFY Down we go?
RILEY Looks that way.
BUFFY That's a big first step. So, Mr. Finn, got an extra jet-pack for a girl like me?
RILEY Sorry, fresh out of jet-packs. Looks like we'll have to share.
RILEY This test line's built for one, so if we go together, we're not hauling any gear. Just be you and me.
BUFFY I was never big on the hardware anyway.
RILEY You hold onto me?
BUFFY If that's what it takes.
RILEY Come on.
BUFFY Ready when you are, Agent Finn.
BUFFY Riley!
WOMAN Hey.
WOMAN Hey there. What exactly are you doing with my husband?
BUFFY Husband?
BUFFY Wife.
BUFFY And ... those aren't code names like Big Dog or Falcon or... I didn't think so.
RILEY Buffy, meet Sam. Sam, Buffy.
SAM Pleasure.
BUFFY Demon.
SAM Mine.
BUFFY She's good.
RILEY She's a special one.
BUFFY How long have you been married?
RILEY Four months almost.
BUFFY Mazel tov. Any children?
RILEY Buffy, I meant to tell you. When the time was right. She caught up to us a hell of a lot faster than I would've guessed possible. She does that.
BUFFY So, you-you guys do this often, you know, the whole ... husband-and-wife tag-team demon fighting thing?
RILEY Yeah, it's what brought us together. I almost feel sorry for the Suvolte.
RILEY But not quite.
BUFFY Call this your wedding gift.
BUFFY So, guess that's mission accomplished.
RILEY She killed it.
SAM Oh, honey ... That's okay.
BUFFY Okay? Wait ... you guys have been tracking this thing as a couple for two days straight, and you ... did want it dead, right?
BUFFY Oh.
SAM Let me guess. Captain Can-Do over here forgot to mention that this was a homing operation. But it's nice to finally meet you, by the way. Knife.
BUFFY What is a homing operation?
RILEY It's my fault. I should have explained.
BUFFY That would have saved me some ... trouble.
SAM Damn.
SAM We're too late. Finn ... how could you recruit the Slayer without filling her in on the objective?
BUFFY That'd be my question.
SAM If we weren't under severe time constraints I'd seriously think about ripping you a new one.
RILEY Stand down, soldier.
BUFFY He's your boss, too?
SAM Oh, he wishes. We better regroup. Buffy, I hate to impose further, but ... you got a safe house?
BUFFY I, I have a house. I-I think it's safe. Sometimes you can't even leave.
RILEY I know the way. And I'll fill you in. On everything.
BUFFY Sorry the place is such a mess. I haven't had a chance to give it a good cleaning.
RILEY Hey.
DAWN Agent Finn returns.
RILEY Dawn. Geez, look at you. I think you grew a foot and a half.
DAWN A lot can happen in a year.
RILEY Well, it's good to see you.
XANDER Hey, there's the man! Life taker, heartbreaker. You know, figuratively speaking.
RILEY Xander, Sam. Willow...
SAM Hi.
RILEY Hi.
WILLOW We got your call.
XANDER We're here to help. Just like old times. Except, with you being all big with the married life.
RILEY Hear you're getting hitched yourself. Believe me, you're gonna love it.
WILLOW Congratulations, really, both of you.
WILLOW Just so you know? I'm prepared to hate this woman any way you want.
BUFFY Thanks, but no. I don't wanna seem all petty.
WILLOW Well, that's the beauty! You can't, but I can. Please. Let me carry the hate for the both of us.
BUFFY Go nuts.
DAWN So. What brings you back to town after you left suddenly with no word?
RILEY Sam and I have been tracking a Suvolte demon through Central America. Killing machine. Nearly mature.
SAM Yeah, three months old and growing fast.
RILEY These things start to kill the minute they're hatched. And leave a real clear trail.
SAM Yeah. Just follow the villages with nothing in them but body parts.
RILEY Uh ... Dawn, are you sure you wanna be around hearing all this?
SAM Oh, come on, Finn, she looks all grown-up to me. That is, if it's all right with you.
BUFFY Uh, sure, yeah, it's fine.
DAWN So, this demon shredded your guys, and now you're looking for a little payback?
SAM No. It came here to the Hellmouth to, to spawn. But we think it already hatched its eggs somewhere.
RILEY And the plan was to track it. Let the demon take us to its nest.
DAWN And ... now they're gonna hatch a bunch of ... baby demon things?
SAM Unless we stop it.
BUFFY Which means we have to find the nest, and fast, before Sunnydale turns into the Trouble Meat Palace.
BUFFY I wish I'd said something else.
XANDER Okay, so we track down the demon, find the nest, Mr. and Mrs. Finn here make with the killin', and everyone goes home happy. But seriously, married man. If forced to choose between a photographer and place settings-
BUFFY We can't track the demon. I killed it. So! Who's hungry? We got, uh-
DAWN Ice cubes.
BUFFY All you can eat.
SAM Buffy? It's good that you killed the Suvolte before it killed us. Disposable cameras.
XANDER Di - wah?
SAM Yeah, you, you know, little plastic ones, ten bucks a pop. You arrange them like table settings, guests snap photos...
SAM ...breaks the ice, and when the wedding's over, you get to take home the pictures.
XANDER I like it!
BUFFY So, demon eggs. Any timetable on when they're gonna hatch?
RILEY Hatching's not the problem.
SAM We think they're gonna be sold on the black market. There are some foreign military powers that would love to have their own Suvolte. You could never train it, but drop it on an urban population...
RILEY And it cleanses the area.
DAWN Is that a nice way of saying it kills people?
SAM Lots of 'em. Money's been exchanged. There's a dealer in town, calls himself the, The Doctor. Willow, you think you can help with a little locating spell?
WILLOW I can't do the magicks.
SAM Oh, Riley says you're comin' on as one major-league Wicca.
WILLOW I got addicted. The way addicts do.
RILEY Two teams. No civilians. I'll, uh ... I'll go out and look for our Doctor. You two find that nest.
BUFFY Me and Sam together?
RILEY You come across a Suvolte nest, you're gonna want backup.
SAM You know, I don't wanna be dragging down the Slayer. You've got speed, and power I can't even-
BUFFY Let's go. Xander, are you okay to stay with Dawn?
XANDER Yeah.
RILEY I'll check out some bars. Willy's, some, uh, crypts that I know.
SAM Hey Willow. I'm sorry, I think I really ... stepped in it in there. You know, back in the jungle ... we had not one, but two hard-core shamans working for us ... they were working the dark magicks, and ... got addicted. And now they're gone. Gone ... as in ... there's nothing left. I've never met anyone with enough strength to quit before.
SAM I'm just saying.
SAM_VOICEOVER Thanks for letting me tag along.
BUFFY No problem.
SAM Maybe not for you. I gotta tell you, Buffy, I'm a little bit intimidated. I mean, patrolling with the real live Slayer, you're like ... Santa Claus, or Buddha, or something.
BUFFY Fat and jolly?
SAM Legendary. And it's not just slayer status I'm talking about. It's you.
BUFFY Riley talks about me?
SAM He didn't say anything for a long time, but I could tell. He was ripped up inside.
BUFFY Good thing he has you.
SAM More like miraculous. I went down to Central America with the Peace Corps. One night, my entire infirmary got slaughtered by... I didn't know what they were. I got saved, quit the Corps, joined the squad. My first firefight, I met Riley. We started talking, you know, first about tactics, missions, stuff like that. And then about you.
BUFFY He thinks ... I let him go.
SAM Do you wish you hadn't.
BUFFY I wish things were different. I-I'm not trying to ... I don't ... uh, you know.
SAM I didn't mean to put you on the spot, Buffy. There's no bad guys in this one. The only thing that could ... help Riley work it out was time. Lots of time. Took him a year to get over you.
BUFFY I'm glad he's over me.
SAM So, you seeing anyone new? Someone special?
BUFFY You know, I just take my time, you know, I don't ... I don't wanna jump right into anything, don't wanna ... you know ... be defined by who I'm with.
SAM Yeah, better no guy than the wrong guy, that's for sure.
BUFFY Sam. You know what? Um, I think we should split up.
SAM Oh, I'm slowing you down. I knew I would, this was just selfish of me.
BUFFY No, it's not, uh ... there's this guy, uh, an informant, but he's twitchy. I show up with company, and, and we get nothing.
SAM Cool. I'm guessing Finn needs me about now. He's probably off somewhere gettin' his ass kicked. You know how wild he gets. Don't worry about Rye and me, we're good.
BUFFY I noticed.
SPIKE Buffy. Hey now. If I'd-a known you were coming, I'd-a baked a cake.
BUFFY I need information.
SPIKE Well, suppose I could be helpful. If the price is right. I'm not sure I'm selling out at Double Meat Palace wages, though.
BUFFY I need to find a guy. Dealer. Calls himself The Doctor.
SPIKE Human?
BUFFY His traffic isn't.
SPIKE Clock ticking?
BUFFY Whatever he's doing, he's doing it soon.
SPIKE Soon but not now?
BUFFY Tell me you love me.
SPIKE I love you. You know I do.
BUFFY Tell me you want me.
SPIKE I always want you. In point of fact-
BUFFY Shut up.
SPIKE Well, looky here. I don't usually use the word delicious...
SPIKE ...but I've gotta wager this little tableau must sting a bit, eh? Me and your former? Must kill. What can I say? Girl just needs a little monster in her man.
RILEY That's not why I'm here ... Doctor.
BUFFY Oh god.
SPIKE Here I thought we'd run you out of town, mate.
SPIKE Last time I saw you, if memory serves, you were getting the juice sucked out of you by some undead ladies of very questionable reputation.
SPIKE Now, be a good tin soldier and, uh...
RILEY Where are they ... Doctor?
SPIKE Where are what, and why do you keep calling me that?
RILEY Glad to be back in Sunnydale. The locals all speak English, and I know who to beat for information. It's all brought me here.
SPIKE Look, crew cut. She's not your bint any more. And if I can speak frankly, she always had a little thing for me, even when she was shagging you.
RILEY Nice. That's very distracting. Now tell me, before I get unprofessional... ...where are the eggs, Spike?
SPIKE Eggs? You're off your nut. It must be those drugs they were keeping you on. I did warn you.
RILEY Okay. We can do this the hard way, or we can do this the fatal way.
RILEY Where are the eggs?
BUFFY Look, the Doctor, it can't be Spike.
SPIKE No need to defend me, luv.
BUFFY Look, i-it can't be, okay? He-he's too incompetent. It's just Spike, Riley.
RILEY Right. Deadly ... amoral ... opportunistic. Or have you forgotten?
RILEY I'm taking this place apart until I find that nest.
SPIKE Over my dead body.
RILEY I've seen enough of your dead body for one night, thanks.
SPIKE Well, you're not gonna-
RILEY You coming?
SPIKE Oh, this is ... unconstitutional, is what it is! Here!
SPIKE There's nothin' to see down there!
BUFFY Riley, look, I'm not saying that he's good, okay, I'm just saying that he's not capable of something as-
SPIKE I can explain.
RILEY We're gonna need more weapons. Spike screwed up. You didn't keep 'em frozen, did you ... Doctor?
SPIKE You can stop calling me that any time. If I may, the thing of it is, I'm holding these for a friend, who-
BUFFY No more games.
SPIKE Well, that's bloody funny coming from you! No more games? That's all you've ever done is play me. You keep playing with rules you make up as you like. You know what I am. You've always known. You come to me all the same.
RILEY Can you shut him up?
BUFFY Not so far.
RILEY You better get outta here.
RILEY On second thought, stick around.
BUFFY Riley, I-
RILEY Aim high, plenty of lead.
BUFFY I'm not exactly gun girl.
RILEY You wanna live, learn fast.
BUFFY These things? Never useful.
RILEY We have to pull out.
RILEY We need a way to contain these things-
BUFFY Riley!
RILEY Get down!
ANYA_VOICEOVER You know, if you love Riley Finn so much, maybe you should just marry him.
XANDER He's taken. And that's not the point.
ANYA So you think that their marriage is better than ours, is that it?
XANDER No! But granted, I have a hard time imagining Nick and Nora Fury hiding out from their own relatives in the bathroom.
XANDER And I have no idea what Riley and Mrs. Riley's wedding was like.
ANYA Well, you haven't shut up about them.
XANDER Well, they have a great marriage! And it bummed Buffy out, but I can see it. And Anya ... I really have no clue what their wedding was like.
ANYA So our wedding... ...is not our marriage.
XANDER Separate things. One fills me with a dread akin to public speaking engagements.
ANYA And that would be the wedding.
XANDER Which will be over soon.
ANYA But our marriage...
XANDER That lasts forever.
ANYA Ah, well. That works out nicely, then.
BUFFY So, are you and Sam headed back to Central America? Or, is that classified?
RILEY Nepal.
BUFFY Sounds fun.
RILEY I'll send you a postcard.
RILEY Buffy-
BUFFY Riley-
RILEY By mission parameters I'm done here. But I have authorization to take the Doctor out. Do you want me to do that?
BUFFY Do I want you to... How can you ask me ... I'm sleeping with hi-him. I'm sleeping with Spike.
RILEY I had actually noticed that.
BUFFY And then you come back ... and did you wait until your life was absolutely perfect and then send that demon here so you could throw it in my face?
RILEY Look ... you think this was easy for me?
BUFFY Yeah! I think it was a rollicking adventure, fun for the whole family.
RILEY I was terrified about seeing you again.
BUFFY Well, I'm sure my incredible patheticness softened the blow for you.
RILEY I don't know what you're talking about.
BUFFY Riley, please don't patronize-
RILEY Hey! You want me to say that I liked seeing you in bed with that idiot? Or that blinding orange is your very best color? Or that that ... burger smell is appealing?
BUFFY You smelled the smell?
RILEY Buffy, none of that means anything. It doesn't touch you. You're still the first woman I ever loved ... and the strongest woman I've ever known. And I'm not advertising this to the missus ... but you're still quite the hottie.
BUFFY You know, it goes away after many bathings.
RILEY This isn't about who's on top. I know how lucky I am right now. I love my work, and I love my wife.
BUFFY I know. And I kinda love her too.
RILEY So you're not in the greatest place right now. And maybe I made it worse.
BUFFY No.
RILEY Wheel never stops turning, Buffy. You're up, you're down ... it doesn't change what you are. And you are a hell of a woman.
BUFFY Riley, that night... I never got the chance ... to tell you ... how sorry I was. About what happened between us.
RILEY And you never have to.
SAM Well, the wedding itself was held in a military chopper just before a hairy night drop into hostile territory.
XANDER Huh! And just curious, what's a chopper rental run these days?
SAM Oh, well, actually, we commandeered it from a local guerilla squad, so ... cheap!
XANDER Oh!
SAM Yeah.
SAM You have my email, you promise you'll keep in touch?
WILLOW You won't get traced? I don't wanna lead the bad guys to your location by mistake.
SAM Our line's secure.
WILLOW Oh, huh, duh, of course it is! I keep thinking of you like regular people, but no, you're not.
SAM Oh, right, like demon-hunting is all exotic to a girl from Sunnydale.
DAWN So you gonna say goodbye this time, or just ... split all secret-agenty like last time?
RILEY Depends. I warrant a hug?
RILEY Goodbye, Dawn.
DAWN I thought it would suck less this time. It doesn't.
SAM It was really nice meeting you all. You ready for Nepal, agent?
RILEY Soldier.
RILEY Fire-fights, bug hunts, big body counts ... yeah, I could use a break.
WILLOW Bye!
XANDER Bye! Bye Riley! Bye Sam!
WILLOW What a bitch.
