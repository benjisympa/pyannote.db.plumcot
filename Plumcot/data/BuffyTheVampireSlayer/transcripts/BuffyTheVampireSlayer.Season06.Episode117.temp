ANDREW Oh man, your face was priceless.
JONATHAN Yeah, real funny.
WARREN It serves you right for taking Z's on lookout again.
JONATHAN What do you expect? I haven't had a decent night's sleep since... I mean, I'm going Jack Torrence in here, you know? Stuck in this basement for weeks! I mean, we rented the whole house, can't we at least sleep upstairs?
ANDREW We're on the lam. We have to lay low. Underground?
JONATHAN It's figurative, doofus! Did you even read
WARREN Okay, enough! Midgetor, get back to the monitors. The last thing we need is to be surprised by-
ANDREW Holy Geez Louise.
JONATHAN The-the-
WARREN The frickin' Slayer.
JONATHAN She's right there!
WARREN All right, don't panic. Andrew ... deploy your little friend.
BUFFY Oh. Hi.
BUFFY You didn't by chance happen to just eat a couple of nerds, did you?
MAN_1 You're gonna hurt yourself!
MAN_2 She's gonna break the needle. We're gonna have to strap her down.
WILLOW Hi, um, Tara, how are you?
WILLOW W-well, I-I was wondering, maybe, you would wanna go out sometime? For coffee ... food ... kisses and gay love? Hi Tara. Guess what? Magic-free now for, insert number, days now.
LORRAINE Buffy.
LORRAINE Buffy.
FEMALE_DOCTOR Come on, it's time for your drugs.
BUFFY What?
LORRAINE I said, if I didn't know any better, I'd think you were on drugs.
BUFFY Okay. Good.
BUFFY Whatcha doin'?
WILLOW I'm online, checking to see if Xander emailed.
BUFFY Any luck?
WILLOW No such.
BUFFY Well, maybe Anya found him and they're trying to work it out. How come you're all, home, hearth, and DSL anyway? I thought you were gonna go see Tara.
WILLOW Saw her. Saw her completely.
BUFFY Ouch. Just got a scratch from all that brittle.
WILLOW It's... ...when I was seeing her, she was seeing someone else. A girl.
BUFFY You mean-
WILLOW I mean ... not seeing seeing. Well, maybe. I don't know, it was inconclusive, and I didn't stick around to find out. Might have magicked my fist through a wall or something,
BUFFY Will, I'm sorry.
WILLOW I mean, they're probably just friends. I press my lips against my friends' all the time.
BUFFY I'm sure they're just friends. Once you fall for Willow, you stay fallen.
WILLOW Thanks, Buffy.
XANDER Hi.
WILLOW Xander?
XANDER I'm back.
BUFFY Xander?
WILLOW Xander, you're here!
WILLOW We missed you, where were you?
XANDER I know, I tried calling, but I couldn't without...
BUFFY Hey. You don't need to explain to us.
XANDER Right. Is she here?
WILLOW Oh ... n-no, you ... wanna find her?
XANDER I need to. Her suitcase is gone and some of her stuff. There's a Closed sign on the Magic Box, which, like, chills me to the bone.
WILLOW She left a couple days ago.
XANDER Was she looking for me? Before she left, did she say anything?
WILLOW You mean, between sobs? There was mostly just wheezing.
BUFFY She was a little ... she was ... kinda broken.
XANDER I don't know how stuff got so mixed up! I blew it.
BUFFY No. Well ... maybe it wasn't the best time to break up with her, but...
XANDER No. It wasn't about breaking up. I love her, and god, I miss her so much.
WILLOW So, you left her at the altar, but you still wanna-
BUFFY You still wanna date?
XANDER I guess. I know that I'm a better person with her in my life. But things got so complicated with the wedding, and with my family, and with her ... demons, and ... what if it all goes to hell, a-and forever? But then I left ... and ever since ... I've had this painful hole inside. And I'm the idiot that dug it out.
XANDER I screwed up real bad.
BUFFY Hey. We all screw up.
SPIKE You lookin' for me?
BUFFY Really not.
SPIKE Oh. Right then. Off you go. Did you cry?
BUFFY What?
SPIKE The wedding. Two hearts joined for eternity, great pelting showers of rice and so forth.
BUFFY You didn't hear.
SPIKE What? Families get out of hand? Tear the place apart?
BUFFY No. Well, yes, absolutely. But ... Xander left. The wedding didn't happen.
SPIKE Well. Gotta say ... I didn't see that coming.
BUFFY It was awful. Anya was devastated.
SPIKE Is that right.
BUFFY And, Xander ... thinks maybe they can still get back together, but ... he hurt her a lot.
SPIKE Yeah, well ... some people can't see a good thing when they've got it.
XANDER Spike.
XANDER I shoulda known you'd be tagging along.
BUFFY Hey, guys. I, uh ... I found Spike and was, uh, trying to figure out what kind of dangerous contraband he had.
SPIKE Tell you what, Slayer. Let me get out of your way. I'll stop bothering you.
XANDER Yeah, maybe you should do that, Spike, just run along.
SPIKE You know, I guess you know all about that, don't you? The king of the big exit. Heard it brought the house down.
XANDER I don't need this crap from you.
SPIKE Right. Let's not listen to Spike. Might get a bit of the truth on you.
WILLOW Okay, okay. Heh. Calm now. Let's, uh, turn around and release this very manly thing the other way.
XANDER I forgot. Willy Wannabite can't hurt me. Dumb to pick a fight, I guess.
WILLOW Xander.
BUFFY Guys...
SPIKE More than happy to beat you right through the pain, you pathetic poof.
BUFFY Guys, don't.
MAN Buffy, can you hear me?
BUFFY What is this?
DOCTOR Do you know where you are, Buffy?
BUFFY Sunnydale.
DOCTOR No, none of that's real, none of it. You're in a mental institution. You've been with us now for six years. Do you remember?
WILLOW Buffy? Are you okay?
XANDER What happened?
DOCTOR It's okay, Buffy. Buffy, it's okay.
DOCTOR Look. Look who's here.
JOYCE Buffy?
JOYCE Welcome home, sweetie.
BUFFY Mom?
JOYCE Oh, baby, you're really here.
BUFFY Dad?
DOCTOR She's lucid. Keep talking, maybe the sound of your voice will ground her.
HANK Sweetheart ... we've missed you very much. Honey, can you hear me?
JOYCE Oh, Buffy, stay with us, please.
BUFFY Oh ... no!
SPIKE Here, let's get her back to my crypt.
XANDER Spike, just go, okay? She's our friend, we'll take care of her.
BUFFY No, guys, I'm okay. I'm okay.
WILLOW Come on, Xander, help me get her home.
SPIKE Put a little ice on the back of her neck.
SPIKE She likes that.
BUFFY I've been having these flashes. Hallucinations, I guess.
WILLOW Since when?
BUFFY Uh ... night before last.
BUFFY I was, uh, checking houses on that list you gave me, and looking for Warren and his pals ... and then, bam! Some kind of gross, waxy demon-thing poked me.
XANDER And when you say poke...
BUFFY In the arm. It stung me or something, and ... then I was like ... no. It, it wasn't like. I *was* in an institution. There were, um ... doctors and ... nurses and, and other patients. They, they told me that I was sick. I guess crazy. And that, um, Sunnydale and, and all of this, it ... none of it ... was real.
XANDER Oh, come on, that's ridiculous! What? You think this isn't real just because of all the vampires and demons and ex-vengeance demons and the sister that used to be a big ball of universe-destroying energy?
BUFFY I know how this must sound, but ... it felt so real. Mom was there.
DAWN She was?
BUFFY Dad, too. They were together ... like they used to be ... before Sunnydale.
WILLOW Okay! All in favor of research? Motion passed. All right, Xander, you hit the demon bars. Dig up any info on a new player in town.
WILLOW Dawnie, you can help me research. We'll hop on-line, check all the-
DOCTOR -possibilities for a full recovery, but we have to proceed cautiously. If we're not careful
JOYCE Wait.
JOYCE Are you saying that Buffy could be like she was before any of this happened?
DOCTOR Mrs. Summers, you have to understand the severity of what's happened to your daughter. For the last six years, she's been in an undifferentiated type of schizophrenia.
HANK We know what her condition is. That's not what we're asking.
DOCTOR Buffy's delusions are multi-layered. She believes she's some type of hero.
JOYCE The Slayer.
DOCTOR The Slayer, right, but that's only one level. She's also created an intricate latticework to support her primary delusion. In her mind, she's the central figure in a fantastic world beyond imagination. She's surrounded herself with friends, most with their own superpowers ... who are as real to her as you or me. More so, unfortunately. Together they face ... grand overblown conflicts against an assortment of monsters both imaginary and rooted in actual myth. Every time we think we're getting through to her, more fanciful enemies magically appear-
BUFFY How did I miss-
DOCTOR and she's-
BUFFY Warren and Jonathan, they did this to me!
DOCTOR Buffy, it's all right. They can't hurt you here. You're with your family.
BUFFY Dawn?
HANK That's the sister, right?
DOCTOR A magical key. Buffy inserted Dawn into her delusion, actually rewriting the entire history of it to accommodate a need for a familial bond. Buffy, but that created inconsistencies, didn't it? Your sister, your friends, all of those people you created in Sunnydale, they aren't as comforting as they once were. Are they? They're coming apart.
JOYCE Buffy, listen to what the doctor's saying, it's important.
DOCTOR Buffy, you used to create these grand villains to battle against, and now what is it? Just ordinary students you went to high school with. No gods or monsters ... just three pathetic little men ... who like playing with toys.
WARREN Dude, that poison has got her drooling like a, some kind of-
JONATHAN Where have you guys been?
WARREN Uh ... picking up some stuff.
ANDREW And checking out Buffy on the van's remote surveillance.
WARREN Andrew's demon pet has done some number on the slayer. Got her tripping like a Ken Russell film festival.
JONATHAN Well, what kind of stuff?
WARREN What?
JONATHAN The packages. What's in them?
WARREN Well, what do you think, Spanky, you think we're plotting against you?
JONATHAN Better not be.
WARREN It's just stuff, big man. All right, you'll be in the know just as soon as you stop being all freakazoid.
WARREN Ah, now, there's the vault.
ANDREW I still say we're gonna need eight other guys to pull this off.
WARREN I never should have let you see that movie.
WARREN Wha, uh, where you going?
JONATHAN Out. Getting stuff I need.
WARREN You know, I don't really think that's such a good idea.
JONATHAN Why not?
WARREN Well, it's... It's just not safe out there ... alone. You saw how close the slayer got. Look, we're, we're a team. Something happens to you, it happens to all of us. Right? Look, I know, I know you're antsy, we all are, but you see, things, they're about to pick up. Big, big time. Just gotta be careful. Right? All right? Stick together. Okay?
WILLOW Look, Buffy, I found the demon. Fits your description and symptoms perfectly.
WILLOW Look, is this it?
WILLOW See, it's gonna be okay. Its pokey stinger carries an antidote to its own poison.
BUFFY I feel so lost.
WILLOW I know. You're confused. It's, it's that crazy juice inside you.
BUFFY It's more than that. Even before the demon ... I've been so detached.
WILLOW We've ... all been kind of slumming.
BUFFY Every day I try to ... snap out of it. Figure out why I'm like that.
WILLOW Buffy, look at me.
WILLOW You are not in an institution. You have never been in an institution.
BUFFY Yes, I have.
WILLOW What?
BUFFY Back when I saw my first vampires... I got so scared. I told my parents ... and they completely freaked out. They thought there was something seriously wrong with me. So they sent me to a clinic.
WILLOW You never said anything.
BUFFY I was only there a couple of weeks. I stopped talking about it, and they let me go. Eventually ... my parents just ... forgot.
WILLOW God. That's horrible.
BUFFY What if I'm still there? What if I never left that clinic?
WILLOW Buffy ... Buffy, you're not. I'm ... so sorry you had to go through that. But, i-it's the past. You've got to trust me. We're gonna get you that antidote. Xander's hunting the demon right now.
BUFFY Alone? Will, he can't. It's too strong.
WILLOW Oh, it's okay. We got help.
SPIKE So, she's having the wiggins, is she? Thinks none of us are real. Bloody self-centered, if you ask me.
XANDER Spike, we need muscle, not color commentary.
SPIKE On the other hand, it might explain some things this all being in that twisted brain of hers. Yeah. Thinks up some chip in my head. Make me soft, fall in love with her, then turn me into her soddin' sex slave-
XANDER What?!
SPIKE Nothing. Alternative realities. Where we're all little figments of Buffy's funny-farm delusion. You know, in a different reality, you might not have left your bride at the altar. You might have gone through with it like a man.
XANDER Okay, one more syllable about Anya-
SPIKE Oh, balls. You didn't say he was a glarghk guhl kashma'nik
XANDER 'Cause I can't say glar-
XANDER I altered his reality. Get it, I... Never mind.
DAWN I made you some tea.
BUFFY Thanks.
BUFFY I'm okay, Dawn.
DAWN The, uh, thousand-yard stare really helps sell that.
DAWN You're burning up.
BUFFY I should be taller than you.
DAWN Maybe you're not done growing.
BUFFY Coming apart.
DAWN What's coming apart?
BUFFY We have to try harder, make things better.
DAWN I'm trying.
BUFFY Your grades ... stealing. Willow's been doing your chores, hasn't she?
DAWN What? No, i-it's ... it's the fever. It's cooking your brain.
BUFFY We have to deal with these things, Dawn, we-
JOYCE_VOICEOVER You don't have a sister, Buffy.
BUFFY Dawn?
JOYCE No, honey.
JOYCE Say it. It'll help you believe it.
BUFFY I ... don't ... have a sister. I know I, I didn't grow up with her. These monks, they-they made her.
HANK It's your mind, just playing tricks on you.
JOYCE You're our little girl, Buffy. Our one and only. We've missed you so much. Mom and Dad just want to take you home and take care of you.
DAWN I'm not even there, am I?
BUFFY What?
DAWN You said it a second ago. You don't have a sister.
DAWN It's your ideal reality, and I'm not even a part of it.
BUFFY Dawn, I ... I didn't mean-
DAWN I have to go finish my chores.
XANDER Hold it. Hold it!
WILLOW I'll need its arm.
XANDER Yeah, I'd like both my arms too.
XANDER Thanks, Spike. I'll help when the ... blistering pain subsides.
WILLOW Ready?
WILLOW Xander, go to the magic shop.
WILLOW I'll need alkanet root and a handful of nettle leaf. Just for the medicinal properties. No magic.
WILLOW When you've got them, meet me at the campus lab. I'll see if I can brew up an antidote the old-fashioned way.
SPIKE I'll hold here, keep an eye on the wax job.
XANDER Make sure that's all you're ogling.
WILLOW Xander!
WILLOW Buffy? Wake up.
WILLOW Got yummy antidote goodness for you.
BUFFY What happened?
WILLOW It took a little longer than I'd hoped. No magic and all. Went boom twice, but then I got it. Just ... when it's cool, drink it all down, and ... everything should go back to normal.
BUFFY You never stop coming through. Thank you, Willow.
SPIKE How is she?
WILLOW Make sure she drinks all that. I'm gonna let Dawn know that everything's gonna be okay.
SPIKE You all right?
BUFFY You need to leave me alone. You're not part of my life.
SPIKE Fine, then.
SPIKE You know, but I hope you don't think this an-
SPIKE I hope you don't think this antidote's gonna rid you of that nasty martyrdom. See, I figured it out, luv. You can't help yourself. You're not drawn to the dark like I thought.
SPIKE You're addicted to the misery. It's why you won't tell your pals about us. Might actually have to be happy if you did. They'd either understand and help you, god forbid ... or drive you out ... where you can finally be at peace, in the dark. With me. Either way, you'd be better off for it, but you're too twisted for that. Let yourself live, already. And stop with the bloody hero trip for a sec. We'd all be the better for it.
SPIKE You either tell your friends about us ... or I will.
DOCTOR_VOICEOVER Buffy.
BUFFY I don't wanna go back there.
BUFFY I wanna be healthy again. What do I have to do?
BUFFY Oh ... please, help me. I-I wanna go home, with you and dad.
JOYCE I know, Buffy. But first you've gotta get better.
DOCTOR It's not gonna be easy, Buffy. You have to take it one step at a time. You have to start ridding your mind of those things that support your hallucinations. You understand? There are things in that world that you cling to. For your delusion, they're safe-holds, but for your mind they're traps. We have to break those down.
BUFFY Slaying?
DOCTOR Yes ... but I'm talking about those things you want there. What keeps you going back.
BUFFY My friends.
DOCTOR That's right. Last summer, when you had a momentary awakening, it was them that pulled you back in.
JOYCE They're not really your friends, Buffy. They're just ... tricks keeping you from getting healthy.
DOCTOR You have to do whatever it takes to convince yourself of that, Buffy. Whatever it takes.
WILLOW Oh, Buffy, I, I didn't see you. I was just coming to check on you. You feeling better? Did the antidote work?
BUFFY I'm ... still pretty dazed, but, uh, better.
WILLOW No more cuckoo's nest? Well, we still have the big bad all tranked out down in the basement. In case it didn't work and we need more parts.
WILLOW It'll be nice to see you all better.
BUFFY Thanks.
WILLOW I can make you some food, something big with energy, help you clear your noggin. Come on.
XANDER Hello! I'm back! Clean and with the better smell now. Friends? Romans?
XANDER Anyone?
XANDER Hey.
XANDER Hey, there, sane girl. So did Willow get that antidote to you all right?
BUFFY Yeah. I'm better now.
XANDER Great. So, it's settled. We're, uh, we're real, right? Guess we should finish off that demon and drag it out of the basement. And tell me you're up for that. I so don't wanna see Spike right now. I mean, talk about losing touch. Hate to say it, but I almost... feel sorry for the guy. Almost. The things the poor guy was saying ... I mean, I get it, you know. Been a part of the Buffy obsess-
XANDER B-Buffy-
XANDER Willow, what...
BUFFY Dawn?
DAWN Don't you knock?
BUFFY I called for you.
DAWN Buffy, are you okay?
BUFFY Where are you going?
DAWN I'm going over to Janice's, where they actually like having me around.
BUFFY You're not going anywhere.
DAWN Why not? You want me gone anyway. What do you care?
BUFFY I care. You're going downstairs with the others. It's the only way I can get healthy.
DAWN What are you talking about?
DAWN Buffy, you look sick. What are you doing? What's wrong with you?
DAWN Stay away from me!
DAWN Willow, help!
DAWN Buffy, please!
BUFFY You can't hide, Dawn.
DAWN Talk to me. You're hallucinating.
BUFFY I know. You're just a trap for my mind.
DAWN Buffy, please, listen to me. That asylum and those people, they're not real!
DAWN Buffy ... look at me. I'm right here. You're my sister. I need you and love you. Somewhere inside you must know that's real.
BUFFY Sure it is. 'Cause what's more real? A sick girl in an institution...
DAWN Don't. Please. Listen to me.
BUFFY Or some kind of supergirl ... chosen to ... fight demons and... save the world. That's ridiculous.
BUFFY A girl who sleeps with the vampire she hates?! Yeah, that makes sense.
DAWN No! Buffy, stop! I'm real!
DAWN Buffy, stop it. I'll be good!
DAWN I promise. You're not thinking. I'll-
DOCTOR_VOICEOVER It's okay, Buffy. Don't stress yourself.
JOYCE Honey, take your time.
DOCTOR Make it as easy on yourself as possible. There's nothing wrong with that.
XANDER Buffy ... what are you doing?
XANDER Oh my god.
XANDER Buffy, help me! I need my hands!
TARA Hello?
TARA Anybody home?
JOYCE_VOICEOVER Buffy?
JOYCE I-It's gonna be okay, sweetheart. Whatever it is, it's not real, remember? Just keep concentrating. I'm right here, sweetie.
XANDER Buffy, help me!
XANDER Buffy, help!
TARA Willow?
WILLOW No! Tara!
BUFFY I don't know...
JOYCE Buffy, look at me.
BUFFY I don't know. I don't know.
JOYCE I believe in you. You're a survivor, you can do this.
BUFFY Xander. No.
BUFFY Willow!
JOYCE Buffy? Buffy! Buffy, fight it. You're too good to give in, you can beat this thing. Be strong, baby, ok? I know you're afraid. I know the world feels like a hard place sometimes, but you've got people who love you. Your dad and I, we have all the faith in the world in you. We'll always be with you.
JOYCE You've got ... a world of strength in your heart. I know you do. You just have to find it again. Believe in yourself.
BUFFY You're right. Thank you.
BUFFY Good-bye.
JOYCE Buffy.
BUFFY I'm so sorry.
WILLOW Buffy? We're okay. It's all okay. Buffy, sit down. You'll fall over.
BUFFY No ... I can't. Not until I have the antidote.
WILLOW Okay. We-we'll make more, we'll take care of it.
WILLOW Everything's gonna be okay, Buffy.
DOCTOR I'm sorry, there's no reaction at all.
DOCTOR I'm afraid we lost her.
