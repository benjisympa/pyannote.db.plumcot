WARREN Ha ha!
ANDREW They're getting to the gate!
WARREN I see it, I see it!
ANDREW We're gonna lose 'em.
JONATHAN We need that disk.
WARREN Wait.
SPIKE How you doin'?
BUFFY Oh, fine. You know, same old same old.
SPIKE Here, I could take care of this guy if you want.
BUFFY Whatever.
BUFFY Your call.
SPIKE I mean, sure he don't look like much...
VAMP_2 Hey!
SPIKE ...but I'd wager he could give you a bit o' nasty. Save you the staking. All you gotta do is-
BUFFY I am not telling my friends about us.
SPIKE Right, I'll just be dropping him down to you then.
BUFFY You wanna tell them so badly? Go ahead.
BUFFY You know why? I tried to kill my friends, my sister, last week ... and guess how much they hate me. Zero. Zero much. So I'm thinking, sleeping with you? They'll deal.
SPIKE In that case, why won't you sleep with me again?
VAMP_2 Huh?
BUFFY Because I don't love you.
SPIKE Like hell.
TARA Hey!
WILLOW Hey. Look at you. All coming out of class and everything.
TARA I do that sometimes. Usually at the end part of the class.
WILLOW Right.
TARA So how's your, you know, after the whole basement deal?
WILLOW It's between a hitch and a kink, with a side of a twinge. It's okay.
TARA And Buffy's okay too? Enjoying the refreshing sanity and so forth?
WILLOW Ha, yeah! Refreshing san - that's funny. She's okay. A little ... freaked. I'm glad she didn't hurt you.
TARA You too.
TARA So, this is becoming kind of a regular thing, you and me after class.
WILLOW Uh, I didn't...
TARA Only this time you stuck around.
WILLOW Uh, um ... various sounds of hesitation...
TARA She was just a friend.
WILLOW Friends are nice!
TARA You rushed off before I could, you know, explain.
WILLOW Well, officially, I have to say I have no idea what you're talking about.
TARA Unofficially?
WILLOW We should have some coffee some time. Uh, maybe some day ... this week after class?
TARA I'm free tomorrow.
WILLOW Uh, you could, you could bring your friend.
TARA I wasn't gonna - I-I mean, if you have a friend-
WILLOW No! I'm, oh, I-I'm friendless.
TARA Yeah, yeah, no friends. I-I mean, I have friends-
WILLOW Right, many dear friends, yeah.
TARA Coffee.
WILLOW With us. Who are ... just friends.
BUFFY Okay, how about this store?
DAWN Ah. Three pairs of earrings, a coin purse and a toothbrush.
BUFFY You stole a toothbrush.
DAWN A mother-of-pearl handle. Very fancy.
BUFFY Yeah, but you stole a toothbrush. As far as rebellious teenagers go, you're kinda square.
DAWN Dental hygiene is important.
BUFFY Guess this was kind of a lame sisters' day out, huh? I make up for trying to kill you by taking you to places you can't go in.
DAWN No, it's my bad. I'm the one that got caught taking stuff.
BUFFY Hey, how about the pet store? You didn't take anything from there, did you?
DAWN A pocketful of goldfish. It didn't work out.
DAWN No!
BUFFY Okay, good. We can go, and we can look at all the puppies.
DAWN Ehh. It's so awful! There's puppy mills, and keeping them in cages, and, and people poking at them all day.
BUFFY Yeah, but puppies, cute! Come on, you used to love the pet store.
DAWN Yes, when I was in my fives and sixes. Uh, come on, we'll go look. Besides, I don't think there's another store here where I can ... show my face.
BUFFY It'll pass. You've returned all the stuff that you still had, and we're paying for the rest.
DAWN I'm paying for the rest.
BUFFY We'll figure it out.
JONATHAN Get back.
JONATHAN You don't want to make me rush this.
WARREN I'm not impressed, padawan. When do we hit pay-dirt?
JONATHAN If something goes wrong, it's gonna surge... ...and we'll be deader than an ex-girlfriend.
WARREN What did you say?
JONATHAN Just let me work!
WARREN All right. All right, you do what you need to do. You get us to the goods, and then watch out! It'll gonna be like ... it'll be like the whole world just spread open and gave it up for you, man.
JONATHAN And then we're done, right? We each take our share and we call it a day.
WARREN You that ready to get rid of us? Huh?
WARREN Don't worry. We pull this off, you can go buy any tropical island you want. Aw, cheer up, Short Round. You're about to get us everything we ever wanted.
WARREN He's almost done.
ANDREW I sorta feel ... kinda sorry for him.
WARREN That's a weakness.
ANDREW Um ... okay.
WARREN Look at him.
ANDREW He's got that same look on his face, the one he had that time I highlighted in his Babylon 5 novels.
ANDREW Right before he told his mother on me! Warren! I don't think we can trust him.
WARREN We don't have to. Not for that much longer.
ANDREW Is it gonna be that soon?
WARREN The milk. In the fridge. How long 'til it expires?
ANDREW Well, we got it on Friday, and I remember noticing there wasn't a full two weeks on it, but we did get it in the fridge pretty quick, unless I'm thinking of the two-percent milk...
WARREN Forget it. It was a thing. It's gonna be soon.
ANDREW Oh. Wow.
XANDER Oh my god.
XANDER How are you?
ANYA Ducky. You?
XANDER Ahn. Please. Let me, uh, explain.
XANDER I know there's nothing that I can say or do to make up for what I did. I can't. Sometimes when I wake up in the morning, I'm like, 'oh god, is this my life? Was that me?'
ANYA Me too.
XANDER But you gotta believe me, please. I want to make up for it. I want to take away the hurt. I love you so much.
XANDER I, I may have practiced that a couple times in front of the mirror.
ANYA I just ... don't understand what happened.
XANDER I do. I'm an idiot. All I had to do was say something earlier. I could have spared you from that ... that nightmare.
ANYA Said something about what?
XANDER No, no! I mean, you know, if I were, like, more ... self-aware. Because, with the whole idiot thing.
ANYA If you had been more self-aware, you would have what? Been able to stop the wedding?
XANDER No no, it's not like that, that's not what... Okay, see, I didn't practice this part.
ANYA Do you still want to get married?
ANYA Oh.
XANDER Ahn, it's a very complicated question.
ANYA No, actually, it's really not. It's kind of an either-or deal. Do you want to get married?
XANDER Someday, yes, very much. When we're ready. I don't want you to take this as a bad thing. It's good. I love you, I love you so much, I'm just trying to be honest with you.
ANYA Yes, honesty *now*. Congratulations, Xander, on being honest now. I wonder what the medal will say.
XANDER Okay, clearly I'm not handling this well.
ANYA Well, duh!
XANDER All I want is for us to be together. I love you, I ... I wish we could just go back to the way things were before.
ANYA And I wish you were never born!
XANDER I know this is all coming out wrong.
ANYA I wish you felt the pain of a thousand searing pokers boiling your heart in its own juices!
XANDER I know, honey. I totally deserve that.
ANYA I ... I wish you had tentacles where your beady eyes should be! I wish your intestines were tied in knots and ripped apart inside your lousy gut!
XANDER They are.
ANYA Really? Right now? Does it hurt?
XANDER God, yes. It hurts so bad it's killing me. Anya ... I love you, I want to make this work.
ANYA Those are metaphor intestines! You're not in any real pain! What's wrong with me?
XANDER No, honey, it's not you, it's me. That-
ANYA Ohh!!
XANDER Ahn! Ahn! Wait. Please.
XANDER Ahn!
HALFREK_VOICEOVER So there was no child support in, like, eleven years...
HALFREK ...not a single check, so now, every time he picks up a piece of paper that isn't a check for the child? Paper cut.
HALFREK Oh, you know how I hate to toot my own horn ... but now his hands are just covered in all these tiny little bandages. Like a quilt. You know, made of bandages.
ANYA Hmm?
HALFREK Okay, do they not teach listening skills in Human World?
ANYA I'm sorry. I know. I'm just distracted.
HALFREK What, about this thing with Xander? Don't worry, you'll figure out a way to-
ANYA No, that's just it, I've tried everything. I tried every curse I knew, nothing's worked.
HALFREK Wait. Did you try to curse him yourself?
ANYA Yeah, I am the wronged party here, of course I-
HALFREK You can't exact justice against someone on behalf of yourself, silly! How long have you been away?
ANYA I haven't been scorned by a man in, like, a thousand years. I never had to make a wish for myself. There has to be some way around that.
HALFREK Well ... You could try getting someone to make the wish for you. I suppose.
DAWN Uh ... did we open a chain?
DAWN Are we the International House of something?
BUFFY Nope. Got up early, and it felt like a breakfast kind of morning. Okay, what kind of syrup do you want on your pancakes?
DAWN Syrups have kinds?
BUFFY Oh! Also, you know, I was thinking, after the mall yesterday, maybe we, we shouldn't go out tonight, you know, maybe we could stay in and, uh, ow ... um, you know, get a pizza, or, uh, rent a movie?
DAWN Um...
BUFFY Also, I didn't know if, you know, if you had plans this weekend, but I thought, maybe we could...
DAWN Hey, Buffy?
DAWN I'm gonna be okay with the basement thing. Really. You weren't you.
BUFFY This isn't guilt. I want us to spend time.
DAWN Okay. Good. I love spending time-
BUFFY But I'm cramping your teenage style.
DAWN No-
BUFFY Yes, I am. I'm the embarrassing mom who tries too hard. When did this happen?
DAWN No, you're not, it's not that, it's just ... what if, instead of you hanging out with me? Maybe I could hang out with you.
DAWN Why don't I come patrolling with you tonight?
BUFFY Oh. And then? Maybe we can invite over some strangers and ask them to feed you candy.
DAWN Well, you guys went out patrolling every night when you were my age.
BUFFY True ... but technically, you're one-and-a-half.
BUFFY See, I thought a little levity might ... but okay, also no.
DAWN I just ... I just think I could help.
BUFFY I'm sure you could. But it's a little more dangerous than I had in mind.
DAWN But-
BUFFY Dawn, I work very hard to keep you away from that stuff. Okay, I don't want you around dangerous things that can kill you.
DAWN Which would be a perfectly reasonable argument, if my sister was chosen to protect the world from tax audits? But, see, my sister is you, and ... dangerous things that want to kill me seem to find me.
BUFFY But you don't need to go looking for them.
BUFFY Now eat up. You're gonna be late for school.
TARA Okay, wait, it was under her wig?
WILLOW Well, it was this thing, it just came out from inside her head.
TARA That's disgusting! What did it look like?
WILLOW Well, let's put it this way, if I wasn't gay before...
TARA God, and this was *after* the invisible ray?
WILLOW Yep.
TARA Okay, I'm gone for a couple of months-
WILLOW Oh, did I tell you about the demon eggs?
TARA See, now, now I know you're just trying to make me jealous.
WILLOW So, what, no rollicking adventures in the dorms?
TARA Mm, it's not the same. It's not like living with a house full of family, or sharing a room with someone you...
WILLOW ...are friends with?
ANYA Hi.
WILLOW Oh my god. You're back.
TARA We've been so worried.
ANYA Yeah, sorry. I needed to, you know ... I couldn't stay here. Not after ... everything that happened.
TARA No, no no, we, we totally understand.
WILLOW But, you're back now, right?
ANYA It's complicated. You know, and there's a lot to deal with.
WILLOW Well, if there's anything we can do, just let us-
ANYA Actually ... um ... there is an eensy something I could use a little help with. You're lesbians, so the hating of men will come in handy.
ANYA Let's talk about Xander.
DAWN He feels awful.
ANYA You think it's anywhere close to what I feel?
DAWN No, but-
ANYA What if it were you, Dawn? What if ... all you dreamed about was that magical day? The day when the one person you loved with all your soul would promise to cherish and protect your heart for the rest of his life, but instead he shatters it into a million jagged pieces?
TARA Well, it's, it's not really so much about hating the men.
WILLOW We're more centered around the ... girl on girl action.
ANYA And men really like to watch that kind of stuff, don't they? Men like Xander.
BUFFY I don't think he could feel any worse.
ANYA Let's test that theory.
BUFFY Anya, Xander's my friend. I know what he did was wrong, and ... if it had happened to me, I'd-
ANYA Wish his penis would explode?
DAWN I never use that word anymore.
ANYA Coagulate?
DAWN W-i-s-h.
ANYA Oh, wish! As in 'I wish Xander-'
DAWN Right! That word. There's vengeance demons out there that are still active, remember? Any 'I wish' could totally end in horrible grossness.
ANYA Gimme a for-instance?
BUFFY I don't really think I should.
ANYA Did I mention the whole 'left at the altar' thing? Didn't leave that out, did I?
BUFFY No. Look, I - I know what he did was wrong. God, if it happened to me, I ... I-I, it must have been torture.
ANYA Okay! Let's talk about torture!
ANYA So. Tell me more about wishing Xander's brains and guts would go blooey.
DAWN I didn't say that.
ANYA Yes you did.
DAWN No I didn't.
ANYA I heard you.
DAWN I swear, I didn't say that.
ANYA Didn't say what?
DAWN Um ... I just saw you were back and wanted to talk to you about working off my debt. You know, my whole sticky-fingers, grabby-hands thing?
ANYA Oh, right, the mad thieving! Good, yes, there 's much to do. I'm gonna put you to work, missy!
ANYA So, back to Xander's brains and guts...
ANYA Squish squish squish! Guys have been running roughshod over you for years. Torturing that perky little ticker. Aren't you sick of it? Don't you wish guys like that-
BUFFY Whoa. Guys? There have only been four - three! Three! Three guys. That's barely plural.
ANYA And didn't each of them rip your heart out? Don't men like that, as to pick an example, Xander, deserve to be punished?
WILLOW Well, Xander is a guy, so ... it's kinda not the surprise that he likes to watch ... girls ... Why are we talking about this?
ANYA We're comforting me!
TARA Well, I-I guess it's ... natural for guys to be interested in-
ANYA God! What kind of lesbians are you?! If you love men so much, go love men!
BUFFY Anya, I know you're hurting, but-
ANYA What? Xander doesn't deserve to suffer for what he did 'cause he's your friend, and I'm not, right? I get it.
BUFFY No. That's not what I'm saying at all. What he did was wrong. He knows that.
ANYA It just, it hurts. He hurt me so much.
BUFFY He really did. Look, I-I wish that...
XANDER Anya?
ANYA Well, congratulations. They all still love you. Even after what you did to me.
XANDER Anya, wait...
BUFFY Okay. Not, not crazy about that idea.
XANDER What are you doing? I have to go after her.
BUFFY Or, in the land of the sane, you could give her some space, let her cool down.
XANDER That's not Proactive Guy. That's Sit-Around-And ... Watch-The-Rest-of-Your-Life-To-Turn-To-Crap Guy.
BUFFY True, uh, but at least Crap Guy gets to keep all of his appendages.
XANDER And I'm supposed to what? Walk away? Shouldn't be too hard. It's what I'm good at, right?
BUFFY Okay, see, that's exactly why a heart-to-heart is probably not your best course of action right now. When you're both angry and upset and ... what the hell is that creepy little thing doing in my yard?
BUFFY Did Willow put that there when I was dead? 'Cause if I had known, I would have crawled out of the grave sooner to-
XANDER Buffy.
BUFFY Oh my god.
XANDER Looks like someone's been keeping an eye on all your ins and outs.
BUFFY What the who?
XANDER Well, now, let's see. Who's obsessed with Buffy? Who likes to hang out in her yard and keep an eye on her? Who's in love with you and not getting any?
SPIKE What's this?
BUFFY It's a camera.
SPIKE Yeah, I got that part. Why am I holding it?
BUFFY Someone was using it to spy on me. On my house. Xander thinks it's you.
SPIKE Oh, the great Xander thinks so! Shudder gasp! It must be true!
BUFFY Spike-
SPIKE That ponce has always had it for me. Every chance he gets, he sticks it-
SPIKE You believe him, don't you? You think I was spying on you.
SPIKE You think I could do that?
BUFFY Because you don't lie or cheat or steal or manipulate...
SPIKE I don't hurt you.
BUFFY I know.
SPIKE No, you don't. I've tried to make it clear to you, but you won't see it. Something happened to me. The way I feel ... about you ... it's different. And no matter how hard you try to convince yourself it isn't, it's real.
BUFFY I think it is.
BUFFY For you.
BUFFY I know that's not what you want to hear. I'm sorry. I really am. But, Spike, you have to move on. You have to get over-
SPIKE Get out.
ANYA No! They're all, 'oh, poor Xander! It took so much out of him, all that running away he did.' I just don't understand what's wrong with these people.
HALFREK Did you really think they were the ones who would help you?
ANYA Well, but-
HALFREK Do you want retribution, Anyanka?
ANYA I want Xander good and cursed.
HALFREK Then you know what you have to do.
ANYA Get a wish from someone who doesn't freaking love him.
HALFREK Exactly.
ANYA Yeah, but my social circle is a little limited here. What am I supposed to do, just stumble upon someone who doesn't give a fig's ass if Xander gets hurt?
SPIKE Hey. I need a thing.
ANYA So. What's your pleasure?
SPIKE Fresh of out of pleasure. That's why I'm here. I need something. Numbing spell, maybe.
ANYA Uh huh. Hang on.
ANYA Oh my God. Spike *hates* Xander. Maybe I could get him to wish ... dammit, if only he were a woman. Got it! If I can somehow get someone to wish that Spike were a woman, then I could go to him - well, he'd be a her by then - then I could go to her -
HALFREK Anyanka. There's an easier way. Now, I know you have this whole female-power, Take Back the Night thing, I think that's cute. But I've been telling you for decades - men need a little vengeance now and then, too.
ANYA Oh.
HALFREK Maybe this is a good chance to try it out.
HALFREK Good luck with that. Ta-ta!
SPIKE Sorry to bust up the little girls' night out.
ANYA That's okay. I'm ready to do some business.
SPIKE Right then. Got something that'll dull the ache a bit?
ANYA Actually, yes. Um, Giles left a couple of supplies here, and I think ... this might help.
ANYA Eases the hurt ... makes the sun shine a little brighter, even makes boring people seem more interesting. Ah. Here.
BUFFY How's it coming? Can you see who's getting the camera's signal?
WILLOW Should have something once I get tapped into the fiber-optic network. We're gonna use the feedback relay to, uh, get their signal routed into our system.
XANDER Okay, if it's not Spike, and I'm, I'm not saying I believe him ... but if it's not Spike, I think we already know who's behind this.
WILLOW Makes sense.
BUFFY I want. To find. These guys.
JONATHAN Uncover.
JONATHAN There. That's it. That's where we have to go.
WARREN Well, now that we've found out where we're supposed to go-
JONATHAN Yah!
SPIKE So then, this girl says, real for *you*.
ANYA Right. But getting back to Xander...
SPIKE Xander. Let's not waste any more breath on that wanker.
ANYA But he made a fool of me. And nobody seems to care enough to do anything!
SPIKE I care. What he done to you? I've never stooped that low, and I'm an 'evil, soulless thing.' According to some people.
ANYA But shouldn't he pay? Don't you wish he had to pay in some horrible way?
SPIKE Absolutely.
SPIKE Take him on myself, if it wasn't for my little handicap.
ANYA Right. So ... hypothetically, what do you wish you could do to him?
SPIKE You name it, pet. You're the wronged party. Something, uh... gruesome, how 'bout?
JONATHAN Hey! That's my blanket!
WARREN Well, makes sense, it was your fire.
WILLOW Hey hey, I think I've got something.
ANYA Thing about it is, none of this was my idea. I didn't ask to be human.
SPIKE Right! And I didn't ask for this bloody chip in my head.
ANYA To tell you the truth ... all I wanted was to use him and lose him. I hadn't had a good tumble in a thousand years...
SPIKE Me too. The using part. I just wanted to know what I was missing, move on.
ANYA Yeah ... and he was ... all bumpy ... in the right places. And nice to me...
SPIKE She was so raw. I've never felt anything like it.
ANYA Next thing you know ... I'm changing to please him. I care if he cares!
SPIKE Right.
ANYA And I'm off my guard. Happy! I'm singing in the shower and doing my sexy dance?!
SPIKE Exactly. I ... have no dance.
BUFFY Talk to me, Will.
WILLOW Technology's pretty sophisticated, lots of booby traps and firewall stuff...
BUFFY But can you get us a location?
WILLOW Well, hey, I'm still me. Just one - whoa.
BUFFY What?
WILLOW There are other cameras.
ANYA Screw 'em!
SPIKE To the rafters!
ANYA I did everything for that man. Was it ever enough?
SPIKE Never! I was always going above and beyond. I saved the Scoobies how many times? And I can't stand the lot of you.
ANYA Me either! I hate us! Everybody's so *nice.* Nobody says what's on their mind.
SPIKE You do. That's why you're the only one of them I wouldn't bite if I had the chance.
ANYA Really?
SPIKE Absolutely. I have nothing but respect for a woman who is forthright. Drusilla was always straightforward. Didn't have a single buggering clue about what was going on in front of her, but she was straight about it. That's a virtue.
ANYA Mm. Xander didn't think so. He thought I was rude.
SPIKE That's because he's one of them. Uptight. Repressed.
ANYA You think?
SPIKE Please. It's no wonder they couldn't deal with the likes of you and me, luv. We should have been dead hundreds of years ago ... and we're the only ones who are really alive.
WILLOW Oh my god, the Double Meat Palace? The Bronze? My classes on campus...
WILLOW Xander's site...
BUFFY What?!
XANDER They've been spying on all these places?
WILLOW I can tell there are more feeds, I, I'm just having a harder time pinpointing 'em. Here, lemme...
SPIKE Here. Ladies last.
ANYA Thank you.
SPIKE Take it quick or my chivalry'll run out.
ANYA No ... thank you.
ANYA This is the first time since ... It feels good to be with someone who understands.
SPIKE Intimately.
ANYA This whole time, I've been coming on all ... hell-bent and mad. Wanting his head, you know?
SPIKE Yeah.
ANYA When, really, I ... can't sleep at night, thinking it ... has to be my fault, somehow...
SPIKE Shh...
ANYA What if it was just pretending? What if he never wanted me ... the way I wanted him?
ANYA Ohh. I'm sorry.
SPIKE Now now.
SPIKE He would have to be more than just the git he is, Anya. He'd have to be deaf, dumb and blind not to want a woman like you.
ANYA Then why?
SPIKE The two of them ... they're weak, is all. But, I'll tell you what, though. They'll, uh, miss the water now that the well's gone dry.
ANYA Too hot to handle.
SPIKE Too hot...
ANYA Um ... just-just one more question.
SPIKE Hmm?
ANYA Can I see your sexy dance?
SPIKE I'll show you mine...
ANYA Wait. Wait. What are we doing?
SPIKE Moving on.
WILLOW Here, I think there are a couple more transmitters on the network, I just ... ucch, I've almost got a picture on 'em.
ANYA You know I'm only doing this 'cause I'm ... I'm lonely and drunk and you ... smell really good.
SPIKE See? Forthright.
WARREN Ahh!
ANDREW It tapped into our feed, something's wrong!
WILLOW I think I've got the Magic Box.
WILLOW Whoa!
WARREN Shut it down, shut it *all* down!
ANDREW I'm trying, I can't find
JONATHAN Here, dorkface-
ANDREW I'll get it myself-
WARREN Guys, we have to - oh, holy crap.
JONATHAN Oh my god.
WARREN What is that, p-porn?
JONATHAN Oh my god.
WARREN Is that the cam in the Magic Box?
JONATHAN Oh my god.
ANDREW What are they ... ohh.
WARREN Is that-
JONATHAN Spike.
ANDREW He is so cool. And, I mean, the girl is hot too.
WARREN Dude.
WILLOW Wait, Xander, no.
XANDER Oh, god.
DAWN Hey guys. What's up?
WILLOW Whoa, whoa, whoa.
XANDER I ... what is she...
WILLOW Buffy?
BUFFY That's enough.
WILLOW Here, lemme just...
WILLOW You know, we, we aren't even really sure what we're just seeing here, there could be something-
WILLOW There, got it.
WILLOW Xander?
DAWN So. This is it? This is the stuff you've been protecting me from? You and Spike?
BUFFY And a lot of monsters.
DAWN Uh-huh.
BUFFY But it's over. Spike.
DAWN I wish you'd told me.
BUFFY I kinda didn't wanna admit it to myself.
DAWN I get that.
DAWN I know it must hurt. To feel like you have to hide, to keep secrets from everybody?
WILLOW Buffy. Xander's gone. He took your axe.
XANDER Get up. Get up!
XANDER You're just gonna sit there? Do nothing?
XANDER That the kinda man you are?
SPIKE I'm not gonna fight you. Chip.
XANDER Too bad.
ANYA Xander, no! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
ANYA Xander, I...
XANDER Don't even try to deny it. 'Cause I saw it all. The whole beautiful show.
ANYA How...?
ANYA It was just, it ... it was just a thing. I ... I felt bad, and he was just ... there.
BUFFY Didn't take long, did it?
XANDER Oh, oh, oh, okay! You had to do it. Because he was there. Like Mt. Everest. Like I used to be.
ANYA And then you weren't. You left *me,* Xander. At the altar. I don't owe you anything.
XANDER So you go out and bang the first body you can find? Dead or alive?
ANYA Where do you get off judging me?!
XANDER When this is your solution to our problems. I hurt you, and you hit me back? Very mature.
ANYA No, the mature solution is for you to spend your whole life telling stupid, pointless jokes, so that no one will notice that you are just a scared, insecure little boy!
XANDER I'm not joking now. You let that evil, soulless thing touch you. You wanted me to feel something? Congratulations, it worked.
XANDER I look at you ... and I feel sick. 'Cause you had sex with that.
SPIKE It's good enough for Buffy.
XANDER Shut up and leave her out of...
ANYA Buffy?
BUFFY Xander...
XANDER I don't want to know this.
XANDER I don't want to know any of this.
SPIKE Bloody Xander, muckingup everything.
SPIKE You know, I wish-
ANYA Don't.
TARA Things fall apart. They fall apart so hard.
WILLOW Tara?
TARA You can't ever ... put them back the way they were.
WILLOW Are you okay?
TARA I'm sorry, it's just ... You know, it takes time. You can't just ... have coffee and expect-
