XANDER She's in the back.
XANDER This way!
PARAMEDIC_1 She was shot?
XANDER Yeah, in the chest.
PARAMEDIC_#2 Accidental?
XANDER No no, it was a ... He was trying to kill her.
WILLOW Oh god, oh no. Please, please, come on....
WILLOW Come on, Tara! Please, come on, baby...
WILLOW By Osiris, I command you, bring her back!
PARAMEDIC_#2 Pulse is 100 and weak. Lung sounds are wet.
XANDER What does that mean? Is she going to...
PARAMEDIC_#1 You need to stand back, okay? If you want us to help her out, we need some space.
WILLOW Hear me! Keeper of darkness!
DEMON Witch! How dare you invoke Osiris in this task!
WILLOW Please. Please, bring her back.
DEMON You may not violate the laws of natural passing.
WILLOW How? How is this natural?
DEMON It is a human death, by human means.
WILLOW But I-
DEMON You raised one killed by mystical forces. This is not the same. She is taken by natural order. It is done.
WILLOW No. There has to be a way.
DEMON It is done.
WILLOW NOOOO!
PARAMEDIC_#2 Sunnydale Memorial, do you copy? We have a caucasian female, 21, GSW to the chest.
XANDER Come on, Buff, hang on. We're going to get you to the hospital.
XANDER Willow, god, are you okay?
WILLOW How did this happen?
XANDER Warren. He had a gun.
WILLOW Warren.
XANDER It went down too fast, I couldn't stop him.
XANDER Hey.
XANDER Will!
PARAMEDIC_#1 Sir, we have to go, are you coming with us or not?
ANDREW Think they'll let my aunt bring me my Discman?
JONATHAN That's what you're worried about? In-flight entertainment? We're in jail!
ANDREW We're in custody. We haven't been charged yet.
JONATHAN Thank you, Dragnet. It doesn't matter what they call it, they got us, okay? We're going down.
JONATHAN That guy's been looking at me. I think he wants to make me his butt monkey.
ANDREW Don't flatter yourself. I heard him talking to the guard. He's in here for parking tickets.
JONATHAN That doesn't mean anything! The joint changes you. I hear they like the small ones, with little hands like their girlfriends.
ANDREW You have got to chill out. This isn't Oz, it's like, Mayberry. Besides, Warren is going to find a way to get us out of here.
JONATHAN Yeah. I'm sure he'll be busting us out any minute.
ANDREW He will. He's coming up with a plan. Like, War Games. Remember that decoder that Matthew Broderick used?
JONATHAN Oh, yeah. That was rad. The one he made from the scissors and the tape recorder?
ANDREW I miss Ferris Matthew. Broadway Matthew? I find him cold.
JONATHAN Really? No, I- Shut up!
JONATHAN This is real life. And nobody's coming to get us. Not even your aunt who won't return your one phone call.
ANDREW She must be out of town.
JONATHAN She. Doesn't. Care. And neither does your partner in crime, Warren.
ANDREW Don't say that. And what do you mean, my partner in crime? We're in this together.
JONATHAN What do you mean, what do I mean? You two were totally going to fly off and leave me holding the bag.
ANDREW No we weren't! I was going to - carry you.
JONATHAN No, you two were setting me up, and then Warren was going to screw you over too.
ANDREW That is so not true!
JONATHAN Sure. He's a nice murderer who keeps his word.
ANDREW You're wrong. He's coming for us. He's out there right now, devising a brilliant way to get us out of here.
WARREN Whiskey, straight up. And get a round for the house. I'm feeling expansive.
WARREN Hey.
WARREN Bet you don't get a lot of humans in-
VAMPIRE I'm watching my program.
WARREN Wouldn't want to interrupt your 'me' time. Not even to buy the guy who killed the Slayer a drink.
VAMPIRE What's that?
WARREN Took her out myself. I've been heading an organization. The Trio? You've heard of us.
VAMPIRE Uh - ...no.
WARREN Not important. I cut them loose. I figure, now that Buffy's out of the picture, some things have got to change around here. I need a real gang, you know, not a, not a couple of wannabes.
BARTENDER And you killed the Slayer?
WARREN With these hands.
BARTENDER What are you, a warlock?
WARREN It's funny you mention that. You know, I've explored all the dark arts ... witchcraft, demonology. You name it, I tried it against the Slayer. But you know what I found *really* works?
WARREN Gun.
VAMPIRE You killed the Slayer with a gun.
WARREN In her own backyard. Don't underestimate science, my friend. Good old-fashioned metal meets propulsion.
BARTENDER Man, this is gonna be good.
WARREN Oh, the best. This town is ours.
VAMPIRE Ours, maybe. You are screwed.
BARTENDER Metal meets propulsion, yeah. But you still better be a good shot!
WARREN This isn't the evil laugh of victory, is it.
VAMPIRE More like the evil laugh of you're a dead man.
WARREN Okay, uh ... what, what's the joke?
BARTENDER It was just on the news. Girl was shot.
VAMPIRE In her back yard.
BARTENDER She survived. She's in the hospital
BARTENDER Slayers heal fast. Real fast.
VAMPIRE Yeah. I was gonna eat you myself during the commercial, but now I think it'll be more fun to let the Slayer de-gut you.
VAMPIRE Might want to get a head start, my friend. 'Cause this girl is gonna be coming for you, big time.
ANYA Willow.
WILLOW Where do you keep the black arts books?
ANYA Something terrible has happened, I know. But you don't have to do-
WILLOW I need power.
ANYA Not with those books. I can't let you. Willow!
WILLOW That's better.
DAWN Buffy?
DAWN Buffy?
DAWN Hey. Hello? Uh, the door was...
DAWN Tara?
RACK All right, who's next?
WARREN I am.
JUNKIE Hey.
RACK You're new.
WARREN Yeah. And I come bearing dead presidents, so you think we can just skip the small talk?
RACK How'd you find me?
WARREN I talked to a guy. He's one of your regulars. Offered to show me the way for twenty bucks.
RACK Should have haggled. Most of my customers'll bring you here for five.
WARREN Great, great I'll file that away. Look, I'm in a bit of a situation here. I tried to do us all a favor, and eliminate the Slayer, but it ... I....
WARREN I guess it didn't take.
RACK Killing a Slayer, that's big business for a kid.
WARREN I'm not a kid.
RACK Okay.
WARREN I had my own guys. The Trio, yeah, you've heard of us.
RACK Right. What were you, a band or something?
WARREN I thought word traveled in the underworld. You know, we were evil. Robots were my thing. You didn't hear about the freeze ray?
RACK Sorry. So why aren't your guys helping you?
WARREN Look, I thought this was a cash for service gig, not an interview process, all right? I need protection. I've got the Slayer after me.
RACK Slayer is the least of your problems.
WARREN You're right. Let's talk about my skin troubles. You know, I'd say on the scale of problems, that she ranks!
RACK If I were you, I'd be worried about the witch.
WARREN Witch? W-which witch?
RACK Willow. Slayer's pal? She's the new power, man, anybody with intuition can feel it. She's going to blow this town apart . Starting ... with you.
WARREN Me? What did I, what did I do to her? O-okay, okay, I, I shot her friend...
RACK I feel death.
WARREN But the Slayer's alive. And - and she heals.
RACK She might, but somebody's stone cold, and that ... is why the witch wants your head. She can sense your essence right now, man. It's just a matter of time before she finds you.
WARREN All right. Take it. All right, there's that, and I can get more. Just give me something.
RACK Hide or fight?
WARREN Both. All of it. I, I still have a few tricks up my sleeve, but it's not enough. I need, I need a cover, and I need lots of fire power.
RACK I can't guarantee anything. Not this time. The girl is running on pure fury. I've never felt anything like it.
WARREN Thank you for the tip, Nostradamus. Just load me up, okay?
NURSE ...standing by.
DOCTOR We've got to stop that bleeding.
NURSE_#1 Where?
DOCTOR Over by the left ventricle.
NURSE_#2 BP is down to 80/palp.
DOCTOR We got more bleeding.
NURSE_#2 BP is...
NURSE_#1 What's happening?
WILLOW Leave.
XANDER Willow.
WILLOW Now.
XANDER Will, what are you doing?! She's going to die.
WILLOW No she isn't.
WILLOW It's so small.
BUFFY What happened?
XANDER Buffy!
XANDER Oh my god, are you okay?
BUFFY Sure. How'd I get here?
XANDER You've got to stop doing this. This dying thing's funny once, maybe twice.
BUFFY Willow?
WILLOW Buffy. Hey.
BUFFY What's wrong?
WILLOW I'll explain. But we've gotta go.
BUFFY Why?
WILLOW It's time to find Warren.
WARREN This'll get me all the way to the border?
CLERK You'll have to change to the city bus. It's all in the folder.
WILLOW Faster.
XANDER I'm going as fast as I-
WILLOW Faster!
XANDER Will, would you cut that out? If you wanted to drive...
BUFFY We need to stop. I don't like this.
WILLOW We're close. I can feel him.
BUFFY And we'll catch him, and he'll go to jail. Look, I'm finding the whole getting shot very motivating. But you're using magic.
WILLOW If I wasn't, you'd be dead.
BUFFY Maybe. But this isn't right. Okay, this isn't how I want it.
WILLOW Sometimes you don't have a choice.
XANDER I think Buffy gets the tie-breaker on this one. She was the one on the ouchy end of the bullet.
BUFFY Will, you do have a choice. This isn't good for you.
XANDER You made the decision to stop for a reason. You promised us. And can I just ask, what's with the make-over of the damned? I mean, the hair...!
WILLOW Turn right! Go!
XANDER Go - where?
WILLOW Over there! Now!
XANDER Will.
WILLOW Turn.
XANDER Fine, fine! Puppetmaster wants to drive? Go right ahead!
BUFFY Willow, wait!
WILLOW Stay back.
WILLOW Get out.
WARREN Please. I'll-I'll do anything.
WILLOW It's a robot.
WILLOW I, I could feel his essence.
WILLOW He tricked me. We'll find him another way.
BUFFY And then what?
WILLOW And then we'll kill him.
BUFFY Okay, you need to calm down.
WILLOW Calm down?
BUFFY Look, you're angry. I, I am too. There's no excuse for what Warren did, but that-
WILLOW He shot Tara.
WILLOW When he shot you, he hit her too. Upstairs in my room.
BUFFY Oh my god.
WILLOW Guess the last shot was the charm.
XANDER She's dead?
WILLOW She's dead. Now he's dead too.
BUFFY Oh my god ... Tara...
XANDER Christ, Will, how come you didn't say anything?
WILLOW I'm busy.
BUFFY W-Willow, please, just stop.
BUFFY We love you. And Tara. But we don't kill humans. It's not the way.
WILLOW How can you say that? Tara is dead.
BUFFY I know ... I know. And I ... can't understand ... anything. Not what happened ... a-and not what you must be going through. Willow, if you do this, you let Warren destroy you too.
XANDER You said it yourself, Will ... the magic's too strong, there's no coming back from it.
WILLOW I'm not coming back.
BUFFY Will, please. Please, we'll get through this together.
WILLOW We won't! Not your way.
BUFFY Please, just-
WILLOW No! No more talking. It's done!
BUFFY Willow? Dawn?
XANDER Maybe she went to the hospital to find you.
BUFFY I left there hours ago. She'd be back by now.
BUFFY Dawn?
BUFFY Oh god.
DAWN I didn't ... want to leave her alone.
BUFFY Dawn. Sweetheart. Come on. Honey, we need to get out of here, okay? Dawn, sweetheart. Be strong for me, okay?
BUFFY Dawn, we need to go downstairs.
DAWN I don't understand.
BUFFY I don't understand either.
CORONER If you could just sign this?
XANDER Sure.
CORONER Call this number tomorrow, we'll have more information.
XANDER Okay, thanks. Thank you.
CORONER I'm sorry for your loss.
XANDER So that's it.
BUFFY Are the police gone too?
XANDER Coming back tomorrow with more of their pretty yellow tape.
BUFFY We need to find Willow.
XANDER Yeah, she's off the wagon big-time. Warren's a dead man if she finds him.
DAWN Good.
BUFFY Dawn, don't say that.
DAWN Why not? I'd do it myself if I could.
BUFFY Because you don't really feel that way.
DAWN Yes I do. And you should too. He killed Tara, and he nearly killed you. He needs to pay.
XANDER Out of the mouths of babes.
BUFFY Xander.
XANDER I'm just saying he's ... he's just as bad as any vampire you've sent to dustville.
BUFFY Being a Slayer doesn't give me a license to kill. Warren's human.
DAWN So?
BUFFY So the human world has its own rules for dealing with people like him.
XANDER Yeah, we all know how well those rules work.
BUFFY Sometimes they do. Sometimes they don't. We can't control the universe. If we were supposed to ... then the magic wouldn't change Willow the way it does. And ... we'd be able to bring Tara back.
DAWN And Mom.
BUFFY There are limits to what we can do. There should be. Willow doesn't want to believe that. And now she's messing with forces that want to hurt her. All of us.
XANDER I just ... I've had blood on my hands all day. Blood from people I love.
BUFFY I know. And now it has to stop. Warren's going to get what he deserves. I promise . But I will *not* let Willow destroy herself.
XANDER Okay, where do we go? She could be anywhere.
BUFFY I don't know, um ... Maybe the Magic Box for some kind of locating spell. I could go myself.
XANDER No no. I'm cool. I'll go.
BUFFY Dawn can't stay here by herself.
DAWN Let me go with you. I want to.
BUFFY No, honey, it's too dangerous.
DAWN But ... it's Willow. She needs us.
BUFFY She does. And you'll help her. Lots. Okay, but first we have to get her home in one piece.
DAWN But-
BUFFY Dawn. I'm serious. You've been through enough for more than one ... ever. You should be someplace where you feel safe.
DAWN Fine. I want to go to Spike's.
BUFFY All right.
XANDER What?! Not all right. Are you kidding? After what Spike did-
BUFFY Xander!
BUFFY I'll get the coats.
XANDER You're not gonna really leave Dawn with Mr. Attempted Rape.
BUFFY He won't hurt Dawn. I, he-he physically can't. Besides, he wouldn't.
XANDER Well, after the other night, I'd say all bets are off on what he's capable of.
BUFFY Dawn feels safe with him. We don't have a choice. Right now, he's all we've got.
WILLOW Blood of the slain, hear me. Guide me to Tara's killer.
MAN_ON_TV John, why don't you forget this foolishness?
WOMAN_ON_TV John! John!
BUFFY Spike.
CLEM Suffering cats!
CLEM Where did you come from?
BUFFY Oh. Clem, I - sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.
CLEM It's, uh, it's okay, you just snuck up on me is all.
BUFFY I made you spill your snacks.
CLEM Nah, don't worry about it. Like I need any more of this. Oh, hi.
DAWN Hi.
CLEM Can I get you ladies something? I was just about to mix up some Country Time.
BUFFY We're looking for Spike, actually.
CLEM He didn't tell you?
BUFFY Tell me what?
CLEM He left. Town.
BUFFY Oh.
DAWN He just took off?
CLEM That's why I'm staying here for him. Sweet pad like this goes empty for a few days, you'll lose it for sure. Plus, I ... don't have a TV.
CLEM I'm surprised he didn't tell you. He kind of left in a hurry, I guess. Sure I can't get you something? I've got Bugles and, uh, liverwurst...
BUFFY We're fine, thank you. Um, but you could do us a favor. Do you think maybe Dawn could hang out here with you for a while? I have some stuff that I need to do and, uh, I really don't want her to be alone.
DAWN I still don't see why I just can't-
BUFFY Dawn. We've been through this. What do you think?
CLEM No problem. I'd love the company. Do you like Parcheesi?
DAWN Sure.
CLEM Or, we could rent videos. I've been dying to see The Wedding Planner.
DAWN Either way. I'm good.
CLEM Ooh, and here. You can have the comfy chair.
BUFFY I'll be back as soon as I can. I promise.
DAWN Okay.
BUFFY Thank you.
BUFFY Did he say when he'd be back?
CLEM Spike? No. Only that he could be gone a while.
SPIKE Not asking for permission, mate.
VOICE You seek me, vampire?
SPIKE You do the finger paintings? Nice work.
DEMON Answer me.
SPIKE Yeah. I seek you.
DEMON Something about a woman. The slayer.
SPIKE Thinks she's better than me. Ever since I got this bleeding chip in my head, things ain't been right. Everything's gone to hell.
DEMON And you want to return to your former self.
SPIKE Yeah.
SPIKE What?
DEMON Look what she's reduced you to.
SPIKE It's this bloody chip-
DEMON You were a legendary dark warrior, and you let yourself be castrated. And you have the audacity to crawl in here and demand restoration?
SPIKE I'm still a warrior.
DEMON You're a pathetic excuse for a demon.
SPIKE Yeah? I'll show you pathetic. Give me your best shot.
DEMON You'd never endure the trials required to grant your request.
SPIKE Do your worst. But when I win ... I want what I came here for.
SPIKE Bitch is gonna see a change.
XANDER You feeling any change? Can you talk?
ANYA It's wearing off.
ANYA Willow was here earlier. She put the whammy on me and went straight to the dark arts books. Sucked them dry.
XANDER Look, Anya, something terrible happened.
ANYA I know. Tara.
XANDER Willow's out for blood, big time. We need to find her before she finds Warren. Is there something you can do, a, a locator spell?
ANYA I don't need a spell. I can feel her.
XANDER You can...?
ANYA Feel her. Her thirst for vengeance, it's overwhelming.
XANDER Is that like, left over from your vengeance demon days? You just sense her?
ANYA No. Not left over.
XANDER Oh.
ANYA Yeah.
XANDER When?
ANYA When do you think?
BUFFY Is everyone okay? Did Willow -
ANYA Got her power boost and took off.
XANDER Anya's ... Anya was saying she knows where Willow is.
BUFFY A spell?
XANDER Not exactly. Seems Anya got her vengeance on again.
BUFFY Oh.
XANDER So, Willow's all wrathy ... why don't you go to her? Isn't that your gig?
ANYA Normally, I'd have to ... but she doesn't want me.
BUFFY She wants to do it herself.
ANYA Yeah.
BUFFY Look, Anya, we don't have much time. Which side of this are you on?
XANDER If you know where she is, you can help us.
ANYA I'll help. But I'm helping Willow.
ANYA She's close to him. He's in the woods.
WILLOW Run all night, Warren. I'll still find-
WILLOW Axe, not gonna cut it.
WARREN Cute. That's a cute trick.
WARREN It was an accident, you know.
WILLOW Oh. You mean, instead of killing my best friend, you killed my girlfriend.
WARREN It ... it wasn't personal, that's all.
WILLOW Well, this is.
WARREN Capture!
(latin_translation entangle)
WILLOW Cute tricks.
WARREN You're really asking for it, you know that?
WILLOW I'm asking for it?
WARREN I'm gonna walk away from this. And when I do, you're gonna beg to go join your little girlfriend.
WILLOW She wasn't your first.
WARREN Uh, first who?
WILLOW Tara. She wasn't the first girl you killed.
WARREN I don't know what you're talk-
WILLOW Reveal!
KATRINA I should have strangled you in your sleep.
KATRINA Back when we shared a bed. I should have done the world a favor.
WARREN It's a trick.
KATRINA Why, Warren? You could have just let me go.
WARREN Make it shut up. Make it go away.
KATRINA It didn't have be like that.
WARREN I'm not kidding!
KATRINA How could you say you loved me, and do that to me?
WARREN Because you deserved it, bitch!
WILLOW Because you liked it.
WARREN Oh, shut up!
WILLOW You never felt you had the power with her. Not until you killed her.
WARREN Women. You know, you're just like the rest of them. Mind games.
WILLOW You get off on it. That's why you had a mad-on for the Slayer. She was your big O, wasn't she, Warren?
WARREN Are you done yet? Or can we talk some more about our feelings?
BUFFY What's happening? What do you feel?
ANYA She's stronger now. Close.
XANDER What about Warren? Has she-
ANYA He's still alive. She's not done.
WARREN Help! Let me go. Somebody! Help!!
WILLOW What's the matter? Thought you wanted to talk.
WARREN No.
WILLOW Okay.
WILLOW I'll talk.
WARREN What, what are you doing?
WILLOW Shhh.
WARREN Hey, hey, I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry.
WILLOW Wanna know what a bullet feels like, Warren? A real one? It's not like in the comics.
WARREN No. No.
WILLOW I think you need to. Feel it.
WARREN Oh god! Stop it!
WILLOW It's not going to make a neat little hole. First, it'll obliterate your internal organs. Your lung will collapse. Feels like drowning.
WARREN Please! No.
WILLOW When it finally hits your spine, it'll blow your central nervous system.
WARREN Oh please, stop, god! Please-
WILLOW I'm talking!
WILLOW The pain will be unbearable, but you won't be able to move. Bullet usually travels faster than this, of course. But the dying? It'll seem like it takes forever.
WILLOW Something, isn't it? One tiny piece of metal destroys everything. It ripped her insides out ... took her light away. From me. From the world.
WILLOW Now the one person who should be here is gone ... and a waste like you gets to live.
WILLOW Tiny piece of metal. Can you feel it now?
ANYA Over there.
WILLOW I said, can you feel it?
WARREN Please! God! I did wrong, I see that now. I need, I need jail! I need ... But you, you don't want this. You're, you're not a bad person. Not like me.
BUFFY Willow!
WARREN Oh, and when you get caught, you'll lose them too. Your friends. You don't want that. I know you're in pain, but-
WILLOW Bored now.
XANDER Oh my god.
BUFFY What did you do?
BUFFY Willow, what did you do?
WILLOW One down.
