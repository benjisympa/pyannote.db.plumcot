BUFFY Giles?
ANYA Giles?
WILLOW Uh oh.
WILLOW Daddy's home. I'm in wicked trouble now.
GILES You have no idea. You have to stop what you're doing.
WILLOW Uhh, sorry. Can't do that. I'm not finished yet.
GILES Neither am I. Stay down.
ANYA How'd you do that?
WILLOW That's borrowed power. No way is it gonna be strong enough-
GILES I'm here to help you.
WILLOW Thanks, but I can kill a couple geeks all by myself. But, hey, if you'd like to watch ... I mean, that's what you Watchers are good at, right? Watching? Butting in on things that don't concern you?
GILES You concern me, Willow. Stay on this path and you'll wind up dead.
BUFFY Willow. Listen to him. I don't want to fight you anymore.
WILLOW I don't want to fight you either. I wanna fight him.
GILES Stay down.
WILLOW No.
WILLOW Remember that little spat we had before you left? When you were under the delusion that you were still relevant here? You called me a rank, arrogant amateur. Well buckle up, Rupert...
WILLOW 'Cause I've turned pro.
WILLOW Asmodea, bring forth
WILLOW What? No! Get off!
BUFFY What did you do?
GILES Contained her and her powers within a binding field. It puts her in a kind of ... stasis for the time-
GILES You cut your hair.
ANYA I'm blonde.
ANYA I, I colored my hair. Again. I'm blonde.
GILES Yes, I noticed.
GILES I'm very sorry about Tara.
WILLOW This...
WILLOW ...won't hold me ... forever.
GILES I came as soon as I heard.
BUFFY The Council?
GILES The Council haven't a clue. About much of anything, really. No, there's an ... an extremely powerful coven in Devon. They sensed the rise of a dangerous magical force here in Sunnydale. A dark force, fueled by grief.
BUFFY Willow.
GILES I'd so hoped it wasn't her. And then a seer in the coven told me about Tara. That's when the coven ... imbued me with their powers.
BUFFY And sent you here to bring Willow down.
GILES Buffy, what's happened here?
BUFFY God. I don't even know where to start.
GILES Well, Willow's clearly been abusing the magicks.
BUFFY She has. She was ... and I barely even noticed. Giles, everything's just been so... Xander left Anya at the altar, and Anya's a vengeance demon again... Dawn's a total klepto ... money's been so tight that I've been slinging burgers at the Doublemeat Palace ... And I've been sleeping with Spike.
GILES Sorry.
WILLOW Anya...
ANYA Willow.
WILLOW I need you, Anya. I need you to do something for me.
ANYA I know what you're trying to do. And I hate to burst your bubble, but that mind control mojo doesn't work on vengeance demons, so why don't you just-
WILLOW Stop talking and listen.
ANYA Okay.
WILLOW You need to free me.
ANYA No.
WILLOW You don't want to call out to them. You want to take away this binding spell.
ANYA I don't know how.
WILLOW I do. Do you want me to tell you?
GILES Duct tape?
BUFFY On their mouths. So the demon could eat them...
GILES Because they were figments.
BUFFY All of it! You, Sunnydale ... And I was just some nutcase in L.A.
GILES Of course. Why didn't we see it before?
BUFFY For what?
GILES I should never have left.
BUFFY No. You were right to leave. We're just ... stupid.
GILES I know you're all stupid. I should never have abandoned you.
BUFFY No. Giles, you were right about everything. It is time I was an adult.
GILES Sometimes the most adult thing you can do is ... ask for help when you need it.
BUFFY Now you tell me.
BUFFY I guess ... I wasn't ready before. It took a long time for that feeling to go away ... the feeling that I wasn't really here. It was like ... when I clawed my way out of that grave, I left something behind. Part of me. I just... I don't understand ... why I'm back.
GILES You have a calling.
BUFFY But it was my time, Giles. Someone would have taken my place. So why?
BUFFY Right. What's gonna happen to Willow?
GILES Well, the coven is working on a ... way to extract her powers without ... killing her. And, uh, should she survive, you ought to know, Buffy, that there's no guarantee she'll ... be as she was. Willow has killed a human being. How will she be able to live with herself?
WILLOW I wouldn't worry about that.
WILLOW Willow doesn't live here anymore.
WILLOW Fool me once...
GILES Willow...
WILLOW Shame on you.
DAWN Where are we going?
XANDER I have no idea.
DAWN What?
XANDER I don't know, okay? I can't even run away well. And that's something I'm usually good at.
DAWN Maybe we should we go back and help.
XANDER Yeah, 'cause I've been such a big help already. Standing around like a monkey while Buffy gets shot. Tara's dead ... and Willow ... losing...
DAWN Well, feeling sorry for yourself isn't helping either, Xander, okay?
DAWN You know, if Spike were here, he'd go back and fight.
XANDER Sure, if he wasn't too busy trying to rape your sister.
DAWN What?!
XANDER Forget it.
DAWN I don't believe you.
XANDER Fine.
DAWN He wouldn't do that.
XANDER Is this blind spot like a genetic trait with the Summers women? The only useful thing Spike ever did was finally leave town.
SPIKE Well, that was a bloody doddle and piece o'piss.
SPIKE Got any more ruddy tests for me, you ponce? I'll take anything you can throw at me, if it'll get me what I need to take care of the Slayer. Give her what's coming to her. So you just bring it on. Bring on the whole-
SPIKE Bloody hell.
WILLOW That all you got, Jeeves?
WILLOW 'Cause, I could stand to go another ten rounds. Whereas ... you can barely stand.
GILES Your powers ... may be undeniably greater. But I can still hurt you if I have to.
WILLOW Boy, you just don't get it, do you? Nothing can hurt me now.
WILLOW This?
WILLOW ...is nothing. It's all ... nothing.
GILES I see. If you lose someone you love ... the other people in your life who care about you...
GILES ...become meaningless. I wonder what Tara would say about that.
WILLOW You can ask her yourself.
WILLOW You're always saving everyone. It's kinda pesky.
WILLOW You probably even think you're buying escape time for Jonathan and the other one. Well, I got a little secret for ya. I can kill them from anywhere I want. With this.
WILLOW It'll find them. It'll bury them. Along with anyone helping those Dead Men Walking.
BUFFY Don't.
WILLOW Unless ... somebody, somehow ... can get there in time to save them. Huh. Oh, well.
WILLOW Fly, my pretty, fly.
WILLOW See what I did there?
GILES Go.
WILLOW Good luck.
WILLOW Thought she'd never leave. Now I finally have you all to myself.
WILLOW You're such a hypocrite. Waltzing in here with your borrowed magicks. So you can tell me what? Magic's bad? Behave? Be a good girl? Well, I ... I don't think you're in any position to be telling me what to do.
WILLOW Do you?
WILLOW I used to think you had all the answers. That I had so much to learn from you.
GILES Willow...
WILLOW You were jealous. Still are. Just couldn't bear that I was the one with power. That's why you ran away.
WILLOW That's why you-
WILLOW That ... was rude! Now I forgot what I was saying.
GILES Perhaps you're not as strong ... as you think you are.
GILES You're expending way too much of your mystical energy to maintain your powers. At this rate you're going to ... burn out. And up.
WILLOW Blah blah blah.
GILES Willow, you ... you need to stop.
WILLOW What I need...
WILLOW ...is a little pick-me-up.
WILLOW Whoa. Head rush.
WILLOW Wow. Whoa. Who's your supplier? This is ... wow.
WILLOW It's incredible. I mean, I am so juiced ... Giles, it's like ... no ... mortal person has ... ever had ... this much power. Ever. It's like I, I'm connected to everything ... I can feel ... it feels like ... I ... I can feel...
WILLOW ...everyone. Oh. Oh my God. All the emotion. All the pain. No, it, it's too much. It's just too much.
GILES Willow ... It doesn't have to be ... like that. You ... you can stop it.
WILLOW Yeah. I, I can. I have to stop this. I'll make it go away.
GILES Willow...
WILLOW Oh, you poor bastards!
WILLOW Your suffering has to end.
GILES No....
XANDER Ow. Ow.
JONATHAN Ow! Son of a bitch!
ANDREW Buttwipe!
JONATHAN I wasn't talking to you.
ANDREW Oh. Reflex.
XANDER Man, they've really tightened security up here lately. One too many squatters from the Hellmouth.
ANDREW Hide out in the cemetery. What a fantastic idea.
XANDER Yeah, I'm working on a whole shut the hell up pitch you might like too.
DAWN Xander?
XANDER I've had just about as much as I can stand baby-sitting a couple of social retards who don't appreciate-
DAWN Xander!
XANDER What?
DAWN What is that?
BUFFY Get out of there!
BUFFY Move!
BUFFY Dawn! Dawn, hold on.
JONATHAN Mexico, huh?
ANYA Giles.
ANYA Giles!
GILES Anya.
ANYA I'm so sorry. Willow forced me to free her with her brain. Are you okay?
GILES I can see...
ANYA Oh. It's a ... miracle.
GILES Willow ... I can see her. She took the magic I had and ... now ... I know where she is. I can feel what ... Oh, God.
ANYA Giles ... you have to rest.
GILES Silly girl. I'm dying.
ANYA No you're not.
GILES It was ... It was the only way. I thought we ... there'd be a chance ... now ... I know where Willow is. She's going to finish it.
ANYA Finish what?
GILES The world.
DAWN Buffy!
DAWN Are you okay?
BUFFY We have to get out of here. Xander!
DAWN I think I saw him hit his head.
BUFFY Xander!
DAWN This looks a little like Spike's place. You know, under his crypt.
DAWN What are you doing?
BUFFY If we can pull these out, we can use the coffins for height. Maybe get out of here!
DAWN Maybe one of the tunnels Spike uses is around here. Uh, we could use it to get to his place.
BUFFY That's the last place on Earth we need to be.
DAWN Oh, but it was good enough for you to take me there after what he did to you.
BUFFY What he...
DAWN Tried to do. Whatever.
BUFFY Xander.
DAWN So it's true?
BUFFY Dawn, you may not have noticed, we're in really big trouble here. This isn't-
DAWN Why did you not tell me?
BUFFY Because you didn't need to know.
DAWN Yes, I do. I need to know! I'm not a kid anymore.
BUFFY Dawn, I'm trying to protect you.
DAWN Well, you can't! Look around, Buffy. We're trapped in here! Willow's killing and people I love keep dying! And you cannot protect me from that.
BUFFY Dawn...
XANDER Hello?
BUFFY Xander?
XANDER Buffy, you okay? Where's Dawn?
DAWN Here.
BUFFY Are Jonathan and Andrew up there with you?
XANDER No, they musta skedaddled when I was out. Weasels. Whoa!
BUFFY Xander, you've gotta find some kind of rope or something and get us out of here.
XANDER Right. Okay, I'll, uh, I'll take a look around.
BUFFY And hurry up before-
ANYA Holy frijole!
BUFFY Anya! What are you doing here? Where's Giles?
DAWN Giles?
ANYA He's still at the magic shop.
DAWN Giles is back? You didn't tell me that.
BUFFY Did he stop Willow?
ANYA No. And things just got a whole lot worse.
BUFFY How worse?
ANYA End of the world worse. Willow's going to destroy it.
DAWN She can do that?
ANYA She can and she will when she gets to where she's going.
BUFFY Where's she going?
ANYA Big old Satanic temple. Kingman's Bluff?
BUFFY There's ... no temple on Kingman's Bluff.
BUFFY Proserpexa?
BUFFY Who's she?
ANYA Uh, way up there in the hierarchy of she-demons. Her followers intended to use her effigy to destroy the world. They all died when the temple got swallowed up in the big earthquake of '32.
BUFFY So now seventy years later, Willow's going to make their dreams come true.
ANYA She's going to drain the planet's life force, and funnel its energy through Proserpexa's effigy and, and burn the Earth to a cinder.
BUFFY Not if I can help it.
ANYA You can't.
BUFFY What does that mean?
ANYA Don't know. He, he said, the Slayer can't stop her, and then he said a bunch of other stuff. He really wasn't too clear.
BUFFY Anya, what are you-
ANYA I ... I should get back to him. He's alone.
BUFFY Is he okay?
ANYA Don't think he ... has a lot of time left. I'm sorry.
BUFFY Xander! Where is that rope?!
DAWN Buffy...
BUFFY Xander! Where is he?
DAWN You heard what Anya said ... you hear what Giles said.
BUFFY I heard. And I don't care, I have to try...
WILLOW From the pit of forgotten shadows...
BUFFY I'm not just gonna sit here while Willow incinerates what I'm chosen to protect.
WILLOW Awaken, sister of the dark, awaken-
BUFFY I have to stop her.
WILLOW Always the Slayer...
WILLOW Right to the last.
BUFFY Willow?
WILLOW And it is the last, you know? For all your fighting ... thinking you're saving the world...
DAWN Buffy?
WILLOW And in the end ... I'm the only one that can save it.
BUFFY By killing us?
WILLOW It's the only way to stop the pain.
WILLOW I can't take it anymore. But I know you, Buffy.
WILLOW You're a warrior. You won't go out without a fight. I don't really have time for one. But you should go out fighting.
BUFFY Willow, what are you-
WILLOW It was me that took you out of the Earth. Well, now...
WILLOW ...the Earth wants you back.
DAWN Buffy!
BUFFY They just keep coming. I can't take them all.
BUFFY Dawn. Will you help me?
DAWN I got your back.
WILLOW Proserpexa ... let the cleansing fires from the depths burn away the suffering souls and bring sweet death.
BUFFY Willow...
ANYA Giles? Giles! Don't die. Not yet, there-there are things I wanna tell you.
ANYA Thanks a lot for coming. It was good of you to teleport all this way.
ANYA Though in retrospect, it probably would have been better if you hadn't come and given Willow all that magic that made her like ten times more powerful. That would have been a plus.
XANDER Hey, black-eyed girl. Whatcha doin'?
WILLOW Get out of here.
XANDER Ah, no. You're not the only one with powers, you know. You may be a hopped-up uber-witch, but ... this carpenter can dry-wall you into the next century.
WILLOW I'm not joking, Xander. Get out of my way. Now.
GILES There...
ANYA What?
GILES It's not over.
BUFFY Dawn! I'm coming!
DAWN What? You think I never watched you?
WILLOW You can't stop this.
XANDER Yeah, I get that. It's just, where else am I gonna go? You've been my best friend my whole life. World gonna end ... where else would I want to be?
WILLOW Is this the master plan? You're going to stop me by telling me you love me?
XANDER Well, I was going to walk you off a cliff and hand you an anvil, but ... it seemed kinda cartoony.
WILLOW Still making jokes.
XANDER I'm not joking. I know you're in pain. I can't imagine the pain you're in. And I know you're about to do something apocalyptically evil and stupid, and hey. I still want to hang. You're Willow.
WILLOW Don't call me that.
XANDER First day of kindergarten. You cried because you broke the yellow crayon, and you were too afraid to tell anyone. You've come pretty far, ending the world, not a terrific notion. But the thing is? Yeah. I love you. I loved crayon-breaky Willow and I love ... scary veiny Willow. So if I'm going out, it's here. If you wanna kill the world? Well, then start with me. I've earned that.
WILLOW You think I won't?
XANDER It doesn't matter. I'll still love you.
WILLOW Shut up.
XANDER I love you.
XANDER I ... love y-
WILLOW Shut up!!
XANDER I love you, Willow.
WILLOW Stop!
XANDER I love you.
WILLOW Stop.
XANDER I love you.
DAWN What happened?
ANYA Giles!
ANYA You're not dead!
GILES No.
GILES However, I am still in some pain.
ANYA Oh... Well ... why aren't you dead? Why aren't I dead?
GILES Uh, the threat's gone. Willow's been stopped.
ANYA Oh. You mean she's-
GILES No, she's alive. It, uh ... the magic she took from me, it-it did what I hoped it would do.
ANYA Oh. You dosed her.
GILES Yes.
ANYA You knew she'd going to take your powers all along.
GILES The gift I was given by the coven was the true essence of magic. Willow's magic came from a ... place of rage and power.
ANYA And vengeance. Don't forget vengeance.
GILES Oh. How could I? In any case, the magic she took from me tapped into ... the spark of humanity she had left. Helped her to feel again. Gave Xander the opportunity to ... reach her.
ANYA Xander?
GILES Yes. It was he who got to her in time. He saved us all.
DAWN I ... I think it's over, Buffy. The world's still here.
DAWN Sorry to disappoint y-
DAWN Wait, is ... is that happy crying?
BUFFY Yes, dummy. You think I wanted the world to end?
DAWN I don't know. Didn't you?
BUFFY Dawn ... I'm so sorry.
BUFFY I'm sorry.
DAWN It's okay, Buffy. It's okay.
BUFFY No. It hasn't been. It hasn't been okay.
BUFFY But it's gonna be, though. I see it.
DAWN See what?
BUFFY You.
BUFFY Things have really sucked lately, but it's all gonna change. And I wanna be there when it does. I want to see my friends happy again. And I want to see you grow up. The woman you're gonna become. Because she's gonna be beautiful.
BUFFY And she's going to be powerful.
BUFFY I got it so wrong. I don't want to protect you from the world. I want to show it to you.
BUFFY There's so much that I want to show you.
DEMON_VOICE You have endured the required trials.
SPIKE Bloody right I have.
SPIKE So you'll give me what I want. Make me what I was. So Buffy can get what she deserves.
DEMON Very well.
DEMON We will return...
DEMON ...your soul.
