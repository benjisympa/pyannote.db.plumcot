GILES Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer:
WILLOW Tara? Oh, God!
WARREN Somebody!
ANYA Things just got worse.
BUFFY How worse?
ANYA End of the world worse. Willow's going to destroy it.
XANDER I love you
BUFFY Things really sucked lately. Things are going to change. And I'm going to be there when it does.
SPIKE Make me what I was.
DEMON We will return your soul.
BUFFY It's about power.
BUFFY Who's got it. Who knows how to use it. So...
BUFFY Who's got the power, Dawn?
DAWN Well, I've got the stake.
BUFFY The stake is not the power.
DAWN But he's new. He doesn't know his strength. H-he might not know all those fancy martial arts skills they inevitably seem to pick up.
BUFFY Who's got the power?
DAWN He does.
BUFFY Never forget it. Doesn't matter how well prepped you are or how well armed you are. You're a little girl.
DAWN Woman.
BUFFY Little woman.
DAWN I'm taller than you.
BUFFY He's a vampire, OK? Demon. Preternaturally strong. Skilled with powers no human could possibly ever
VAMPIRE Excuse me. I think I'm stuck.
BUFFY You're stuck?
VAMPIRE My foot's caught on a root or something, and... I don't even know how I got down there. If you girls could just give me a hand...
DAWN Hm. So, he's got the power?
BUFFY Zip it.
VAMPIRE I really appreciate it. It's just it's so dark, and I don't even know what I'm doing here.
VAMPIRE Whoa. Ooh. Thanks. That was a help. Unfortunately it was the last
VAMPIRE thing you'll ever do.
BUFFY Listen up. I'm the slayer. You don't want to get into it with me. You want blood? You can have hers.
BUFFY Power. He's got it. He's going to use it. You don't have it, so 
BUFFY use that. Perfect.
DAWN Buffy!
BUFFY It's real. It's the only lesson, Dawn. It's always real. Let me see.
DAWN It's nothing, it's just a scrape. Plus, I had a plan the whole time.
BUFFY Really?
DAWN Yeah, I planned to get killed, come back as a vampire, and bite you.
BUFFY You wanted to be trained.
DAWN Well, just the next time when you're gonna disa
BUFFY You did pretty well.
DAWN I did?
BUFFY Yeah.
DAWN 'Cause, you know, with the whole rolling thing, I was actually using his strength, and it was very tai chi. Plus I nearly got the heart.
BUFFY My first time out, I missed the heart too.
DAWN No way.
BUFFY Just the once.
DAWN Well, the next vampire I meet
BUFFY The next vampire you meet, you run away. I just wish that was all we had to worry about. Vampires, demons... they're nothing compared to what's coming.
DAWN I know. I just can't believe it's back.
BUFFY Believe me, I thought I was long past it. I guess you never are. Just a few more days 'til it starts. Then we'll never know what's coming next.
PRINCIPAL It is my great pleasure and privilege to announce the official openingon the very ground that it first stood uponof the brand new state of the art Sunnydale High!
GILES That doesn't belong there.
WILLOW No, it doesn't.
GILES That's the flora kua alaya. A native of Paraguay, if my botany serves.
WILLOW Is there anything you don't know everything about?
GILES Synchronized swimming. Complete mystery to me.
GILES Yep. Paraguay. Where does it come from?
WILLOW Paraguay.
GILES Who brought it through the Earth?
WILLOW It's all connected. The root systems, the molecules...the energy. Everything's connected.
GILES You sound like Miss Hartness.
WILLOW She's taught me a lot.
GILES Then why aren't you in your lesson?
WILLOW Sorry.
GILES It's alright. She was just
WILLOW afraid. Yeah, they all are. The coven isthey're the most amazing women I've ever met. But there's this look that they get. Like I'm gonna turn them all into bangers and mash, or something. Which I'm not even really sure what that is.
GILES They're cautious. I trust you understand that.
WILLOW I don't have that much power, I don't think.
GILES Everything's connected. You're connected to a great power, whether you feel it or not.
WILLOW Well you should just take it from me.
GILES You know we can't. This isn't a hobby or an addiction. It's inside you now, this magic. You're responsible for it.
WILLOW Will they always be afraid of me?
GILES Maybe. Can you handle it?
WILLOW I deserve a lot worse. I killed people, Giles.
GILES I've not forgotten.
WILLOW When you brought me here, I thought it was to kill me or to lock me in some mystical dungeon for all eternity orwith the torture. Instead, you go all Dumbledore on me. I'm learning about magic. All about energy and Gaia and root systems.
GILES Do you want to be punished?
WILLOW I wanna be Willow.
GILES You are. In the end, we all are who we are, no matter how much we may appear to have changed.
BUFFY Dawn! Xander's here.
DAWN Just a minute.
BUFFY You're going to be late.
DAWN I'm comfortable with that.
XANDER G'morning!
BUFFY Well, you gotta eat something. I made cereal.
DAWN OK.
BUFFY You're unconscionably spiffy.
XANDER Client meeting. How exactly do you make cereal?
BUFFY Ah, you put the box near the milk. I saw it on the food channel. Want something?
XANDER I ate. I'm good. How are you?
BUFFY My sister's about to go to the same high school that tried to kill me for three years. I can't change districts, I can't afford private school, and I can't begin to prepare for what could possibly come out of there. So, peachy with a side of keen, that would be me.
XANDER Well here's a little something for what ails ya.
BUFFY Mmm. You got the rest.
XANDER Take a look.
DAWN Hey. Check out double-O Xander.
BUFFY Go. Talk with your mouth full.
XANDER I've got two crews working on this diabolical yet lucrative new campus. One here finishing the Science building. And one here, reinforcing the Gym. There are no pentagrams, no secret passageways. Everything's up to code and safe as houses.
BUFFY Nothing creepy? Strange? From beyond?
DAWN Maybe you're just paranoid.
XANDER Well, there is one interesting detail. I managed to scare up the plan from the old high school. You remember the very center of Sunnydale's own hell mouth?
BUFFY Under the library.
XANDER Right. So I lined up the plans, new and old. And right exactly where the library was, we now have...
BUFFY Principal's office.
DAWN So the principal's evil?
BUFFY Or in a boatload of danger.
XANDER Well the last two principals were eaten. Who would even apply for that job?
BUFFY Guess we'll see. Ooh, we have to leave though. You have everything? Books, lunch, stakes?
DAWN Checked thrice.
XANDER Did you give her the...
BUFFY No, I was saving it.
DAWN What is it?
BUFFY Back to school gift.
DAWN It's a weapon, isn't it?
BUFFY Yes, it is.
BUFFY I'm gonna take her to class, have a look around.
XANDER OK. I'm gonna be on-site here all day, so if you have any needs...
BUFFY Now, remember, if you see anything strange... or, you know...dead.
DAWN I got it
BUFFY And stay away from hyena people, or any lizard-type athletes, you know, or if you see anyone that's invisible.
DAWN Hey, Buffy, I think it's pretty safe to say I'm not going to see anybody that's invisible.
BUFFY You know, you could still drop out. Only nerds finish high school.
DAWN You know, I don't really think it's fair for you to try and scare me on my first day of high school. 'Cause it is so redundant.
BUFFY The place is evil.
PRINCIPAL Tough to let 'em go, huh?
BUFFY Hi.
PRINCIPAL I'm Robin Wood. New principal.
BUFFY Oh, uh, Buffy Summers. This is Dawn.
PRINCIPAL Nice to meet you.
DAWN Hi.
BUFFY So you're the new principal. I expected you to be more... aged.
PRINCIPAL Huh. You seem a bit young to have such a gown-up daughter.
BUFFY Oh. Uh, uh, no. Sister.
PRINCIPAL Oh, right, um, of course.
BUFFY You didn't really think she's my... it's my hair. I have mom hair.
DAWN No...
PRINCIPAL I actually have heard of you, Miss Summers. Graduated from the old high school, am I right?
BUFFY Uh, yeah. How did you?
PRINCIPAL Well, I better get back to work. Gotta start deadening young minds. It's really nice to meet you. You have fun.
BUFFY That was suspicious.
DAWN You betcha. Bye.
BUFFY Oh, Dawn
DAWN I know! You never know what's coming. The stake is not the power. To Serve Man is a cookbook. I love you. Go away.
TEACHER OK. I'm Mr. Lonegrin. Why don't we go around the room and introduce ourselves, hmm? Let's start with...
BUFFY It's not mom hair.
DEAD_GIRL You can't protect her. You couldn't protect me.
DEAD_JANITOR Get out. Get out. Get out!
DAWN I love to dance. I like music. I'm very into Britney Spears' early work, before she sold out. So mostly her, um, finger painting and macaroni art. Very underrated. Favorite activities include not ever having to do this again, and uh...
BUFFY Dawn!
DAWN What?
BUFFY We have to go. It's not safe.
DAWN But...
BUFFY We, um. I mean I saw...
TEACHER Can I help you?
BUFFY No, I uh. Dawn, I just thought you were, um, in danger... of smoking. I'll be around.
DAWN I also have a sister.
DUET You've done for me everything I have ever dreamed. You are a miracle in my eyes? How do I ever say to you...
ANYA God, they're depressing.
HALFREK Oh, who are they kidding with this happy, shiny crap?
DUET Everyone I have ever...
ANYA Six weeks tops and she's calling on me for vengeance.
HALFREK Oo-ooh, he better run for cover.
ANYA What's that supposed to mean?
HALFREK Oh, sweetie. You know exactly what it means.
ANYA Excuse me?
HALFREK It's the talk of the order. They're calling you Miss Softserve. Tell me you don't know this.
ANYA But...who?
HALFREK Listen, Anya. I know I've always been a little competitive with you. I mean, there was that thing in the Crimean War. We laugh about it now. But the fact is, I've actually always looked up to you. You were the single-most hard-core vengeance demon on the roster, and everybody knew it. Do I have to mention Mrs. Cholgash?
ANYA Hmm. Ha. Good times.
HALFREK And then you lost your powers. It happens, and you fell for this Xander guy.
ANYA It was a glitch. A summer thing. I am so back in the vengeance fold.
HALFREK No deaths. No eviscerations. You're not goading women into anything inventive, and you're not delivering when it is.
ANYA I don't even know
HALFREK Waitress downtown wished her husband was a frog? You made him French.
ANYA Hmph, he's smelly and with a little mustache. She
HALFREK Listen, Anya, if it was just me
ANYA What do you mean if it was just you?
HALFREK D'Hoffrin. The lower beings. They're all feeling the heat. Something's rising. Something older than the old ones, and everybody's tail is twitching. This is a bad time to be a good guy.
ANYA Well, what is thisan intervention? Shouldn't all my demon friends be here?
HALFREK Sweetie... they are.
XANDER So, how's it looking? Does the place pass inspection?
BUFFY Oh, it's great... if you're a zombie ghost thing!
XANDER So school's back in session, huh?
BUFFY Seems like old times.
XANDER So, zombies or ghosts?
BUFFY I'm not sure. They were in the mirror, but they disappeared. Um, but they touched me, I think. Well, let's just start with dead and pissed.
XANDER They were after you personally?
BUFFY They talked about protecting people. Told me to leave.
XANDER No damage, though.
BUFFY I think I may have destroyed Dawn's social life in all of about 30 seconds, but apart from that, no.
XANDER Ah, being popular isn't so great. Or so I've read in books.
BUFFY This isn't a coincidence, you know, the school being rebuilt. It means something.
XANDER As in what?
NERD Could I borrow a pencil?
DEAD_NERD Thanks a lot.
TEACHER Are you all right?
DAWN I'm sorry. There was... a... a bee. It flew in my eye. I'm very allergic.
TEACHER I think it's gone.
DAWN Can I go to the bathroom?
TEACHER Of course.
PRINCIPAL Whoa.
BUFFY Ooh, sorry.
PRINCIPAL Miss Summers. I didn't know you were still about.
BUFFY Uh, yeah, I was just looking for
PRINCIPAL I thought in general it was customary for a person who's graduated to, um, you know, go somewhere else.
BUFFY Well, it's a new campus. I'm just getting to know it. You know, make sure it's safe for my sister.
DAWN Hey. What's wrong?
KIT There's someone in here.
DAWN It's only me.
KIT No, it's not.
PRINCIPAL You know, I, um, have to be honest. I actually know a little bit more about you than I let on before.
BUFFY Isn't that interesting.
PRINCIPAL Oh, it really is.
DAWN Let's get you out of here, OK? Maybe we can get some air. I'm Dawn.
KIT Kit.
DAWN Saw something pretty creepy, huh?
KIT You wouldn't believe me.
DAWN I kinda sorta think I will. Was there a pencil involved in any
WILLOW Oh, God.
GILES Just breathe.
WILLOW I can't. God!
GILES Just breathe.
WILLOW What happened?
GILES What do you remember?
WILLOW We were talking and I felt...
WILLOW I felt the Earth. It's all connected. It is, but it's not all good and pure and rootsy. There's deep, deep black. There's... I saw, I saw the Earth, Giles. I saw its teeth.
GILES The hell mouth.
WILLOW It's gonna open. It's gonna swallow us all.
KIT Hey. Hey, wake up. Please wake up.
DAWN Oh, oh, God, uh... Are you OK?
KIT We have to leave.
DAWN You're not wrong. C'mon. There's got to be a staircase.
PRINCIPAL The school board recommended I spend a little time reading your record. It's, um, quite a page-turner. Kind of a checkered past...
BUFFY Huh. More like a plaid. Kind of a clan tartan of badness, really. You know, but there were factors.
DAWN What did you see when I found you in the stall?
KIT A girl. She said she died here, and that everybody dies here, and that we would too.
DAWN Here I was worried about not fitting in.
CARLOS Who are you?
KIT Who are you?
DAWN Are you dead?
CARLOS Stop saying that!
DAWN Whoa. We're not dead. We saw creepy dead people, and we're just trying to get out.
CARLOS I just came down here for a smoke, you know, and I saw... it was a janitor. He was yelling at me. I thought he was just pissed, but... I saw him in the light.
DAWN Wait, you came downstairs? Where?
CARLOS Man, I got no clue. I ran away like a girl. I don't know this place at all.
DAWN OK, so we can run around in circles, or...
DEAD_JANITOR Do you really think you can run away?
KIT It's not real.
DAWN Lesson one: it's always real.
DEAD_NERD I tried to run too.
DEAD_GIRL I tried to scream. Doesn't matter how much you scream, nobody ever hears you.
DAWN Hear me. Right. Ooh. I got a present.
KIT What is it?
DAWN A weapon.
PRINCIPAL Well, it's clear your sister looks up to you, which I think is great.
BUFFY No, she's much, much worse than me. Troublemaker. Expulsion is really the only way to go. You know, or you can suspend her for... three years.
PRINCIPAL Well, how 'bout we give her a chance first. Just as long as she keeps her grades up, and
BUFFY Boy, that's loud.
PRINCIPAL That's a part of the reason we don't allow cell phones in
BUFFY Excuse me. Yeah. Oh, sorry. My dog. Uh, dog walker. Three dead?
PRINCIPAL Oh, my God!
BUFFY Uh, no, I'll be right there.
PRINCIPAL Your dogs are dead?
DAWN And, Buffy? Isn't this reception amazing? I'm in the freakin' basement!
BUFFY OK. Sorry about that. II have to ...
PRINCIPAL Yeah. No, of course. And good luck with that...dog tragedy.
DAWN Help is on the way, you guys. We've just got to figure out
DAWN Where did they go?
BUFFY Dawn!
BUFFY Dawn? I'm close by.
DEAD_JANITOR Too late. But then, you're always too late, aren't you? Sure as hell didn't save me.
BUFFY Where's my sister?
DEAD_JANITOR I think she's lost.
BUFFY If I'm the one who let you die, why take it out on her? I'm right here. C'mon, what're you after? Fear? Revenge? Tasty brains?
DEAD_NERD I think I'd like Dawn to be my girlfriend.
BUFFY Again, wrong sister. I'm the one that dates dead guys. And, no offense, but they were hotties. I mean, I'm sure you had a great personality, but...
DEAD_GIRL Busy making out with your dead boyfriend while I was ripped to death by a werewolf? Is that why you let me die?
DEAD_NERD I was screaming for help when they pulled me down
BUFFY Hello! Not making myself clear. I don't care how you died. I'm sorry for your loss, but where is my sister? Dawn!
DEAD_JANITOR She's not gonna hear you. This place is like a maze.
DEAD_GIRL This place is ours now. It was built on our graves.
DEAD_JANITOR All we want is for you to leave so we can rest again.
BUFFY Actually, I'm thinking all you want is to get between me and that door. Who's for finding out why.
BUFFY If at first you don't succeed...
BUFFY ... cheat!
BUFFY Dawnie, we have to get o
BUFFY Spike? Are you real?
SPIKE Buffy, duck.
BUFFY What? Duck? There's a duck?
SPIKE No visitors today. Terribly busy.
DEAD_NERD Told you to get out.
BUFFY He'll probably show up in a sec.
SPIKE Nobody comes in here. It's just the three of us.
BUFFY Spike, have you seen Dawn? She came down here with some kids.
SPIKE Don't you think I'm trying? I'm not fast. I'm not a quick study. I droped my board in the water and the chalk all ran. Sure to be caned. Should've seen that coming.
BUFFY What did you do?
SPIKE I tried... I... tried to cut it out.
BUFFY Dawn?
DAWN Buffy, where are you?
BUFFY I...
BUFFY Look, where are you?
DAWN I don't know. In a room by the furnace. Near where we fell in. They dragged us in here, and then they disappeared.
BUFFY Yeah, they came after me too.
DAWN Well, what do they want?
BUFFY So far, to piss me off.
DAWN Please, tell me it's working.
BUFFY Oh, I'm damage-bound. I just can't figure them. Ghosts can't touch you and zombies can't disappear, so I don't know what
SPIKE Not ghosts.
DAWN Who was that?
BUFFY Hold on. You know what they are?
SPIKE Manifest spirits controlled by a talisman, raised to seek vengeance. A 4-year-old could figure it.
BUFFY Hang tight. I'll find you. These things can hurt you. You can hurt them too. Find a weapon. I'll come for you. Spike, you gonna help me out?
SPIKE This is my home. I belong here. Always been here. Cheers for stopping by.
SPIKE It's in the wall.
BUFFY I'll get back to you.
BUFFY Guys? Resentful dead guys? This can't be good. Come on, manifest spirits, raised up, controlled by a... talisman.
BUFFY Xander...
DAWN We need to find some kind of weapon just to hold them off.
CARLOS I got these.
DAWN Kit, gimme your bag.
KIT Do you think they're gonna come back?
DEAD_GIRL Think they're gonna come back? We never left. We'll always be here. Just like you.
KIT No.
DEAD_GIRL Why do you think we picked you? The ones no one will miss. The ones that don't belong. You spend all your time trying to get out of high school, and now you'll never ever leave.
XANDER Whoa. Contracty goodness. Talisman, talisman.
DEAD_JANITOR You can thank your sister for this.
DAWN Thanks, sis.
BUFFY We just need to keep them at bay.
DAWN The bag!
XANDER Yes! Talisman.
BUFFY Do you really want to keep this up?
DEAD_JANITOR What're you going to do, kill us?
CARLOS Are they gone?
BUFFY Yeah. The talisman must have been destroyed.
DAWN How'd you know it was a talisman?
BUFFY There's always a talisman. The real question is who put it there. C'mon, you guys, let's go find a way upstairs, assuming there is one.
DAWN You really weren't kidding about this place. I guess it hasn't changed.
BUFFY I don't know. Seems smaller.
BUFFY You guys are gonna be OK. School is intense, but you'll do all right as long as you're careful. And you might want to think about sticking together.
KIT Thank you.
CARLOS Yeah, I mean it. You are the coolest mom ever.
DAWN OK. Come on, we still have a few more classes to live through.
PRINCIPAL Curiouser and curiouser.
BUFFY What is?
PRINCIPAL Carlos Trejo and Kit Holburn, right? Possibly the only two students in this school whose files are as thick as yours was.
BUFFY You really did your homework, didn't you?
PRINCIPAL I was looking for one or both of them to actually implode in a fearsome way right before midterms. And now I see that you got 'em socializing and hugging and actually, if I'm not mistaken, headed to class.
BUFFY Well, we shared an... encounter.
PRINCIPAL Look, I know you're probably more than happy to get out of this place. But I gotta tell you, Miss Summers, I think you belong here.
BUFFY Hmm, new?
PRINCIPAL Listen, I know this school's reputation. What, you think I got this job based on seniority? We got a lot of troubled students here, and just enough money to keep this place from caving in.
BUFFY Yeah, you might need a little extra there.
PRINCIPAL Well, we do have a community outreach program. And the money we could pay you... wouldn't even fold. But it would just be a couple of days a week.
BUFFY Are you asking me to be a counselor?
PRINCIPAL Well, we have a guidance counselor, but I was thinking the kids could use someone, you know, closer to their age who still
BUFFY I'm in!
PRINCIPAL What, you serious? Youyou did hear the part about the money, right?
BUFFY Yeah, I heard. My schedule might be a little funtastic, but, uh, I'll work it out. I'd like to keep an eye on this place.
PRINCIPAL Well, that's great. Look at that. It's not even noon, and I've already bullied my first family member into helping out. I'm going to be the best principal ever.
SPIKE The thing is...I had a speech. I learned it all. Oh, God. She won't understand, she won't understand.
MORPHING_MONSTER ...I can be patient. Everything is well within parameters. She's exactly where I want her to be. And so are you, Number 17. You're right where you belong.
MORPHING_MONSTER So what'd you think? You'd get your soul back and everything'd be Jim Dandy? Soul's slipperier than a greased weasel. Why do you think I sold mine? Well, you probably thought that you'd be your own man, and I respect that, but...
MORPHING_MONSTER ...you never will. You'll always be mine. You'll always be in the dark with me, singing our little songs. You like our little songs, don't you? You've always liked them, right from the beginning. And that's where we're going...
MORPHING_MONSTER ...right back to the beginning. Not the Bang... not the Word... the true beginning. The next few months are going to be quite a ride. And I think we're all going to learn something about ourselves in the process. You'll learn you're a pathetic schmuck, if it hasn't sunk in already. Look at you. Trying to do what's right, just like her. You still don't get it. It's not about right, not about wrong...
MORPHING_MONSTER ...it's about power.
