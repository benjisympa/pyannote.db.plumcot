GILES Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer
SPIKE If I'd've known you were coming, I'd've baked a cake.
BUFFY Tell me you love me.
SPIKE I love you.
BUFFY Tell me you want me.
SPIKE I always want you.
SPIKE Do you even like me?
BUFFY It's over.
SPIKE I've memorized this tune, luv.
BUFFY I'm using you... and it's killing me.
XANDER We're getting married.
WILLOW Congratulations.
ANYA Xander's missing? What do you mean Xander's missing!
D'HOFFRIN When you were a vengeance demon, you crushed men like him.
XANDER I wish we could just go back to the way things were before.
ANYA And I wish you were never born.
SPIKE I'm gonna make you feel it.
BUFFY Ah! Stop!
BUFFY Ask me again why I could never love you.
WILLOW Tara? Oh, God!
WARREN Somebody!
XANDER I love you.
SPIKE Make me what I was.
DEMON We will return your soul.
WILLOW When you brought me here, I thought it was to kill me. Instead, you go all Dumbledore on me.
GILES Do you want to be punished?
WILLOW I killed people, Giles.
GILES I've not forgotten.
HALFREK Something's rising. Something older than the old ones, and everybody's tail is twitching. This is a bad time to be a good guy.
PRINCIPAL It is my great pleasure and privilege to announce the official openingon the very ground that it first stood uponof the brand new Sunnydale High!
BUFFY Are you asking me to be a counselor?
BUFFY Spike? What did you do?
SPIKE This is my home. I belong here. Always been here. Cheers for stopping by.
BUFFY I'll get back to you.
GERMAN_GIRL From beneath you, it devours.
BUFFY Ah!
DAWN Buffy! Buffy! Buffy!
BUFFY I heard screaming.
DAWN That was you.
BUFFY There was a girl.
DAWN That would be me.
BUFFY Uh, no. It was...
DAWN Just a dream. It was just a dream, right?
BUFFY From beneath you, it devours. That's what she said, and then they... There's more like her, Dawn. Out there somewhere.
BUFFY And they're gonna die.
SPIKE No, no, no, no, no, no. Now is not the time. You know it. I know it. But making them understand... is a totally different matter. No manners is the problem. Proper breeding. Lack of etiquette. All of it lacking. All of it lost on them.
SPIKE Not the time. Not hardly ready.
SPIKE Stop. Please, mum! Begging now! Make it stop! Oh, God!
SPIKE Ooh! Aaahhhh!
DAWN Could you die? 'Cause, seriously, speaking for everybody who are me in the car right now, we're very excited.
BUFFY Well, I'm glad for all of you then.
DAWN I mean, it's just so cool. You're coming to school with me. You'll be, like, there the whole time. You understand you cannot talk to me, look at me, or hang out with any of my friends, right?
BUFFY Look, I doubt we'll be seeing each other, assuming I even half-understand my fuzzy job description.
DAWN It's not fuzzy. You're, what, dealing with troubled kids?
XANDER At a spanking new Hellmouth High. Please. Outside of drugs and violence and the unwanted pregnancy, and, uh, unleashing of hordes of Armageddon that comes pouring out of the school's foundation every now and then, what trouble could these kids have?
BUFFY Guess I'll find out.
XANDER Those kids are damn lucky having a slayer and a friend on campus there for 'em. I hope they appreciate it. I know I did. Days gone by, huh?
DAWN I thought you hated Sunnydale.
XANDER Yes, and no, with an emphasis on the yes. But, at least then I was dating.
BUFFY You could be dating now.
XANDER Yeah. Um, I don't know what's not clicking for me right now.
BUFFY Well, there's that thing with Anya.
XANDER That leaving her at the altar thing?
BUFFY Yeah, that one. That's not something you bounce right back from.
XANDER Sure it is. She bounced back to being a vengeance demon, and I bounced back to being a dateless nerd.
DAWN Do you guys talk at all?
XANDER I've seen her at the Bronze a couple of times. I guess there's a lot of scorned women there, making vengeance wishes on their exes.
BUFFY I know that's where I go to get my scorn on.
DAWN You guys need to really to ease up with the whole dating demons thing.
BUFFY Uh, hello, I'm sorry. Wasn't that you having the smooch-a-thon with teen vampire last Halloween?
DAWN See, this is why I don't want you talking to my friends. Oh.
PRINCIPAL We'll sort of feel our way around. Some students will be sent to you, and others, I'm hoping, will start to come in on their own.
BUFFY What if they don't? Should I panic?
PRINCIPAL You'll be surprised, Buffy. You're the youngest, and, uh, least stuffy member of this faculty. I think the students are gonna want to come in and talk to you. And when they do, don't evaluate them. Just listen. They need to feel like there's someone around here who actually understands them.
BUFFY Can I give detention?
PRINCIPAL OK by me. A little authority can be a wonderful thing. Just remember that while you are here to help, you're not here to be their friend. Trust me, you open that door, and these students will eat you alive.
BUFFY You heard about Principal Flutie, right?
PRINCIPAL Hmm?
BUFFY Forget it.
PRINCIPAL OK then. And, Buffy, relax. There's only three things these kids understand: the boot, the bat, and the bastinada.
PRINCIPAL It's the... it's a... it's a bad joke. It's the bastinada. No one ever knows what that thing is.
BUFFY Wooden rod to slap the soles of the feet in Turkish prisons, but if made with the correct wood makes an awesome Billy club.
PRINCIPAL I think you're gonna fit in just fine. Is there something else?
BUFFY Um, yeah. Uh, just one more thing. I was, uh, just curious, you know, uhnot that I'm not grateful or anything. But, uh, I guess I was wondering why I
PRINCIPAL Have this job?
BUFFY I still haven't finished college.
PRINCIPAL I know.
BUFFY Was it my sparkling personality? Or maybe you enjoyed my work at the Doublemeat Palace?
PRINCIPAL I'm a vegetarian. These students need someone around here who understands them, and I need someone who understands these students. Why? Is there something about you that I don't know that maybe I should?
BUFFY Nothing I can think of.
PRINCIPAL Oh, if you'll excuse me. First catch of the day. I'll be in my office if you need me.
BUFFY Thanks. I'm just gonna have a look around. Get to know the place. Make sure it's all... school-like.
BUFFY Spike?
BUFFY Spike?
GILES The taxi's here.
WILLOW I know.
GILES And in keeping with a quaint old Birtish tradition, you would now be expected to get into it.
WILLOW I don't know if I can. Giles, I'm not done here.
GILES That's your fear talking.
WILLOW Yes, and my fear's a big, obnoxious blabbermouth. You're the one that keeps telling me to trust my instincts.
GILES True.
WILLOW So, shouldn't we be listening? I don't want to go back home just so I can screw up again. I Why don't I stay? Not forever. Just long enough to, I don't know, make my fear shut up a little, maybe?
GILES It's possible, but... Try to be very specific. What exactly are you afraid of?
WILLOW Well, for starters, how 'bout the hellmouth's getting all rumbly again. And now I know it's got teeth. And are those literal teeth, 'cause I don't know if I can handle it. And what if I can handle it? Does that mean I have to be a bigger, badder badass than the source of all badness? And what if I give up all this control stuff and I go all veiny and homicidal again? And what if
GILES They won't take you back?
WILLOW Uh-huh.
GILES Willow, we could spend another two years here training and practicing and learning to hone your powers and still there'd be no way of knowing for sure that the friends you left behind you are still your friends.
WILLOW Well, sure. I mean, if you put it that way, duh.
GILES I'd love to offer you some guarantee that you'd be welcomed back to Sunnydale with open arms, but I can't. You may not be wanted, but you will be needed.
WILLOW That all you got?
GILES For the moment, yes.
WILLOW OK. I guess I'd better...
GILES Trust yourself, and the others might follow.
NANCY Rocky, come on, do your business so I can go home.
NANCY Could've gotten a cat, but no.
NANCY Ahh!
XANDER Uh, hello?
NANCY And whatever it was, it was big and strong. Stronger than.... I mean, I don't know how it's possible. You hear thing in this town, living here in Sunnydale, but nobody actually believes them. You know, you'd have to be crazy, and... You guys think that I'm crazy, don't you?
XANDER I don't.
BUFFY We've seen things, too, Nancy.
XANDER And we're going to take care of this. It's your lucky night... considering, you know, your dog just got all ate up and stuff... Hey, can I freshen up your tea?
NANCY No, that's OK. Thanks.
DAWN So, you say this thing just came up out of the ground without any warnings or signs or anything?
NANCY Just this kind of rumbling, you know, like just before an earthquake.
BUFFY From beneath you, it devours.
NANCY What?
BUFFY Nothing.
DAWN Nothing good.
XANDER Sounding monster-ific, all right.
DAWN Should we round up the gang?
XANDER Good thinking, except... this is the gang.
BUFFY Look, Nancy, we're going to get into this. And I promise you, if your dog is alive, we're going to find him. The only thing that I need is a little
SPIKE What you need is help. Fortunately, you've got me.
SPIKE Buffy.
BUFFY Spike.
NANCY Who is that?
DAWN He's... it's Buffy's...
XANDER Ex.
NANCY And I'm thinking it's a little more complicated than just that.
XANDER Always is.
BUFFY You've changed.
SPIKE I have.
BUFFY New clothing. Better hair. Not so much with the crazy. I like it. Now what do you want?
SPIKE Easy. If you think I like putting myself here, surrounded by people who don't particularly like me, you'd be wrong.
XANDER If you're uncomfortable, we can make you leave.
SPIKE I'll be quick. We need to talk. Want to do that here, or privately?
XANDER I'm thinking here, in the company of good friends and pointy weapons.
BUFFY You said something about quick?
SPIKE I did. Before I start, and for the record, the last you saw me, I was a messout of my head, admitted. Last week, living in the school basement, well, you saw me.
DAWN You did?
BUFFY Guys, just a second, OK. Yes, I saw Spike. I just didn't
DAWN What? You just forgot to mention it?
BUFFY Things were insane in the basement. I saved your life. We can discuss this later.
DAWN Sure.
XANDER Whatever you want.
DAWN Right. 'Cause that seems to be the only time you let us in, Buffy. Whenever you want.
SPIKE Now, in fairness to Buffy
XANDER Shut up, Spike!
BUFFY . OK, guys. Give us a second.
BUFFY Do not start by saying you're sorry.
SPIKE I didn't come here to atone.
BUFFY Then what the hell do you want?
SPIKE I'm here to help you.
BUFFY Help me what?
SPIKE I was hoping you'd tell me. You're the slayer. Connected to the visions. Long line of worthies, right? I'm just a guy with his ear to the ground, and even I can feel it. Something's coming. I don't know what exactly, but something's brewing. And it's so big, ugly and damned it makes you and me look like little bitty puzzle pieces. I mean, if I'm wrong, say so. Lovely. No hard feelings. I'll go out that door and you can lock it behind me with any spell you like. So, am I wrong?
BUFFY Everything about you is wrong, Spike.
BUFFY But something is coming.
SPIKE You're gonna need some help.
BUFFY Since when did you become the champion of the people?
SPIKE I didn't. I'm just a guy who can lend a hand, if you'll let me. Ball's in your court, slayer.
BUFFY OK, we're gonna split. Two pairs. Whatever this creature is, it's burrowing through solid ground. That means a strength and power that we don't usually deal with, but we may have to get used to now that the hellmouth is getting all perky.
NANCY Shouldn't we call the police, or something?
XANDER And tell them...?
NANCY I'll stop interrupting.
BUFFY Xander, take Nancy home. Drive, don't walk, and try not to stop 'til you get there.
NANCY Is your girlfriend always this... commanding?
XANDER Who? Buffy? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. See, uh, I mean, she's a girl, and she's a friend, but she's not my girlfriend.
DAWN Xander...
DAWN ...a little drool.
BUFFY Spike and I will check out the scene.
XANDER OK, in the biggest way, I am not loving this plan. I am not loving Spike. He tried to rape you.
BUFFY And he failed. I know I can take him. Xander, take Nancy home. Spike and I will patrol.
DAWN I'm command central, so everybody check in with me. OK, I'll be here doing my homework, but the other one sounded cooler.
BUFFY Be safe. Let's go.
SPIKE Righty-o, then.
DAWN Spike. You sleep, right? You. Vampires. You sleep.
SPIKE Yeah. What's your point, niblet?
DAWN Well, I can't take you in a fight or anything, even with a chip in your head. But you do sleep. If you hurt my sister at all... touch her... you're gonna wake up on fire.
SPIKE You're awfully quiet.
BUFFY Wouldn't know what to say.
SPIKE Fine with me. I was more half-expecting to get an earful anyway. And when exactly did your sister get unbelievably scary?
BUFFY What are you doing?
SPIKE What? I told you once, straight up, I'm here to help, and that's all.
SPIKE Think this here is our spot?
BUFFY How'd you guess?
SPIKE I don't fancy sticking my head in there.
BUFFY Well, if something bites it off, that'd be a clue.
BUFFY So, what happened to you?
SPIKE When you saw me. Those ghostly types in the school basement got in my head. Made me flat-out, bug-shaggin' crazy. And I'm not exactly braggin' about it, but they were stronger than I was. Made me see things, do things.
SPIKE And how come you never told anyone that you saw me?
BUFFY I don't know. I guess I was partly hoping you were some kind of mirage.
SPIKE Sorry to disappoint.
BUFFY Not your fault.
SPIKE Hold the torch, would you?
BUFFY Look, this... us working togetherit's not a way for us to get back together, if that's what you want.
SPIKE It's not. Look, I can't blame you for being all skittish.
BUFFY Skittish? That's not a word I would use for it. You tried to rape me. I don't have the words.
SPIKE Neither do I. I can't say sorry. Can't use forgive me. All I can say is: Buffy, I've changed.
BUFFY I believe you.
SPIKE Well, that's something.
BUFFY I just don't know what you've changed into. You come back to town. You make with the big surprises. Twice. I don't know what your game is, Spike, but I know there's something you're not telling me.
SPIKE You're right. There is. But we're not best friends anymore, so too bad for me. I'm not sharing. We've been through things. The end of the world and back. I can be useful 'cause, honestly, I've got nothing better to do. Make use of me if you want.And there's nothing here. Just a bit of slime. Mounds of displaced dirt and such. Whatever our beastie is, he's gone.
NANCY Boy, I still can't believe this is happening. I mean even with this town's reputation for, you know, unexplained weirdness.
XANDER Right. Sunnydale: come for the food, stay for the dismemberment.
NANCY There's good food? Well... Thanks. And that's a couple of levels of lameness right there, me saying thanks after everything you've done for me tonight.
XANDER Well, you could slip me a twenty, but then I'd have to act all offended.
NANCY Got it. So, um, you think I might instead give you a call sometime?
XANDER Just to check in?
NANCY No, actually, I'm hitting on you.
XANDER Even better. I'm very listed.
NANCY And I'm really pushy, so that works out well, then. Good night.
XANDER Uh, Nancy...
XANDER I just got a swell idea... run!
XANDER You OK?
NANCY I just...
XANDER Dumb question. Are you injured? Are you hurt?
NANCY I don't think so. I justI don't think I can take any more of this.
XANDER Two attacks in the same night. I'm starting to think it's not coincidence.
NANCY Oh, sure. Why not? A monster trying to kill me. It's just the thing that was missing to make my life absolutely perfect. Uhh! Ronnie would love this. Boy!
XANDER Right. Who's Ronnie?
NANCY Oh, um, only my psycho ex-boyfriend that I've been trying to get rid of for the past few weeks. I almost prefer the monster. Ronnie was, um... trouble.
XANDER Uh-huh. And I'm just curious. Was this Ronnie guy a borrowing money kind of trouble or was he a raising demon trouble kind of guy?
NANCY Ronnie? He couldn't. He just... he was an abusive bastard is the catchy headline. And he'd just show up, even after... you know the feeling that you get when your ex is constantly ruining every part of your life, and it just doesn't stop?
XANDER Yes.
NANCY And you get so tired of feeling helpless that all you can do is just wish that it would stop?
XANDER Wish?
YOUNG_WOMAN And it's not the fact that he cheated, it's the way he cheated, you know? I mean, we could have talked. I could have handled it.
ANYA Uh-huh. Uh-huh, I get it. Go on.
YOUNG_WOMAN You know what he is? He's spineless. Yeah, that's it. He'she's like this spineless little pig. And you know what I wish?
ANYA God, do I want to.
ANYA You were saying...
YOUNG_WOMAN Um, I want more quesadillas.
ANYA Before that.
YOUNG_WOMAN A margarita.
ANYA After that.
YOUNG_WOMAN Oh, yeah. God, my boyfriend's spineless, and he should justyou know, he should just be spineless for real.
ANYA No spine. Got it. I can do that.
YOUNG_WOMAN What do you mean?
ANYA See, honey, what I'm driving us towards here is sometimes, don't you just wish that Oh, penis!
XANDER Is this the one you talked to?
ANYA I tell you whatwhy don't we put a pin in it? Why don't you get yourself a drink, and we'll pick it up in a few, OK?
ANYA You guys, I am working here.
BUFFY We noticed.
SPIKE That's why we're here.
XANDER Riiiight. Did you turn this nice lady's ex into a giant worm-monster?
ANYA Yes.
NANCY No way. Are you saying that thing was Ronnie?
ANYA You wish it, I dish it. I thought we were clear on this. I didn't think you were going to go all narc on me.
BUFFY You wished your ex was a worm?
NANCY Well, we were just talking.
XANDER Anya has a way of making things happen.
ANYA I had a quota; the guy had it coming. What's the big?
NANCY I think I'm gonna be sick.
BUFFY Anya, that thing you created burst through solid pavement and ate her dog.
ANYA Ooh, puppy!
XANDER Wait, that gets your sad noise? People's lives are in danger, and you give it up for the Yorkie?
ANYA You never understood me, Xander.
NANCY Xander, who is this woman?
XANDER Anya, she's, um, Anya. My ex.
NANCY Oh.
ANYA Hey, nobody's bragging here.
SPIKE Ah, ah, ah...
ANYA Hey, hands off the merchandise. Spike, you don't get to go there again.
SPIKE Please. I've already forgotten about our little time together.
NANCY I thought you were Xander's ex-girlfriend.
ANYA I am.
NANCY But you and Spike...
ANYA Had a thing.
SPIKE Didn't last.
NANCY But weren't you Buffy
SPIKE Briefly.
BUFFY Never serious.
NANCY Is there anyone here that hasn't slept together?
ANYA Look, at least we're all bipeds, which is more than I can say for Ronnie, the worm boy.
BUFFY OK, guys, can we focus here for just a second? Anya, this is Ronnie. OK? He wasn't a worm. Worms are like this big. This thing was like 
SPIKE Sluggoth demon. Am I right?
ANYA Maybe.
NANCY Wait, I didn't wish for that. I mean, I don't even know what this whatchamacallit demon thing is.
SPIKE Sluggoth demon. It's a very large, very nasty, natural predator who died around the crusades.
ANYA Same phylum. It's not cheating, I just embellished.
XANDER Well, you can un-embellish now.
ANYA Bite me, Harris. I have rules to work with. Vengeance demon codes of conduct. But you'll never understand 'cause you're all still so... human.
SPIKE I'm not. Demon, just like yourself, Anya. Now, you're gonna turn the spell around like a good little vengeance demon or I- what?
ANYA Oh, my God!
SPIKE What are you staring at?
ANYA Oh, my God!
SPIKE Right. Let's go.
ANYA How did you do it?
BUFFY Spike, what is she talking about?
ANYA I can see you.
SPIKE Nothing. Let's go. Got some worm hunting to do.
ANYA How did you do it?
SPIKE Shut up.
ANYA You shouldn't be allowed to.
SPIKE Shut your mouth!
ANYA I mean, how did you get it?
SPIKE I said you shut up!
ANYA I am so gonna kick your ass.
SPIKE Right, bitch. Round and round we
BUFFY You haven't changed, Spike.
SPIKE Working out some personal issues, are we? Right you are, luv. I haven't changed. Not a lick. And watching your face trying to figure me out was absolutely delicious.
XANDER Buffy!
BUFFY Not now, Xander.
XANDER Nancy. She's gone. And out there all alone, she's worm bait.
BUFFY I'll go find her. Stay with Anya. Get her to reverse that spell.
SPIKE Hey, is that it? A little touchy-feely, and then you're off to the bat poles?
NANCY Freaks. Why do I always surround myself with freaks?
NANCY Oh, God. Oh, God.
NANCY Help! Somebody help me!
NANCY Oh, help me! Help me!
ANYA What do you want me to do?
XANDER Reverse the spell.
ANYA It's not that easy, Xander.
XANDER You can do it.
ANYA Yeah, sure, the spell part. What about me? I'm in enough trouble as it is. Halfrek's all over my case. D'Hoffrin is not pleased with my work. You don't want to see him angry. Trust me.
XANDER Nice friends you got.
ANYA Nice friends I had. Chums. Coworkers. Bridesmaids. Oh, I had the whole package until something fell apart. What could that be, Xander?
XANDER You saying this was my fault?
ANYA All I'm saying is none of this happened until you dumped me at the altar.
XANDER And sooner or later, Anya, that excuse just stops working.
SPIKE You've had your turn, luv. Leave the real violence to the demons, yeah?
SPIKE That's right. Big bad's back, and looking for a little death!
RONNIE Ow!
SPIKE I'm sorry.
SPIKE Right. Wrong. All wrong. Wrong maneuver. Not hardly helpful.
SPIKE God, please help me. Help me!
BUFFY You're not the one who needs help. He's going into shock.
SPIKE No. No. Too much. Too much. Too much. Too much. Too much. Too much. Too much. ...inside me all the way.
BUFFY Yeah, I need an ambulance. Someone's been stabbed. Oh, God, uh, corner of Third and Fairview. OK, help is coming. Try not to move.
SPIKE Deep, deep, deep inside me.
BUFFY Look, Spike, whatever you're doing
SPIKE Get away. Get. Uhh
BUFFY Do it somewhere else. I am through with this.
SPIKE Oh, oh, lucky girl. Call it quits. Now, there's an option. If only it were so easy. If only If only If only What the hell are you screaming about? I can hear you. No need to SHOUT!
SPIKE I get it. The joke's on me. Lots of laughs. Yeah. Hey, bring the wife and kiddies. Come see the show 'cause it's going to be a circus. This... just the beginning, luv. A warm-up act. The real headliner's coming, and when that band hits the stage, all of this... all this... will come tumbling in death and screaming, horror and bloodshed. From beneath you, it devours. From beneath... Poor Rocky.
XANDER Buffy!
NANCY You. You did this. What are you?
XANDER She's not calling me.
BUFFY OK. Help is on the way. Look after him.
XANDER Where you goin'?
XANDER You did the right thing here.
ANYA Tell him that.
XANDER You reversed the spell. It took guts. I know this is bad, but it could be worse.
ANYA Oh, it will be.
SPIKE Hello.
BUFFY What the hell are you?
SPIKE It didn't work. Costume. Didn't help. Couldn't hide.
BUFFY No more mind games, Spike.
SPIKE No more mind games. No more mind.
BUFFY Tell me what happened to you.
SPIKE Hey, hey, hey! No touching. Am I flesh? Am I flesh to you? Feed on flesh. My flesh. Nothing else. Not a spark. Oh, fine. Flesh then. Solid through. Get it hard; service the girl.
BUFFY Stop it!
SPIKE Right. Girl doesn't want to be serviced. Because there's no spark. Ain't we in a soddin' engine?
BUFFY Spike, have you completely lost your mind?
SPIKE Well, yes. Where've you been all night?
BUFFY You thought you would just come back here and... be with me?
SPIKE First time for everything.
BUFFY This is all you get. I'm listening. Tell me what happened.
SPIKE I tried to find it, of course.
BUFFY Find what?
SPIKE The spark. The missing... the piece that fit. That would make me fit. Because you didn't want... God, I can't... Not with you looking.
SPIKE I dreamed of killing you.
SPIKE I think they were dreams. So weak. Did you make me weak, thinking of you, holding myself, and spilling useless buckets of salt over your... ending? Angelhe should've warned me. He makes a good show of forgetting, but it's here, in me, all the time. The spark. I wanted to give you what you deserve, and I got it. They put the spark in me and now all it does is burn.
BUFFY Your soul.
SPIKE Bit worse for lack of use.
BUFFY You got your soul back. How?
SPIKE It's what you wanted, right? It's what you wanted, right? to hell.
BUFFY Why? Why would you do that
SPIKE Buffy, shame on you. Why does a man do what he mustn't? For her. To be hers. To be the kind of man who would nev to be a kind of man.
SPIKE She shall look on him with forgiveness, and everybody will forgive and love. He will be loved.
SPIKE So everything's OK, right?
SPIKE Cancan we rest now? Buffy...can we rest?
