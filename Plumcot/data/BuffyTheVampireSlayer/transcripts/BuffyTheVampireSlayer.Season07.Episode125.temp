GILES Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer
WILLOW I killed people, Giles.
GILES I've not forgotten.
WILLOW When you brought me here, I thought it was to kill me. Instead, you go all Dumbledore on me.
WILLOW I don't want to go back home just so I can screw up again.
GILES What exactly are you afraid of?
WILLOW What if I go all veiny and homicidal again? And what if
GILES they won't take you back?
XANDER Did you turn this nice lady's ex into a giant worm-monster?
ANYA You wish it, I dish it. I thought we were clear on this.
SPIKE It's what you wanted, right?
BUFFY Tell me what happened.
SPIKE Why does a man do what he mustn't? For her.
BUFFY Your soul. You got your soul back.
HUSBAND Hi. How are you doing?
WIFE Hi, honey. Good.
HUSBAND And how's it going with you two?
DAUGHTERS Hi, Dad.
DAUGHTER Go on. See what you did?
FATHER Hey, stop acting up!
XANDER You think she'll get the sign?
BUFFY Get the sign? I don't think she's gonna see the sign.
DAWN Why is it so pale?
XANDER I used yellow crayon. It was a thing from when I talked to Willow on the bluff. I hope she gets it.
DAWN Oh, tell us again what you said.
XANDER Well, I was talking from my heart and I knew Evil Willow wasn't really ready to You were kidding.
DAWN Mm-hmm. A little bit.
BUFFY We've heard the crayon speech a few times. Not that it's not great, of course.
XANDER I saved the world with talking from my mouth. My mouth saved the world.
DAWN Uh-huh. I'm getting nervous. Are you nervous?
BUFFY Yeah. It's gonna be weird seeing her. What do you say to someone in this situation?
XANDER I'm gonna say Hi, Willow.
BUFFY C'mon. You're saying it's not going to be the least bit strange? We saw her kill someone. She was about to kill Dawn
XANDER And Giles wouldn't let her leave unless she completed that whatever recovery course.
DAWN Right. Right?
BUFFY She kinda didn't finish.
DAWN She didn't finish? She didn't finish being not evil?
BUFFY H-he said it was really important that she come back early and that she was doing really well and we shouldn't worry.
XANDER Guys, I just noticed something. Everyone's off the plane, so where's Willow?
HUSBAND Hi. How are you doing?
WIFE Hi, honey. Good.
HUSBAND And how's it going with you two?
DAUGHTERS Hi, Dad.
DAUGHTER Go on. See what you did?
FATHER Hey, stop acting up!
WILLOW Welcome home, me.
GNARL All alone. Are you frightened to be all alone?
TEEN_BOY Is somebody there?
GNARL The wind talks when you're alone.
TEEN_BOY You better clear out, whoever you are.
WILLOW Buffy? Hello?
WILLOW Dawn? Did I hear the door?
BUFFY They absolutely put her on the plane in London.
XANDER So, she got off in Chicago when they stopped?
DAWN She could've caught a flight anywhere from there.
BUFFY Maybe she doubled back. Got off the plane in London after Giles left.
DAWN Well, if she's doing thatducking Gilesthen, she's evil, right?
XANDER Well, I've avoided Giles tons of times. Just meant I was lazy, not evil.
BUFFY I hope you're right, because defeating Lazy Willowprobably less hard.
DAWN We should check the messages... see if she tried to reach us here.
BUFFY 'S a good idea.
DAWN What was that?
BUFFY Upstairs.
XANDER Willow, is that you?
BUFFY Definitely not up there.
DAWN She didn't leave a message.
BUFFY I checked with Giles again, too. Hasn't heard from her.
XANDER Is he throwing a tasteful British wiggins?
BUFFY Oh, with extra wig. He's blaming himself pretty hard, like he should've known she wasn't ready to come back. I-I kept telling him, you know, it wasn't his fault. Maybe something about us she couldn't face.
XANDER Like she didn't think we were ready to forgive her? I get that.
DAWN So Giles is blaming Giles, and we're blaming us. Is anyone gonna blame Willow? Oh, don't give me shock face. I mean, will anyone around here ever start asking for help when they need it?
BUFFY Look, if Willow flipped out, it's her bad. We can only be here for her so much if she won't be, you know, here.
WILLOW Hello. I'm calling for Giles, uh, Mr. Giles. Right. Council meeting all day. No, no, I know, he can't be reached there. Thanks. Bye.
WILLOW Anya!
WILLOW Anya, don't! Don't run away.
ANYA What are you doing here? I thought you were with Giles studying how to not kill people.
WILLOW I just got back.
ANYA Just got back, as in you're all better, or just got back to bring about a fiery apocalypse of death.
WILLOW Neither, but I-I have been studying, working real hard, and I-I'm gonna be fine.
ANYA Oh. Good. 'Cause I remember the last time you said that. I've spent a lot of time since them cleaning the debris out of my ex-livelihood. Stuff like that.
WILLOW Well, yeah, I wanna help any way I can with that. I-I feel really responsible.
ANYA You feel really responsible? You are really responsible!
WILLOW I-I know I hurt you andand everyone. I'm sorry.
ANYA Here's something you should know about vengeance demons: We don't group with the sorry. We prefer Oh, God, please stop hitting me with my own rib bones.
WILLOW Go on. Say whatever you want. Rib bones and so forth. I-I deserve it.
ANYA Then you won't mind? Well, then, that's no fun.
WILLOW Sorry.
WILLOW So, um, where is everyone these days?
ANYA Well, I'm back in my own apartment. And, of course, vengeance takes me all over the world. I was in Brazil yesterday. They love their soccer.
WILLOW And the others? Dawn, and, uh, Xander, Buffy?
ANYA You haven't seen them?
WILLOW Not so much.
ANYA Huh. I guess they're still mad at you. They've been a little temperamental lately, just between you and me. We had this little mix-up a few days ago, and 
WILLOW That sounds great. So, um, where do you think they'd be?
ANYA Oh, at the new high school, probably. Everyone's all about the high school. Buffy's got some kind of job there helping junior deviants, Spike's insane in the basement, Xander's there doing construction on the new gym
WILLOW Wait, Spike's what in the whatment?
ANYA Insane. Base. Xander does construction. He likes to start early, so he's probably there by now.
WILLOW Xander? Xander, you down there?
BUFFY No skin.
XANDER Tough to look at.
BUFFY And yet my eyes refuse to look away. Stupid eyes.
XANDER I found it first thing this morning. I gave my crew the day off, and I called you right away.
BUFFY I got to get a job where I don't get called right away for this stuff.
XANDER Yeah, I know exactly what you're thinking. Maybe Willow is back.
SPIKE Out! This is my place. You need permission to be here. You need a special slip with a stamp.
WILLOW Spike. My God... I
SPIKE You go off and try to wall up the bad parts and put your heart back in where it fell out. You call yourself finished, but you're not. Worse than ever, you are...
SPIKE You went away. You've been gone since...
WILLOW I needed to go, but I'm back now. And I found... There's a body.
SPIKE Tragedy. Is there blood?
WILLOW Uh, I, Yeah, and I can't find Buffy or Xander or Dawn. And there's this thing killing people. And the victim was... skinned. What could do that?
SPIKE You did it once. I heard about it.
WILLOW Anything otherother than me?
SPIKE Look at you... glowing. What's a word means glowing? Gotta rhyme.
WILLOW Spike?
SPIKE Oh, ah, no. I-I-I should hide. Hide from you. Hide my face. You know what I did.
WILLOW What you did? You didn't do anything... did you?
SPIKE Everyone's talking to me. No one's talking to each other.
WILLOW Spike, please try to listen to me.
SPIKE Someone isn't here. Button, button... who's got the button? My money's on the witch.
XANDER We can't use the blueprints to find our way around down here. It's like the walls move or something.
SPIKE Out! This is my place.
BUFFY I think I hear him.
SPIKE You need permission to be here. You need a special slip with a stamp.
SPIKE ... and put your heart back in where it fell out. You call yourself finished, but you're not. Worse than ever, you are...
BUFFY Spike. Spike.
SPIKE You went away. You've been gone since...
BUFFY The church. You scared me a little. I didn'tI didn't know what to think.
XANDER We're here for a reason, Spike.
SPIKE Tragedy. Is there blood?
XANDER He knows. He must have seen the body.
SPIKE You did it once. I heard about it.
BUFFY Spike, we need to know who did this.
SPIKE Look at you... glowing. What's a word means glowing? Gotta rhyme.
BUFFY Spike, please...
SPIKE I-I-I should hide. Hide from you. Hide my face. You know what I did.
XANDER Boy, he's extra-useful today.
BUFFY This isn't the time.
SPIKE Everyone's talking to me. No one's talking to each other.
BUFFY Might as well go.
SPIKE Someone isn't here. Button, button... who's got the button? My money's on the witch.
SPIKE Red's a bad girl.
BUFFY He's talking about Willow.
XANDER And that means something because he's chock-full-o-sanity.
BUFFY Maybe he saw her.
SPIKE They think you did it. The slayer and her boy. They think you took the skin.
BUFFY Is there something here? Something that killed?
XANDER Her boy? I'm her boy?
SPIKE I have to go. There are things here without permission. I have to check their slips. Make sure they have authorization.
WILLOW I need help.
ANYA I don't have any money.
WILLOW I don't want money.
ANYA Come in. Enjoy my personal space.
WILLOW I found a dead body near the high school.
ANYA Yes, that can happen.
WILLOW Something horrible killed a boy. Took his skin right off.
ANYA_&_WILLOW Was it you? No.
ANYA Well with the skin thing, they're definitely going to think it was you. Buffy is, anyway.
WILLOW Yeah. I mean maybe she already does. I don't know. I justI-I have to find whatever did this. I justI need to do something right.
ANYA Oh, and so they'll think it wasn't you, right? I mean, that has to be part of it. Maybe you're even thinking you kill this thing, they don't even have to know about it. Won't suspect you, even for a minute.
WILLOW No, I-I don't When did you get all insightful?
ANYA I'm surprisingly sensitive.
WILLOW So, will you help me?
ANYA Is it difficult or time-consuming?
ANYA This isn't going to get all sexy, is it?
WILLOW I'd be shocked. OK, do you have your powder?
ANYA Oh, I ate that. I have it.
WILLOW OK, we scatter it over the map, and everywhere there's a demon, a little light appears.
ANYA Oh, pretty! Will it hurt the carpet?
WILLOW No. OK, scatter.
ANYA_&_WILLOW Oh!
ANYA Hey lookthat's me! Hello. What's that huge clump?
WILLOW It's the high school. It's all hellmouthy is underneath.
ANYA Things have been stirring there lately. Is it getting brighter?
WILLOW Smoke!
ANYA Ah! OK. Remember our talk about the carpet?
WILLOW Thi-this could be it. It's strong, it's near the body, and it's all by itself, hiding in the woods or-or maybe cave. There are a couple of good caves around there.
ANYA I don't know. Sounds pretty thin to me.
WILLOW Well, that's why you teleport over there real quick like a bunnreal quick and, uh, see if I'm right.
ANYA No. Sorry. You damaged my carpet.
WILLOW Anya, you're a vengeance demon. Just teleport!
ANYA Well, as it turns out, teleporting isn't a right, it's a privilege. I withdrew a vengeance spell last week, and this is my punishment. I can only teleport for official business. I have to file a flight plan and everything.
WILLOW Oh. I'm sorry. That must be hard.
ANYA Yeah, it bites a pretty big one. And the vengeance itself, i-it's not as fulfilling as I remember.
WILLOW Really? 'Cause I got the impression that you enjoyedyou know, inflicting.
ANYA Well, causing pain sounds really cool, I know, but turns out it's really upsetting. Didn't use to be, but now it is.
WILLOW Is it like you're scared of losing that feeling again. And that having it be OK to hurt people. And then you're not in charge of the power anymore because it's in charge of you?
ANYA Wow, that was really over-dramatically stated, but, yeah, that's it.
WILLOW I get it. Believe me.
ANYA I'm sorry, Willow. I wish it were better for you.
WILLOW You too.
ANYA It did get a little sexy, didn't it?
WILLOW I have to find this monster.
ANYA Willow... um, isn't there another spell? I mean, you're trying to find Buffy and Xander. Couldn't we use a spell to do that?
WILLOW I did. I-I tried, and something went kaflooey, and it didn't work.
ANYA What did it say?
WILLOW It said they don't exist.
DAWN OK, so I looked up demons that skin their victims and demons that flay their victims 'cause, you know, same thing. There's a ton of prospects. Anything else gone? Uh, eyeballs, toenails or viscera? That's guts.
BUFFY She knows about viscera. Makes you proud.
XANDER Just skin.
DAWN OK, I'll work on that.
XANDER What's up?
BUFFY I need to do something. I justI have this feeling in my gut
XANDER In your viscera!
BUFFY that we know exactly who did this. And all of this work that we're doing is just a way for us to convince ourselves that Willow's OK.
DAWN Oh, guys! I got a good one. A demon called Gnarl. He's a parasite with these nasty long fingernails. He secretes something through them and uses that to paralyze his victims. He then cuts strips of their skin while they're still alive. It takes hours.
XANDER We didn't find any strips of skin. Which, by the way, gghhhh!
DAWN You wouldn't. He eats them. That's why he's a parasite. It's like his natural food.
BUFFY Dawn, you're new at this, and I get why you're proud, but I'm not exactly sure why this demon is any more likely than any of the others.
DAWN You never said pool of blood.
BUFFY There was no pool, just splatters.
DAWN Then this is your guy. He laps up the blood. You could say it's like his natural beverage.
XANDER You're terrifying.
DAWN Now if we just knew how to find this thing.
XANDER Well, we could ask some questions over at Willy's place.
BUFFY Or, we could be smart. Sorry, Xander.
XANDER What?
BUFFY W-whoever did this had to get blood on them, which means they left a trail.
DAWN Right, minute traces of blood.
BUFFY And we have a way to track it.
DAWN We have a Oh, I get it.
XANDER What? How? What's going on?
SPIKE William's a good boy. Carries her water, carries her sin. Supposed to get easier, isn't it. Supposed to help to help, but it doesn't. Still so heavy.
XANDER Should've put a leash on him.
BUFFY Yes, let's tie ourselves to the crazy vampire.
XANDER You really think it's gonna work?
BUFFY It's pretty easy. Spike follows the exciting smell of blood, and we follow the fairly ripe smell of Spike.
DAWN It's smellementary. Also, I'm sure there's tons of stuff like this. You know, procedures we can use that don't involve magic spells. Just good solid detective work. And we can develop a database of tooth impressions and demon skin samples and I could wear high heels more often.
BUFFY Wow, that was so close to being empowered.
DAWN Everybody loves a slender ankle.
SPIKE That's it. End of the line. Everyone off. Keep your ticket, you'll need that.
BUFFY That's a rock cliff.
XANDER Well, give him a break, Buffy. Maybe it's a vicious skin-eating rock cliff.
SPIKE There's a cave in it. Look. I'm insane. What's his excuse?
GNARL All alone.
XANDER Dark and dank. I was hoping it'd be dark and dank.
BUFFY Shh! Do you hear that?
XANDER No, I don't. But now I do.
DAWN Something's moving in here.
BUFFY Guess we're in the right place.
GNARL Look at the shorn lamb. See how he trembles. Is it the cold wind? Or is it that the flock is nowhere to be seen?
GNARL Poor little lamb all alone.
DAWN You guys hear that, right?
XANDER Yep.
BUFFY It's echoing. I know it sounds close, but I don't think
BUFFY Dawn! Are you OK?
DAWN I guess so. Poison paralyzes.
BUFFY Dawn. OK, we need to get her out of here. We'll deal with him later. Seal him in.
WILLOW What's going on? Who's there? No! Stop!
GNARL Ha ha ha!
GNARL No way out now. No way out.
WILLOW Protect me, Goddess. In thy name, I supplicate myself. Take the powers from my enemy, and lay him lower than the lowest field.
GNARL Gnarl loves spells. He keeps them as pets. They love him. And they leave him alone.
WILLOW You may be immune to magic, but I've got more than that. You wanna fight?
GNARL Your friends left you here. No one comes to save you. They wanted me to have you.
BUFFY The computer. That thing Dawn was reading might have an antidote for the paralysis.
DAWN Um, Buffy?
BUFFY What?
DAWN I'm really sorry.
BUFFY Oh, it's OK.
XANDER You couldn't help it. It had paralyzing fingernails.
BUFFY Just like you said it would, so good on you.
GNARL Did they leave you as a gifty for me? Are you a tasty little gifty?
WILLOW Stop it!
GNARL Or did they just throw you away?
WILLOW Were they here? Were my friends really here? I heard something.
WILLOW Ah, ah...
GNARL They were here. Here they were. And there they went. Gone, all gone, what a pretty song. They sealed you in with me. I love a gifty. Can't wait to unwrap it.
BUFFY OK, watchwatch the head.
XANDER Gotcha.
DAWN Watch my head. Watch my head!
XANDER Sofa.
DAWN Face up! Face up!
XANDER She's right, face up is better.
BUFFY OK, I'm gonna check the computer. Find that page. See if there's an antidote.
XANDER It'll be all right. We'll get you fixed up. You'll be doing limbo in no time.
DAWN Yeah, as a pole.
XANDER No, not as a pole. I promise.
BUFFY Oh, got it. It says the paralysis is permanent. No, oh, wait, my bad. Permanent until the creature dies. Sorry.
BUFFY Guess we have to go back.
XANDER We can't just leave her here like this. What if she vomits?
DAWN Ew. I won't vomit.
BUFFY Do you think she'll vomit?
DAWN Stop talking about vomit.
BUFFY I'll call Anya. She can watch her.
XANDER Right, she'll love being called for vomit watch.
DAWN Stop talking about vomit.
GNARL Gnarl makes a pretty picture. It's easy when you know how. It's easy when everyone helps. They helped me. Too bad there's no one to help you.
ANYA I bet she's dying.
BUFFY She's not dying. She's just paralyzed.
ANYA Oh. Paralyzed how?
XANDER Paralyzed how? In the not moving way.
ANYA Well, there's lots of different ways. Did you try this?
BUFFY Hey!
DAWN Hey!
XANDER Oh! You're poseable.
BUFFY She's poseable?
ANYA It's a common variety. Watch this.
ANYA Huh. Neat as you please. Hardly a need to undo her.
BUFFY Where'd you get the nuts?
ANYA Brazil. No need to thank me, by the way, for sitting with her. I'm feeling very benevolent today. Helping Willow. Helping you. You might even call it even for that whole worm thing last week.
BUFFY Yeah, I don't think we could call Wait, you saw Willow?
ANYA Um-hmm. Oh, she's looking for you, by the way. Decided you might be out in some cave. Sounded pretty tenuous.
DAWN Cave?
BUFFY Anya, listen. This is really important. Did Willow go to that cave?
ANYA Mm-hmm. Last time I saw her, that's where she was headed. Shall I make her salute? That'd be very cute.
BUFFY Xander, she could be there right now. Willow could be trapped with the Gnarl.
ANYA Uh, it's not The Gnarl, just Gnarl. Oh, wouldn't it be tragic if you were here being kinda silly with your comically paralyzed sister while Willow was dying?
BUFFY Anya, you know about this creature?
ANYA Uh-huh, sure.
BUFFY You're coming with us.
WILLOW They wouldn't leave. They'll return.
GNARL They don't want you. Lock you in, nice white skin... And if they do return, where will the find you? Inside me, you'll already be. Aww... love it.
XANDER Anya, you gotta keep up.
ANYA Uhhh! I'm out of shape. I've been teleporting for months.
BUFFY Hurry!
WILLOW No, no, no...
BUFFY What's going on? Where's Willow?
ANYA She's right here. Can't you see her? She's hurt!
XANDER What? Where? There's nothing here.
ANYA Your handit's going right through her. What's going on?
BUFFY I don't know, but I'm starting to get why we haven't seen her.
XANDER Because we haven't seen her.
BUFFY I have this feeling that whatever's causing this invisible thing is a whole separate issue from the skin-eating monster.
ANYA Behind you!
BUFFY Close one.
ANYA Remember what I said. Get him in the eyes. Willow, I'm here. Wow, you're really hurt.
WILLOW What's going on?
ANYA Buffy's fighting the demon over there, see. But if they get too close, I'm gonna have to run.
WILLOW I don't see.
ANYA But they're here. Buffy and Xander.
WILLOW They came? They didn't leave me?
ANYA No, they didn't leave you. They can't see you.
WILLOW They're here. They're here. I'm not alone.
ANYA Good. You're doing really good.
XANDER Ew. Ew. Thumbs? I can't believe you did that.
ANYA Oh, Buffy killed the demon. It was gross.
WILLOW I can... I can move. Oh...
BUFFY Willow? Are you here?
XANDER Where is she? Is she alive?
ANYA She's right here. OK, stand back. You're getting your feet in her.
BUFFY Willow?
ANYA She's hurt really bad, you guys. I'm gonna go get help.
XANDER I think she's sort of here-ish.
BUFFY Willow? W-we can't exactly see you, but we're really glad that you're back. I-I don't know how badly you're hurt, but
XANDER Is that Willow?
WILLOW I couldn't find you guys and I looked everywhere. And the demon said that you left me and Oh, there you are. There you are! Don't go away.
XANDER We're not going away. Oh, God.
BUFFY It's gonna be OK, Willow. You're gonna be OK.
WILLOW I know. You're here.
WILLOW Buffy...
BUFFY Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.
WILLOW That's all I had left in me anyway.
BUFFY I didn't realize meditating was such hard work.
WILLOW I'm healing. Growing new skin.
BUFFY Wow. That's magic, right? I mean, when most people when they meditate don't get extra skin, right. 'Cause Clem should, like, cut back.
WILLOW It's magic. I'm drawing power from the earth to heal myself.
BUFFY We're on the second floor.
WILLOW You know Giles says everything's part of the earth. This bed. The air. Us.
BUFFY Explains why my fingernails get dirty even when I don't do anything.
WILLOW Plus you stuck your thumbs in a demon.
BUFFY True.
BUFFY You're wiped out. I-I should go.
WILLOW No. Please stay. I missed you so much when I couldn't find you.
BUFFY We missed you too. I missed you. Dawn's, uh, working on what caused the mutual no-see-ums, but so far we haven't
WILLOW I did it.
BUFFY You did a spell?
WILLOW I didn't mean to. I-I just remember thinking I wasn't ready to see you guys yet. I was afraid we wouldn't, you know, connect.
BUFFY So, you made it happen just by thinking it?
WILLOW Guess I have a ways to go before I master my powers, huh?
BUFFY It's OK. As long as you're all right.
WILLOW It's nice to be forgiven. Too bad I need so much of it.
BUFFY I have a confession to make. I thought it might be you. With the flaying.
WILLOW I know.
BUFFY I wanna be the kind of person that wouldn't think that. Xander never thought it.
WILLOW He did, a little. Heck, I did a little. Xander has the luxury of not saying it, but you're the slayer. You have to say stuff like that. It's OK. It's OK too if you still don't think I can recover from this magic stuff, 'cause, honestly, I'm not that sure about it either.
BUFFY I thought you were too tired.
WILLOW It hurts too much not to try.
BUFFY I'm sorry.
WILLOW It just takes so much strength. I don't have that much.
BUFFY I got so much strength, I'm giving it away.
WILLOW Are you sure?
BUFFY Will it help?
WILLOW Much.
BUFFY Good.
