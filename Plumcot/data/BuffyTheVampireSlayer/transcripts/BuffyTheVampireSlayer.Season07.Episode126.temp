GILES Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer
WILLOW Anya!
ANYA I thought you were with Giles studying how to not kill people.
WILLOW I just got back.
BUFFY Are you asking me to be a counselor?
ANYA Spike's insane in the school basement, Xander's there doing construction on the new gym
BUFFY I was, uh, wondering why I
PRINCIPAL have this job?
BUFFY I still haven't finished college.
PRINCIPAL These students need someone around here who understands them; I need someone who understands these students.
MORTUARY_MAN_1 You did good work on her. She looks good.
MORTUARY_MAN_2 Thanks. She's all set for the service tomorrow.
MORTUARY_MAN_1 Good. All right then. I'll see you in the morning.
MORTUARY_MAN_2 G'night.
XANDER Hey.
BUFFY Sorry.
XANDER 33 minutes. Since when do we go through all this trouble for one lousy vampire. Excuse me, one lousy potential vampire.
BUFFY Vampire by vampire. It's the only way I know how.
DAWN I think this thing has a freakin' child lock on it.
BUFFY Shh!
DAWN You know, I'm not the shortest one here. I don't know why I had to be in the kid coffin.
BUFFY Look, I know it's my job
XANDER No, no. I'm sorry. I wanna help. I guess I've been a bit stressed out lately. I'm sorry I took it out on you.
BUFFY No big. Been kinda stressed myself.
DAWN Well, the whole Willow sitch is not unstressifying.I mean she's here, but not part of the gang here and hopefully not under my feet here in another time dimension here.
BUFFY There's Willow. There's the looming humongo bad. And it's a school night. I should be home in bed, cuddled up to my insomnia, and worrying about how I'm gonna mess up tomorrow.
DAWN You'll be fine. You'll be a great counselor.
BUFFY It's my first week actually talking to the kids. What if their problems are all weird and tricky?
XANDER I think you underestimate your familiarity with the world of weird and tricky. This job's perfect for you.
BUFFY Check out perfect me.
BUFFY Taking my sister on an educational outing to the
DAWN Dead body.
XANDER I don't know. Amateur opinion here, but she looks dead. I mean like natural causes dead.
BUFFY The paper said she had unusual cuts and contusions on her neck.
XANDER Maybe she cut herself shaving and then died naturally of embarrassment.
DAWN She looks...
BUFFY Peaceful.
DEAD_WOMAN I am not peaceful.
BUFFY That, I can help with.
BUFFY I always thought closed caskets were more tasteful anyway.
INTROVERTED_GIRL Hello?
BUFFY Come in! Hi.
INTROVERTED_GIRL Mr. Miller sent me here.
BUFFY Do you know why?
INTROVERTED_GIRL I'm not sure. Maybe 'cause this guy was picking on me.
TOUGH_BOY I don't wanna talk to you.
BUFFY OK. That's fine.
TOUGH_BOY I'm serious. I don't wanna talk.
BUFFY OK.
CONFIDENT_BOY You know, I hate to miss Bio, but I thought it was best I come speak with you.
BUFFY So, what's on your mind?
CONFIDENT_BOY On my mind?
BUFFY Are you worried about school? Uh, friends, girls, your parents?
CONFIDENT_BOY Yeah, yeah, that's it. My parents.
BUFFY What about them?
CONFIDENT_BOY Oh, issues... of divorce.
BUFFY You know, it's awful... being teased. But the thing is, you know, with bullies like this, they're really just
INTROVERTED_GIRL Insecure? Yeah, everyone says that. You know, I'm really tired of everyone being so insecure.
BUFFY Divorce is terrible. My parents got divorced when I was a kid.
CONFIDENT_BOY Yeah, my parents are happily married. It's hard. Uh, I feel... left out. B-but I'm also concerned about girls. OK, I'm just bored. Maybe I should get back to Bio?
BUFFY You have to stick up for yourself, Amanda. You need to show this bully that you're not gonna take any more of his shguff. Uh, any guff.
AMANDA/INTROVERTED_GIRL 'Cause that's what I did. I stuck up for myself. The other day after class, I jumped him in the parking lot, and I slammed his stupid-ass insecure face right into the pavement.
BUFFY You what?
AMANDA I guess that's another reason Mr. Miller wanted me to see you. Do you think I should pound on him some more?
XANDER I bet she's giving them great advice.
WILLOW Absolutely! Those kids are lucky to have Buffy looking out for them. I just wish she believed it. She's still stressing over the whole dropped out of college, not actually qualified thing. Plus the salivating hellmouth underneath her feet and the whole
XANDER From beneath you, it devours. It's not the friendliest jingle, is it? It's no I like Ike or Milk: it does a body good.
WILLOW I know. It's gonna be bad. It's gonna be real bad. And I wonder, will I Well, if it comes When it comes, will I be able to help?
XANDER I think so.
WILLOW I don't know. I don't know what I can do. I mean, frankly, I'mI'm scared of what I might do.
XANDER Yeah, I get that. Figuring out how to control your magic seems a lot like hammering a nail. Well, uh, hear me out. So you're hammering, right? OK, well at the end of the hammer, you have the power, but no control. It takes, like, two strokes to hit the nail in, or you could hit your thumb.
WILLOW Ouch.
XANDER So you choke up. Control, but no power. It could take like ten strokes to knock the nail in. Power, control. It's a tradeoff.
WILLOW That's actually not a bad analogy.
XANDER Thanks.
WILLOW Except... I'm less worried about hitting my thumb, and more worried about going all black-eyed baddy and bewitching that hammer into cracking my friends' skulls open like coconuts.
XANDER Right. Ouch.
WILLOW Sorry. Xander, being back here... I don't know...
XANDER It'll take time. Are you sure you're ready for this?
WILLOW Hey.
WILLOW It's me.
TOUGH_BOY I'm scared. I don't want to be left all alone. My brother's joining up with the Marines. Whew. You know, if he knew I was making a fool of myself, he'd smack me in my head. I guess I'm just being stupid.
BUFFY Sounds like your brother's pretty tough.
TOUGH_BOY Yeah, he's a man. I'm just all messed up right now.
BUFFY You are not messed up. It is not messed up to worry about your brother.
TOUGH_BOY What if he doesn't come back? What if he gets blown up?
BUFFY Have you talked to him? Have you told him how you feel?
TOUGH_BOY No. No, I don't wanna talk to him. I don't wanna do that. I don't wanna talk to him.
BUFFY OK.
TOUGH_BOY You understand?
BUFFY So, Josh, what's on your mind?
JOSH Well, I'm worried that I'm... gay.
BUFFY OK, first of all, I... I think it's great that you would come and talk to me about this. And second of all, you should know that there is nothing shameful about being gay. Nothing.
JOSH I-I know. It's justI'm not positive, so, uh, I was thinking that... why don't you go on, uh, a date with me so I can be sure.
BUFFY It sounds like it's difficult for you. Like maybe your sister makes it hard for you to establish your own identity. You said she's controlling, she doesn't let you make your own decisions
DAWN Yeah, and she borrows my clothes without asking.
BUFFY I understand. That must be hard.
BUFFY So, you're not doing your homework.
GIRL I guess not. It all just... seems kind of ... whatever.
BUFFY I know high school can seem kind of frustrating. But if you just get through it, then you can go to college, you know, or you can join the French Foreign Legion, or anything you want.
GIRL Yeah, well, I'm not gonna do all that stuff.
BUFFY OK, no Foreign Legion. I get that. I mean all the changing your name, and being indentured for all those years, and occupying Algeria...
GIRL It's just that I'm not graduating from high school.
BUFFY Why not?
GIRL I really like that shirt. Where'd you get it?
BUFFY Cassie, don't change the subject. Why won't you graduate?
CASSIE/GIRL Because next Friday I'm gonna die.
BUFFY What?
CASSIE Can we talk about something else?
BUFFY No, we have to talk about this.
CASSIE Just... never mind.
BUFFY Cassie, what makes you feel like this?
CASSIE Feel like what?
BUFFY Like you wanna hurt yourself.
CASSIE Oh, I'm I'm not gonna commit suicide ifif that's what you're saying. No way.
BUFFY OK then. Then what are you saying?
CASSIE Look, I don't mean to be a pain. You seem really nice, and I know you're just trying to help. But I'm wasting your time.
BUFFY No you're not. This is why I'm here. Cassie, please tell me, why do you think you're gonna die?
CASSIE I don't think it, I know it. I just know.
BUFFY What do you mean, you know? A-are you saying that someone's going to hurt you? Has someone threatened you?
CASSIE No. No, I just know that next Friday I'm gonna die. Some things I just know. I don't know how, I just do. Like I know there will be coins
BUFFY Coins?
CASSIE Mm-hmm. Lots of coins. Weird ones. And I know that you'll go someplace dark underground. I-I don't know.
BUFFY What do you mean underground?
CASSIE And I know you'll try to help
BUFFY Cassie, I-I don't understand what you're saying.
CASSIE But you can't, OK? I gotta go. Trig. I don't want Mr. Corrigan sending me Principal Wood again.
BUFFY Cassie, please
CASSIE Thanks for being so nice. I really do like that shirt. You should put a sweater on so it doesn't get stained. I gotta go.
BUFFY Cassie, wait, please
CASSIE Gotta go.
BUFFY What am I supposed to do?
PRINCIPAL Well, you did what you were supposed to do. You reported the situation to me.
BUFFY And...
PRINCIPAL Listen, Buffy, it's hard. Kids this age... they're hurting, they're pissed off, and they say things. Sometimes they say awful things. When I was in high school, I had a thing with this guy, right? Real bully. I kept telling everyone that he'd better sleep with one eye open 'cause I was gonna bust his ass. Well, I got suspended. Talk like that is taken pretty seriously where I come from.
BUFFY The hood?
PRINCIPAL Beverly Hills... which is a hood.
PRINCIPAL Listen, the point is, I was talking big because I was scared. I couldn't bust a move back in high school, let alone someone's ass. Most of the time, that's what it is when these students act out. Fear, pain
BUFFY But sometimes, it's not just talk, right?
PRINCIPAL Every time there's a threat like this, we do the same dance. Inform teachers, search lockers, but we can'twe can't know what's gonna happen, and we can't search their brains. We justwe just do what we can.
BUFFY It's not enough. I need to fix this. I don't usually get a heads up before somebody dies.
PRINCIPAL What do you mean usually?
BUFFY No. No, not sinceI mean, I'm sure it's not usual to get a chance to stop something likeI just I need to do something, OK? I have to make this better Oh! Oh, shoot.
BUFFY I have a job for you.
GUY What're you drawing?
CASSIE Don't you have a history test to study for?
GUY When are you gonna design me a tattoo?
CASSIE A tattoo? Oh, right. I could imagine that.
GUY Come on. Design something. I mean, maybe we could get matching tattoos. How 'bout like a snake with fire coming out of its mouth.
CASSIE Hmm. Or a sexy hula girl who wiggles when you flex?
GUY Yeah, now you're talking. Sexy hula girl. But a sexy snake hula girl.
CASSIE You are so ridiculous.
GUY So, I was thinking... maybe we should go to that dance after all.
CASSIE What do you mean after all. I told you I don't wanna go.
GUY Well, I assumed you were kidding.
CASSIE It would probably be lame anyways.
GUY Well, yeah, but lame is funny and, you know, maybe fun if, you know, we're hanging out together.
CASSIE We hang out together all the time.
GUY Right. And therefore we should hang out together at the winter formal.
DAWN Hey. Um, I'm in ceramics class with you. I'm Dawn Summers. I forgot if we had an assignment last week. I spaced.
CASSIE Right. Um. Hey, Dawn. Uh, yeah, you know we did have an assignment, but I didn't write it down. I think something to do with glazes...
GUY As scintillating as the pottery talk is, I'd better actually go study. I'm Mike, by the way.
DAWN Hi, Mike. I-I'm sorry. I didn't mean to
MIKE/GUY Oh, don't worry about it. I better go hit the books if I'm gonna ace this test. Nice meeting you, though. Cass, I'll see you later?
CASSIE Yep. Hey, Mike, you're gonna get a B.
MIKE Oh, A+ baby, A+.
DAWN So, um, is that any good?
CASSIE Yeah. Actually, yeah.
DAWN What do you have to read it for?
CASSIE Oh, just for me, I guess. I kinda stopped reading my homework assignments. I just... read what I want.
DAWN That's so cool. I'd do that, but my sister'd be down my neck in a second.
CASSIE Summers... hey are you the counselor's little sister?
DAWN No. She's my sister. Lucky me, huh?
CASSIE No, no, she's-she's really nice. I actually just saw her this morning.
DAWN Oh, really? What about? Uh, I'm sorry, that's none of my business.
CASSIE No, I don't care.
DAWN So, Mike's a cutie. Are you guys going to that dance?
CASSIE No, I don't think so.
DAWN Oh. I mean, didn't he ask you?
CASSIE Uh, like 105 times.
DAWN And you said no?
CASSIE 106 times. No, I-I can't go. I'm not gonna be around that night.
BUFFY Cassie's records all show the same thing. Good grades, good kid, then all of a sudden not so good grades, absenteeism, comments about apathy and depression
XANDER So, the question is, what changed?
BUFFY Right. If she did have some sort of psychic vision, that would explain it.
WILLOW Do you really think this girl is some kind of precog?
BUFFY Oh, I don't know. I told you about the shirt, right?
XANDER Buff, you spilled a cup of coffee. I'm not saying you don't have slayer grace, but it's not the first time.
WILLOW I mean maybe, just maybe, you're trying so hard to help that you're seeing paranormal when there's just normal.
BUFFY Maybe. But maybe not.
WILLOW Want me to check her medical records?
BUFFY Her doctor already sent them.
XANDER Let me see that. Strep throat. Ear infections. Yeast infections. None of my business... no real info here.
WILLOW Have you googled her yet?
XANDER Willow, she's 17.
WILLOW It's a search engine. Look. OK, let's see what Cassie Newton pulls up. Hey, look. Check this. She's got her own site.
XANDER A day and a half of researching, and we finally try looking up her.
BUFFY Wow, that's a lot of poems.
XANDER Poems. Always a sign of pretentious inner turmoil.
WILLOW The sheets above me
WILLOW cool my skin
WILLOW like dirt
WILLOW on a mad woman's grave
WILLOW I rise into
WILLOW the moonlight white
WILLOW and watch
WILLOW the mirror stare
WILLOW Pale fish looks
WILLOW back at me
WILLOW Pale fish that will
WILLOW never swim
WILLOW My skin is milk
WILLOW for no man to drink
WILLOW My thighs unused
WILLOW unclenched
WILLOW This body is
WILLOW not ready yet
WILLOW But dirt waits for no
WILLOW woman
WILLOW and coins will
WILLOW buy no time
WILLOW I hear the chatter
WILLOW of the bugs. It's they alone
WILLOW will feast.
XANDER OK, death is really on her brain.
DAWN We all deal with death.
XANDER This girl isn't just dealing, she's giving death a long, sloppy word-kiss. She has a yen for the big dirt-nap.
WILLOW I don't know. I mean, a lot of teens post some pretty angsty poetry on the web. I mean, I even posted a melodramatic love poem or two back in the day.
XANDER Love poems?
WILLOW I'm over you now, sweetie.
XANDER Love poems!
WILLOW Look, all I'm saying is that this is normal teen stuff. You join chat rooms, you write poetry, you post Doogie Howser fan-fic. It's all normal, right? Let's see what other sites there are.
DAWN You guys are way off track. I got a hunch on this one.
WILLOW Oh, wait, no, here's something. No, that's Philip Newton.
BUFFY No, that's her dad. Open it.
DAWN Guys, I'm telling you. I got this case cracked wide-open. I got the perp fingered. I told you 'bout Mike Helgenberg, right?
BUFFY Uh, that's the guy that asked her to the dance?
DAWN Right. The one that keeps asking her to the dance. I'm thinking, who likes to be rejected? Nobody. I'm thinking, some people can't handle the rejection. I'm thinking that
WILLOW Hey, I got something. Whoa, drunk and disorderly, disturbing the peacethere's a lot of charges here.
BUFFY Her dad's a drunk?
XANDER A violent drunk?
BUFFY We'd better find out. I have his address right... here. Got your keys?
XANDER Yeah.
DAWN Guys, I'm telling you, I'm liking Mike Helgenberg for the perp. Let's collar him before he lawyers up.
BUFFY Buffy, the vampire slayer, would break down this door.
XANDER And Buffy, the counselor?
BUFFY Waits.
BUFFY Mr. Newton?
MR._NEWTON That's right.
BUFFY I work at your daughter's school. I need to talk to you.
MR._NEWTON So, is she screwing up her grades again? Because she's not the sharpest apple in the barrel.
BUFFY She's got some problems. But it's, um, it's kind of you we wanted to talk about.
MR._NEWTON What about?
BUFFY We know you've been picked up by the police a couple of times. We wanted to know if you still drink a lot.
MR._NEWTON What's that got to do with Cassie?
BUFFY Frankly, we were worried that you mightdrink too much and hurt Cassie. That's all.
MR._NEWTON Oh. Oh, I see. That's-that's all. You just come in here in the middle of the night, into my home, and start accusing me of beating on my daughter? That's all?
BUFFY We just want to make sure that Cassie's
MR._NEWTON Well, that's a lie! Who told you this? Did Cassie's mother put you up to this, 'cause I pay my support, OK? To the dime! She just wants to take away the one weekend a month I get to be with my girl.
BUFFY Which is when?
MR._NEWTON What?
BUFFY Which weekend is it?
MR._NEWTON I-I just had her last weekend. Look, I may not be the greatest dad in the world, but I don't beat up my daughter.
BUFFY So, you won't be seeing her this Friday, then?
MR._NEWTON Not unless my ex-wife gets a personality transplant.
BUFFY OK.
MR._NEWTON OK, what? OK now you'll get out of my house?
BUFFY Yeah, we will.
CASSIE It's not him. He's not the one who does it. Thank you for trying, but I probably shouldn't have told you anything. You're making such a big deal out of it, and I want it to all to just go away.
XANDER Are you talking about killing yourself?
CASSIE No, of course not.
BUFFY Then fight. Try.
CASSIE There's no point. I told you
BUFFY This doesn't sound like someone who really wants to live.
CASSIE You think I want this? You think I don't care? Believe me, I want to...be here, do things. I want to graduate from high school, and I want to go to the stupid winter formal... I have this friend, and it would be fun to go with him. Just to dance and hear lame music to wear a silly dress and laugh and stuff.I'd like to go. There's a lot of stuff I'd like to do. I'd love to ice skate at Rockefeller Center. And I'd love to see my cousins grow up and see how they turn out 'cause they're really mean and I think they're gonna be fat. I'd love to backpack across the country or, I don't know, fall in love, but I won't. I just never will.
BUFFY You will. Cassie, you will. You just have to tell us what you know. You have to tell us everything. Please, help us.
CASSIE I can't. I just know it's gonna happen. I don't know why and I don't know how, but something out there is gonna kill me.
PRINCIPAL Hey, how're we doing? Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.
BUFFY Oh, no, that's OK. I just didn't get much sleep last night.
PRINCIPAL It's been a long week, huh. Well, thank God it's Friday. I can't believe I just said that. See you later.
BUFFY I sit alone at my
BUFFY window sill
BUFFY Trees crackle,
BUFFY sunshine blares...
CASSIE ...and
CASSIE children laugh like death
CASSIE their sharp happiness is a
CASSIE knife to me
CASSIE One jealous snake on a
CASSIE window sill
CASSIE They will be here, trees and sun
CASSIE and children with canes
CASSIE and pruney skin
CASSIE when I am but a memory
CASSIE a laugh in the trees
CASSIE of time. I sit alone
CASSIE and try to love them
CASSIE I sit alone, a snake
CASSIE I sit alone and try to
CASSIE love them
CASSIE I sit alone
CASSIE and laugh.
BUFFY Spike, what are you doing?
SPIKE Nothing. If I don't move, if I don't think, if I don't listen to the voices, then I won't hurt...much.
BUFFY I need to ask you something.
SPIKE Don't.
BUFFY There's a girl, she's in danger, and she needs your help. Now. Time is running out. It's Friday, the day Cassie said she's going to die.
SPIKE I can't. I can't hear you.
BUFFY Is there something evil in the school? Down here, maybe. Spike, please, do you know anything?
SPIKE Yes. There's evil. Down here. Right here. I'm a bad man. William is a baaad man. I hurt the girl.
BUFFY Spike, stop it! What did you do?
SPIKE I hurt you, Buffy, and I will pay. I am paying because I hurt the girl.
BUFFY Spike. No. It's not me. It's a different girl, OK? Her name is Cassie Newton. Please, do you know anything specific?
SPIKE Don'tdon't leave me. Stay here, and help me be quiet.
BUFFY I think it's worse when I'm here.
SPIKE Don't let him hurt the girl.
PRINCIPAL Well, there's nothing in this one. What've you got?
BUFFY Where's your hall pass?
MIKE No hall pass. I got a free period.
BUFFY You seem kind of upset. Something on your mind?
MIKE No, not really. Well, I got a lousy B in Egyptian history. Knew this stuff cold, so that, you know, that pisses me off.
BUFFY You get... pissed off a lot?
MIKE No, I
BUFFY Let me cut to the chase. I hear you can't get a date for the winter formal.
MIKE Oh, whoa, look, I know it's your job to talk to kids with problems, but honestly I don't have any. I'm fine. All right, look, it's really no big deal. I have a friend that I really wanted to takeI don't know, I guess she doesn't see me that way. She makes me crazy.
BUFFY Crazy?
MIKE Yeah, sometimes I jus That's funny. You're Dawn's sister, right?
BUFFY Uh, that's right. Dawn is my sister.
MIKE Oh, that's so weird. I was just thinking about her. Yeah, I was thinking if, you know, Cassie won't budge, maybe I'll ask Dawn.
BUFFY You aren't mad at Cassie, with her rejecting you like that?
MIKE Nah, she's a girl right? Making boys crazy is like your job description.
BUFFY You're asking my sister to the dance, and she's your second choice?
BUFFY I'll be keeping an eye on you.
PRINCIPAL Seems like someone's got quite a coin collection, huh?
BOY You wanted to see me?
BUFFY You have locker number 281?
BOY Yeah, why?
BUFFY I want you to tell me what this is, and what this has to do with a girl named Cassie Newton.
BOY I don't know. I-i-it's late. I'm going to miss my bus.
BUFFY I know it's late. That's why I don't have time to mess around, so you need to talk to me. Now.
BOY Believe me, i-i-if I knew anything, I'd tell you. I just... don't.
BUFFY Do you know why I came back to Sunnydale High?
BOY To creep me out?
BUFFY To help. I'm a counselor here because I wanna help. I know what it's like to walk these halls and feel lost, alone. I just want to make things better, connect. And I'm going to connect with your face if you don't stop wasting my time and help me do my job.
BOY I... please, I
BUFFY A girl could die.
BOY I guess I know who you're talking about. She's some weirdo suicidal poet girl. These guys I know wanna mess with her. They've got this plan
CASSIE Well, I guess this is goodbye.
DAWN No. I mean, let me walk you home.
CASSIE Oh, don't worry about it, I'm going to my Mom's. It's kinda far.
DAWN Far is good.
CASSIE Dawn, I know what's going on here.
DAWN What?
CASSIE Buffy told you about me, right? She told you to pretend to be my friend?
DAWN No. Maybe. Cassie, she was scared. She wanted to help you.
CASSIE Well, she can't.
DAWN Maybe she can. She's not like you think. She's got powers... of helping. And look, she was worried and now I'm worried and I wasn't pretending at all. I really wanted to be your friend.
CASSIE You are my friend.
DAWN I am?
CASSIE Yeah. Just remember, I'm not as dumb as I look.
DAWN I'm glad.
CONFIDENT_BOY Hey, Summers!
CASSIE Listen, Dawn, whatever happens now, it's not your fault, OK?
DAWN Uh... Uh, what's up, Peter?
PETER/CONFIDENT_BOY I was just wondering if anyone had asked you to winter formal.
DAWN What? Oh, uh, no. not exactly.
PETER Well, uh, I was just doing a poll. I'll see you.
DAWN That guy is such an ass.
DAWN Cassie? Cassie? Cassie!
PETER All present?
ALL All present.
PETER Then we begin. Mandel, shut up.
MANDEL Sorry, dude, it's It's just so cool, I mean We're gonna be rich!
PETER Keep your shorts, all right. We have to do the ritual if we wanna score. Oh, Keith, did you take care of the fire exits?
KEITH Yeah. Anybody tries to bust in here's gonna get a nasty surprise. I set up this booby trap my cousin Ben always used to do
PETER Then nobody is getting in... and nobody is getting out.
MANDEL Dude.
PETER This is our sacrifice. It's nothing personal. It's just that you have this death-kick suicidal vibe going. I figure if you disappear, everybody'll just assume you threw yourself in a river somewhere. Extinguish.
PETER All mighty Avilas... please accept our sacrifice. Please appear before us, oh mighty soldier of the dark. Please appear before us, and grant us with infinite riches, and we will pay you with our sacrifice. We kneel before you with the gift of flesh.
BUFFY OK, thatis going on your permanent record.
PETER Wait, this isthe counselor! What the hell is she doing here?
MANDEL I-it was his idea!
PETER Back off. Get back! Get back, you stupid bitch!
PETER Aw, you're gonna die!
BUFFY Do you know how lame this is? Bored teenage boys trying to raise up a demon. Sorry it didn't show. I bet it's 'cause you forgot the boom box playing some heavy metal thing, like Blue Clam Cult. I think that's the key to the raising of lame demons.
PETER That lame demon?
KEVIN Dude, help!
BUFFY No!
BUFFY No! Ow!
BUFFY Spike?
SPIKE Here to help. No hurting the girl.
BUFFY Untie her. I'll take care of this.
PETER Who are you?
SPIKE I'm a bad man.
CASSIE She'll tell you. Someday she'll tell you.
BUFFY Are you OK?
CASSIE Uh-huh. Ow.
PETER You can't be dead. Where are my infinite riches? Ahh! Ahh! It bit me!
BUFFY C'mon.
PETER Help! Help me, please! I'm bleeding.
BUFFY Sorry. My office hours are 10 to 4.
BUFFY It's all OK now. I hope you're not too disappointed.
BUFFY See? You can make a difference.
CASSIE And you will.
BUFFY Cassie? Cassie. Cassie. No, come on. Cassie. Cassie.
WILLOW How is her mom?
BUFFY OK. As OK as... she told me that her family had a history of heart irregularities, but she never told Cassie.
WILLOW Cassie didn't know? Then it was fate?
XANDER I think she was gonna die, no matter what, wasn't she. Didn't matter what you did.
