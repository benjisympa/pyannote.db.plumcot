GILES Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer
TROLL You seem determined to put an end to all my fun. Just like you always did when we were dating!
BUFFY You dated a troll?
ANYA Well, he wasn't a troll then. You know, he was just a big dumb guy.
WILLOW Where is everyone?
ANYA At the new high school. Buffy's got some kind of job there, Spike's insane in the basement.
BUFFY Willow?
WILLOW There you are!
BUFFY We're really glad that you're back.
XANDER Did you turn this nice lady's ex into a giant worm-monster?
ANYA Yes.
WILLOW I got the impression that you enjoyedinflicting.
ANYA Well, causing pain sounds really cool, I know, but turns out it's really upsetting. Didn't use to be.
HALFREK It's the talk of the order. They're calling you Miss Softserve.
ANYA Excuse me?
HALFREK No deaths. No eviscerations. You're not goading women into anything inventive, and you're not delivering when it is.
ANYA It was a glitch, and I am so back in the vengeance fold.
DAWN My advice to you is do exactly what everyone else does all the time.
WILLOW Got it.
DAWN Do what everyone else does, wear what everyone else wears, say what everyone else says.
WILLOW OK.
DAWN People may say something to you you don't understand. Just don't be afraid to keep your mouth shut and pretend like you know what they're saying.
WILLOW You know, Dawn, I've been to college before.
DAWN People may say something like My protein window closes in an hour. Just nod and smile. Mm-hmm. Turns out it has something to do with fitness.
BUFFY Have you talked to her lately?
XANDER Not since that night with the Gnarl demon. And that wasn't exactly the kind of how have you been kind of talk. More of the pierce its eye with something sharp kind of talking. I'm thinking I should call her.
BUFFY I just don't want you to get your hopes up.
XANDER Hopes? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. There are no hopes. Anya and I are done. I love being single. I'm a strong, successful male who is giddy at the thought of all the women I will no doubt be dating in the near future.
BUFFY Strong, successful males say giddy?
XANDER I just worry about her, that's all.
WILLOW Anya?
XANDER Yeah, she seems so sad.
DAWN She should try acting like everybody else more.
WILLOW Apparently it's what all the kids are doing nowadays.
BUFFY Well, I'm not sure I get the sad vibe, but there's definitely a vengeance vibe worth worrying about.
XANDER Oh, that? No, no. I don't worry about that. She was hurt and she just turned back to what she knew when I you know. But that's not her anymore.
BUFFY I hope you're right.
XANDER Well, she turned that worm guy back before any real damage happened, right? It'll just take some time. I really think she's coming around.
ANYA What have I done?
OLAF Aud! Sweet, beautiful Aud! I am so hungry, I could eat a small child!
ANYA Olaf! Are you injured? You smell of blood and musk.
OLAF Fear not! It takes more than a band of minor trolls to bring down the mighty Olaf!
ANYA Trolls!
OLAF Oh! They are wretched creatures indeed. The mere thought of them makes me bend at the knee and flex!
ANYA Sweetheart, please sit down. Allow me to tend to you.
OLAF I am fine. Really. I could go for some mead, though.
ANYA Certainly.
OLAF Is it my imagination, or do we have substantially more rabbits in this house today?
ANYA Oh, they breed so quickly that it's
OLAF All this talk of breeding... it makes me want to breed!
ANYA Honey, of course. But heredrink your mead first.
OLAF Ah, yes. Mead.
ANYA The rapid reproductive rate of our rabbits...has given me an idea. I can give the excess out to the townspeople, exchanging them not for goods or services, but for goodwill and the sense of accomplishment that stems from selflessly giving of yourself to others.
OLAF Ha, ha, ha! Sweet Aud! Your logic is insane and happenstance, like that of a troll. It is no wonder that the bar matrons talk of you.
ANYA You've been to the bar...
OLAF It is not my fault they don't take kindly to you. You speak your mind, and are annoying. It's one of the things I love most about you.
ANYA Was Rannveig there?
OLAF Bah! I've told you a thousand times; I have no interest in this Rannveig. Her hips are large and load bearing, like a Baltic woman. Your hips are narrow, like a Baltic woman from a slightly more arid region. You are my perfect Aud. I could never want for another.
ANYA I am sorry. I simply love you so much...I feel as though I could burst at times...I could not live without you.
OLAF Fear not, sweet Aud, you will always be my beautiful girl.
SPIKE I don't trust what I see anymore. I don't know how to explain it, exactly. It's like I've been seeing things. Dru used to see things, you know? She'd always be staring up at the sky watching cherubs burn or the heavens bleed or some nonsense. I used to stare at her and think she'd gone completely sack of hammers. But she'd see the sky when we were inside and it'd make her so happy. She'd see showers. She'd see stars. Now I see her.
BUFFY Spike.
SPIKE I'm in trouble, Buffy.
BUFFY I can help you.
SPIKE I could never ask. Not after...
BUFFY It's different. You're different.
SPIKE I could never ask.
BUFFY Spike, it's me. It's you and it's me, and we'll get through this.
SPIKE Never...
BUFFY We'll get through this.
BUFFY Spike. This basement is killing you. This is the hellmouth. There is something bad down here, possibly everything bad.
SPIKE Can't hear you. Can't hear you.
BUFFY You have a soul? Fine. Show me.
SPIKE Scream montresor all you like, pet.
BUFFY Get up and get out of this basement.
SPIKE I don't have anywhere else to go.
WILLOW And it's not like I've been gone for that long, and I've already done all the reading that I missed. And I can sign up for
PROFESSOR Willow, Willow, it's OK. We'll get you caught up in no time.
WILLOW Really?
PROFESSOR What am I gonna say? No, I don't want my best student back in my class? Well, of course I noticed that drop-off in your grades at mid-term last year, and I was concerned
WILLOW Yeah, that was
PROFESSOR But thenviola. You turned it around and aced all your finals likeboom. Magic.
WILLOW Yeah, similar to, but, um...
PROFESSOR Look, come see me during office hours tomorrow and we'll see about what we need to do to get you caught up, all right?
WILLOW OK. Thanks, professor. Anya! Anya!
ANYA Willow, hi! What're you doing here?
WILLOW Oh, I'm starting back up at school again! Yeah, I can't believe how great everyone's been. I-I was a little worried, but I already have books and homework and they even said they'd give me periodic surprise quizzes just to make up for the ones that I missed, and... Wh-what're you doing here? Walking out of the fraternity house in the middle of the day?
ANYA Uh, um... I have a new boyfriend now. He lives here.
WILLOW That's great.
ANYA Yeah, we just had lots and lots of sex.
WILLOW OK. This is so great. I am so happy to see you've moved on.
ANYA Yeah, we're tremendously happy together. Now, um, if you'll excuse me, I'm late for something important.
WILLOW Uh, OK. See you later.
WILLOW Hello? Is anybo
YOUNG_WOMAN I take it back. I take it back. I take it back.
WILLOW It's OK. You're OK.
YOUNG_WOMAN I take it back.
WILLOW W-what do you take back?
YOUNG_WOMAN 'S gonna be a party. Everyone's gonna be there. Everyone's bringing a date. I'll have a great time. But it was just me. And them. He broke up with me in front of them. I was a game. It was all a game.
WILLOW It's OK. You're OK now.
YOUNG_WOMAN They laughed and they laughed and I cried and they laughed. And I yelled, Just once, I wish you could all feel what it's like to have your hearts ripped out. Just once. I wish... and it came.
WILLOW OK. Come on, what came? What did this?
YOUNG_WOMAN A spider.
WILLOW W-where did it go?
YOUNG_WOMAN What do you mean?
WILLOW The spider. Where is it now?
WILLOW Protect!
WILLOW For God's sake, shut your whimpering mouth!
WILLOW I'm sorry.
VILLAGE_MAN Troll!
VILLAGE_WOMAN It's the largest troll I've ever seen!
VILLAGE_MAN Run! Hide your babies and your beadwork!
TROLL Stop!
TROLL Stop! It is Olaf!
VILLAGE_MAN The troll is doing an Olaf impersonation!
TROLL I am Olaf!
VILLAGE_MAN Hit him with fruits and various meats.
TROLL Aaarrrrgh!
TROLL I am Olaf!
D'HOFFRYN Impressive.
ANYA Thank you.
D'HOFFRYN What is that? A Woodlow Transmogriphic spell?
ANYA Thornton's Hope.
D'HOFFRYN Thornton's Hope. But how did you get the troll element?
ANYA Eelsbane.
D'HOFFRYN Eelsbane. Brilliant! What'd he do?
ANYA Bar matron. A load bearing bar matron.
D'HOFFRYN Is there any other kind. I'm sorry. How rude of me. Allow me to introduce myself. My name is D'Hoffryn.
ANYA I am Aud.
D'HOFFRYN Are you? Hmm. I'm afraid you don't see your true self. You are Anyanka. I'm a patron of a family of sorts. We're vengeance demons. I'm sure you've heard of us.
ANYA No, I'm sorry.
D'HOFFRYN Oh, well, that's quite
ANYA Oh, no, don't feel bad. I, uh, I don't talk to people much. I mean, I talk to them, but they don't talk to me. Except to say that your questions are irksome, and perhaps you should take your furs and your literal interpretations to the other side of the river.
OLAF Come here tiny man. You are small and toy like.
D'HOFFRYN I get the sense that your talents are not fully appreciated here, Anyanka. We'd like you to join us.
ANYA Why do you keep calling me that? My name is Aud.
D'HOFFRYN Perhaps, but Anyanka is who you are.
ANYA What would I have to do?
D'HOFFRYN What you do best. Help wronged women punish evil men.
ANYA Vengeance.
D'HOFFRYN But only to those who deserve it.
ANYA They all deserve it.
D'HOFFRYN That's where I was going with that, yeah.
BUFFY Hello. Willow, hey! Is everything A spider demon? Wh h-hold on. A-are you all right? Like how? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Wait, OK, go ahead. No, no, no, no, no. It's all good. I'll get Xander to go. But seriously, you just Whoa. Ripped out the heart? My God. Hey, did you get that physics class you wanted?
HALFREK This is just wonderful, Anyanka. There's even talk of having some sort of ceremony. I can't tell you how many times today I've heard Anyanka is back to her old self again. Honey, what is it? What's wrong?
ANYA It's nothing. I just There was just so much screaming, so much blood. I I forgotten how much damage a Grimslaw demon could do.
HALFREK Oh, tell me about it. They can be feisty little guys and impossible to house train. I mean, once they start nesting, forget Are you OK? Oh, did something happen?
ANYA I-I guess I'm just a little rusty. I didn't think it would hit me like this.
HALFREK Oh, sweetie. This is perfectly normal. It's a reflex. You'll get over it in no time, trust me.
ANYA Oh, Hallie! I can't tell you how good it is Thank goodness you're here.
HALFREK Oh, sweetie. Of course.
ANYA It's just lately, with everything that's been going on, I-I've had trouble even remembering
WILLOW Get out.
HALFREK Lemon drop, if you think I'm gonna
WILLOW Get out.
ANYA It's OK.
HALFREK Well, OK. If you need anything, you holler.
WILLOW Anya, you have to stop this.
ANYA Do you know what they did to her? Do you? It was a game. They were humiliating her.
WILLOW Anya, listen to me. You're in trouble. You know it. I'm here to help you.
ANYA You're here to Well, that's great, Willow. Flayed anybody lately, have you? How quickly they forget!
WILLOW I haven't forgotten one second of it.
ANYA What do you want?
WILLOW I want to help you.
ANYA They got what they deserved.
WILLOW No, they
ANYA I am a vengeance demon! Do you understand that?
WILLOW No.
ANYA Try! They got what they deserved.
BUFFY Thanks for side-kicking. I didn't want to trouble Willow. Figure she's got enough to do. First day back and all.
XANDER Are you kidding? We're doing vent work at the site. Anything's better than breathing freon for eight hours. So, did she say what this thing is?
BUFFY Some sort of spider demony thingy. She had to go pretty quickly. I think she had to sign up for classes or something.
XANDER Ah, yes, there is little that can distract the Willow when she's on the hunt for the mighty syllabi.
BUFFY I don't know. I guess she was a little more nervous than she was letting on.
XANDER How big did she say this thing was?
BUFFY She didn't. But I can't imagine she'd send us out if it wasn't The heart is completely ripped out. This is our guy.
XANDER Or a copycat spider demon. So what's this black stuff?
XANDER Aw, it's sticky!
BUFFY Willow said it was a spider demon. Maybe it's its webbing.
XANDER This isn't springy high-flying fun.
BUFFY Xander.
XANDER Is that it?
BUFFY I can't tell. There is definitely something moving up there.
XANDER Maybe we can somehow lure it.
BUFFY Xander!
BUFFY You OK?
XANDER Buffy, where'd it go? I think we need more swords.
BUFFY Uh-huh.
XANDER I say we go home, pick up more swords, and some sort of spidery demon protection amulet. We come back, and
XANDER Or
BUFFY I'm more concerned with where that thing came from. If there are more of those spider demons running around, we need to know about it. We should hit the research, find out if
WILLOW I know where it came from.
BUFFY How many?
WILLOW Ten, twelve.
XANDER When were you planning on telling us?
WILLOW I'm telling you now.
XANDER Great. Thank you. Willow, it's Anya. How could you let us How could you not have told us?
BUFFY Xander...
XANDER How could you not have told me?
BUFFY Xander. It's OK. She didn't tell us for a reason. She didn't tell us because she knows what I have to do. I have to kill Anya.
HALFREK I swear, I'm in awe of you.
ANYA Oh, stop.
HALFREK Oh, I will not.
ANYA I grant wishes. It's all inside the girl. I just bring it out.
HALFREK Yes, I'm sure this is what she had in mind.
ANYA Well, I don't know about her mind, but it was in her heart. Besides, Russia was ready to explode. All we did is just give it a little push.
HALFREK What should we do with the rest of our evening? I hear they're going to raze the Winter Mansion.
ANYA Well, I thought we'd head on down to Madame Dubasov's. No better spot for vengeance than a brothel.
HALFREK Oh, it's always work, work, work with you.
ANYA Well, of course. What else is there?
HALFREK What else is there? Why, the whole world, for one. Darling, take a look around. There's a lot to see. There's a revolution going on outside that you are somewhat responsible for. Aren't you the teeniest bit interested?
ANYA Well, what is there to be interested in? The worker will overthrow absolutism and lead the proletariat to a victorious communist revolution, resulting in socio-economic paradise on earth. It's common sense, really. I have better things to worry about.
HALFREK But, Anyanka, there's a whole world out there.
ANYA Yes, filled with wronged women who need my help.
HALFREK Oh, but you're talking work.
ANYA I'm talking about life. Vengeance is what I do, Halfrek. I don't need anything else. Vengeance is what I am.
BUFFY She's not the Anya that you knew, Xander. She's a demon.
XANDER That doesn't mean you have to kill her.
BUFFY Don't act like this is easy for me. You know it's not.
XANDER There are other options.
BUFFY I've considered them.
XANDER When? Just now? Took you all of ten seconds to decide to kill one of your best friends?
BUFFY The thought that it might come to this has occurred to me before. It's occurred to you, too.
XANDER But we can change what she did. Fix it. These are mystical deaths, right? There has to be something.
WILLOW I don't have anywhere near that kind of power. I didn't have that kind of power when And I-I don't think I trust the power I do have.
BUFFY It's OK. Xander, I know this is hard for you to hear, but it's what I have to do.
XANDER Hard for me to hear? Buffy, you wanna kill Anya!
BUFFY I don't want to.
XANDER Then don't! This isn't new ground for us. When our friends go all crazy and start killing people, we help them.
WILLOW Sitting right here.
XANDER I'm sorry. But it's true.
BUFFY It's different.
XANDER Because you don't care about her the same way I do. Buffy, I still love her.
BUFFY I know. And that's why you can't see this for what it really is. Willow was different. She's a human. Anya's a demon.
XANDER And you're the slayer. I see now how it's all very simple.
BUFFY It is never simple.
XANDER No, of course not. You know, if there's a mass-murdering demon that you're, oh, say, boning, then it's all gray area.
BUFFY Spike was harmless. He was helping.
XANDER He had no choice.
BUFFY And Anya did! She chose to become a demon. Twice.
XANDER You have no idea what she's going through.
BUFFY I don't care what she's going through!
XANDER No, of course not. You think we haven't seen all this before? The part where you just cut us all out. Just step away from everything human and act like you're the law. If you knew what I felt
BUFFY I killed Angel! Do you even remember that? I would have given up everything I had to be with I loved him more than I will ever love anything in this life. And I put a sword through his heart because I had to.
WILLOW And that all worked out OK.
BUFFY Do you remember cheering me on? Both of you. Do you remember giving me Willow's message: Kick his ass.
WILLOW I never said that
XANDER This is different
BUFFY It is always different! It's always complicated. And at some point, someone has to draw the line, and that is always going to be me. You get down on me for cutting myself off, but in the end the slayer is always cut off. There's no mystical guidebook. No all-knowing council. Human rules don't apply. There's only me. I am the law.
XANDER There has to be another way.
BUFFY Then please find it.
WILLOW I can't. I'm sorry.
D'HOFFRYN Behold, D'Hoffryn. Lord of Arashmahar. He that turns the air to blood and rains Miss Rosenberg. How lovely to see you again. Have you done something with your hair?
WILLOW Hello, D'Hoffryn.
D'HOFFRYN I figured I'd be hearing from you soon. The flaying of Warren Meers? Oh, truly inspired. That was water cooler vengeance. Lloyd has a sketch of it on his wall.
WILLOW That's not me anymore.
D'HOFFRYN Is that right? So, I didn't feel your presence earlier today? I didn't feel a bit of the old you?
WILLOW We need to talk about Anya.
D'HOFFRYN Very well. Let's talk about Anyanka.
XANDER I thought I might find you here. Have you forced yourself to look at the bodies yet?
ANYA What do you want?
XANDER I want to help you.
ANYA Everyone is so considerate today. I should've slaughtered people weeks ago.
XANDER I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything I did to you. Everything I put you through.
ANYA Thank you. All better. Thank goodness you got here in time.
XANDER You don't understand. This isn't an intervention. Buffy's coming to kill you.
ANYA She's coming to try.
XANDER Did everybody have their crazy flakes today? You guys are friends. How could you talk like this?
ANYA I have a job to do. And so does Buffy. Xander, you've always seen what you wanted to. But you knew, sooner or later, it would come to this.
XANDER Buffy, get out of here.
BUFFY Get out of my way, Xander.
XANDER No.
ANYA Get out of her way, Xander.
ANYA This is getting to be a pattern with you, Buffy. Are there any friends of your left you haven't tried to kill? C'mon, Buffy. Don't you have a clever retort for me?
BUFFY Anya, I'm sorry.
ANYA You're apologizing to me. What fight are you watching? Or is this like one of your little pop-culture references I don't get, 'cause I'm a vengeance
XANDER I just want... happy... ending...
ANYA Honey? Honey?
XANDER What? I'm awake. I'm OK.
ANYA Honey? Was that weird? That thing earlier with the singing... and the coconuts.
XANDER What? No, it's fine.
NEIGHBOR_MAN Oh, no. Mustard on my shirt.
NEIGHBOR_WOMAN Mustard. I'll never get it out.
NEIGHBOR_MAN My favorite red shirt.
NEIGHBOR_WOMAN Dry clean it.
NEIGHBOR_MAN How could you serve
NEIGHBORS Mustard.
ANYA Are you still hungry? Because I'd be
ANYA Mr. Xander Harris.
ANYA That's what he is to the world outside.
ANYA That's the name he carries with pride.
ANYA I'm just lately Anya.
ANYA Not very much to the world, I know.
ANYA All these years with nothing to show.
ANYA I've boned a troll, I've wreaked some wrath,
ANYA But on the whole, I've had no path.
ANYA I like to bowl, I'm good with math,
ANYA But who am I?
ANYA Now I reply that
ANYA I'm the Missis
ANYA I will be his Missis.
ANYA Mrs. Anya Christina Emanuella Jenkins Harris.
ANYA What's the point of loving...
ANYA I mean except for the sweaty part.
ANYA What's the point of losing your heart?
ANYA Maybe if you're lucky
ANYA Being a pair makes you twice as tall.
ANYA Maybe you're not losing at all.
ANYA No need to cover up my heart,
ANYA Plus see above RE: sweaty part.
ANYA So maybe love is pretty smart
ANYA And so am I
ANYA I found my guy!
ANYA And I'll be Missis
ANYA I will be his Missis
ANYA Mrs. Anya Lame-Ass-Made-Up-Maiden-Name Harris.
ANYA We'll never part
ANYA Not if we can
ANYA And if we start
ANYA Then here's my plan
ANYA I'll show him what bliss is
ANYA Welcome him with kisses
ANYA 'Cause this is a Missis who misses her man
ANYA He's my Xander
ANYA And he's awfully swell
ANYA It makes financial sense as well,
ANYA Although he can beI'll never tell
ANYA Just stand aside
ANYA Here comes the bride
ANYA I'll be Missis.
ANYA I will be his Missis
ANYA I will be
XANDER Anya!
ANYA Forgotten how much swords through the chest hurt. Aaahh! You know better than that, Buffy. It takes a lot more to kill a vengeance demon.
BUFFY Oh, I'm just getting started.
ANYA Stop trying to save me, Xander!
D'HOFFRYN Oh, please, don't mind me. Continue with whatever it was you were doing. Oh, breathtaking. It's like somebody slaughtered an Abercrombie and Fitch catalog. Easy now. I'd be gone before you could swing. Isn't that just like a slayer. Solving all her problems by sticking things with sharp objects. I talked to your friend, Miss Rosenberg. She's a firebrand. I have high hopes for her.
XANDER Stay away from Willow.
D'HOFFRYN Oh, he's gallant, isn't he. I understand what you saw in him. Look, Miss Rosenberg seems to think Anyanka would be better suited outside the vengeance fold. I think we already know what Lady HacksAway wants. And the young man, he sees with the eyeballs of love. But I'm not sure if anyone's bothered to find out what Anyanka herself really wants.
XANDER Her name is Anya.
D'HOFFRYN Actually, funny historical side-bar, her original name was
ANYA I wanna take it back.
D'HOFFRYN I'm sorry. What was that?
ANYA I wanna take it back. I wanna undo what I did.
D'HOFFRYN Hmm. You want to take it back. Must be twelve bodies in there. Such a thingnot easily done. But not impossible. You're a big girl, Anyanka. You understand how this works. The proverbial scales must balance. In order to restore the lives of the victims, the fates require a sacrifice. The life and soul of a vengeance demon.
ANYA Do it.
XANDER Wait!
ANYA Stay out of this Xander.
XANDER OK, all right. That seems smart. He just said you have to die! Perhaps there's some sort of alternate price.
ANYA Xander, you can't help me. I'm not even sure there's a me to help. I understand the price. Do it.
D'HOFFRYN You're sure? This is your wish?
ANYA This is my wish. Undo what I did.
D'HOFFRYN Very well.
XANDER No!
HALFREK Anya!
ANYA Hallie!
D'HOFFRYN Who did you think you were dealing with? Did you think it would be that easy to get away?
ANYA Why?
D'HOFFRYN Why? Because you wished it!
ANYA But she was yours.
D'HOFFRYN Like you were mine? Haven't I taught you anything, Anya? Never go for the kill when you can go for the pain. Hold him back, Slayer. Wouldn't want anyone to get hurt. I've got plenty of girls. There will always be vengeance demons. But now you, Anya, you're out. Congratulations. You're wish is granted.
ANYA You should've killed me.
D'HOFFRYN Oh, I wouldn't worry about that. From beneath you, it devours. Be patient. All good things in time.
BUFFY Go. I'll check on the boys.
XANDER Anya, wait.
ANYA Xander, please. Just go away.
XANDER Whatever's between usit doesn't matter. You shouldn't be alone in this.
ANYA Yes, I should. My whole life, I've just clung to whatever came along.
XANDER Well, speaking as a clingee I kinda didn't mind.
ANYA Thanks. For everything.
ANYA Xander what if I'm really nobody?
XANDER Don't be a dope.
ANYA I'm a dope?
XANDER Sometimes.
ANYA That's a start.
