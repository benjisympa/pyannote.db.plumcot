GILES Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer
BUFFY Spike, this is the hellmouth. You have a soul? Fine. Show me. Get out of this basement.
SPIKE I don't have anywhere else to go.
D'HOFFRYN There will always be vengeance demons. But now you, Anya, you're out.
XANDER Whatever's between usit doesn't matter. You shouldn't be alone in this.
ANYA Yes, I should.
XANDER You're gonna live in that small room over there. I know it looks like a closet, but it's a room now. You're not gonna touch my food. I take the first shower in the morning, and if I use up all the hot water, that's your tough noogies. And I hate this plan. Are you keeping up, or do you need some kind of English-to-ConstantPainInMyAss translation?
BUFFY Invitation.
XANDER Is there something more emphatic than hate? Can I revile the plan? Fine. I invite you in. Nimrod.
SPIKE Don't want your soddin' food anyway.
XANDER I just don't understand when his problems became your problemsmore specifically mine.
BUFFY The school basement is making him crazy. We can't just leave him there.
XANDER Why not? Crazy-Basement-Guy is better than Stalking-Buffy-Guy.
DAWN It's true. You guys aren't... You're not starting up again with the whole
BUFFY No. A thousand gallons of no. OK, it's justthings are different nowhe has a soul.
XANDER I'm sure that'll be a real comfort when he soulfully attacks you again.
DAWN Yeah, what does that mean exactlythat Spike is all soul-having?
BUFFY I don't know, but he's been through a lot, OK, and nobody's attacking
SPIKE Buffy Sorry.
BUFFY No, it's me. I-I just
SPIKE I'll go. This can't work.
BUFFY It will. I-it already is. OK, you know, you've been out of the basement for half an hour, and you've already stopped talking to invisible people.
SPIKE Bollocks.
BUFFY OK, so there was that one episode in the car, but
SPIKE No, bollocks to the whole thing. I don't need your mollycoddling.
BUFFY It's not coddling. Now go to your closet.
DAWN So, what is it?
BUFFY What's what?
DAWN Last night, you said you weren't helping Spike out of pity. What is it?
BUFFY It's a good question.
DAWN Is sitting there drinking soda some kind of a Zen non-answer?
BUFFY No, I just... I don't know what I'm feeling. I think I can't stand him, but sometimes...
DAWN You love him?
BUFFY No. II feel for him.
DAWN Feel what, exactly?
BUFFY Dawn...
DAWN No, I'mI'm just trying to understand. I mean, none of it makes sense. First you say Spike disgusts you, but secretly you two are doing it like bunnies. And then Spike says he'd die for you, but he tries to rape you.
BUFFY For the record, Spike knew how wrong it was. That's why he went away.
DAWN But to get a soul? Like that would make him a better man? Xander had a soul when he stood Anya up at the altar. And now he says he still wants her? I just don't think it's the school basement that's making people crazy.
BUFFY I should really get back. You comin' with?
DAWN I just don't see why people bother. I mean, you put all this energy into chasing and having and brooding and I just don't understand these relationships where you all do insane things.
BUFFY Bye, rant girl.
DAWN Well, you could, like, paint a beautiful mural on every ugly wall in the world, and then you could paint a beautiful mural on every ugly mural in the wor
ANYA Maybe I'm not even the right Anyanka. Ever think about that? There's tons of Anyanka's out there. Maybe one of them pissed off this, uh what did you say his name was? D'Hoffryneffer...
BUFFY Good thing I stopped by and heard screaming. So, I guess D'Hoffryn decided to take you out after all?
ANYA Yeah. He's, uh, not head of vengeance for nothing. Well, thank you for the generous life-saving. Now please go away. Look, I don't need anyone's help. Or, OK, clearly I do, but I don't want to need anyone's help, so stop helping.
BUFFY I get it. After last week, you feel you need to be all renegade and broody. Taking yourself out of the loop
ANYA I need to figure out who I am.
BUFFY Another, something bad is happening. I don't want my friends out there alone right now, OK?
ANYA Well, I-I guess you guys could use my help. Willow's not very good with the practical strategizingexcept when she's evil. And Dawnshe's not really good for anything.
CHEERLEADER_ON_CRUTCHES You guys, I've been thinking about it, and I think I can still cheer. I mean, I could use a chair or we all could, like the Laker Girls.
CHEERLEADER_FRIEND Oh, honey, you need to concentrate on getting better. Don't worry. We'll find a replacement for you tomorrow.
CHEERLEADER_ON_CRUTCHES I just feel like I let you down.
DAWN Hey, R.J.
CHEERLEADER_FRIEND Oh, Dawn.
R.J. Hey, Summers.
DAWN Um, so I-I-I was wondering. You had Mr. Gurin for English back at your old school, right?
R.J. We all did.
DAWN I have him this year.What a drag.
R.J. I actually kinda liked him.
DAWN Right! Right. No, no, I like him. It's just, you know, I meant drag in a good, fun way.
JOCK_FRIEND So, um, are the tryouts tomorrow? You're gonna make the new girls jump up and down a lot, right?
CHEERLEADER_FRIEND God, gross! A vending machine fell on Cheryl and all you can think about is new cheerleaders?
DAWN Hey, um, so, you know, I heard someone saying yesterday that we're gonna go all the way to the championships this year. In football.
R.J. Yeah, we actually have a good shot, considering we're a new team.
JOCK_FRIEND Yeah, well if you can get us past Highland, we've got a good shot.
R.J. Oh, like you could do better.
JOCK_FRIEND We'll see.
R.J. Wait, you actually think Coach'd start you at quarterback over me?
JOCK_FRIEND I'm just saying...
DAWN The quarterback is like the most important member of the team. He is like the rudder that guides the ship.
R.J. Right. Could I give you a hand with that?
CHEERLEADER_ON_CRUTCHES Would you really?
CHEERLEADER_FRIEND It's OK, she can do it herself.
R.J. Hey, we're all on the same team, all right?
DAWN Yeah, you're all on the team. We'll talk later, guys. That's cool.
CHEERLEADER_WANNABE_#1 Gooooo Razorbacks!
CHEERLEADER_FRIEND OK. Awesome. Thank you. Up next, we haveDawn Summers. Nice outfit.
DAWN Razorbacks, razorbacks, we're gonna play, we got a secret weapon and his name is R.J. Hear us cheer, hear us yell, listen what we say, razorbacks, razorbacks, go R.J.!
CHEERLEADER_FRIEND OK. Thank you. Very... spirited.
BUFFY Come on, Dawnie. Come out. Dawn, sweetheart, it's not that bad.
DAWN How would you even know? R.J.'s never gonna notice me now.
BUFFY From what you said, I'm sure he already noticed you, I mean with the falling and thespirit. Spirit. They said you were spirited, right?
DAWN Go away!
BUFFY Dawn...
XANDER Things are a lot better, I see.
BUFFY I don't think tonight's gonna be good for videos, Xand.
XANDER Right, with the wailing and the crying... Still better than a cozy evening with Spike. Shall I order a pizza? Don't teens in a snit like pizza?
DAWN It is not a snit! I-I finally met himthey guy of my dreams, OKand I blew it. R.J. hates me now.
BUFFY Dawn, what is that?
DAWN Just the end of my life.
XANDER Remember when she used to have a crush on me? I miss the much cuter me crush.
BUFFY You shredded my outfit.
DAWN I'll buy you a new one.
BUFFY That's not the point. I don't want a new cheerleading outfit.
XANDER Now, now, let's not be hasty. Not the right time.
BUFFY Dawn, I'm sorry that you feel so bad. OK, but in the morning this won't seem so terrible. You don't even know this R.J. Not really.
DAWN I do know him. I know his soul.
BUFFY Really? Dawn, he wasn't even on your radar yesterday.
XANDER It's the jacket. It's true. Something about the big letter on the chest makes girls get all swoony and crushy. I saw it all the time in school. And you couldn't just pin any old felt letter to your coat and get play not that I tried.
DAWN It isn't a crush. It's love. I love R.J.
BUFFY Again, since yesterday. Dawn, it's awfully fast.
DAWN What? You're telling me I don't feel what I feel?
BUFFY No, of course not. I believe that you think it's real. It seems real... to you.
DAWN You know what? Maybe I don't want advice from the Dysfunction Queen. You have no idea how I feel. You have no idea what real love is. Maybe if you did, you wouldn't make fun of me this way.
BUFFY Dawn, I'm not making fun of you.
DAWN Just go. Leave me alone.
JOCK_FRIEND I talked with the coach.
R.J. Yeah? I told you manall those fumbles in practicehe was gonna come down on you.
JOCK_FRIEND I'm starting on Saturday.
R.J. Great. Who knew fumbling all the time was the key?
JOCK_FRIEND It's just time to let someone else have a turn, man. And you knew this was coming.
R.J. Yeah. Sure.
DAWN You can't do this to R.J.
JOCK_FRIEND Oh, hey, it's you. Nice cheering the other day.
DAWN It isn't fair. He works so hard.
JOCK_FRIEND What do you care? I mean, this is how the game is played. It's dog eat dog, may the best man win.
DAWN But nobody's better than R.J.
JOCK_FRIEND Yeah, well, that's not really up to you, is it? Hmm?
DAWN It all happened so fast. I mean, one minute he was walking, and the next he stumbled, and then he fell.
PRINCIPAL Why would he say you pushed him down the stairs?
DAWN I don't know. Maybe he was just embarrassed. It's hard being clumsy, especially when you're popular and athletic. I'd bet.
PRINCIPAL Yeah, well, to be candid, it wouldn't be the first time I caught O'Donnell in a lie.
BUFFY It'd be nice if his lies didn't involve my sister, though.
PRINCIPAL Anyway, I'm gonna have to call Coach Wheeler and, uh, tell him the bad news. Not a conversation I really want to have.
DAWN At least you still got R.J. to take over.
PRINCIPAL Yeah. Well, I think we have everything we need for now. I'm sorry you had to get involved in this, Dawn.
DAWN That's OK. I'm just really sorry it happened.
R.J. Summers! Hey.
DAWN Hi.
R.J. I heard Wood hauled you into his office.
DAWN Well, yeah.
R.J. About O'Donnell?
DAWN Yes.
R.J. That sucks, facing the whole inquisition thing.
DAWN Yeah. No one expects the Spanish Inquisition. God, it's like I have a disease or something. It was really no big deal.
R.J. No. It was. I think it's cool that you faced him. Wood.
DAWN We just talked. He just wanted me to tell him about... the accident.
R.J. Yeah. It sucks when these things just happenout of nowhere.
DAWN Right. Out of nowhere.
R.J. You know, I was thinking of heading out tonight, after practice. You want to meet up?
DAWN Uh... hmm...
XANDER Well, Spike definitely seems a little more cogent, less bl-bl-bl-bl-bl. I'm just saying... once you get back the soul, doesn't that mean you start, like, picking up your own wet towels off the floor?
WILLOW No, but maybe you start to feel really bad about leaving them there.
BUFFY At least he's showering, and that's a refreshing and delightful change.
XANDER Buff.
BUFFY I think that's the guy.
WILLOW What guy?
BUFFY The one who, according to Dawn, is the quote smartest, funniest, coolest, hottest, and having the thickest boy eyelashes boy in school unquote.
XANDER He don't seem so tough.
WILLOW Check out the fan club.
XANDER Daddy like.
BUFFY What is that shirt made of? Paint?
WILLOW Buff
BUFFY Glad Dawnie isn't here to see her precious boyfriend getting all thrusty with some slut-bag hussy
BUFFY Oh.
XANDER Oh. Oh! No! Daddy No, I wasn't When I was looking, I wasn't Oh, God!
WILLOW Right there with ya.
BUFFY So, do you have plans later, or are you just gonna go down to the docks and wait for the fleet to come in?
DAWN What?
BUFFY Where do I start with the bad? First, you told me you were going to the library. Second, you do not go out on a date without informing me first. Third, Anna Nicole Smith makes you look tacky.
DAWN Yeah, well I think I look hot, and so does R.J.
BUFFY Oh, I bet he does. Maybe I should go have a little word with him.
DAWN No! Don't you dare embarrass me in front of him.
BUFFY I don't like this. This boy has you acting crazy.
DAWN It's my life. I'll do what I want to.
BUFFY I don't think so.
DAWN Oh. So, whatsuddenly you're Mom now?
BUFFY No, I'm not. And I am glad she's not here to see you like this. Look, I'm sorry. I just
DAWN You just can't handle it.
BUFFY What?
DAWN You've always been the special one. Hot little Buffy with her boyfriends. The Slayer. And now someone likes me, and you just can't stand that I'm getting the attention.
BUFFY That is the farthest thing from true.
DAWN No it's not. And I'm sorry, but I like the way R.J. makes me feel, and if you think that makes me a slut or whatever, I don't care.
BUFFY Oh, no, no, no. You are not going back out on that dance floor.
DAWN R.J.?
CHEERLEADER_FRIEND I know what you're doing, slut. I saw you. I saw you with R.J.!
DAWN So? We were just dancing.
CHEERLEADER_FRIEND Right? You think I'm stupid? You're gonna back off now.
DAWN You know what's sad? A girl who can't move on when she's been dumped.
CHEERLEADER_FRIEND He didn't dump me!
BUFFY OK, first with the lap dance, now with the cat fight. Hey, you wanna get drunk and barf next?
DAWN Let go of me. This isn't finished.
CHEERLEADER_FRIEND I'll never let you have him, bitch. R.J. is mine. I mean it! Stay away from him!
BUFFY Well, at least someone agrees you shouldn't be dating this guy.
PRINCIPAL How 'bout if you try doing your own homework for a change? No more getting these young, impressionable women to do it for you. Avoid detention, R.J. Sound good?
R.J. Whatever.
PRINCIPAL Oh, sweet infectious enthusiasm.
BUFFY Whoa. Hang on there, slappy. I'm not done with you yet.
R.J. Oh, man. Like it's not bad enough I got that guy riding my back all the time. Now I gotta deal with you, too?
BUFFY Actually, I'm a bit more formidable than Mr. Wood. You might come to look fondly on his back-riding.
R.J. Yeah, but come on
BUFFY Sit.
R.J. Hey, I told him I was sorry about the homework.
BUFFY Mmm... not the homework, Mr. Wizard. The girls. What you're doing to them. In specific, my sister.
R.J. Hey, I didn't do anything to your sister. And you saw how hot she looked last night. I think that proved that she
BUFFY Aah! No more with the talky. Look, I know how guys like you work. You turn on the charm, you get whatever you want, no matter who gets in your way, right?
R.J. OK, look, it's not like that. I just get along really well with girls.
BUFFY Oh, I see how you get along. Oh, look at me, I'm Mr. Quarterback. I crush little girls and all their little feelings. All I have to do is lead a team of high school athletes trying their best to do a good job. Everyone depending on me. That is a lot of pressure. But it doesn't mean you get to disregard other people's feelings.
R.J. It's not like I meant to hurt anyone.
BUFFY I know. I know that. It's just you're a leader, a captain, OK? People look up to you. You need to keep that in mind when you I bet you run a lot, huh? I mean, they work you pretty hard, don't they?
R.J. Yeah, I guess so.
BUFFY I get that. I do. I'm there. Or at least I was there when I was still in high school. Which I was, just a couple of years ago, really. You know, I just realized that I'm basically the same age as you. I'm not really older at all, actually. Just like you, but with the sexual experience and stuff.
R.J. I think I hear what you're saying.
BUFFY Um, right, I'mI'm really glad that w-we had this talk, so, uh, I think you'd better to get back to class.
R.J. OK. Thanks.
BUFFY Dawn. You wanna come talk to me?
DAWN Ambush.
BUFFY I wanted to tell you that I talked to R.J. today. He's OK. I think he likes you.
DAWN Really? Tell me what he said about meevery wordincluding intonation and facial expressions.
BUFFY Well, he thinks you're-you're funny and-and pretty and interesting. Didn't have a thing to say against you.
DAWN Yes, he did. I can tell.
BUFFY The tiniest thing. He might have said that you came on a little strong.
DAWN Oh, my God! I'm the pushy queen of slut town.
BUFFY No, honey, honey, not at all. No, no. It's justyou know, lay back a little. Let him come to you.
DAWN I'm just scared that while I'm laying back, some other girl's gonna come and sweep him up.
BUFFY But we have inside info. We know he doesn't like being swept. He likes to be the sweeper. Dawn, you're gonna come out the winner here, with me looking out for you.
DAWN Yeah, I guess so. Thank you.
TEACHER So we do know that
TEACHER , so we can solve for
TEACHER in terms of iso
BUFFY Sorry to interrupt, but we need to see R.J. Brooks down in the guidance office.
R.J. There's no one here.
BUFFY Yeah, there is. There's one of you, and there's one of me. You were the one in math class. Tell me what that adds up to.
DAWN I'm not coming on too strong if I just look at him.
BUFFY I've always been fascinated by football. So, what's it like to lead a team?
R.J. The thing of it is: the time. Nobody gets how much time goes into it, with practices and games.
BUFFY I totally get it. I was kinda juggling some stuff when I was in high school, toowhich was also very recent. Principal Snyder was always on me.
R.J. I still say Wood's the worst. You haven't seen the way that guy rides me. I wish somebody'd get him off my back.
BUFFY Yeah, that would be cool.
R.J. And sometimes, I didn't even do anything wrong
R.J. You're like a teacher.
BUFFY Not really. But, I mean, does it bother you?
R.J. Not so much.
XANDER Dawn? What's wrong? Is this Did that guy in the jacket
DAWN Uh! I don't even want to hear his name anymore!
XANDER I just called him that guy in the jacket.
DAWN That's what I used to call him in my head before I knew his real name!
XANDER Dawnie, honey, you seem extremely perturbed. Maybe I should go get Buffy
DAWN No! I don't ever want to see her again.
XANDER I thought that was about that guy in the um, that guy with the thing.
DAWN No, it's about both of them.
XANDER Buffy, I think Dawn needs y Uuh!
BUFFY Xander, hi. This is R.J.
R.J. Hey, guy. It's called knocking.
XANDER I'm sorry. It's just checkout time was an hour ago. We were hoping to make up the bed. Also, it's a classroom, you chowder-head! Now get off the boy, Buffy. We're going home.
BUFFY Dawn, please stop crying. Please? Crying isn't going to make his love for me go away, you know.
XANDER Listen, you're under a love spell. That's what this has to be.
BUFFY You're right. He's right.You're under a spell. Oh, poor little Dawnie.
WILLOW But we're working on it. It'll be better soon.
ANYA Yes. Soon neither one of you will be in love with this boy.
BUFFY He's not a boy.
DAWN What do you know about our love? It's true and real. This isn't magic. This is my heart.
ANYA Fine.
XANDER We'll be working.
WILLOW Look, I know this feels terrible, but it isn't real. Try to hold onto that.
BUFFY Did you hear that? It isn't real. You're just crazy.
DAWN It is so real! I love him. You knew how I feltlike I finally found something, and you betrayed me.
BUFFY I betrayed you? You're the one that constructed this elaborate fantasy about you and my lover.
DAWN Your lover? You're lover!
WILLOW Guys Guys
BUFFY I tried to get you to back away.
DAWN That's right! You lied to me!
BUFFY Did you want me to tell you that he's in love with me? That your little crush is hopeless?
DAWN It's not a crush! Stop. You're not supposed to do this.
BUFFY Why? Because he's younger than me? You know, I'm extremely youthful. And peppy.
DAWN No, because you were the one I trusted.
BUFFY Dawn, wait!
ANYA Crazy little lust puppies, aren't they?
XANDER Well, at least the yelling went away. It was starting to sound like Christmas morning with my family.
WILLOW Love spells. People forget how dangerous they can be.
XANDER Hey, been there...
XANDER Good times.
WILLOW Here. Something.
BUFFY She's locked her door. That spell has her good and loopy.
WILLOW Info on one R.J. Brooks.
BUFFY Oh, lemme see. Is there a picture?
XANDER Family stuff. Hey, I knew his brother. He was a big jock at Sunnydale High too. Couple years ahead of us. He used to stick chewing gum in my hair. Huh.
WILLOW What're you thinking?
XANDER Well, I think my relationship with R.J.'s brother was complex at best, but...maybe he's a way in.
BUFFY Now, look for a picture.
XANDER I'm just saying, we'rewe're tangling with a powerful spell here. We don't know what the deal is soso keep an eye out if this guy looks twitchy. And don't let this guy charm you, either. He had everyone around him practically kissing his ring back in high school.
BROTHER Yeah?
BROTHER Construction, huh? That's awesome.
XANDER Yeah.
BROTHER So, what's up with R.J.? How's he doing at the old alpha mater?
XANDER Good. It's just I know a girl that might be going out with him and I was wondering
BROTHER God, and you want to know if he's a good guy. Truth is, he's the best. Following in my footsteps. You might not know it now, looking at me with a couple of extra pounds, but back then, I was quite the guy.
XANDER Yeah, I gather that R.J. is pretty popular, too.
BROTHER I gotta tell ya. There was a time I was worried about R.J. He was into comic books, Model U.N., geek stuffno offense, Harris.
BROTHER One time, I found all this poetry under his bed. Turns out, he wrote it. Then he, uhwhat do you call it? Blossomed. That's what it was like.
XANDER And do you have any idea why he, you know, burst into a flower all of a sudd?
SPIKE You're wearing your brother's jacket. Here, in this picture.
BROTHER Oh, no, dude. He's wearing mine. That jacket was with me all the way through high school. Gave it to him when I graduated, right before I started over at the Pizza Barn. I'm in the management program.
XANDER So, Lance, where did you get the jacket?
LANCE/BROTHER Oh, dad gave it to me. Made a big deal about it, too. How he met mom wearing that jacket. She was a former Miss Arkansas. Very hot in her day.
XANDER Wow, that's wonderful. Boy, it's getting late.
LANCE Hey, you guys don't have to take off if you don't want too. I got sort of a rumpus room set up in the basement. There's air hockey and a mini fridge. We could party.
MRS._BROOKS Lance? Do you have guests down there? There's little boxes or raisins if you want snacks.
XANDER We really gotta go.
WILLOW Damn love spell. I have tried every anti-love spell spell I could find.
ANYA Even if you find the right one, the guy would probably just do an anti-anti-love spell spell... spell.
WILLOW What? I'll get it. Maybe it's Xander with some answers from the brother.
WILLOW Oh, you have to be
R.J. I was looking for Buffy. Miss Summers.
WILLOW Buffy's not here. Go away!
R.J. Are you sure?
ANYA No Buffy for you. Leave quickly now.
R.J. Uh-huh. OK. Tell her to call me.
WILLOW Man...
ANYA Good thing Buffy and Dawn are upstairs. If they knew he was here...
WILLOW But you don't even know him!
ANYA Yes, I do. I looked into him and saw his soul.
WILLOW He was walking away, so unless his soul was in his ass
ANYA A.J. is my best friend and my dearest darling
WILLOW It's R.J. And what you were picking up on was his deep caring and devotion to me.
DAWN What's going on?
ANYA Willow thinks she's in love with my boyfriend, R.J.
DAWN What? No! You two can't do this.
BUFFY Willow, you're a gay womanand he isn't.
WILLOW This isn't about his physical presence. It's about his heart.
ANYA His physical presence has a penis!
WILLOW I can work around it!
DAWN This isn't fair! How can you all be doing this to me?
BUFFY OK, wait. Everyone wait. Just calm down, OK? I-I think I know what this is. Clearly, you've both been affected by the same love spell that got Dawn.
DAWN Uh! This isn't a spell. He owns my heart.
BUFFY Dawn, be quiet. We're trying to work this out. We don't need you interfering.
WILLOW There's a simple answer to this. Just think about who loves him the most. Clearly I do, since I'm willing to look past the whole orientation thing.
DAWN I need him.
ANYA Well, you're gonna have to do better than thatI'd kill for him.
WILLOW You'd kill for a chocolate bar.
BUFFY No. Yes! Kill for him. I'm the slayer. Slayer means kill. Oh, I'll kill the principal.
ANYA Ooh, that is hard to top.
WILLOW Yeah, well I have skills. I can prove my love with magic.
ANYA Yeah, right. What're you gonna douse magic to make him into a girl? Damn.
ANYA Ooh, I know what he'll like.
BUFFY Sorry, Dawnie. You're never gonna get him.
DAWN No. Never.
WILLOW Oh, Hecate, I call on you. I humbly ask your will be done. Hear my request, a simple change, create a daughter from a s
WILLOW Oh, man! Now I've gotta start all over. Hecate hates that.
XANDER What the hell are you doing?
WILLOW Proving I love R.J. the most!
XANDER Will, honey... R.J.'s a guy.
WILLOW I did notice that, yeah. 'S why I'm doing my spell, 'cause, you know, he doesn't have to be. Now, hand me back my crystals. I don't have much time.
XANDER Much time before what?
WILLOW Before Buffy and Anya and Dawn have a chance to prove that they love R.J. the most.
XANDER And how are they gonna do that, exactly?
WILLOW Well, Buffy's gonna kill Principal Wood, Any
XANDER Fine, OK, let's start there.
BUFFY Hey! What are you guys doing?
WILLOW Locator spell. Human variety. Almost done.
BUFFY Well, I've got a principal to kill. What's going on? Who are we looking for?
BUFFY You realize that Anya's probably seducing R.J. even as we speak.
WILLOW My God. You think so?
BUFFY Well, I wouldn't put it past her. She's recently evil, you know.
WILLOW Well, so am I. Why should I miss out?
XANDER Hey, crazy chickslook.
BUFFY Dawn? Dawn!
WILLOW Buffy!
BUFFY What were you doing? I mean, what is this?
DAWN It doesn't matter.
BUFFY This is the plan? You're gonna steal R.J. by being trisected?!
DAWN What am Igonna compete with you? You're older and hotter and have sex that's rough and kill people. I don't have any of that stuff. But if I did this then his whole life he'd know there was someone that loved him so much they'd give up their life.
BUFFY Dawn...
DAWN And it would be true forever.
BUFFY No guy is worth your lifenot ever.
DAWN R.J. is. And don't say he isn't. Look what you were willing to do.
BUFFY Dawn, I would give him to you in a second if I could. That's how much you're scaring me.
DAWN But II thought you wanted him... for you.
BUFFY Nah. Well, yeah. My God, that boy is hot. Sorry. I think I might be under a spell here.
DAWN I hear ya.
XANDER Now, you're sure you understand the plan?

DAWN I'm just so... the way I acted, the way I talked to you. I feel so stupid. All over a spell.
BUFFY Get ready to feel even stupider when it's not.
WILLOW Hey, Anya, you never told us what you can't believe you almost.
ANYA Almost who, now?
WILLOW No, you can't be the only not embarrassed one. What did you do?
ANYA I, uh, wrote a poem. An epic poem... comparing him to a daisy and a tower and a lake.
RADIO_ANNOUNCER And now the latest on Sunnydale's late-night bandit who is still at large. A masked thief held up a number of large businesses
ANYA OK, great, ice cream. My treat.
