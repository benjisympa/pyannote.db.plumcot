GILES Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer:
ANDREW You're just scared.
JONATHAN Of course I'm scared. Last time we were here, 33.3bar percent of us were flayed alive.
WARREN Nice job.
ANDREW Do you have any idea how hard it's been to act this cool?
WARREN Now, that death thing was all part of the master plan. If short round pulls off his end of the bargain, we'll both become gods.
DAWN I saw Mom.
JOYCE Things are coming, Dawn.
DAWN Why are you?
JOYCE When it's bad, Buffy won't choose you.
WILLOW It wasn't her.
DAWN What?
WILLOW It's the Big Bad, Dawn. The one we knew was coming.
BUFFY What the hell happened?
WILLOW This big evil that's been promising to devour uswell I think it's started chomping.
BUFFY Oh, God.
WILLOW Buffy, this thing knows us. It made us think that we were talking to people we knew.
SPIKE I'm just a guy with his ear to the ground, but even I can feel it. Something's coming. I don't know what exactly, but something's brewing. And it's so big, ugly and damned it makes you and me look like little bitty puzzle pieces.
WILLOW Buffy, he's been feeding... on human blood. That's gotta do stuff.
BUFFY I think there was something there, talking to him, making him do things.
SPIKE-2 How could you use a poor maid so?
BUFFY Spike!
SPIKE I remember.
SPIKE I killed, and I can feel 'em. I can feel every one of them.
BUFFY There's something playing with us.
SPIKE Why is it doing this to me?
BUFFY I don't know.
SPIKE Help me.
BUFFY I'll help you.
BUFFY This thing has been closer to Spike than any of us.
WILLOW And if you want to understand it....
BUFFY I'm gonna have to get close to Spike.
GILES Robson, are you here? Robson!
GILES Dear God, I thought you
ROBSON Gather them.
GILES What?
ROBSON It's started.
GILES It's all right. I understand. I'll take care of it
DAWN So the basement was filled with bodies?
WILLOW Apparently.
DAWN And Spike could've sired countless others and buried them around town. And we're waiting for him to do what, exactly? Do something crazy?
WILLOW It's not that simple.
ANYA Shouldn't we stab him through the chest? Isn't that what we do when these things happen?
WILLOW Look, Buffy knows what she's doing.
ANYA Well, Xander, you know what we're all talking about. I mean, you've always been part of the Spike is evil faction.
XANDER I've got a house to put back together.
ANYA Fine. You guys keep your heads buried in the sand, but I think we should prepare ourselves for the possibility that William the Bloody is back.
WARREN All right. Looking good. How do you feel?
ANDREW Good.
WARREN Excellent. We've got work to do.
ANDREW I have to do work right now? Can't I just walk around for a while in my coat?
WARREN Don't go soft on me now. We're right in the trench, and the exhaust port's in sight.
ANDREW I thought that was it. I did what you told me. It's not my fault it didn't work. Why do I have to do all the wet works?
WARREN Hey! You know the rules. I can't take corporeal form. Here, feel. Mm-hmm.
ANDREW Cool.
WARREN Pretty bitchin', right? I'm like Obi Wan?
ANDREW Or Patrick Swayze.
WARREN Believe me, I would do this stuff if I could. I can't. I need you. You're my iron fist.
ANDREW I just don't think I can kill anybody else.
JONATHAN Oh, will you stop whining about that?
ANDREW I didn't want to kill you. Warren made me.
JONATHAN Hey, I'm glad he did. This is the best thing that's ever happened to me.
ANDREW It didn't hurt too much? I-I'm not very good at stabbing.
JONATHAN You know, it wasn't that bad. It was like a sharp pain, then a burning, then a general queasiness. It's kinda like when I used to get ulcers in high school, only at the end I became one with light and hope.
ANDREW I can't do it. I can't do it anymore.
JONATHAN Hey, this isn't your fault, OK. It's my fault the ritual didn't work. I screwed up. I'm littleI-I don't have as much blood as other people. And I probably should've told someone I was anemic. Don't worry. We're gonna fix it. You gotta trust us. We know what we're doing.
ANDREW I can't kill anybody else.
JONATHAN OK, calm down. We can work around that.
BUFFY We're gonna get to the bottom of this. We just can't take any chances.
SPIKE Don't... Make it tighterthe knots'll give. I get free, someone's gonna die.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Now, guys, look, we can settle this one of two ways. You can repaint the walls, or I can suspend you and report this little incident on your permanent record.
PUNK_#1 Fine. Do that.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD OK, I was bluffing. I hadn't really thought that one through. Listen, this whole permanent record thing is such a myth anyway. Colleges never ask for anything past your SAT scores, and it's not like employers are gonna be calling up to check to see how many days you missed back in high school. So, listen, I-I could suspend you, but that would mean calling your parents, alerting your teachers, filling out paperwork, and, quite possibly, having to talk to the school boardall of which sounds positively exhausting to me. No. No, I think it would be much easier if I just called the police, let them deal with it. Oh, and, in case you're wondering, this is the part where I'm not bluffing.
PUNK_#2 We'll repaint it.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Good job. Excuse me. Miss Summers. I'm with students.
DAWN I just wanted to tell you that Buffy won't be coming in today. She's really sick.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Oh, no.
DAWN Yeah, last night she was vomiting, and then this morning she was vomiting some more, and then, just when we thought she was done, she was vomiting again.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Yeah, we got that stomach flu going around.
DAWN Her exact words were, I've got stuff coming out of both ends.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Thank you. That's very helpful.
DAWN Sure. No problem. Hey, guys. How's it going?
PUNK_#2 Pretty good.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Um, tell your sister not to worry about it. We'll soldier on without her here. Just, um, tell her to concentrate on getting better.
DAWN Yeah, she'll be fine. She just needs to get some stuff out of her system.
BUFFY Can I do something?
SPIKE I think you should probably go
BUFFY Here.
BUFFY He's been feasting on humans for weeks. He's having some pretty bad withdrawls. I think we need to get him some blood.
WILLOW Do you want me to kill Anya?
BUFFY No, we should probably try to wean him off humans. He'll have to make do with animal blood.
WILLOW I'll go get some.
BUFFY You don't mind?
WILLOW No, I have to get out of the house. Xander's installing the new windows, and he keeps giving lectures on proper tool maintenance. Tool talknot my thing.
BUFFY Thank you.
WILLOW How're you doing in there?
BUFFY He's in pretty bad shape, past the point where he can tell me anything.
WILLOW I wasn't asking about him.
BUFFY I'll be OK.
WARREN Cut her deep. Cut her quick. It'll be over before she knows what hit her.
ANDREW What if she squeals?
WARREN Uh, better go for her throat first.
ANDREW was really underrated.
WARREN Don't think about Babe.
ANDREW Right.
WARREN You're Conan. You're the destroyer. It's you against nature. You're the hunter, you're primal, you live off the land. You're Andrew. Everyone knows you. You play by your own rules. It's kill or be killed.
ANDREW That'll do, pig!
WARREN Noyou gottayou gotta corner it. Stay between it and the hall, or it That's the worst attempted pig slaughtering I've ever seen.
ANDREW I'm not very good at stabbing. Isn't there some other way we could get blood?
BUTCHER Number 87.
ANDREW I'd like 12 pork chops, 2 pounds of sausage, 8 quarts of pigs blood, 3 steaks, um, halibut, and, uh, some toothpaste
BUTCHER This is a butcher's shop, Neo. We don't sell toothpaste.
ANDREW Um, OKjust the other stuff then.
BUTCHER You got it.
ANDREW Hi. Ooh, steak sauce.
BUTCHER Number 88.
WILLOW Wait a minute!
ANDREW Don't kill me!
WILLOW I'm not gonna kill you.
ANDREW Don't torture me and send me to an eternal pain dimension.
WILLOW I'm not gonna.
ANDREW Warren killed Tara. I didn't do it. And he was aiming for Buffy anyway.
WILLOW Not making it better.
ANDREW And you got your revenge. You killed my best friend. We're even.
WILLOW Even? You think I get satisfaction from what I did?
ANDREW Maybe not, but let me keep my skin, OK? I'm not bad. I'm not bad anymore. I'm good. I do good things now.
WILLOW Then, why do you need lots and lots of blood?
ANDREW I am bad. I'm bad, I'm evil, but I'm protected by powerful forces. Forces you can't even begin to imagine, little girl. If you harm me, you shall know the wrath of he that is darkness and terror. Your blood will boil, and you will know true suffering. Stand down, she-Witch. Your defeat is at hand
WILLOW Shut your mouth. I am a she-witch, a very powerful she-witch, or witch, as is more accurate. I'm not to be trifled with
ANDREW But I
WILLOW I'm talking. Don't interrupt me, insignificant man. I am Willow. I am death. If you dare defy me, I will call down my fury, exact fresh vengeance, and make your worst fears come true. OK?
WILLOW Look who I found.
XANDER Oh, this can't be good.
WILLOW Guess who was buying mass amounts of blood at the butcher's shop.
ANDREW Hey, your hair's not even black anymore.
XANDER What're you doing back in town?
ANDREW You'll get nothing out of me, carpenter.
XANDER We'll see about that.
ANDREW Careful with my coat. It's expensive.
ANYA Is it new?
ANDREW Hey. Ow!
XANDER Now, we can do this the hard way, if you want. But believe me if I tell you, this will go much easier if you just tell us what you know.
ANDREW Ow. You're barking up the wrong asparagus, man. I don't know anything.
XANDER Here's the thing. I don't believe you.
ANDREW I haven't done anything wrong.
XANDER Well, then, you won't mind if we ask you a few questions.
ANDREW Yeah, OK.
XANDER Why were you buying blood at the butcher shop?
ANDREW I fell in love with a beautiful vampire girl down in Me-hi-co. Now we're trying to make a go of it on the straight and narrow, and put our lives back together here in Sunnydale.
ANYA You think this is a game, junior? People are dying. Friends lives are in danger.
XANDER Hey, Anya.
ANYA Now you want to waste time on deceptions? Not on my watch!
XANDER Hey, Anya! Can I talk to you outside for a second?
ANYA Did you see that? I actually made him cry.
XANDER You were perfect. I was worried I overdid it with the whole easy way, hard way thing.
ANYA No, you were great! And I wasn't sure if I should slap him, but then he made me want to slap him, so I thought, OK, slap him!
XANDER He'll be singing in no time.
ANYA So, what do we do now?
XANDER Now, we let him stew in his own juices for a bit, then we give him the hard brace.
ANYA Right. What's the status with your guy?
BUFFY He's not talking yet. We'll get there. How's your guy?
ANYA The weasel wants to sing. He just needs a tune.
XANDER He's primed. I'll be pumping him in no time. He'll give us information soon.
BUFFY Better? Good.
SPIKE I don't remember anything.
BUFFY Well, you were having pretty bad withdrawal.
SPIKE No, not that. I don't remember... what I did.
BUFFY Nothing?
SPIKE It's all flashes here and there. It's like I'm watching someone else...do it, kill people. I've been losing time for a while now, waking up in strange places.
BUFFY When did your chip stop working?
SPIKE I wasn't aware that it had, you know. Not 'til now.
BUFFY And the losing time? How long has that been going on?
SPIKE Oh, things have been wonky since I got back, ever since
BUFFY You got your soul.
SPIKE Figured that's what it was like, it'd been so long since I had one.
BUFFY How did you do it? How'd you get your soul back?
SPIKE Saw a man about a girl. I went to seek a legend out. Traveled to the other side of the world, made a deal with a demon.
BUFFY Just like that?
SPIKE No, not just like that. There was a price. There were trials, torture, pain and suffering... of sorts.
BUFFY Of sorts?
SPIKE Well, it's all relative, isn't it?
BUFFY Meaning?
SPIKE Meaning I have come to redefine the words pain and suffering since I fell in love with you.
BUFFY How can you say that?
SPIKE Apparently, I just slaughtered half of Sunnydale, pet. I'm not really worried about being polite anymore.
BUFFY So, that's what this is about. You feeling sorry for yourself, Spike?
SPIKE I'm feeling honest with myself. You used me.
BUFFY Yes.
SPIKE You told me that, of course. I never understood it though. Not until now. You hated yourself, and you took it out on me.
BUFFY You figured that out just now?
SPIKE Soul's not all about moonbeams and pennywhistles, luv. It's about self-loathing. I get it. Had to travel 'round the world, but I understand you now. I understand the violence inside.
BUFFY Violence? William the Bloody now has insight into violence?
SPIKE Not the same. As bad as I was, as evil and as wretched as I was, I never truly hated myself back then. Not like I do now.
XANDER How's your face?
ANDREW OK.
XANDER Sorry about that. She shouldn't have hit you. Thirsty? Go on.
ANDREW That chick's psycho.
XANDER You don't know the half of it. She's a vengeance demon, you know. She's bad news.
ANDREW This one time I saw her having sex with Spike.
XANDER She's killed more men than smallpox.
ANDREW Does smallpox still kill people?
XANDER She's killed a lot of men. She tortures them. Anyone who incurs her wrath. One time she No, never mind.
ANDREW What?
XANDER It's not important.
ANDREW What'd she do?
XANDER Well, there was this one guythere was this one guy, he, uh, he hurt her real bad, so she paid him back. She killed him, but she did it real slow. See first she stopped his heart, then she replaced it with darkness, then she made him live his life like that. But he still had to go do his job and see his friends and wake up in the morning and go to bed at night, but he had to do it all empty. Without anything to look forward to. Ever.
ANDREW Sounds bad.
XANDER Well, then she tore out his intestines and rubbed it in his face and took pictures of it.
ANDREW Oh, God.
XANDER But she's downstairs now. Don't worry about her.
ANDREW What if
XANDER See, the thing is, we've all been a little on edge lately. Some bad things have been happening, and the girlsthey're all looking for someone to blame.
ANDREW I didn't do anything
ANYA You lying son of a bitch! You're gonna tell us what we need to know, and you're gonna tell us right now!
XANDER Anya no!
ANDREW Stop it!
ANYA Get off me, Harris! C'mere, you pipsqueak!
ANDREW Get her off me! I'll tell you! I'll tell you what you need to know!
BUFFY Excuse me.
SPIKE-2 Well, we've got ourselves a problem.
ANDREW Somebody help. Ow...
BUFFY Everything OK?
ANYA Fine.
BUFFY OK..
SPIKE What do I do, job half-done? Never send a boy to do a man's job. Oh, don't deceive me, Oh, never leave me.
BUFFY Who were you talking to?
SPIKE What's that?
BUFFY I heard you through the door. Who were you talking to?
SPIKE Nobody. I was just, uh, keeping myself company.
BUFFY Are you OK?
SPIKE Fine. How are you?
ANYA Now, you can talk, or I can keep hitting you. Believe me, I'd love to keep hitting you.
BUFFY Spike?
SPIKE I'm fine, Buffy. Really. I'm just...feeling a bit peckish, I suppose. Do you mind?
ANDREW ...We needed more blood to activate the seal of Danthaz
BUFFY He didn't seem to want anything to do with me. I mean, he just pushed me aside and charged at the wall.
WILLOW Are you hurt?
BUFFY Notnot really.
DAWN How is what's his name?
XANDER He's got a good chunk taken out of his neck, but he'll be all right. Had to tie him up again, but mainly just to keep him from scratching at his bandages. What the hell happened up there?
BUFFY I-I don't know. Spike and I were having a conversation, and he was fine. I mean, you know, fine as Spike can be. And then I went to check on you guys, and when I got back, it was like he was a completely different person.
WILLOW Different like William the Bloody type different?
BUFFY He was talking to someone. I heard through the door, he was having this conversation. And then he started singing.
ANYA Maybe it's another musical. A much crappier musical.
BUFFY Hehe mentioned something about a song in the cellar. Uh, a-and he changed there, tooI mean instantly became another person.
XANDER Trigger.
ANYA The horse?
XANDER No, in his head. It's a trigger. It's a brainwashing term. It's how the military makes sleeper agents. They-they brainwash operatives and condition them with a specific trigger, like a song, that makes 'em drastically change at a moment's notice.
WILLOW Is this left over from your days in the Army?
XANDER No, this is left over from every Army movie I've ever seen. But it makes sense. We've had ghosts or something haunting us, right? Well, what if Spike's ghosts have figured out a way tonot only haunt himwhat if they figured out how tohow to control him?
BUFFY Spike said he's been seeing things since I found him in the basement.
WILLOW So, he gets his soul back, he starts seeing spooky things, and he goes extra-extra-crazy.
BUFFY This trigger. How do we holstersafety, orI don't know guns. How do we make it stop?
XANDER Well, usually the operative completes his task and either blows his head off or steals a submarine.
BUFFY All right. I need information. If Spike's a bomb, then I need to know how to diffuse him. You two, I wanna know what did this to him. Spirits, ghosts, demonscheck the lot of them. Look for anything that could haunt or-or possibly control like this. I need to know exactly what we're dealing with.
SPIKE Did I hurt anybody?
BUFFY You took a good bite out of Andrew.
SPIKE Who?
BUFFY Tucker's brother.
SPIKE Oh.
BUFFY He'll be OK.
SPIKE I don't remember.
BUFFY It's OK.
SPIKE Buffy, I don't know why.
BUFFY We think we do. Something's playing you. Some ghost or demon has figured out how to control you. Got the gang researching it right now. Xander has this theory that you're being triggered.
SPIKE Kill me.
BUFFY What?
SPIKE Buffy, you have to kill me.
BUFFY You don't understand. When I left the room earlier, I heard you talking to someone
SPIKE Do you have any idea what I'm capable of?
BUFFY I was in the cellar with you. I saw what you did.
SPIKE I'm not talking about the cellar. The people in the cellar got off easy. I'm talking about me. Buffy, you have never met the real me.
BUFFY Believe me, I'm well aware of what you're capable of.
SPIKE No, you got off easy too. Do you know how much blood you can drink from a girl before she'll die? I do. You see, the trick is to drink just enough to know how to damage them just enough so that they'll still cry when you 'cause it's not worth it if they don't cry.
BUFFY It's not your fault. You're not the one doing this.
SPIKE I already did it. It's already done. You wanna know what I've done to girls Dawn's age? This is me Buffy. You've got to kill me before I get out.
BUFFY We can keep you locked up. Keep you here and we'll figure out
SPIKE Have you ever really asked yourself why you can't do it? Off me? After everything I've done to you, to people around you. It's not love. We both know that.
BUFFY You fought by my side. You've saved lives. You've helped
SPIKE Don't do that. Don't rationalize this into some noble act. We both know the truth of it. You like men who hurt you.
BUFFY No.
SPIKE You need the pain we cause you. You need the hate. You need it to do your job, to be the slayer.
BUFFY No. I don't hate like that. Not you, or myself. Not anymore. You think you have insight now because your soul's drenched in blood? You don't know me. You don't even know you. Was that you who killed those people in the cellar? Was that you who waited for those girls?
SPIKE There's no one else.
BUFFY That's not true. Listen to me. You're not alive because of hate or pain. You're alive because I saw you change. Because I saw your penance.
SPIKE Window dressing.
BUFFY Be easier, wouldn't it, it if were an act, but it's not. You faced the monster inside of you and you fought back. You risked everything to be a better man.
SPIKE Buffy...
BUFFY And you can be. You are. You may not see it, but I do. I do. I believe in you, Spike.
XANDER Buffy?
BUFFY Dawn?
XANDER She's OK. Is this it? I thought there was more of them.
BUFFY Spike.
XANDER They were so fast. And organized.
BUFFY They were after Spike all along.
XANDER And we were just in the way.
BUFFY I know these guys. I fought them before. We aren't being haunted. This isn't some demon. It's all the same thing. Spike's ghosts, the people you guys saw, from beneath us, it's all the same thing. I know what we're up against. The First.
WATCHER_AIDE_#1 They took our files, wiped out our records. We've lost contact with operations in Munich, Switzerland and Rome. We've got casualty confirmations coming in from as far away as Melbourne.
WATCHER_AIDE_#2 Sir, we are crippled.
QUENTIN_TRAVERS It's all right, Lydia. We are still masters of our fate, still captains of our souls.
WATCHER_AIDE_#2 Yes, sir.
QUENTIN_TRAVERS Ladies and gentlemen, our fears have been confirmed. The First Evil has declared all-out war on this institution. Their first volleys proved most effective. I, for one, think it's time we struck back. Give me confirmations on all remaining operatives. Visuals and tacticals. Highest alert. Get them here as soon as possible. Begin preparations for mobilization. Once we're accounted for, I want to be ready to move.
WATCHER_AIDE_#3 Sir?
QUENTIN_TRAVERS We'll be paying a visit to the hell mouth. My friends, these are the times that define us. Proverbs 24:6. O, by wise council, you shall make your war.
SPIKE/FIRST You'll have to excuse the spectacle, but I've always been a bit of a sucker for the old classics.
SPIKE Oh!
SPIKE/FIRST Oh, don't look at me that way. I wanted to do this more subtle-like. My Harbingers have a tendency to call attention to themselves.
SPIKE Oh!
SPIKE/FIRST You're the one who couldn't hold his end of the bargain. You're the one who couldn't take care of what's-his-name. You're the one who had to make breakthroughs and learn something about himself.
SPIKE Oh!
SPIKE/FIRST So now, fittingly, you're the one who gets to do the honors.
BUFFY/FIRST I have to admit, I'm glad it worked out this way. I was going to bleed Andrew, but you look a lot better with your shirt off.
BUFFY/FIRST To be honest, I'm getting a little tired of subtle. I think it's about time we brought some authority to our presence. Now, Spike, wanna see what a real vampire looks like?
