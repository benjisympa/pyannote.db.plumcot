GILES Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer
GILES Robson! Dear God, I thought you
ROBSON Gather them.
GILES I understand
DAWN I saw Mom.
WILLOW It's the Big Bad, Dawn. The one we knew was coming.
ANDREW I did what you told me. It's not my fault it didn't work.
WARREN I would do this stuff if I could.
ANDREW I just don't think I can kill anybody else.
JONATHAN It's my fault the ritual didn't work. I don't have as much blood as other people.
WILLOW Look who I found. Guess who was buying mass amounts of blood at the butcher's shop.
XANDER Just tell us what you know.
ANDREW Ow.
BUFFY I believe in you, Spike.
BUFFY They were after Spike all along.
BUFFY/FIRST I'm getting a little tired of subtle. It's about time we bring some authority to our presence. Now, Spike, wanna see what a real vampire looks like?
XANDER It's a loop...like the Mummy Hand. I'm doomed to replace these windows for all eternity. You know, maybe we should just board these up until things are less hellmouthy.
ANYA Nothing...and nothing. Cliff Notes to nothing. Nothing abridged...
WILLOW Yeah, my search isn't turning anything up either. Are you sure this thing called itself The First?
BUFFY Pretty sure. It claimed to be the original evil, the one that came before anything else.
ANYA Please, how many times have I heard that line in my demon days? I'm so rotten, they don't even have a word for it. I'm bad. Baddy bad bad bad. Does it make you horny? Or terrified. Whatever.
BUFFY It wasn't a line. When I came up against this thing, I felt it. It was ancient and enormous. It nearly got Angel to kill himself. And if we don't rescue Spike soon, God only knows what the First'll get him to do.
XANDER I wish Sleeping Ugly would come to. He's been out all night.
ANYA Yes, he was just starting to squeal when the spooky SWAT attacked. Said The First was held up at the Seal of...Danzar something?
DAWN Hmm. Maybe he's just faking so he doesn't have to answer any more questions. Hm. Or maybe he's in a fugue state.
BUFFY Dawn.
DAWN What?
BUFFY He'll come to when he comes to. Keep reading. If we're gonna rescue Spike, we need to figure out how to fight this thing.
DAWN Anya gets to hit him.
WILLOW Hey! Here, The First!...Bank of Delaware. Sorry.
BUFFY Hand me the Watchers' Codex again.
JOYCE Can I get you anything else, baby? How 'bout some tea?
BUFFY Mom? You're not real.
JOYCE OK, is that, uh, slang, like you're not for real, or?
BUFFY You're The First.
JOYCE Oh, baby, you're so tired, you're not making sense. Maybe you should get some sleep.
BUFFY No.
JOYCE You can't win against this thing. Not if you don't rest.
BUFFY Stop. Stop being like this. It's a lie.
JOYCE I don't want to scare you, but I want you to take care. You need to wake up.
BUFFY What?
XANDER You're dreaming. Buff, wake up.
BUFFY Hm? Did you see it?
XANDER There's nothing to see. You were just doing a little dream talking, that's all.
BUFFY Oh.
XANDER You OK? What'd you see?
BUFFY Nothing. It was nothing.
SPIKE/FIRST Go on. Give it a kick then. You always liked that, didn't you?
DRUSILLA/FIRST Kick a dolly when he's down. That was always your style.
DRUSILLA/FIRST Has buckets of energy, poor dear. He's been laying in wait for his moment since before the bug walked. There, there, pet. Soon as the moon comes, you'll have your carnage. Little girls tear so easily, like pink paper. 'Til then, we'll have our way with this one. Got it coming, he does.
ANYA That was something.
DAWN Maybe if you threw hot water on him.
ANYA Good thinking.
ANYA Whoa, hey.
DAWN Hi. Nothing.
BUFFY What?
DAWN Oh, um, I thought you were gonna ask us what we were doing.
BUFFY No, was going to ask
DAWN Oh! Look who's awake.
ANYA Silly Andrew, you drooled all over yourself.
ANDREW I'mI was about to be dead. You saved me.
BUFFY For the time being. But if you don't tell us what we need to know, then I'm gonna offer you to The First on a platter and let him chop you into tiny pieces.
ANDREW The first what?
ANYA The name of the evil thing that pretended to be Warren to get you to kill Jonathan.
ANDREW Oh, not very ominous sounding.
DAWN No, i-it is if you understand the context.
ANDREW No, an evil name should be like Lex or Voldemort or
BUFFY Hey, I was intimidating here.
ANDREW Oh, sorry. Um, go ahead.
BUFFY Forget it. Where's the seal?
ANDREW It's around this corner, I think.
BUFFY You better be right this time.
ANDREW I told youI'm not sure.
XANDER Maybe you should get sure. I'm sick of all the runaround with you Whoa. Check out the goat-heady badness.
BUFFY What's it do?
ANDREW I don't know. Something not good. It didn't work 'cause... there wasn't enough blood. OK.
DAWN There's blood on this. Lots. Looks like the first made another sacrifice. Or a music video.
BUFFY The seal could've been activated. I bet that's what the First needed Spike for.
ANDREW That wasn't there before. I had nothing to do with that.
XANDER Thanks for clearing that up 'cause otherwise we might've thought you were up to no good here at the satanic manhole cover. You killed your best friend!
ANDREW He's in a place of joy and peace. He told me.
XANDER No, nobody told you. You got tricked by a fake ghost.
BUFFY Boys, can we save the encounter session? We need to cover this thing up. Whatever it does, we can't leave it exposed like this.
ANDREW Man, this place gives me the creeps. It's like in Wonder Woman, issue 297/299
XANDER Catacombsyeah with the skeletons.
ANDREW_&_XANDER That was cool.
XANDER Move it. This way.
DAWN So what next? We found the seal, but no Spike.
BUFFY I don't know. The first was camped underground last time I found him, but
PRINCIPAL Buffy?
BUFFY Hey.
PRINCIPAL Hey. Ithought that you were, um
DAWN Sick? She was. Oh, vomiting and oozing from various places and
PRINCIPAL Yeah, I remember, so please don't go on.
DAWN Oh, but now, it's amazing. The doctor gave her some cream.
BUFFY Pills. And a cream. And I'm all better.
PRINCIPAL Oh, yeah, um, apparently somebody left this in the courtyard, and I was just returning it.
BUFFY That's some full-service principaling.
PRINCIPAL I try.
BUFFY Oh, I was down here helping Dawn with a school project.
DAWN For science.
BUFFY We buried a, um, uh, time capsule.
DAWN Hello people of the future. Kids of today like Red Bull and, uh, Jackass.
BUFFY We better go.
PRINCIPAL Buffy? You know if you are feeling better, I could really use you back at work. I've been wait listing kids who really want to see you.
BUFFY Oh, uh, yeah. Uh, I'm sorry, you know, I was justI've been ill and stuff.
PRINCIPAL No, no, it's fine, and I understand. It's just things are starting to back up.
BUFFY Well I-I-I'll be there tomorrow. No problem. 100% ooze free.
PRINCIPAL Good.
BUFFY OK.
XANDER How's it going?
BUFFY Dawn's trying to find out anything she can about the Seal of Danzalthar. Will's about to do a locator spell, see if we can find The First.
XANDER Why don't you go get some rest. You haven't slept for like two days. We'll call you if we find anything.
BUFFY Nah, I-I couldn't sleep. Too much going on.
XANDER It'll be OK, Buff. We've faced this kind of stuff before.
BUFFY You didn't see The First. I did. I felt it. It was like
BUFFY Will!
WILLOW You only make me stronger!
BUFFY Will!
WILLOW It's still in me. I feel it!
BUFFY No, it's not. It's gone. You're OK.
WILLOW I don't want to hurt anybody. Please, Buffy, don't let it make me. Oh, God!
BUFFY We won't. I promise, OK? I promise. We won't use magic to fight this thing until we know what we're doing.
WILLOW I can't. I can't. I'm sorry.
XANDER At least let me come with you.
BUFFY I'm going alone.
XANDER You said yourself, you don't know how to fight The First, or even where it is.
BUFFY It's out there. It's hurting my friends. I'll find it.
GILES Buffy.
BUFFY Giles.
GIRL_#1 Nice place. Bit of a mess.
GIRL_#3 This is a slayer?
GILES Sorry to barge in. We have a slight apocalypse.
DAWN They're all slayers?
GILES Potential slayers. Waiting for one to be called. There were many more like them all over the world, but, um, now there's just a handful, and they're all on their way to Sunnydale.
BUFFY The others were murdered.
GILES In cold blood. As well as their watchers. We always feared that this day would come, when there'd be an attack against not just an individual slayer, but against the whole line.
BUFFY The First. That's what it wants.
GILES Yes, to erase all the slayers in training and their watchers along with their methods.
BUFFY And then Faith, and then me. And with all the potentials gone and no way of making another, it's the end. No more slayer. Ever.
WILLOW But we haven't found any information on The First. No documentation
GILES That's because it predates any written history, and it rarely shows its true face. The only record I know was in the Council Library.
ANYA What about the Council? What do they say about this?
GILES Gone.
WILLOW What?
GILES Obliterated. They were in session, and, uh, there was an explosion.
WILLOW That means all the Council's records are-are destroyed?
GILES Annabelle. That's what's left. The mystic secrets of the Watchers. And whatever I could find on The First. When I learned what was happening, I-I, um, I stole them.
ANYA And you blew the Council up! See, this is what happens when you're all stuffy and repressed. You overreact.
GILES NotI didn't. Must've been an agent of The First, after my little burglary session. The knowledge contained in these files had to be protected, and there wasn't time for-for bureaucracy or debate. The Council knows no other way.
ANDREW And it cost them their lives! Go on.
BUFFY Can we gag him? But what do these records say about The First?
GILES Uh, very little. It can change form. Uh, it only appears in the guise of someone who's passed away.
WILLOW Our ghosts.
GILES Also it's not corporeal. It can't touch or fight on it's own. It only works through those it manipulates. And its followers, the Bringers.
GIRL_#3 Those freaks in the black robes.
GIRL_#1 Yeah, with the hoodies and the crazy alphabet eyes. I never saw 'em, I just heard
ANNABELLE/GIRL_#2 Shh! Molly, Mr. Giles doesn't need us prattling on.
GILES The First is unlike anything we've faced before. I mean, there's evil and then there's the thing that created evil, the source.
BUFFY And that's what this thing claims to be?
GILES That's what it is. It has eternities to act, endless resources. How to defeat itI-I honestly I don't know. But we have to find a way. If the slayer line is eliminated, then the hell mouth has no guardian. The balance is destroyed. I'm afraid it falls to you, Buffy. Sorry. I mean, we'll do what we can, but you're the only one who has the strength to protect these girlsand the worldagainst what's coming.
XANDER But no pressure.
GIRL_#3 That's it? That's the plan? I don't see how one person, even a slayer, could protect us. I saw what those bringer guys can do. They tore apart my watcher.
GILES Of course we'll use all our resources
GIRL_#3 And if this thing is the root of all evil, isn't the hell mouth it's number one vacation spot? I mean, don't you think we should be hiding our asses on the other side of the globe?
ANNABELLE Kennedy!
BUFFY No, she's not wrong. We need more muscle. That's why we need to find Spike.
ANYA Yeah, he'll help. You know, if he's not crazy or off killing people or dead. Or, you know, all of the above.
DRUSILLA/FIRST That's why our kind make such good dollies.
DRUSILLA/FIRST Hard to kill. Tried to enlighten little Buffy, didn't you? Spilled, spilled, spilled our secrets like seed. But you forgot, I say what you tell and what you know. I say when this is over. And I'm not done with you yet. Not nearly.
GILES This place you originally saw The Firstyou say it was in a Christmas tree lot?
BUFFY Under it. There was a hidden cavern. Just happened to be under a tree lot. The Bringers were doing some kind of ritual. Giles, this is bad, isn't it? A new kind of bad.
GILES Just in time for Christmas.
BUFFY You know, I didn't even realize it was December. Maybe when we get home, we should decorate the rubble. Think you'll ever show up for a real visit? The kind where the world isn't about to end?
GILES If we survive this, I promise.
BUFFY Good. 'Cause I miss you.
GILES I miss you too.
ANDREW So, how long have you followed Buffy?
XANDER I don't follow her. She's my best friend.
ANDREW Huh. She seems like a good leader. Her hair is shiny. Does she make you stab things?
WILLOW OK, so Annabelle can sleep down here, uh, Molly can sleep in Dawn's room
KENNEDY Not if Dawn actually wants to sleep. Molly'll talk her ear off.
WILLOW OK, then Molly down here, you with Dawn, and Annabelle in my room.
KENNEDY Bad idea. Annabelle snores.
WILLOW You wanna do the sleeping arrangements?
KENNEDY OK. You, uh, better not hog the covers.
DAWN Does she want to eat?
WILLOW What? Huh? Oh, she'sOh, she's new.
DAWN Well, Annabelle and Molly are starved and I totally burnt the mac and cheese. Oh, um, I'll put hot sauce on it, tell 'em it's an American thing, say it's blackened.
ANYA Actually, it's not blackened so much as ruined.
WILLOW Or we can order pizza.
ANNABELLE As long as it's plain. I'm veggie.
MOLLY Cracked, you mean.
ANNABELLE Just because you'll eat any kind of trash
MOLLY Brill! Biscuits! You don't mind do you? I got a case of the nerves after Mr. Giles lecture.
DAWN Knock yourself out. I feel a cookie problem coming on, myself.
GILES So the entrance to the cave was above ground here?
BUFFY Yeah, I'm pretty sure it was around here somewhere.
GILES Well, we'll just keep
BUFFY Aah! Found it!
GILES Good lord, are you all right?
BUFFY Peachy, except my knees bend backwards now. OK, Giles, stay up there. I'm gonna check it out.
GILES Right.
BUFFY ...the others just yet. It'll give us a chance to
KENNEDY Sorry about the British invasion.
MOLLY We've been up for hours.
ANNABELLE 4 P.M. London time.
KENNEDY Are you all right? You look...
BUFFY Oh. Yeah, I'm OK. I just got into a fight is all. You want to tell me with what?
GILES Yes, Buffy, but don't you think we should, uh, discuss this privately?
BUFFY You mean, not in front of the next generation? No time to coddle them, Giles. Welcome to the war room, guys.
GILES Uh, what you fought was a vampire, but it was, um, something more than that. It was a Turok-Han. As Neanderthals are to human beings, the Turok-Han are to vampires. Primordial, ferociously powerful killing machines, as single-minded as animals. They are the vampires that vampires fear. An ancient and entirely different race and, until this morning, I thought they were a myth.
BUFFY So, The First shows up, and now this? You think it's a coincidence?
GILES I think it's more likely that the Turok-Han is here as an agent of The First.
ANNABELLE Um, did you slay it?
BUFFY No, it's still out there, somewhere.
MOLLY What's it want?
BUFFY All of us dead. But for now it looks like sunlight is keeping this UberVamp away.
GILES So, until sunset, I suggest you get some rest. A few hours sleep will do a world of difference.
BUFFY No sleep today. Can't.
GILES Oh, come on, you're exhausted.
BUFFY Ah, it comes with the gig. Somehow I don't think taking on prehistoric evil comes with nap time. Sorry, potential guys. I know you came a long way, and you wanna get into it, but the best thing you can do right now is just sit tight, wait it out. I'm gonna go to work, see what I can find out. I'll be back before sunset.
GILES How do you plan to research something as ill-defined as The First?
BUFFY I have the best plan ever.
BUFFY Yeah, well, I already re-checked the basement. Wait, you know, hold on, I'm gonna try something. Maybe The First isn't ready for modern technology. Displaying results 1 through 10 of 900,517. OK, I gotta narrow this down. I'll call you back? Yeah.
PRINCIPAL Manifestations of evil? In... the... movies. You're searching for evil movies?
BUFFY Uh, I know it's not the all-time most kosher use of my office hours, um, but, you know, looking at some down time. And what can I say, I just love those evil, evil movies. Like Exorcist, you know, Blair Witch...
PRINCIPAL Hmm. As opposed to Rob Schneider's Oeuvre.
BUFFY Different kind of evil.
PRINCIPAL Yeah. Buffy, you know, I'm not that big a fan of scary movies, even the hokie ones. Sometimes they go to a place that I think kids could stand to avoid.
BUFFY Well, it's not for the kids.
PRINCIPAL Yeah, yeah, I'm only saying that once you see true evil, it can have some serious after burn, and then you can't unsee what you saw. Ever. That's just one opinion. I better get back to work.
BUFFY What kind of movies do you like?
PRINCIPAL Oh, me? Mysteries. I love finding out what's underneath it all at the very end.
DRUSILLA/FIRST Think of it as a game. A fun, funny game. Without all the rules, or any of the bothersome winning part. But still, there are sides. You have to choose a side, Spike. Then we can flybe free and visit all our friends as they come squirming up from out the earth. I know you like a good wriggle and a giggle and a squiggle.
SPIKE You're not Drusilla.
DRUSILLA/FIRST No, I'm really not.
SPIKE She was crazier than you.
DRUSILLA/FIRST Ooh, daddy. No kicking. It's almost Christmas day today and you've gone spoiling it. I've been so very good all year. But I could be bad if you like. Bad daddy. Needs a caning. Never learned his headmaster's lesson while all the school bells ring and ring and ring and ring and ring...Choose a side. Choose our side. You know that it's delicious. What do you say?
SPIKE Dru, luv...
DRUSILLA/FIRST Hmm?
SPIKE Get bent.
DRUSILLA/FIRST Stupid, stubborn daddy.
DRUSILLA/FIRST Ringing, ringing, ringing...
BUFFY Ow. Oh. Ah.
JOYCE Buffy, what happened?
BUFFY Uh, oh, it's OK, Mom.
JOYCE I tried to warn you, butright. The last thing you need now is one of helpful Mom's guilt trips. I'll get you some ice.
BUFFY No. Mom, I-I can't.
JOYCE Buffy, you have to heal.
BUFFY I don't have time.
JOYCE Are you worried about the sun going down? Because there's some things you can't control. The sun always goes down, the sun always comes up.
BUFFY Everyone's counting on me.
JOYCE Well, they do that, and I'm sorry, Buffy, but these-these friends of you put too much pressure on you. They always have.
BUFFY Something evil is coming.
JOYCE Buffy, evil isn't coming, it's already here. Evil is always here. Don't you know? It's everywhere.
BUFFY And I have to stop it.
JOYCE How are you gonna do that?
BUFFY I-I don't know yet, but
JOYCE Buffy, no matter what your friends expect of you, evil is a part of us. All of us. It's natural. And no one can stop that. No one can stop nature, not even
BUFFY Oh, um, I'm sorry. What were we talking about?
TEEN_BOY Only my life. You're just like all the others.
BUFFY No. No, no, no. I'm different. I'm hip. I relate to the young people. No, don't go, uh, uh...
TEEN_BOY Roger.
BUFFY Roger. See? I knew that! Oh...
GILES This day's almost over. And the sun will go down in 17 minutes.
XANDER Hey, junior slayers, don't look so worried. I mean, sure, we don't know where Spike is, or how to fight The First, or if and when the super style vampire is gonna attack us all. However, houseboarded up. No all we gotta do is trap this UberVamp in a pantry, and it's game over.
WILLOW Xander, newbies. Let's ease them in to the whole jokes in the face of death thing.
XANDER Who's joking? That pantry thing could work. Are you saying M. Night Shamalayan lied to us?
BUFFY You'll be OK.
WILLOW OK, or even better. It's like our guarantee. Um, Buffy, I just, I want you to know that I'm really sorry for letting you down. You know, here before with the magic going all aah and me going all eeee and everything getting all rrrr. I wish I could help out.
BUFFY No one expects you to make everything right.
WILLOW So, I can't do everything, but I should at least be able to do something. I have so much power, but when I try to use it
BUFFY Don't, OK?
WILLOW OK. But, you need help, Buffy. I know you, and I know you'll never admit it, but you need help.
BUFFY I'll be OK. OK, or better. It's like my guarantee.
KENNEDY Hey, are we getting weapons? Trained fighters? Patton is coming? I've heard worse ideas.
ANNABELLE We'll be armed when the slayer feels we're ready.
MOLLY I feel ready.
ANNABELLE You're frightened. You must learn to control your fear.
KENNEDY Hey, you know what would help with that? Weapons.
BUFFY Uh, I don't know about that
KENNEDY We're sitting ducks without them.
ANNABELLE We're with the slayer. Safe as houses.
KENNEDY Do you see the house we're in?
ANNABELLE It'll come straight for us, won't it?
BUFFY We should load them up, Giles.
ANDREW Listen to me, man, I've got a bad feeling about this.
XANDER Of course you've got a bad feeling, dude. You're-you're tied to a chair.
ANDREW No. Yeah, but above and beyond that. I'm telling you that my spider-sense is tingling. This is gonna get hairy. I'm talking weird with a beard. Better untie me.
BUFFY And that'll help us, how?
ANDREW OK, I know what you're thinking. Andrew, bad guy. You think I'm a super-villain like Dr. Doom or Apocalypse or-or The Riddler. But I admit I went over to the dark side, but just to pick up a few things, a-and now I'm back. I've learned. I'm good again.
BUFFY And when were you good before?
ANDREW OK, technically, never. Touché. But I'm like Vader in the last 5 minutes of Jedi with redemptive powers minus a redemptive struggle of epic redemption which chronicles... These ropes itch.
BUFFY How're we doing on time?
GILES Sunset should be any minute now. Done everything we can. And don't worry, everyone here understands that you're calling the shots.
BUFFY I just hope I'm calling the right ones.
GILES You have all my faith. And they're depending on you.
BUFFY Giles, that's not exactly what I needed to hear right now.
MOLLY Guys? Annabelle split.
XANDER Buffy!
XANDER Oh, God almighty.
DRUSILLA/FIRST Do you know why you're alive?
SPIKE Never figured you for existential thought, luv. I mean, you hated Paris.
DRUSILLA/FIRST You're alive for one reason, and one reason only. Because I wish it. Do you know why I wish it? Because I'm not done with you.
SPIKE Give it up. Whatever you are, whatever you get away with, I'm out. You can't pull this puppet's strings anymore.
DRUSILLA/FIRST And what makes you think you have a choice? What makes you think you will ever be any good at all in this world?
SPIKE She does. Because she believes in me.
GILES We could make plans as we always do, but the truth is, Buffy was our plan. There is no back up.
WILLOW Giles, she looks bad.
GILES She does. I'm afraid there may be internal bleeding.
WILLOW What does that mean? Will she
GILES Die? I don't think so. I don't know.
WILLOW What do we do if she can't fight, if she can't beat this thing?
GILES We're back at square one.
XANDER Which square would that be, exactly?
GILES I'm not sure. The First predates everything we've ever known, or can know. It's everywhere. It's pure. I don't know if we can fight it.
BUFFY You're right. We don't know how to fight it. We don't know when it'll come. We can't run, can't hide, can't pretend it's not the end, 'cause it is. Something's always been there to try and destroy the world. We've beaten them back, but we're not dealing with them anymore. We're dealing with the reason they exist. Evil. The strongest. The First.
GILES Buffy, II-I know you're tired.
BUFFY I'm beyond tired. I'm beyond scared. I'm standing on the mouth of hell, and it is gonna swallow me whole. And it'll choke on me. We're not ready? They're not ready. They think we're gonna wait for the end to come, like we always do. I'm done waiting. They want an apocalypse? Oh, we'll give 'em one. Anyone else who wants to run, do it now. 'Cause we just became an army. We just declared war. From now on, we won't just face our worst fears, we will seek them out. We will find them, and cut out their hearts one by one, until The First shows itself for what it really is. And I'll kill it myself. There is only one thing on this earth more powerful than evil, and that's us. Any questions?
