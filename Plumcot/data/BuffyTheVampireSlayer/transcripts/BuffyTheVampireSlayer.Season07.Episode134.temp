GILES Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer:
WILLOW Dawn, what happened here?
DAWN I saw Mom.
WILLOW It's the Big Bad, Dawn. The one we knew was coming.
BUFFY I believe in you, Spike.
BUFFY They were after Spike all along.
BUFFY You know what we're up against. The First.
BUFFY/FIRST Now, Spike, wanna see what a real vampire looks like?
GILES As Neanderthals are to human beings, the Turok-Han are to vampiresferociously powerful killing machines, as single-minded as animals.
GILES They are the vampires that vampires fear.
MOLLY Nice place. Bit of a mess.
DAWN They're all slayers?
GILES Potential slayers. Waiting for one to be called. There were many more like them all over the world, but, um, now there's just a handful, and they're all on their way to Sunnydale.
KENNEDY Right. How many girls arriving this time?
WILLOW Just one. But since Giles has the coven searching for other slayers in waiting, I bet we'll be seeing a lot more soon enough.
BUFFY Rona, right?
RONA You're her!
WILLOW Another potential arrived in town the day before yesterday.
BUFFY She's cold. Been dead for days.
XANDER Poor kid. She made it all the way to Sunnydale just to get herself killed.
BUFFY Eve.
XANDER Eve, who's in our house?
BUFFY Get away from them.
DAWN Buffy, what did Eve do?
XANDER That's not Eve.
EVE/FIRST One more down. Oh, well, can't save 'em all, can ya, Buffy? Bye.
BUFFY I don't know what's coming next, but I do know it's gonna be just like this. Painful. Believe it, we'll be the ones left standing.
SPIKE You. Oh.
SPIKE OK, these two are dead. Why?
RONA 'Cause the black chick always gets it first?
VI Ow!
BUFFY What was that, Rona?
RONA I'm dead because he's a vampire. I don't have slayer strength, slayer speedi-it wasn't a fair fight.
SPIKE Vi, do you think I care about a fair fight?
VI No, no sir. You don't play by the rules, and I have learned a valuable lesson of some sort. Ow!
BUFFY OK, Spike. You're right. You don't have slayer strength. But that doesn't mean that you're not strong. You have inherent abilities that others do not have.
MOLLY Not like you do.
BUFFY No, not yet, but it's there. You have the potential. You have strength, speed, instinct. You just have to learn to trust yourself. Rona, what did your instincts tell you to do just then?
RONA Block his attack, keep him off balance, gain the advantage...?
BUFFY No, they didn't.
RONA They told me to run.
BUFFY Vi?
VI They told me to run. They're still sort of telling me to run.
BUFFY Don't fight on his terms. Your gut's telling them to run, run. OK? Regain the higher ground. Make the fight your own. Spike, what did your instincts tell you to do just then?
SPIKE Hunt. Kill.
BUFFY Come at me, full speed. He needs to kill to live. That tells you everything you need to know.
BUFFY Instinct. Understand his, but trust yours. You were chosen for a reason. Are you OK?
SPIKE I'm... fine. Couple of ribs ain't quite set right since I'm fine.
BUFFY Lemme see.
SPIKE No, it's just
BUFFY Spike.
SPIKE I'm gonna be OK.
RONA That's hot.
MOLLY So, we're supposed to, like, make out with them or something?
VI Careful, Buffy. Just when you think it's part of the lesson, he'll hurt your arm.
BUFFY Molly, Kennedy, let's go. You're up. Next lesson.
RONA No way. One armed pushups are bull.
KENNEDY I can do 'em. I can do the kinda way you clap between.
RONA I'm more of a chin up kinda girl. I can do chin-ups 'til the cows come home.
VI You're saying demon, and I don't mean to ... Oh, bananas! Imagine yourself covered in human viscera....
BUFFY You're all gonna die. But you knew that already. 'Cause that's the cool reward for being human. Big dessert at the end of the meal. Don't kid yourselves, you guys. This whole thing is all about death. You think you're different 'cause you might be the next slayer? Death is what a slayer breathes, what a slayer dreams about when she sleeps. Death is what a slayer lives. My death could make you the next slayer. Oh, goody. Rapt attention. I love that so much. Now, where was I? Ah. If we go with what Anya's resources are telling us, then The First is in remission for a while, which we think means advantage us.
RONA Well, what does that mean? About The First?
BUFFY As best we can tell, heor precisely itwas putting a lot of stock in that UberVamp thing, the Chaka Khan.
DAWN Turok-Han?
BUFFY So when I kicked its ass, the whole Firsty circus decided to back off for a while. Good news? Means we probably don't have to worry about it pulling Spike's strings for a while. Here's the half-empty. Time away means time to regroup. And part of that regrouping is coming back stronger than ever. The odds are against us. Time is against us. And some of us will die in this battle. Decide now that it's not going to be you. I know you're all tired, far away from home, anxious. But you're all special. Most people in this world have no idea why they're here or what they want to do. You do. You have a mission, a reason for being here. You're not here by chance. You're here because you are the chosen ones. Dawn, you better hurry up and eat something so you're not late for school.
BUFFY Xander, I know. I'm sorryIf you're gonna take a shower at my house, lock the door. Of course they're curious. Hey, I gotta go. Uh, has Giles checked in yet? I thought he was picking up that Chao-Ahn girl in Shanghai yesterday. OK, well, uh, let me know if he does. Bye. Amanda, right? I'm all yours.
AMANDA Do people ever think you're weird?
BUFFY Um, I guess. Sure, in a charming, endearing, loveable... Yeah.
AMANDA I feel like people think I'm weird, and so they pick on me. But I might beweird.
BUFFY Amanda, why do you think that you're weird?
AMANDA One of the boys who picks on me, I kind ofSee, if a guy picks on you, is it weird to think he's cute?
BUFFY Oh..
AMANDA It's just, the last few times I've seen him, I've wanted to, you know, pick on him....extra. More.
BUFFY Uh-huh.
AMANDA The thing is, I can't tell. My mom says when a guy teases you, it means he likes you.
BUFFY Sometimes that's true.
AMANDA Is it weird? We're mean to each other, and we like each other.
BUFFY Well, it depends. Sometimes that's how people relate. Being mean to each other. Even mortal enemies Then with the And that leads to no good, absolutely no good. And much confusion. A-and then it's over. Absolutely, seriously, definitely over. And that's confusing too. The over part. Which it is. Over! So, maybe.
XANDER ...there might be an appropriate place to do that, like maybe outside.
ANDREW Why do we always have to yell?
BUFFY I was only gone a couple of hours.
WILLOW Buffy?
BUFFY Oh, look everybody. It's Willow. Perhaps with a blunt weapon of some sort.
WILLOW Buffy, we just got news.
BUFFY And she's sure?
WILLOW Positive. Althenea said the seers located another potential slayer here in Sunnydale. Someone that already lives here.
BUFFY Oh, God...
ANYA All these girls flocking to town, and this one's already here and under our noses?
XANDER Wait, the seers couldn't find out her name or, like, her address or anything? Am I getting the definition of
XANDER wrong?
BUFFY I was gonna take the girls out tonight, a little show and tell, but maybe now I shouldn't.
ANDREW They were so excited. You're gonna break their little hearts.
BUFFY This town is lousy with Bringers. I don't want to risk that they find this new girl first.
WILLOW No, you should go. I can do a spell to find her tonight. I just have to get together a few ingredients. But you-you shouldn't skip your training, it's too important.
BUFFY You think you can handle it?
XANDER No problemo.
DAWN Yeah, and you guys have more important things to do.
BUFFY OK, I'll take 'em.
ANDREW Yes!
BUFFY Andrew, you're not going.
MOLLY Ooh, crossbow! Got to love it. Feels like I'm storming a castle.
RONA You do a lot of that, do you?
MOLLY I might, I had a beauty like this. Halt!
DAWN OK, see, that's why we don't point the weapons in the kitchen.
VI It's not loaded.
DAWN That's always the lead quote under the headline Household Crossbow Accident Claims Teen.
VI Oh, a mace!
DAWN Yeah, that's better.
RONA Gotta go with the stake. It's classic. I like the feel of wood in my hand.
KENNEDY Lost me there. Hey, we gearing up already?
DAWN Oh, right. You guys are going on your little group patrol.
VI More than that, it's an outing.
KENNEDY I'm thinking tonight we might actually get to kill things.
DAWN I-I've killed things sometimes.
ANDREW I'm not begging.
BUFFY You're like a small dog dancing for Snausages.
ANDREW You don't want me coming along 'cause you think I'm evil.
VI He doesn't seem evil, exactly.
BUFFY He's not evil, but when he gets close to it, he picks up its flavor like a mushroom or something.
ANDREW But I'm reformed. I'm like Vegeta on
ANDREW . I used to be a pure Sayan, and now I fight for the side of Goku.
BUFFY Still not coming.
ANDREW It's not fair. Spike just killed people, and he gets to go.
BUFFY Spike didn't have free will and you did.
ANDREW I hate my free will.
SPIKE This is where you're all hiding. You ready to go, or what?
BUFFY Let's go, girls. Grab your weapons.
RONA All right. Let's do it. I don't know about you guys, but I'm ready to kick some serious....
ANDREW You wanna play
ANDREW ?
WILLOW OK, I got my tumbleweed, my eggs...got my chrysaliseschrysali? My butterfly transformer pods. Hey, wh-where's my snakeskin?
ANDREW At your ssssservice, Miss Rosenberg, ssssir. Can you imagine if every once in a while, people just wriggled out of their skin and left it behind them likelike on the sidewalk. Talk about embarrassing.
DAWN Hey, do you think this girl, this potential, goes to Sunnydale?
WILLOW Hmm. Well, I guess probably, huh? I mean, she's got to be about that age.
DAWN Could be anybody. Could be that glamazon in gym class, what's her name? Oh, my lab partner, Margot, the freak. Boy, I hope not, because she totally fainted right in the middle of our fetal pig dissection. Somehow I just don't think she's cut out for the slayage biz.
ANDREW Killing pigs is just so wrong. And also hard.
WILLOW Well, we'll know soon enough who the next potential is. Somebody's life is about to change.
DAWN How long will it take? Will we find out who it is right away?
WILLOW Pretty much. The spell will conjure up this brilliant light, a-and the light will find the potential and it'll illuminate her with a glowing aura.
ANDREW Cool.
WILLOW I've enchanted this map so we can track her basic location. We'll have to hot-foot it, but I'm betting we find her tonight.
DAWN You know, if it is Margot, she's so gonna faint.
WILLOW To light the aura of the new, skin of snake and chrysalis too.
WILLOW To indicate the fresh reborn, tumbleweed and rosebush thorn.
WILLOW An egg that means the life to come.
WILLOW Take this, oh spirit, and my spell is done.
XANDER Oh, good God, what is that smell?
ANYA I'm fairly sure that's the smell of a hardboiled egg being thrown into a fire.
XANDER Uh-huh.
WILLOW The smell will lead us to the potential.
XANDER Or some poor soul who ate too many chimichangas.
WILLOW She'll also be lit with a brilliant aura.
DAWN Is it supposed to be shimmying all over like that?
WILLOW I don't know. I don't think so.
ANYA So you messed up the spell again. At least it smells, you know, other-worldly. Oh, look, pretty.
WILLOW I suck. I'm sorry, you guys, I Maybe we could figure something out on the computer?
DAWN Good call. I'm gonna open the door and let this place air out.
XANDER Don't worry, Will. It's really no big.
WILLOW I justI was sure that it was gonna work.
WILLOW Dawn!
WILLOW I think it worked.
XANDER Dawn!
WILLOW Dawn, are you OK?
DAWN Maybe y-you did it wrong? Was it a-ambiguous in any way? Did you maybe say potential sailors? 'Cause I-I do like the water.
WILLOW I did it right.
XANDER Wow, sheyou're a potential. You could be the next slayer.
DAWN Whoa.
ANYA Wow, it's like one second you were this klutzy teenager with fake memories and a history of kleptomania, and thenthen suddenly you're a hero, a hero with a much abbreviated lifespan.
XANDER This is huge. We have to think about this.
DAWN I-I can't think about this. It doesn't fit in my head.
WILLOW A slayer. Makes sense, I guess. Remember that thing about they share the same blood or whatever?
ANYA Yeah, I never got that.
DAWN She has to die. I mean, if I was ever the slayer, it would mean she died.
ANYA Well, it's a lot like being the Pope in that way, except you don't have to be some old Catholic.
WILLOW I've got to call Buffy. She's gonna be so excited.
XANDER No, we can't. She didn't bring a cell phone.
DAWN Well, sure, 'cause all the important people are with her.
XANDER You are important now.
DAWN Wh-wha-what happens now?
ANYA Well, you could start by maybe sitting still for a sec.
DAWN I-I cant. I-I need to know what happens to my life.
WILLOW Well, I guess Buffy trains you.
DAWN Right, I train with the potentialsother potentials. Learn to do the stuff they're learning.
ANYA Right, we also have to protect you from the, uh, eyeless guys, the ones with the sharp, sharp knives.
DAWN Bringers.
WILLOW It's OK, we'll protect you.
DAWN What if they saw the spell?
XANDER Saw the spell? Dawn, they can't see flashcards. Big ones.
DAWN We did a big orange powerful spell. What if they sensed it? What if they're on their way?
ANDREW Are we gonna replace the microwave? 'Cause I was thinking some Orville Redenbacher with fresh butter flavor What's going on?
ANYA Dawn's gonna be a slayer.
ANDREW Holy crap! Excuse me. Plucked from an ordinary life, handed a destiny
XANDER Say Skywalker, and I smack ya.
ANDREW Does Buffy know?
XANDER She didn't take her phone.
ANDREW Incommunicado.
WILLOW Well, we'll tell her soon as she gets back.
DAWN Let's not.
WILLOW What? Dawn, she has to know.
DAWN I-I know, just not right away. Guys, when mom appeared to me, she said
WILLOW Dawnie...
DAWN No, please. She said something about Buffy, and I'm thinking... I'm just not so sure Buffy will be happy for me.
WILLOW Of course she will.
DAWN Will she? I mean, I'm not even sure I'm happy for me. Everything's different for me now.
ANYA That's because you're a part of something larger. Like being swallowed. By something larger.
DAWN This-this is too much for my head again. I can't. II need to be
XANDER Nice job with the getting swallowed analogy.
ANYA Well, it is a mixed bag, you know. If she gets to be the slayer, then her life is short and brutal. And if she doesn't, then it smells of unfulfilled potential. My swallowed analogy looks pretty sweet right now, doesn't it?
WILLOW It's not like that. It's like, she's part of this huge power. I know what that feels like. It feels wonderful.
ANDREW Yes, Willow so captured it. It's likewell, it's almost like this metaphor for womanhood, isn't it? The sort of flowering that happens when a girl realizes that she's part of a fertile heritage stretching back to Eve, and
XANDER I'll pay you to talk about Star Wars again.
ANYA This isn't about womany power. This is about the fact that Dawn just might have bought herself an early death.
WILLOW We don't know that.
XANDER Right, all we know is that everything just changed.
XANDER I'm not talking about that. I mean, what do you think Buffy's going to do with this information? Jump up and down? Teach Dawn the secret handshake? She know what this means.
ANYA Short, brutal life. Sharp, sharp knives. I covered this.
XANDER Right. You think Buffy really wants that for Dawn? And besides, Dawn doesn't want us telling her yet.
ANYA He's right. We shouldn't rush her. Rushing's only gonna get her killed.
RONA This is a bar.
KENNEDY Best damn field trip I ever took.
MOLLY Look, they're all
VI They're demons! It's a demon bar. It's like a gay bar, only with demons.
DEMON Spike! Long time. Nice of you to bring snacks.
SPIKE Thouch them, and lose your privates.
VI I didn't like him.
SPIKE Nice job of blending in, girls.
RONA We're a bunch of 15 year olds in a demon bar. How much blending did you think we were gonna do?
BUFFY Look, it's ok. Ususally you come to a place like this, you wanna be seen. You wanna scare someone, or make contact-
MOLLY Or have a strong drink?
BUFFY Not usually that.
KENNEDY You don't drink?
BUFFY Sure I do. I mean, no. That would be wrong.
VI Do they card?
BUFFY Nope, go ahead. Down all the yak urine shots or pigs blood spritzers you like.
VI Gross.
SPIKE Got that right. Prices they charge, you could get human blood straight from the body. Vampire...
BUFFY Look, if I come here, it's 'cause I gotta wring some information out of something large, scary, drunk, with a room full of friends who don't care much for the slayer. Remember that. Not a being in here wouldn't be glad to rip your throat out.
CLEM Buffy? Girl, how ya been?
BUFFY Clem! You look great, so toned.
KENNEDY He's ripping out her throat right now.
CLEM Oh, my God! It is so good to see you! I saw this great show on the History Channel the other night that I knew you would love, and then something went all flooey with my TiVo.
BUFFY You know what? Can I talk to you for a second over here?
KENNEDY You think she dated him too?
BUFFY OK, everyone. These are the girls.
CLEM Howdy. So, you girls are gonna deal with demons, huh? Just lemme tell you this.
VI I could use a shot of that yak urine right about now.
DAWN Hey.
AMANDA Hey, Dawn. Whatcha doing?
DAWN Uh, just walking. You?
AMANDA Um, yeah, just walking too. K, well, have a good walk. I guess I'll see you Monday morning?
DAWN Yeah.
AMANDA You all right?
DAWN Sure. Just walking, you know? A-are you all right? You've got a thing.
AMANDA I guess I I had a bit of a It's been a bizarre night.
DAWN What happened? Who did that to you?
AMANDA Uh, nobody...exactly. I don't think you'd exactly believe me.
DAWN Try me.
AMANDA I-I was at school late because of, you know, Swing Choir, and I tore my sweater, you know, the striped ones we wear. So I went to Home Sciences to sew it up.
DAWN Uh-huh.
AMANDA And by the time I was finished, the place was empty, so it was all echoy and lonely. And then there was this guyor thing. And it wasit scratched me, and I kinda dodged it, and it kinda hit its head.
DAWN What kind of thing?
AMANDA I don't know. It was messed up. In the face. 'Round here abouts.
DAWN And when it scratched at you, did itwas it scratching with its teeth?
AMANDA Is it real? Was it really a vampire? I bet you think I'm crazy.
DAWN II believe you.
AMANDA Well, cool. The thing is, after it hit its head, I kinda freaked out. I trapped it in a room, and it's still there, and now I don't know what to do.
DAWN It's OK. This is totally dealable. Don't worry.
AMANDA Well, I was thinking of getting your sister.
DAWN You know something about my sister?
AMANDA Well, I've heard people talking. A lot of 'em think she's some kind of high-functioning schizophrenic. But I also heard that maybelike, maybe she could help with this kind of thing. Do you think we should go get her?
DAWN She's out. I'll take this one.
DAWN Whew. I think I strained something. Maybe something I'll need later in life. Uh
AMANDA Come on. The vampire's upstairs. Are you spooked out?
DAWN No. I'm all right. I-I can do this. It's mostly instinct. I think.
AMANDA So, if he scratched me with a tooth, am II'm not gonna turn into one, am I?
DAWN Uh, only if he slashed open one of his own veins and led you to drink deep of his blood.
AMANDA Nope.
DAWN Good. You're lucky he didn't hurt you way more than that.
AMANDA Right. He can do that. So, I was thinking... we don't have to kill the vampire, do we?
DAWN What?
AMANDA Just suppose he got out and was maybe like encouraged toward the gym while the marching band was playing because the way they look down on the Swing Choir. It might be, you know, funny. I'm just saying.
DAWN Well, he didn't break down the door, anyway.
AMANDA Yeah. Can they do that?
DAWN They're very strong and, although they feel pain, they don't hold back because of it.
AMANDA Guess you're some kind of monster expert too?
DAWN Let's just say it runs in the family. I thought you said it was locked.
AMANDA It was. It was here.
DAWN Amanda, it got out.
AMANDA Where'd it go?
DAWN I dunno. But we have to get out of here.
AMANDA What are you doing?
DAWN I can't remember, does it have to be upside down or right side up to work? Which is it?
BUFFY A vampire is an animal. Sometimes they run in packs, sometimes alone. Who can tell us where we are?
RONA It's a nest.
BUFFY How can you tell?
KENNEDY Only a vamp could live like this.
SPIKE Some, yeah. As a group, we're not known for our tasteful decor, but in all fairness to the race, this place is seriously lacking in style.
BUFFY Thank you, Spike.
SPIKE I'm merely saying...
BUFFY He has a point. Vampires can live anywhere. Any way they want. Taste, fashions, living conditionsthey can vary. The animal inside, always the same.
MOLLY Where'd you live?
SPIKE What, you mean before? A crypt actually, but nicer. A bit moreI don't know if posh is the right word, but it was more like
BUFFY Comfy.
KENNEDY Excuse me? When did you find it comfy?
BUFFY Moving on. You want to stay alive, you have to spot and identify a nest on site. Look around, all of you. Look for signs that just last night maybe a dozen, two dozen vampires were right where we're standing. Go ahead.
SPIKE Work, work, work. This little excursion was just in danger of being interesting.
BUFFY You know what, Spike Interesting is not a problem.
RONA Buffy, I think we found something.
MOLLY It's a body.
BUFFY It's not a body. It's leftovers.
DAWN In here!
DAWN Help! We need to barricade this! Too small.
AMANDA Too big.
DAWN Stay down.
AMANDA Think we're safe?
BUFFY No one's safe. Not here, not ever. See this guy?
KENNEDY B-but he was dead a minute ago.
BUFFY That was a minute ago. Now...
VAMPIRE Hey!
BUFFY ... he's the enemy.
DAWN Amanda?
AMANDA Yes.
DAWN Listen.
AMANDA I'm listening
DAWN We're gonna get out of this. Both of us. Alive. Alive! You believe me?
AMANDA I believe you.
DAWN Good. 'Cause I got a plan.
BUFFY You can't think too much. Reacting's better. Could be the difference between staying alive and that other thing.
DAWN OK, this plan of mine, I'm not guaranteeing it'll work.
AMANDA Better than mine about him eating the Marching Band. Besides, your plan'll work.
DAWN In case you haven't noticed, I don't know what I'm doing here.
AMANDA You're getting it done.
WILLOW Come on, sweetie, open up.
ANYA Want me to kick down the door?
XANDER Anya.
ANYA What? It'd be funny. Besides, she's been sulking in there forever. Oh.
ANYA Crap. Double crap.
XANDER Gone. We got to find her before the Bringers do.
WILLOW I can do a locator spell, but we gotta hurry. And find Buffy.
DAWN Help! Amanda, help me!
AMANDA I can't!
DAWN Amanda!
DAWN No! You don't want her! You want me...
DAWN Amanda!
AMANDA What were those?
DAWN Amanda, listen to me. Remember when you said I was special? Well, I'm not. But the thing is, you are. This is your battle, Amanda.
AMANDA No, I can't.
DAWN You can! You've got to. Look, I've got your back, but this is something you have to do. It's something you were born to do. Here, this belongs to you.
XANDER Buffy, up here.
BUFFY Here!
AMANDA OK. One minute I'm in Swing Choir, and the next What the hell's going on? You tell me to come to you with problems. Turns out, a vampire attacked me. Problem. So I go to your house, and when I get there, this orange cloud hits me.
DAWN She was at the doorway.
AMANDA And I don't know if you're into the drugs, but that's not my deal, all right. That cloud hit me, and I got a little dizzy and discombobulated.
DAWN It was Willow's spell. She's the potential slayer.
RONA I'm sure the vampire thought we were like, what, four helpless girls. And then ViVi actually yells, We're just four helpless girls.
VI That was part of my plan.
RONA When it all started going down, it was like we knew what we were doing. For real.
MOLLY Yeah, like when you dodged that first attack, and then cracked him across the jaw.
RONA Aw, no, no, no, no, no. See, I wouldn't have been able to do that if you hadn't've pulled his legs out.
VI I hurt his arm. Yep. And an arm can be as lethal as a mouth.
MOLLY When you staked him, seriously, the rush was like
KENNEDY So you took one out solo?
MOLLY Yeah, what was that like?
AMANDA I don't know. I mean, when I saw the vampire, vamp
KENNEDY Vampire's good too.
AMANDA Cool. Yeah, when that vampire attacked me, I felt this kind of charge, you know?
KENNEDY Like you realize in one instant that your whole life is different.
AMANDA Exactly. It's that rush you're talking about.
BUFFY Hey. You OK?
DAWN Yeah, I was thinking of hitting the books. Do some research on The First. It's in retreat mode right now, but you're still gonna need to know how to fight it.
BUFFY Great. Sounds good. Hey, you guys, wanna head downstairs? Get our newest arrival up to speed?
DAWN What's up?
XANDER Aw, I'm just thinking about the girls. It's a harsh gig, being a potential. Just being picked out of a crowd, danger, destiny, plus if you act now, death.
DAWN They can handle it.
XANDER Yeah. They're special, no doubt. The amazing thing is, not one of them will ever know, not even Buffy.
DAWN Know what?
XANDER How much harder it is for the rest of us.
DAWN No way. They've got
XANDER Seven years, Dawn. Working with the slayer. Seeing my friends get more and more powerful. A witch. A demon. Hell, I could fit Oz in my shaving kit, but come a full moon, he had a wolfy mojo not to be messed with. Powerful. All of them. And I'm the guy who fixes the windows.
DAWN Well, you had that sexy army training for a while, andand the windows really did need fixing.
XANDER I saw what you did last night.
DAWN Yeah, I I guess I kinda lost my head when I thought I was the slayer.
XANDER You thought you were all special. Miss Sunnydale 2003. And the minute you found out you weren't, you handed the crown to Amanda without a moment's pause. You gave her your power.
DAWN The power wasn't mine.
XANDER They'll never know how tough it is, Dawnie, to be the one who isn't chosen. To live so near to the spotlight and never step in it. But I know. I see more than anybody realizes because nobody's watching me. I saw you last night. I see you working here today. You're not special. You're extraordinary.
DAWN Maybe that's your power.
XANDER What?
DAWN Seeing. Knowing.
XANDER Maybe it is. Maybe I should get a cape.
DAWN Cape is good.
XANDER Yeah.
