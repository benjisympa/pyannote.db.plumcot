GILES Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer:
BUFFY The First. That's what it wants.
GILES To erase all the slayers in training and their watchers, along with their methods.
WILLOW Buffy, he's been feeding...
BUFFY He really didn't know what he'd done. It wasn't in his control.
XANDER It's a trigger. It's a brainwashing term. It's how the military makes sleeper agents.
WILLOW Amy.
AMY Can I come in?
WILLOW If you really are my friend, you better stay away from me.
PROFESSOR_WALSH Agent Finn, my implant?
RILEY The implant works. Hostile 17 can't harm any living creature in any way without intense neurological pain.
WARREN You think you can just do that to me?
WILLOW Tara?
WARREN Somebody! Help!
WILLOW You wanna do the sleeping arrangements?
KENNEDY OK. You, uh, better not hog the covers.
GILES Are you sure you'll all be all right?
DAWN You'll only be gone for two days.
BUFFY I think we've managed a bit longer than that.
GILES Right. Oh, Dawn, Vi's left her notebook on the mantelpiece. Would you mind running it out to the car?
DAWN Sure.
GILES While you're at it, you smack her in the head with it and remind her not to leave it lying around.
DAWN On it.
GILES I'm just a bit twitchy about leaving you alone again here whilewhile things are in such a state of flux.
BUFFY I know. But you should go. This trip is important for the girls to understand the source of their power, and to know how to use it right.
GILES Do you think they appreciate the gravity of what we're undertaking? It's frightening, and it's difficult. And then, apparently, someone told them that the vision quest consists of me driving them to the desert, doing the hokey pokey until a spooky Rasta-mama slayer arrives and speaks to them in riddles.
BUFFY That's not exactly how I put it, I Hey, how's Kennedy?
WILLOW Still fluey. Bummed about missing the field trip. She says she wants you to meditate extra hard for her and to bring her back some smores.
GILES Ah yes. Smores. I'm going to end up singing campfire songs aren't I?
BUFFY Oh yeah.
XANDER Giles, you might want to get out there.
GILES Oh, God, what?
DAWN Molly and Rona are fighting over who gets to drive the first leg.
BUFFY Bet you wish you renewed that California state driver's license now, huh?
ANYA Rona won. You should probably let Molly out of the trunk. I never actually realized just how compact Molly really is.
GILES Please be safe while I'm away.
BUFFY You too.
BUFFY Hey.
SPIKE Hey.
BUFFY Giles is off ...on the retreat.
SPIKE Give us all a chance for a breather, eh?
BUFFY From Giles?
SPIKE From the constant pitter patter of clomping teenage girly feet.
BUFFY I have no idea what you're talking about.
SPIKE Come on.
BUFFY No, I enjoy my responsibility as mentor, role model, life guideoh, my God, I cannot believe I have my bathroom all to myself for two whole days.
SPIKE It's like a bloody war-zone up there, and not in a good way.
BUFFY Have you seen the kitchen since they've been here?
SPIKE I'm just trying to stay out of their way.
BUFFY I noticed.
SPIKE This is better. Believe me, it's safer.
BUFFY OK. But you've been fine. In close contact with the girls.
SPIKE With you by my side, yeah. You won't let me hurt one of them. And that's the way it's gonna be until we're sure the First is done making me its bitch. Either we're together, or I'm on the leash.
BUFFY We just need to make sure the trigger's deactivated then. We've got a couple of days, lack of pitter-patter and all...
SPIKE Buffy...
BUFFY What?
SPIKE Ow.
BUFFY Ow?
SPIKE Ow ow ow!
BUFFY What's wrong? Spike, what is going on?
SPIKE The chip. God. Why would? Aaahhh!
WILLOW Hey. How is he?
BUFFY Oh, in the goes part of comes and goes.
WILLOW Well there seems to be a definite lack of screaming. That has to be good.
BUFFY You'd think. That for the other patient?
WILLOW Yeah. Thought I'd bring her some tea, help her feel better.
BUFFY Mm-hmm?
WILLOW It's just tea.
BUFFY Will, how much do you know about the chip?
WILLOW Spike's chip? Well, I remember trying to dig up stuff back then, but, you know, turns out, when a secret government agency studies vampires and puts chips in their brains that keep them from hurting people, they don't really build websites. Why?
BUFFY Even with the chip, Spike was able to hurt all those people when he was brainwashed.
WILLOW Yeah, but he was under the control of the First.
BUFFY Maybe something's wrong with it.
WILLOW The chip is misfiring all on its own, then. Well this'll be fun.
BUFFY Remember when things used to be nice and boring?
WILLOW No.
BUFFY Have fun...delivering tea...
WILLOW OK, not when you make it sound all dirty like that. It's just tea.
WILLOW Hey, I figured the best thing for a cold is a nice hot cup of...boots?
KENNEDY Hey.
WILLOW For someone who's sick, you look surprisingly robust and casual dressy.
KENNEDY Well, the lighting in here is good. Maybe it's just
WILLOW You were never sick!
KENNEDY No...I was never sick.
WILLOW Oh, you are so busted. Xander's gonna have to drive you to the desert and
KENNEDY Willow, chill. There's a reason I didn't go. I have a thing. A separate thing.
WILLOW What?
KENNEDY Something's coming down. I have my own mission. And I need you help.
BAND So I can be happy again...
WILLOW This is a mission?
KENNEDY Oh! Yeah...
WILLOW And the little pink umbrellas are a signal for what? We're not on a mission, are we?
KENNEDY Hey, trust me, I told you. I have a thing. Come on, come on. Just hang out with me a little. You're sexy when you pout.
WILLOW Why do you do that?
KENNEDY To get you to stay.
WILLOW All right, I'll stay for one drink, then I'm going home.
KENNEDY OK. One drink. I can work with that. Let's start with the easy stuff. How long have you known? That you're gay.
WILLOW Wait. That's easy? And you just assume that I'mI'm gay. I mean, presume much?
KENNEDY OK. How long have you enjoyed having sex with women?
WILLOW Hey! What you think you have some special lesbidar or something?
KENNEDY OK, you know there's a better word for that, right? You really haven't been getting out there much, have you?
WILLOW Well, I justcan you always tell justjust by looking at someone?
KENNEDY No. No, of course not. That wouldn't be any fun. The fun part is the process ofof getting to know a girl. It's likeit's like flirting in code. It's using body language and laughing at the right jokes andand looking into her eyes and knowing she's still whispering to you, even when she's not saying a word. And that sense that if you can just touch her just once everything will be OK for both of you. That's how you can tell. Or if she's really hot, you just get her drunksee if she comes on to you.
WILLOW Three years ago. That's when I knew. And it wasn't women, it was woman. Just one.
KENNEDY Lucky woman.
SPIKE Popped another blood vessel, I think.
BUFFY There's gotta be a reason why the chip is going all wonky. Maybe it's related to the trigger or maybe it has something to do with the new soul.
SPIKE Or maybe I wasn't meant to last this long. One more thing you and I have in common, eh, pet?
BUFFY Well, we'll fix it. We'll hit serious research mode
SPIKE Good. Try
SPIKE .
BUFFY OK. You're right. Not a book thing. It's a phone thing.
SPIKE Who you gonna call? God, that phrase is never gonna be useable again, is it?
BUFFY Doubt it.
KENNEDY Do your parents know?
WILLOW Yeah. My mom waswas all proud like I was making some political statement. Then the statement mojo wore off and I was just gay. She hardly ever even met Tara.
KENNEDY Classic.
WILLOW I didn't mind. Tara and I are kind of private.
KENNEDY I'm sorry. It must've
WILLOW Were, I mean. Private.
BUFFY Yes, Agent Finn, Riley. Tell him we're having a problem with Spike's chip. No his chip. Spike.
SPIKE Listen, pet?
BUFFY No, no, Finn is his last name. Yeah. Well, did he used to work there and then he got transferred? Oh, is this actually a flower shop, or is this one of those things where I'm supposed to play along to show that I know it's really secret ops? Oh, maybe I shouldn't have said that. Oh, OK, right. Well, if some guy named Finn shows up to buy flowers Yeah. Thanks. Wrong number. Or a giant government conspiracy, one or the Spike?
SPIKE This one seemed easier than the others. See? Probably just gonna fade
KENNEDY It was
KENNEDY . I saw that, and I knew I wanted to sweep Scarlet off her feet.
WILLOW You were five.
KENNEDY Well, I'm not saying the sweeping would have been easy... What?
WILLOW I justI still don't get it. Why you like me. I mean, you don't even know me.
KENNEDY Have you seen you? And we like the same thingsItalian, skate punk, Robert Parker mysteries, fighting evil...
WILLOW I don't like any of that stuff. Except thethe fighting evil part. Even then, I prefer a nice foot massage.
KENNEDY OK, I dig the way you always turn off the Moulin Rouge DVD at Chapter 32 so it has a happy ending. I like the way you speak. It's interesting. And your freckles...likeable. I'm not so into the magic stuff. It seems like fairy tale crap to me, but if it matters to you... You care about it, so it's cool.
WILLOW Well, this is my stop. So...glad we talked.
KENNEDY Yes. Kinda cleared the air.
WILLOW Yeah, totally. Air cleared. Check.
KENNEDY You know, in the spirit of air clearing...
WILLOW Yeah?
KENNEDY I feel like I need to be honest about something.
WILLOW I-is something wrong?
KENNEDY No. No, it's just I think you should know...
WARREN Well, that was nice.
WILLOW Are you OK? I'm not used to literally knocking girls off of their feet with just the power of my own lips.
WARREN OK, you gonna pick that up, or...?
KENNEDY I don'twhat are you?
WILLOW Is this a freckle thing, 'cause
WILLOW/WARREN* Oh, God! Oh, God...
KENNEDY What... is that?
WILLOW/WARREN* It's the man that I killed.
KENNEDY OK, hold up a sec.
WILLOW/WARREN* Guys
XANDER Get Buffy. Get Buffy. Tell her the First is back.
WILLOW/WARREN* No, I'm not the First.
ANYA We're not interested in any of your evil lies. We've heard 'em all.
WILLOW*/WARREN No, guys it's me.
WILLOW/WARREN* I'm me. I'm Willow. Guys, come on. As Kennedy she was there.
KENNEDY I don't know. I'm not sure. We were up in Willow's room and we were-
ANDREW No... No. You're back.
WILLOW/WARREN* No, I'm not. It's not I'm not it. Listen to me
ANDREW No more listening. I know who you are now. I know what you made me do. Your promises of happy fields and dancing schnauzers and being demigods won't work on me anymore.
ANYA Buffy!
XANDER The Bringers are coming too.
WILLOW/WARREN* No, I'm not the First.
ANDREW You made me do things. Things I can never take back. Ever.
WILLOW/WARREN* I'm not the First.
BUFFY What the hell is going on here? Ow!
SPIKE Buffy...
ANYA Wait.
DAWN But if he's the First...
WILLOW/WARREN* I'm not the First.
XANDER You're not the First.
WILLOW/WARREN* I know.
ANDREW Oh, my God! You're back.
WILLOW*/WARREN Hey, bad touching!
WILLOW/WARREN* Everyone please stop it.
KENNEDY It's Willow.
WILLOW/WARREN* I'm Willow.
XANDER Are you sure?
WILLOW*/WARREN There are other stories from kindergarten. Non yellow crayon stories in which you don't come out in such a good light.
WILLOW/WARREN* An incident involving Aquaman underoos, for example. You want me to start talking?
XANDER Hey, Willow!
ANYA What happened?
WILLOW/WARREN* I don't know. We were there, and then I looked like him.
ANYA Oh, like a glamour.
WILLOW/WARREN* Maybe, but I probably brought it on myself.
BUFFY What makes you think that?
WILLOW/WARREN* Well, it wouldn't be the first time. I have a history with my witchy subconscious making things go kerfloopey. Remember the wacky I can't see you, you can't see me spell?
BUFFY Guys!
ANDREW It's so real.
WILLOW/WARREN* I'm all too aware. (brushes Dawn's hand away.
BUFFY OK, say you're right, and you did do this to yourself. Why would your subconscious turn you into Warren?
WILLOW/WARREN* Obviously because I feel badabout killing him.
BUFFY We'll deal. We'll get help.
WILLOW/WARREN* No, I can handle this.
BUFFY On your own? Why?
WILLOW/WARREN* I did it. I'll fix it. I don't want you seeing me this way anyway.
BUFFY It's kinda a little late for that.
WILLOW/WARREN* Seriously, I'm not posing any big threat to the world. Looks like you've got your hands full already.
WILLOW*/WARREN I'll go, I'll handle it, I'll fix it, I'll be back before you even know I'm gone.
WILLOW/WARREN* Promise.
BUFFY Spike.
SPIKE Buffy.
BUFFY I'm right here.
SPIKE The chip fired again.
BUFFY I kinda figured. Maybe they'll call back. Maybe they'll send help.
SPIKE Maybe we can't wait.
KENNEDY OK. Safe to say no one will ever accuse you of being too butch.
WILLOW/WARREN* Kennedy, go home.
KENNEDY Come on. I mean, you turned into a guy. I mean if you take a step back, seriously, there's a certain element of humor here, right? Well, a really, really big step.
WILLOW/WARREN* I killed him. It's hard to see the chuckles.
KENNEDY So you got a plan?
WILLOW*/WARREN Yeah, get some help reversing it.
KENNEDY I thought you were gonna try it yourself.
WILLOW*/WARREN I did try. Something's blocking me.
KENNEDY All the more reason for me to go with you. Plus, I was there when it happened. Lemme come to try to help too.
WILLOW/WARREN* I really think I'm fine with the handling.
KENNEDY By yourself? Why?
WILLOW*/WARREN I'm the one that killed him. I It's hard to understand.
KENNEDY Given. How 'bout I just tag along anyway. Keep you company. I'm taking that as a yes.
WILLOW/WARREN* Fine. Come.
WILLOW*/WARREN Try not to get in the way.
KENNEDY You know where you're going?
WILLOW*/WARREN To see some old friends of mine. It's been a while, but maybe they can help.
SPIKE Are you sure you still wanna go back in this place with me?
BUFFY Eh, nothing good on TV tonight.
SPIKE Here we are.
SPIKE Yep, here we are. You think the stuff's still good?
SPIKE I don't know. Worked pretty good when the Initiative held me captive here. Every time I'd get a little...rambunctious, the chip'd kick in. I feel like my head was gonna explode. They'd dope me up, and everything would be all daffodils and teddy bears. For a couple of hours anyway.
BUFFY Maybe we should search for files and stuff. Find out everything we can about the chipshelf life.
SPIKE I'll take whatever I can get.
BUFFY Ready?
SPIKE Yeah.
ANDREW I'll get it. I'm supposed to get a call when the new League of Extraordinary Gentlemen comes in. I gave them this number.
XANDER Ooh. Can you see if you can get two?
ANDREW Summers residence, this is Andrew speaking. How can I help you?
XANDER Loser.
ANDREW Hey, do we know some British guy named Robson?
XANDER He was attacked, this Robson guy in England. And Giles was there helping him. And there was a Bringer.
ANYA Xander...
XANDER Robson blacked out, but the last thing he remembers is Giles's head about to get really familiar with a Bringer's very sharp axe.
DAWN Oh, my God!
ANYA Giles never mentioned any of this.
XANDER Robson said by the time he came to, there was no Giles.
DAWN So, what are we saying?
XANDER Maybe Giles just didn't want to talk about it.
ANYA Or maybe he didn't make it. Look, I'm not saying it's a happy scenario, but we're dealing with a big bad that can be any dead person it wants.
XANDER Because if you want to infiltrate the inner circle of the slayer...
ANYA Become the one person she trusts more than anybody else.
DAWN But there's no way that we can know.
ANDREW Actually that's not true. The First can't take corporeal form, so it can't touch anything.
ANYA Oh, it's not like Giles hasn't touched anything, right? Ha-has anyone seen Giles touch anything since he got back? Hold anything? Has anybody hugged him? Think very hard.
ANDREW Waitwhere're you...?
XANDER The desert. We're gonna find Giles.
ANDREW Oh good. Let me just get some tapes for the car. I've been working on this mix
XANDER You're not coming.
ANDREW What? Why? 'Cause I used to be evil?
XANDER No, actually, 'cause you're annoying, but that's a good reason too.
ANDREW Wait, Idon't leave me here alone. I keep getting attacked in this house.
DAWN Actually, Xand...
ANDREW What if this is all part of the plan? Drive you guys away so it can have its way with me? Ever think of that?
XANDER I'll risk it.
ANDREW OK, well, if you leave me here alone, I'll do something evil, like burning something or gluing things together.
ANYA For crying out loud, Harris, let's just take him. At least we can keep an eye on him. Xander...
XANDER I know, they're out there all alone. All of 'em.
CIRCLE_LEADER Instill us, oh, great one, with peace, with strength, with compassion, with hope. The path we seek is yours. Keep us on that path.
WILLOW*/WARREN OK, wow, this is new.
CIRCLE_LEADER Um, hi, we're
WILLOW/WARREN* Oh, hey. I'm sorryWillow. We actually met when I was a Freshman. And also not a boy. This is Kennedy.
KENNEDY Hey.
CIRCLE_LEADER You're Willow?
WILLOW/WARREN* Yeah. Wow, look at you guys. Campus Wiccans. Guess you got past the whole bake sale phase.
CIRCLE_LEADER Uh, no, we still do that too. Second Tuesday of every month. I'm sorry, I'm kind of having a hard time with the whole guy event thing...
WOMAN Um, it's actually her. I can tell. I know her.
WILLOW*/WARREN OK. Whoa...
WOMAN/AMY OK, here's the thing. Hi. Here's the thing. I'll just get this out of the way. I'm sorta screwed up, but I mean you already knew that 'cause you lived it. Gotcha.
CIRCLE_LEADER But she's doing so much better now. Amy...
AMY It's OK, Vaughne, I wanna do this. It took me a long time to really see myself. But I did. Because you know that's the crazy thing about hitting rock bottom, you get to relive all the crappy things you did. And I wanted to come find you and tell you that I was here working on things with these guys. And that they're good. And that I'm sorry. But you're here, looking like Wow. How did this happen?
KENNEDY That's what we're here to find out. I mean, if we're done with all the group hugging.
WILLOW/WARREN* I got hit with this, like, glamour thing, and I can't seem to shake it myself. I was hoping someone here might be able to help.
AMY Yeah, see the thing is we're more about healing spirits and nurturing our life force here.
WILLOW/WARREN* Oh...
AMY But we'll try.
AMY Her spirits true, its shell a lie...
KENNEDY What if she can't handle this?
AMY We draw upon your very light.
CIRCLE_LEADER_/_VAUGHNE Do you have a better idea?
AMY ...Give back the form the soul requires. See that the balance is put right.
AMY It didn't work?
WILLOW*/WARREN No it didn't, you dumb bitch!
KENNEDY Willow!
AMY You slapped me!
WILLOW/WARREN* No, I didn't. It wasn't me. It was Warren.
KENNEDY Willow...
KENNEDY Willow! OK, you're upset.
WILLOW/WARREN* Upset? Upset! Are you just tuning in? Did you not see that?
WILLOW*/WARREN I'm turning into him.
WILLOW/WARREN* It's not a trick, it's not a glamour. I'm becoming him. A murderous, misogynist man. I mean, do you understand what he did? What I could do? I killed him for a reason.
KENNEDY Getting angry isn't helping. We can still try to
WILLOW/WARREN* You understand nothing about magic. In case you hadn't noticed, our little dateit's over.
KENNEDY Willow! Willow, wait!
BUFFY Be careful. Oh, God. They just left them.
SPIKE They just sealed the place off. Left everything as it was.
BUFFY I'm thinking brief stay.
SPIKE Yeah, you're not wrong. I think I can get us to the med lab, find the drug.
ANDREW OK, I'll go. R. Ghost is is hard to play by yourself.
ANYA How long since they left?
XANDER A few hours.
ANYA If it is the First, and I'm not saying it is, what're we expecting to find?
XANDER He didn't bring them out there to meditate.
ANDREW Kinda makes you grateful you weren't a potential after all, doesn't it? Safer.
ANYA Not so fast with the big phew.
XANDER He might know we're coming.
ANYA Which means we're already too late, and we're heading out to the middle of nowhere.
DAWN With no slayer, no powerful witch...
ANYA Just a teenager, a powerful former demon, and two big geeks.
ANDREW OK, license plate game, maybe?
WILLOW/WARREN* Look at me. Crying like a little girl.
SPIKE You hear that?
BUFFY Yep.
SPIKE Think something survived?
BUFFY Sounds like.
SPIKE You see where?
BUFFY No, it sounded like it was coming from over there. Whatever it is, it's not
SPIKE Buffy!
KENNEDY Where'd they go?
AMY They took off. It was a little too creepy, even for us. You're really worried about her. Look, she's gonna be fine, really. She's good at this. She's strong. And she's dealt with a lot worse. Long before she ever went out and found herself a big old potential slayer bodyguard, OK? Just have a little faith in her.
KENNEDY I never said I was a potential slayer.
AMY Oh, no, I think you did. When you first got here, you told us
KENNEDY No, I didn't. How did you know who I was?
AMY Oops.
SPIKE Not now...
BUFFY Spike!
SHOP_KEEPER So, same model as last time? How'd that work out for you?
WILLOW*/WARREN You'd be amazed.
XANDER Touch him. Touch him.
DAWN Oh, I feel him. I feel him.
XANDER Me too.
ANDREW Me too.
GILES We all feel each other. Including some of us who don't know each other well enough to take such liberties, thank you. I assume there's a perfectly reasonable and not at all insane explanation here.
ANYA We thought you might be non-corporeal evil.
DAWN We got a call. We couldn't remember you touching anything.
XANDER We had to make sure you were OK. We were worried.
GILES Oh. That's very sweet. Now wait a minuteyou think I'm evil... if I bring a group of girls on a camping trip and don't touch them?
BUFFY Spike?
BUFFY Hey. Are you still with us?
SPIKE Yeah.
BUFFY That guy was just the beginning.
SPIKE What's happening?
SOLDIER Miss Summers. Agent Finn reported that you tried to contact him earlier today.
BUFFY I knew it! Government conspiracy.
SOLDIER He indicated you might be needing our assistance. We're to provide you anything you need to help assface here. Those were his exact words, ma'am.
SOLDIER Med team tells me they took a look at the chip. You were right. It's degraded. Leave it as it is much longer, it'll be fatal to him.
BUFFY OK. So, how long t
SOLDIER Now.
BUFFY Right, of course. Um, what do we do next?
SOLDIER Agent Finn said it was your call, ma'am.
BUFFY Mywhat was my call?
SOLDIER All decisions regarding Hostile 17 are to be left in your hands. This chip...we can either repair it... or remove it.
KENNEDY Tell me why you did this to her.
KENNEDY What did you do to her?
AMY What, to Willow? Oh, just your standard penance malediction is all.
KENNEDY OK, and that's magic crazy talk for what?
AMY I put a hex on her.
KENNEDY I got that part. But why Warren? And why did it happen after we kissed?
AMY Oh, that's rich. That must've been some kiss. You must be good.
KENNEDY Answer me.
AMY The hex I cast lets the victim's subconscious pick the form of their punishment. It's always better than anything I can come up with. Elegant, you know?
KENNEDY Undo it. Let her out.
AMY OK. Oh, wait, I forgotno.
KENNEDY Why would you do this to her? You really hate her that much?
AMY This is not about hate. It's about power. Willow always had all the power, long before she even knew what to do with it. Just came so easy for her. The rest of uswe had to work twice as hard to be half as good. But no one cares about how hard you work. They just care about cute, sweet Willow. They don't know how weak she is. She gave in to evilstuff worse than I can even imagine She almost destroyed the world! And yet everyone keeps on loving her? So what's wrong with having a little fun, huh? Taking her down a peg or two?
KENNEDY Fun? She's disappearing. Fading away in that creep, and you think it's fun.
AMY It was just a game. It's not my fault if she's losing herself.
KENNEDY I'm gonna stop you now, you know.
AMY Hey, I'm not the bad guy here. But I wonder where he'd be right about now.
KENNEDY Well, that was a hell of a thing.
WILLOW*/WARREN Think you can just do that to me? That I'd let you get away with it?
KENNEDY Do? Get away with OK, let's not get excited.
WILLOW*/WARREN It's too late for that. This is what I am. I made it happen, and I'll make it stop.
KENNEDY Willow, what did you make happen?
WILLOW*/WARREN You were there, bitch! You saw it!
WILLOW/WARREN* I killed her.
KENNEDY You mean him?
WILLOW/WARREN* Her, him You know what I mean.
KENNEDY You said her.
WILLOW/WARREN* No, that was Warren.
KENNEDY No, no it wasn't. You said I was there. Who did you kill, Willow?
WILLOW*/WARREN It was your fault, slut.
WILLOW/WARREN* You tricked me. Got me to forget.
KENNEDY Tara....
WILLOW/WARREN* Shut up!
WILLOW*/WARREN Shut up! You do not get to say her name. Offering it up to whoever's there. Tricking me into kissing you. I didn'tI didn't mean... what I'm saying, II can't make Kennedy, I can't hold on... he's winning.
KENNEDY No...
WILLOW*/WARREN I'm being punished. I kI kissed you justjust for a second, but it was enough. I let her go. I didn't mean to.
KENNEDY Kissing me didn't mean th
WILLOW*/WARREN No, she was never gone. She was with me. We should have been forever, and I I let her be dead. She's really dead. And I killed her.
KENNEDY Willow, no.
WILLOW*/WARREN Please, baby, I'm so sorry.
WILLOW/WARREN* Come back. I'm sorry. I'm sorry! Come back...
KENNEDY Willow, I don't think you did anything wrong. This is just magic. And I think I'm figuring the whole magic thing out. It's just like fairy tales.
WILLOW/WARREN* What are you doing?
KENNEDY Bringing you back to life.
KENNEDY Hmm. I am good.
WILLOW It'sit's me? I'm back? Oh, God...
KENNEDY Are you all right?
WILLOW I have no idea. I'm so tired.
KENNEDY Yeah. I'll make you some tea.
