GILES Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer:
XANDER You killed your best friend.
ANDREW It didn't work 'cause there wasn't enough blood.
BUFFY I bet that's what the First needed Spike for.
BUFFY We don't have time to baby-sit a hostage.
ANDREW I'll be good.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Apparently somebody left this in the courtyard, and I was just returning it.
BUFFY That's some full-service principaling.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD I try.
SPIKE Ow ow ow!
BUFFY There's gotta be a reason why the chip is going all wonky.
SOLDIER This chip...we can either repair it... or remove it.
GILES Robson!
XANDER Robson blacked out, but the last thing he remembers is Giles's head about to get real familiar with a Bringer's very sharp axe.
ROBSON It's started...
GILES I understand. I'll take care of i
GILES It was, uh, extraordinary good luck, of course. Andand, uh, trainingyears of training. Chao-Ahn, keep up. You're new here, Chao-Ahn, so take note. Remember about training. But I honestly feel the largest part of it was instinct. Instinct and-and reflexes. There's a sort of wary watchfulness I've developed over the years. It's like another sense
BUFFY Spike!
GILES What?
SPIKE Anya said you were the First. Said you were evil. You're supposed to be all go-through-able.
GILES Then what the hell did you tackle me for, you berk? What's that supposed to do?
SPIKE I, uh, I didn't think of that.
GILES More importantly, you just hit me. Why didn't your chip go off?
SPIKE Yeah, well...
BUFFY Well, uh, when we were at the Initiative...
SPIKE There was a choice.
BUFFY Right. Either repair the chip, or to remove it.
GILES You had it removYou removed the chip?
BUFFY Yeah.
SPIKE Had to make a choice.
BUFFY It really is OK.
AMANDA What's a chip?
KENNEDY They removed the chip?
CHAO-AHN SUBTITLE: I don't understand a word any of you are saying.
GILES You know this is very dangerous.
BUFFY Ah, you just heard the horror stories. Wear hoops, they'll catch on something, rip your lobe off. Lobes flying everywhere.
GILES That's not what I'm talking about.
BUFFY You mean Spike not having a chip. Free range Spike?
GILES I have to askwhy on Earth did you make that decision?
BUFFY Guess it was instinct, like you were talking about.
GILES I made that up! I knew the Bringer was there because his shoes squeaked. Buffy, it's crucial that we keep these girls safe. I can't count the dangersthe First, the Bringers, random demons, and now Spike?
BUFFY And the Principal.
GILES What?
BUFFY Oh, nothing much. He was in the school basement, holding a shovel, acting evasive. Plus, he's got that whole too charming to be real thing going on. I'm looking into it.
GILES Oh, well that sounds very responsible of you. Balances out the vampire-on-the-loose issue.
BUFFY Nothing's changed, Giles. Spike had a chip before, remember? When the First had him kill and sire all those people.
GILES We have no idea if his chip was working then. A new chip might restrain him should the First attempt to activate him again.
BUFFY Spike has a soul now. That's what's gonna stop him from hurting people.
GILES Buffy...
BUFFY He can be a good man, Giles. I feel it. But he's never gonna get there if we don't give him the chance.
GILES Buffy, I want more for you. Your feelings for him are coloring your judgement. I can hear it in your voice. And that way lies a future filled with pain. I don't want that for you.
BUFFY We haven't Things have been different since he came back.
GILES It doesn't matter if you're not physical with each other anymore. There's a connection. You rely on him, he relies on you. That's what's affecting your judgment.
BUFFY You think I'm losing sight of the big picture, but I'm not. When Spike had that chip, it was like having him in a muzzle. It was wrong. You can't beat evil by doing evil. I know that.
GILES Well, I hope you're right. You're gambling with a lot of lives.
XANDER Hi, can I help? You seem kind of confused.
WOMAN You aren't wearing a green apron.
XANDER Confused, but sort of randomly observant.
WOMAN Sorry, I just mean... you don't work here, right?
XANDER No. Right. Just helpful. I'm Xander.
WOMAN Lissa. And I guess I could use some advice. I can't even figure out if I've got the right kind of rope.
XANDER That depends on what you need it for. Something like functional around the house, or, you know, recreational. By which I mean, for example, boating or mountain climbingnot for tying someone up for sexy, funky fun. In conclusion, rope can be useful in various ways.
WOMAN/LISSA I have a kayak.
XANDER Again with the random. I like it.
LISSA Sorry. I need to store my kayak. So I was thinking maybe I could sorta suspend it from the ceiling in the garage with ropes and a pulley or a winch thing.
XANDER Not a bad plan. You'll need stronger rope than that. Wanna have coffee with me later?
LISSA What?
XANDER Oh, you're the only one that gets to be random?
BUFFY Now, if I were a sign of being evil, where would I be?
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Uh, Buffy?
BUFFY Principal Wood. It's you.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD You looking for something?
BUFFY File folders. And mechanical pencils. Well, I want to write on a file folder with a mechanical pencil.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD The supply cabinet in the outer office has those things.
BUFFY Oh, this isn't a supply cabinet? My bad. OK. Thanks.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Hey, Buffy...
BUFFY Yeah?
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Um, what're you doing tonight?
BUFFY Preparing for tomorrow's counseling sessions.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD No, really.
BUFFY Watching a reality show about a millionaire.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Well, then, I'd, um I'd like to take you out to dinner, if that's all right with you. I mean, you don't have to. I'm certainly not saying come to dinner if you enjoy having a job. You know, I may have to make up a document saying I didn't just say that and have you sign it.
BUFFY Sure. I'd be happy to have dinner with you.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Great. I'll draw up the paperwork.
WILLOW So, he asked you out to dinner?
BUFFY Yeah. Isn't that weird? I mean, he's a Principal. He's a young, hot Principal with earrings, but he's a Principal. Why do you think he asked me out? I mean, he could be interested, right?
WILLOW Yeah, sure. You're a frisky vixen.
BUFFY Or, it could be work-related. Maybe I'm getting promoted for doing such a good job.
WILLOW Oh, right, thatthat makes sense too.
BUFFY Or, maybe he knows that I suspect he's up to something, and he's taking me out to kill me.
WILLOW Well, you'll have to dress for the ambiguity.
BUFFY You know, it's not even that he's acting that suspicious. It's justthere he is. On the hell mouth. All day, every day. That's got to be like being showered with evil. Only from underneath.
WILLOW Not really a shower.
BUFFY A bidet. Like a bidet of evil.
WILLOW Buff, if he's really interested, are you interested back?
BUFFY I don't know. He's good-looking, and he'she's solid, he's smart, he's normal. So, not the wicked energy, which is nice 'cause I don't want to only be attracted to wicked energy. Or what if he is wicked, in which case, is that why I'm attracted to him?
WILLOW I'm gonna wait for that sentence to come around again before I jump on.
BUFFY You know what? Yeah, I mean I think I like him. And he'd be good for me.
WILLOW Right. Help you move on.
BUFFY Why does everybody in this house think I'm still in love with Spike?
WILLOW No, I-I meant move on from this imposed super-self-reliance. Let somebody get close.
BUFFY Oh. Hey, someone's here.
XANDER Guys, guess what happened.
WILLOW Buffy got a date!
XANDER No, I did. Fine. Way to steal my thunder.
BUFFY Sorry. If it makes you feel better, it's Principal Wood, and I think he's aligned with the First.
XANDER Also, like ten years older than you, right?
WILLOW Which is like 100 years younger than your type!
BUFFY Yay. Someone who doesn't remember the Industrial Revolution.
WILLOW I think they're gonna end up making out. Oh, Principal Wood, she'll gasp, I love your lack of wicked energy.
BUFFY Watch it, or I'm gonna make you talk about your new girlfriend who you hold hands with under the dinner table and think we don't notice.
WILLOW How 'bout yours, Xander. Is she evil?
XANDER Well, she's interested in me, so there's a good chance, but I'm hoping for the best. We're going for coffee. She has a kayak
GILES Dear lord, I hate that mall. The shop assistants are rude. And everything in the Food Court is sticky.
WILLOW Looks like you found her some stuff.
GILES Oh, hello. Yes.
XANDER That's gotta be rough. Getting just like pulled out of your home, being told you're a potential slayer, not being able to bring anything.
GILES Yes, and the language barrier is formidable. I was concerned that my Mandarin is a little thin, but as it turns out, she speaks Cantonese, which is thinner. But we muddled through, and, as I suspected, ice cream is a universal language.
CHAO-AHN SUBTITLE: Like many from Asia, I am lactose intolerant. I'm very uncomfortable.
BUFFY What'd she say?
GILES She's grateful to be in the land of plenty. Let's, um, go and put away your new clothes.
BUFFY Hey, Will, do you think you can do a computer check on Principal Wood. See if you can find anything out.
WILLOW Yeah, sure. Want me to check your girl out while I'm at it, Xand?
XANDER Nope. I'm going in blind. I'm gonna be an optimist about this. Why go looking for trouble? If it's gonna find you, it's gonna find you.
ANDREW Getting the most out of your new microwave. Hm. Nice. Clock comma setting the, page 3.
JONATHAN/FIRST You don't need a manual, it's intuitive. There's a button marked Clock Set for pity's sake. What kind of a nerd are you? No wonder you crashed your jet pack.
ANDREW No, get thee behind me. I rebuke thee. Take that, The First!
JONATHAN/FIRST Look, you monkey. Ooh. Ahh. It burns as it ineffectually passes through me. I'm not corporeal, remember. Also, not a vampire, soa cross?
ANDREW What do you want from me, Jonathan slash The First?
JONATHAN/FIRST I have an assignment for you.
ANDREW Um, I follow Buffy's orders now. I'm redeeming myself for... killing youI mean, for... killing Jonathan.
JONATHAN/FIRST Really, why? So you can earn a spot on her little pep squad? You think she'll ever let you in? You're a murderer.
ANDREW Confidentially, a lot of her people are murderers. Anya and Willow and Spike.
JONATHAN/FIRST Interesting. And you're the only one she makes seek redemption. Does that seem fair to you?
ANDREW I guess not.
JONATHAN/FIRST You know we're headed toward a fight, don't you?
ANDREW Yeah.
JONATHAN/FIRST What do you think the world's gonna be like after that? Newsflash. There's not going to be a slayer gang anymore. But there is going to be Evil. And as long as there is Evil, I live. And as long as I live, you can dwell at my side.
ANDREW That sounds nice.
JONATHAN/FIRST Your assignment won't be hard. They're just little girls.
ANDREW You want me to hurt the girls?
JONATHAN/FIRST Uh, no, not all of them. Not Dawn, not Anya, not Willow, and not your friend Buffy. Just the potential slayers.
ANDREW That'sthat's horrible. I'm-I'm gonna scream andand get Buffy in here.
JONATHAN/FIRST She can't see me, and I'm gonna keep talking until you hear what I have to say, so listen up, OK? The girls must die.
ANDREW I could never do that. All those girls, a-all that bloodI-I didn't like the stabbing before.
JONATHAN/FIRST You don't have to stab. This'll be easy. Andrew, I want you to think. Willow brought something to this housesomething good, something you can use.
ANDREW The new microwave?
JONATHAN/FIRST The gun. I want you to think hard. Where did they put the gun?
ANDREW Hmm.
ANYA I don't think it's really a date. That's what I think.
BUFFY Well, it is unclear. That's why I chose a top that says, you know, I'm comfortable in a stodgy office or a swinging casual settingor killing you, you know, if you're a demon.
ANYA It also says I sometimes get blood on my shoulder. Or it might be pizza. I don't think I can fix it.
BUFFY Thanks for trying.
ANYA And I wasn't talking about your date anyway. I was talking about this sham date of Xander's. I think it's part of a plan to make me jealous.
BUFFY Well, it's not working.
ANYA Are you nuts? Of course it's working. Observe my-my bitter ranting. Hear the shrill edge of hysteria in my voice.
BUFFY Um, I should really go find something else to wear.
ANYA Fine, go. Leave me here to stew in my impotent rage. I'm also gonna pee, so you should probably go.
SPIKE You look nice.
BUFFY Oh, thanks. Uh, traditionally, one wears something over this.
SPIKE Heard you got a date.
BUFFY Well, it's unclear. I mean, I have this whole theory about a promotion. Or he's evil.
SPIKE Buffy, I'm all right.
BUFFY You don't have to
SPIKE What? Be noble? I'm not. Really, I'm all right. Think I still dream of a crypt for two with a white picket fence? My eyes are clear.
BUFFY Good. I'm glad. Thank you.
SPIKE Never much cared for picket fences, anyway. Bloody dangerous.
BUFFY You should try this too. The going out thing, I mean. I mean, there's that girl you brought to Anya and Xander's not-a-wedding.
SPIKE Oh, yeah, right. There's always girls who like the lookbad boy, you know. Does it for some of them.
BUFFY Yeah, I can see that. I should go. I don't wanna be late.
XANDER Lissa! Hi. I was afraid you weren't coming.
LISSA You said 8:30, right? Did you think I was going to stand you up?
XANDER Well, it would be kind of karmic.
LISSA What?
XANDER Forget it. I'm just glad you're here. You're gonna love the coffee. Got myself a redeyeit's black coffee with a shot of espresso. It's kinda rough if you're not used to that sort of thing
LISSA It's hot cocoa.
XANDER Well, sometimes I don't sleep too good. I just lost macho points, didn't I?
LISSA Hey, who wants macho? I like that you like hot cocoa. Redeye, please. Sounded good.
DAWN Nothing? No records or certificates? College transcripts?
AMANDA Looks like the only stuff in the system about Principal Robin Wood is super-recent. Like, since he moved to Sunnydale.
WILLOW I've Googled 'til I just can't Google no more. He's not in there.
KENNEDY Well, that's suspicious.
GILES Anya, calm down. They're educational
WILLOW What's this?
ANYA Giles made them for Chao-Ahn, and now she's locked herself in the bathroom. There's other girls upstairs, and they're starting to complain.
GILES Those are flashcards. I-I made them to facilitate her training. Chao-Ahn never had a watcher. The language problem
WILLOW You showed her these?
GILES I wanted her to understand the seriousness of her situation.
DAWN Holy crap!
GILES Perhaps I'll rethink the approach.
WILLOW In the meanwhile, wanna help us get researchy? We're trying to invade Buffy's date's privacy.
GILES Buffy has a date?
ANYA Yes... Didn't you hear? Everybody has a date. Buffy has a date. Willow's been completely making out with this girl
KENNEDY Hey!
ANYA Xander's out with some hardware-store-whore. It's Date Fest 2003.
WILLOW Actually, Buffy's investigating Principal Wood. It's not a date.
GILES Really.
WILLOW Might be a date.
GILES For God's sake! How can anyone think about their social life? We are about to fight the original primal evil. These girls are in mortal danger. Didn't you see the flashcards? This isn't right.
BUFFY This isn't right.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD I know it doesn't look promising, but I swear this place is great. It's the best kept secret in town. It's just right down this way.
BUFFY Well, it is one of the nicer dark alleys.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD I promise you, it's just a little bit further.
BUFFY OK...
BUFFY You set me up, you son of a
BUFFY What?
PRINCIPAL_WOOD I guess we should talk.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD The restaurant's right there.
LISSA And you still have to see her, like, everyday?
XANDER Yeah, but I guess that's good.
LISSA How is that a good thing? I mean, it seems like she never let you forget what happened.
XANDER Well, it's on her mind a lot right now because our anniversary's coming upI mean, it would have been our anniversary. And maybe I shouldn't be allowed to forget it. I didit was a bad thing, and it hurt her real bad.
LISSA And if you'd gone ahead and married her, even though you had doubts, that would've been better?
XANDER I guess not.
LISSA Sounds to me like, in the long run, you're both better off. I know it turned out good for me, and that's what really matters, right?
XANDER I should have taken you on a nicer date than this.
LISSA Well, I can think of something fun to do.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Thank you.
BUFFY This place is nice. How the hell did you do that?
PRINCIPAL_WOOD I've had a little practice. Never took on two at once before, but I have taken out a vamp here or there. And some demons.
BUFFY So, you're freelance?
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Hm... freelance I guess that's a good way to put it.
BUFFY And you know who I am?
PRINCIPAL_WOOD You're the slayer.
BUFFY Right. OK, um, so I'm guessing that you don't work in an office 15 feet above the hell mouth because you enjoy educational administration?
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Well, I actually do enjoy the work, but yeah. Yeah, you're right. I maneuvered myself into that school, that officejust like I maneuvered you there. The hell mouth draws the bad things in close, and now we're headed for something big, Buffy. Really big, and I need to be here when it happens. I want to help.
BUFFY So, y-you didn't hire me for my counseling skills?
PRINCIPAL_WOOD They're valuable too.
BUFFY Wh-why didn't you tell me about you?
PRINCIPAL_WOOD I wasn't sure about things yet.
BUFFY Y-you didn't think you could trust me?
PRINCIPAL_WOOD No, no. No, I wasn't sure I was ready yetready to jump into this fight.
BUFFY And now you are?
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Well, now the fight is startingor starting to startand I don't have time to worry anymore. I have to do something.
BUFFY So, you knew who I was before you even came here.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Yes.
BUFFY How? How do you know about slayers?
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Right. OK. See, when I was a little boy, my mother was one. The one, actuallythe slayer.
BUFFY Your mother Wow, I didn't know that any slayers had children.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Well, I don't know of any others. She was killed when I was four. I still remember her, but it's a little...fuzzy? You know?
BUFFY Um, something got her... a demon?
PRINCIPAL_WOOD A vampire. Oh, man, I went through this whole avenging son phase in my twenties, but I never found him. So, now I just dust as many of them as I can find. I figure, eventually I'll get him. That's probably why we got jumped outside. I'm not very popular with the bumpy-foreheaded crowd, and I bet you aren't either.
BUFFY No. Not most of them. Um, so, do you have any slayer powers? I'm sorry, II'm just so floored. I-I have no idea what to ask.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD No, I don't have powers. No super-strength or mythic responsibilities. I'm just a guy with a few skills 'cause her watcher took me in and raised me.
BUFFY So, you decided to tell me?
PRINCIPAL_WOOD That's right.
BUFFY In a darkened, little romantic French restaurant?
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Um, yeah...Yeah, I'm not really sure how that happened, but yeah.
JONATHAN/FIRST Did you find the gun?
ANDREW Yes, it was in Buffy's underwear drawer. She has nice things.
JONATHAN/FIRST Show me.
ANDREW Well, I didn't take 'em, but there were thongs and regular underpants
JONATHAN/FIRST Show me the gun.
ANDREW Oh. Here. Willow tried shooting Kennedy with that.
JONATHAN/FIRST Great. There's gonna be panic and fleeing when you start firing, so you're gonna have to get them trapped someplace like the basement.
ANDREW And we're killing them because...?
JONATHAN/FIRST Because they're the future of the slayer line. When they're gone, the line is gone.
ANDREW Uh-huh, uh-huh. Um, so why not have Spike do it? He's the one with the trigger.
JONATHAN/FIRST It's not time for him yet. You can wait for the next time they're training in the basement, but don't rely on a locked door to keep them in. You'll need more.
ANDREW OK. Say, um, do you have any weaknesses I should know about if I'm gonna work for you, like, uh, kryptonite or allergies?
JONATHAN/FIRST What are you asking?
ANDREW Oh, nothing, um... Are youare you made out of the evil impulses of humans, so if everyone was unconscious at the same time, you would fade away?
JONATHAN/FIRST You're asking a lot of questions.
ANDREW Yes, well, I, uh, because... 'cause I'm evil, and I want to do the best I can at that, so I want to... know stuff like whenwhen do we kill Buffy?
JONATHAN/FIRST Are you wearing a wire?
KENNEDY Whwhat's going on?
JONATHAN/FIRST You think you can trick the First? You think you could squirm free? I hold you, Andrew. I made you do this...
JONATHAN/FIRST Jonathan suffered. He was your friend, and he trusted you, and now he spends eternity in pain because of what you did.
ANDREW No. What's happening to you?
JONATHAN/FIRST This is what you did to him. Took away everything he was and left him like this. You started down a road with that action. You have to keep going.
ANDREW Stop looking like Jonathan. You're not him. You're the First, and you're trying to get me to shoot innocent girls, but I won't do it. I'm good now. When the fight is over, I'm gonna pay for killing Jonathan.
JONATHAN/FIRST You're gonna pay for more than that. Do you know why? Because the biggest, baddest First Evil in the world's angry with you.
JONATHAN/FIRST You think this was smart?
WILLOW Wait. I'm hearing something.
JONATHAN/FIRST You think you can trick me, women?
KENNEDY It's not in the headphones. It's out here.
JONATHAN/FIRST You only hear what I want you to hear. You only see what I want you to see.
JONATHAN/FIRST So many dead girls. There'll be so many.
XANDER I knew it.
XANDER See? I knew it.
LISSA Thanks for your help selecting the ropes. The one I picked wasn't strong enough.
XANDER Yeah, that would've been bad. Listen, is this because I'm friends with Buffy?
LISSA Who's Buffy?
XANDER The slayer.
LISSA You know the slayer?
XANDER This can't just happen. It can't just keep happening that demon women find me attractive. There's gotta be a reason.
LISSA You just seem like a nice guy, that's all. And I wanted to get to know you.
XANDER And kill me?
LISSA Sure. Do the ropes hurt?
XANDER Yes.
LISSA Good.
WILLOW So, we're thinking it didn't go too well.
DAWN You should've let me do this fast.
ANDREW No, no, no. I hate that. Ow.
SPIKE You tried to recall the ultimate evil? Why? In a complex effort to royally piss it off?
KENNEDY Guess we succeeded pretty good, huh?
ANDREW God, I never should have gone in wired. Redemption is hard.
GILES Getting back to Spike's question, why did you try to recall it?
ANDREW Ooh!
WILLOW To study it. To see if we could figure something out from what it was saying. Because, guys, we have to face it, we know nothing about the First.
ANDREW Owie! Ow ow!
ANYA Well, we know not to record it. That's something.
SPIKE Why did it appear to this one, then? I thought it was supposed to be pulling my strings.
ANDREW It said it wasn't time for you yet. Ow. I'm frightened. And my chest hurts where the tape was.
DAWN It's OK, Andrew. You did good. You stood up to it. That's really amazing.
ANDREW Thank you. You're a peach.
ANYA Yeah. What did it want you to do, anyway?
ANDREW Shoot all the girls.
DAWN Shoot girls?
ANDREW Not you, just the potentials.
DAWN Oh, well that's something, anyway. Something tragic.
GILES This proves my point. This time is crucial. We should be circling the wagons instead of doing things like going out on dates whenwhen gunplay is imminent. Willow, call Buffy. Get her back here. We need to dispose of the gun and-and figure out our next move.
SPIKE I'll go get her.
WILLOW I'll call.
AMANDA Bet that's her. Sometimes you're thinking about calling someone
WILLOW No, it's a text message. Oh, it's from Xander. It's one of our signals.
AMANDA Signals?
WILLOW Yeah, the system we set up a while back. Like codes. Uh, this one's either I just got lucky, don't call me for a while or my date's a demon who's trying to kill me.
KENNEDY You don't remember which?
WILLOW It was a long time ago.
DAWN Well, if we play the percentages...
GILES Something's eating Xander's head.
ANYA Say, that's gratifying.
ANDREW Buffy will know what to do.
SPIKE I'll go get her.
WILLOW That's ok. We don't even know where she went. That's not good.
SPIKE I'll go get Buffy. I can probably still track her scent. She'll be worried about the boy.
BUFFY Oh, my God! Mmm. Oh, my God. That might be the best thing I've ever had in my mouth.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Isn't it good? They soak the pears in brandy. Here, you need a bite with sauce.
BUFFY Mm. What are you doing here?
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Is there a problem?
SPIKE It's Xander.
XANDER Look, I know what happens if that seal down there gets all excited. I don't think you understand what you're getting yourself into.
LISSA The seal opens, and a vicious feral vampire creature comes out.
XANDER Well, then you do understand. But, uh, what makes you think that's, like, a good idea?
LISSA The end is coming. The final fight, and everyone is hearing the drumbeat. It's telling us to pick our partners, align ourselves with the good or the evil.
XANDER Aaah!
LISSA Couldn't have done it without you, Xander. Thanks for the great date.
BUFFY You sure he's in the high school?
SPIKE Willow did a locator spell. Usual stuff.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD I'm not surprised. That school's at the center of everything.
BUFFY How much longer 'til we get there?
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Ten minutes. So, how do you two know each other?
BUFFY He works with me. Uh, you know, in the struggle against evil.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Mm. Cool.
BUFFY Xander!
XANDER Buffy!
PRINCIPAL_WOOD He's a vampire.
XANDER Oh, God! Hurry!
BUFFY Hey.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD I think your friend's gonna be OK.
BUFFY Hey, Xand. I'm here.
XANDER So, how's your date going?
ANYA Where are they? It's after 2. I can't believe Buffy hasn't brought him home yet. His slut ate him up.
WILLOW His slut didn't eat him up. And besides, I thought you were all angry at him.
ANYA My feelings are changeable but intense.
ANDREW I understand your fear, Anya. I know fear myself 'cause, you know, I, um, I enraged that primal force.
GILES They're not back yet?
ANYA I'm worried. I-I think we should go find them. Xander could be injured or trapped or eaten up.
GILES It is late. Perhaps a little reconnaissance might be helpful.
CHAO-AHN SUBTITLE: Why is everyone up? Are the flashcard monsters attacking?
GILES She says she can't sleep. Um, I made myself some warm milk. You can have it.
CHAO-AHN SUBTITLE: You're trying to kill me!
GILES She's shy.
DAWN They're back! Oh, here they come.
ANYA Xander all right?
DAWN Looks OK.
ANYA Damn him!
WILLOW What happened?
XANDER What do you think happened? Another demon woman was attracted to me. I'm going gay. I've decided I'm turning gay. Willow, gay me up. Come on, let's gay.
WILLOW What?
XANDER You heard me. Just tell me what to do. I'm mentally undressing Scott Bakula right now. That's a start, isn't it?
ANDREW Captain Archer...
XANDER Come on, let's get this gay show on the gay road. Help me out here.
BUFFY What if you just start attracting male demons?
DAWN Clem always liked you.
ANYA It would serve you right.
GILES Children, enough.
XANDER I'd need some stylish new clothes.
GILES Enough! Have you learned nothing from tonight's assorted chaos? There isn't time for fun and games and quips about orientation. Thesethese aren't a joke. Thisthis happens. Girls are going to die. We may die. It's time to get serious.
SPIKE Did anybody tell you about what happened around here tonight?
BUFFY Willow did. The First is back in the mix.
SPIKE It, uh, it talked to the little boy. Said it wasn't time for me yet. I should move out. Leave town before it is time for me.
BUFFY No, you have to stay.
SPIKE You've got another demon fighter now.
BUFFY That's not why I need you here.
SPIKE Is that right? Why's that then?
BUFFY 'Cause I'm not ready for you to not be here.
SPIKE And the Principal? How's he fit in?
WOMAN You look good.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD You're not my mother.
NIKKI/FIRST I give you a compliment, and you don't say thank you? Did I raise you that way?
PRINCIPAL_WOOD You didn't raise me at all.
NIKKI/FIRST Well, I was dead.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD So, you're the First. Why are you here? Why now?
NIKKI/FIRST 'Cause you've been coming up in the worldtaking the demons out. It makes a mother proud.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Yeah? Well, think how pleased she'll be when I help take you out. Until it's time for that, I've got no use for you.
NIKKI/FIRST Would you like to know who killed me? I know you went looking for him.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD You don't know anything.
NIKKI/FIRST Is that right? Well, you can check it out after I tell you. Check the timing. Re-read what the witnesses said, and the people in the subway station
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Who is it?
NIKKI/FIRST You met him. You know him. You fought at his side.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Spike.
NIKKI/FIRST Now, what do you say?
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Thank you.
