GILES Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer:
BUFFY Evil. They want an apocalypse? Oh, we'll give 'em one. 'Cause we just became an army.
ANYA Look, I'm not saying it's a happy scenario, but we're dealing with a big bad that can be any dead person it wants.
ANDREW What do you want from me, Jonathan slash The First?
JONATHAN/FIRST I have an assignment for you.
ANDREW You want me to hurt the girls?
JONATHAN/FIRST The girls must die.
MOLLY Nice place. Bit of a mess.
DAWN They're all slayers?
GILES Potential slayers. Waiting for one to be called. There were many more like them all over the world, but, um, now there's just a handful, and they're all on their way to Sunnydale.
WILLOW Glad we talked.
KENNEDY In the spirit of air clearing...
WILLOW Yeah?
KENNEDY I feel like I need to be honest about something.
BUFFY Spike has a soul now. That's what's gonna stop him from hurting people.
GILES Buffy...
BUFFY He can be a good man, Giles. I feel it.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD I guess we should talk.
BUFFY How? How do you know about slayers?
PRINCIPAL_WOOD My mother was one. She was killed when I was four.
BUFFY Um, something got her... a demon?
PRINCIPAL_WOOD A vampire.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD So, how do you two know each other?
BUFFY He works with me. Uh, you know, in the struggle against evil.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD He's a vampire.
SPIKE I should move out.
BUFFY No, you have to stay.
SPIKE You've got another demon fighter now.
BUFFY That's not why I need you here.
SPIKE Why's that then?
BUFFY 'Cause I'm not ready for you to not be here.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD You're not my mother.
NIKKI/FIRST Would you like to know who killed me? You met him. You know him. You fought at his side.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Spike.
BUFFY Chloe? It is Chloe, right?
FIRST_SLAYER It's not enough.
ANYA I'm a bright girl, good education, quick on the uptake. So, tell me, why in the name of almighty Grothnar would I let myself become human again?
SPIKE You're really talking to the wrong fella.
ANYA I mean, sure, the vengeance demon gig has some downsides...
SPIKE All jobs do.
ANYA But being human? Ugh! You're always icky on the inside, disgusting on the outside.
SPIKE Your outside's not so bad.
ANYA You know, the only thing worse than being human is being trapped inside a house full of humans.
SPIKE Preaching to the choir, luv.
ANYA I mean, it's like we live in slayer central. I swear, if Buffy rooms or boards one more of the potential girls, I'm gonna call aI'm gonna call a health inspector.
SPIKE I like my plan better. Get up, get out, get drunk. Repeat as needed. It's just more elegant.
ANYA Thanks for having me along.
SPIKE Don't mention it.
ANYA At first, I thought... it's weird. Is Spike asking me out on a date? 'Cause that would just be...nuts.
SPIKE Right. I'm just out for the alcohol.
ANYA Right there with you, scooter. Tonight, I plan to drink you under the table.
SPIKE You're on, then.
ANYA Good. Of course, once you're down there, I could join you. Kidding. I like my sex on top of the table.
SPIKE Would you let it go? You're like a dog with a bone!
ANYA So what?
SPIKE It's my bone. Just drop it.
ANYA OK. OK. I wasn't proposing. Time goes by, girl gets hungry. You should know.
SPIKE Oh, thank God.
ANYA What?
SPIKE Demon.
ANYA Huh?
DEMON D'Hoffryn says you die.
SPIKE Of course he does.
ANYA Oh, hey!
BUFFY This may mean more than you think.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Is that so?
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Because I think what we have here is a couple of chuckle-heads who thought that a cafeteria fist fight would impress. I'm not impressed. Buffy, are you impressed? Still, I'm gonna cut you guys some slack this time. Third fight this week, and it's just getting worse. Plus, a rise in vandalism. Three students missing. Tell me something, Buffy, in your professional opinion it's started, hasn't it?
BUFFY The hellmouth has begun its semi-annual percolation. Usually, it blows around May.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Was it like this before? I mean, it just seems to me as if things are getting bad faster than we thought.
BUFFY We're a little ahead of schedule.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD I can't say I'm too surprised. I knew I signed on for something, but, Buffy, I'm just a guy. Granted, a cool and sexy vampire-fighting guy, but still.
BUFFY Don't forget snappy dresser.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Mm. Thank you. But this is gonna get bigger than me.
BUFFY Yeah, it is.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD That's why I've decided to give you this.
BUFFY What is it?
PRINCIPAL_WOOD An emergency kit. This bag belonged to my mother.
BUFFY A slayer keepsake. I-I couldn't.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Well, you have to. Technically, it should have been passed down directly to you through the years, but after my mother died... I guess I just couldn't part with it.
BUFFY Wow!
PRINCIPAL_WOOD I don't know what's inside, exactly, but I know it has something to do with her power. Well, your power now.
BUFFY I-I don't know what to say.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Try saying, Thank you, Principal Wood.
BUFFY Thank you, Principal Wood.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Ah, call me Robin. Now, I'd like to see where you work.
BUFFY Uh, here, actually. Uh, th-this is my desk, and, uh, these are my pencils...
PRINCIPAL_WOOD No, where you do your other work.
BUFFY So, all the potential slayerswho seem to keep popping up from, like, every corner of the earth were getting killed.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD By the First.
BUFFY Agents of. We thought the Council could protect them, but, unfortunately, no one was protecting the Council, and all their watchers were killed. Word got out, and they've all been coming here since.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Well, there's nothing like the end of the world to bring people together.
BUFFY It's heartwarming. Anyway, this is, uh, it. Command central.
ANDREW Where the hell have you been? This funnel cake is kicking my ass.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Yeah, I hear they're tricky.
BUFFY Robin Wood, this is...Andrew.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD It's a pleasure.
BUFFY Andrew is ouractually, he's our hostage.
ANDREW I like to think of myself more as a guestage.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD So, youyou hold him here against his will?
BUFFY Well, he was evil, and people got killed, and now he...bakes. It's a thing.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Oh.
ANDREW Could we try to just keep our secret headquarters a little bit secret? Keep bringing people in, they're gonna see everything. They'll see the big board.
BUFFY Andrew, we don't have a big board.
ANDREW I, uh, made it myself.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Oh, I wouldn't have guessed.
ANDREW Uh, this is us. And this represents the First in various incarnations. And, uh, there's no pattern to the naked eye yet, but the instant one emerges, yours truly is on it. Where do we put our receipts?
BUFFY You'll have to forgive Andrew. Or not. Your call. We do have a lot more working for us than just the, uh, big board.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD So, I see.
POTENTIALS Huh!
KENNEDY Punch block combo!
POTENTIALS Huh!
KENNEDY Cross block kick!
POTENTIALS Huh!
KENNEDY Chamber your energy. Punch block combo! Hold it! What the hell do you call that, potential? Try that in the field, you are dead. Drop, and give me 20.
CHLOE 20 what?
KENNEDY Push-ups, maggot! I love this job! Did you see that? I called that girl maggot. Hi. Who the hell are you?
BUFFY An ally.
KENNEDY So, what do you think? My girls ready to kick some ass, or what?
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Looking strong.
KENNEDY But...?
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Well, I'm just not sure the First has an ass that you can actually, you know, kick.
KENNEDY Guess we'll see.
AMANDA Principal Wood, hi! It's so weird seeing you outside of school.
KENNEDY What are you waving at, potential? Attention!
POTENTIALS Huh!
KENNEDY Rising sun. Begin.
BUFFY You're right, it's not enough.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD That's not what I said, Buffy. It's an impressive group of recruits.
BUFFY They're not recruits. Recruits are...recruited. These girls were chosen.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD You're doing the best you can with what you've got.
BUFFY They're not all gonna make it. Some will die, and nothing I can do will stop that.
WILLOW Oh, hi. Hey. Well, Buffy, II see that our preparation for the school-pep-dance-cheer-drill contest are coming along. Bring it on!
BUFFY It's OK, I filled him in on everything.
WILLOW Oh, thank God! If I had to explain all these weapons, I had nothing.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Buffy tells me you have been, umoh, how shall I put itexperimenting. With the magicks.
WILLOW Oh! Yeah. Oh, nothing too heavy, though. Just the lighter, safer stuff. Uh, if Kennedy asks, her pointy stuff's right there. See you inside. So much cooler than Snyder.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD She really almost destroyed the world?
BUFFY Yep.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Remind me not to make her crabby.
BUFFY It might be better if you did.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD How's that work?
BUFFY Oh, I don't know. It's justthe First is coming, and then look at us: the army. We've got a bunch of fighters with nothing to hit, a Wicca who won't-a, and the brains of our operation wears oven mitts.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Hm. Well, you're redefining the job, Buffy, and that takes guts. This isn't your full arsenal anyway. Show me the vampire.
ANYA But you just let him go.
SPIKE After saving your life.
ANYA For now. That was one of D'Hoffryn's killers, Spike. He won't stop coming 'til he kills me.
SPIKE Yet here you are, walking, talking, annoying.
ANYA But you fought like such a wimpire, what with the lifting and the running. Why not just kill him?
SPIKE Anya, think. I fight, demon boy gets lucky, I get knocked out, you get killed. True? We both know the safest and sanest way of saving your life was to keep you with me, away from danger. No need to thank me. I'm just the one who beat him off. Repelled him would perhaps be the better phrase. Demon.
BUFFY Figured.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD I hope we're not intruding.
SPIKE Not a bit. And just what brings our good principal to this neck of the gloom?
BUFFY I'm showing him our operation. Us.
SPIKE Fine by me. Big fight against evil coming up. The more good guys we've got, the longer we'll all live.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Is that what you are? A good guy?
SPIKE I haven't heard any complaints. Well, I have heard a few complaints over the years, but then I just killed whoever spoke up, and that was pretty much that.
BUFFY He's joking.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD No, he's not.
SPIKE No, I'm not. But...that's the old me I'm talking about.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Why don't you tell me about that?
SPIKE Not much to tell. I've changed.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Oh, now that you have a soul.
SPIKE Yeah. That was a big deal. Very... private. What, are you just telling everyone now?
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Oh, come on, Spike. Don't blame Buffy. I asked.
SPIKE Right, the educator. Yeah, I went to great lengths. Lots of trouble, and now I'm unique. Well, more or less. Got myself a soul, whatever that means.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD And how's that working out for you?
SPIKE In progress.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Well, you've had some time. You've been in Sunnydale, what...?
SPIKE Years.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD How many?
SPIKE A few.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Before that?
SPIKE Around.
BUFFY I think we'd better get back upstairs.
SPIKE Right. Give him the full tour. You don't want to miss a look at her weapons' chest.
DAWN So, I took a look inside that emergency bag of Principal Wood's.
BUFFY And?
DAWN Smelled weird. Kinda like Grandma's closet, but worse.
BUFFY I didn't know what was possible. Anything we could use?
DAWN Trinkets, weapons, one very large textbook. Translation's gonna be a bitch, but... Do you know that ancient Sumerians do not speak English?
BUFFY They're worse than the French. Anything else?
DAWN Uh, yeah. A box. A big, fat, unopenable box. I'm betting whatever the big deal about this emergency bag is, you'll find it in the box.
BUFFY Good. Keep on it. Don't you have any real homework?
DAWN Oh, you mean, like, schoolwork?
BUFFY Yes.
DAWN Well, I've got a system. It's called flunking out. No, just kidding. I'm paying someone to do my work. I'm kidding. I love to see your eyeballs change color when you think I'm gonna flunk out of
KENNEDY What happened? We heard
BUFFY Dawn, get a knife. We're cutting her down.
CHLOE/FIRST Good thinking. But, on the other hand, why rush? Up or down, I'll still be dead.
BUFFY You're not Chloe.
CHLOE/FIRST Yeah, well, neither is she, anymore. Now, she's just Chloe's body.
KENNEDY What did you do to her?
CHLOE/FIRST Nothing! We just talked all night. Well, I did most of the talking, but Chloe is...I'm sorry, was a good listener. 'Til she hanged herself. Like when you called her maggotshe really heard that.
BUFFY Don't listen to it, any of you. It's the First.
CHLOE/FIRST Oh, let 'em. The only reason why Chloe offed herself is 'cause she knew what you're not getting. I'm coming, you're going. All thisit's almost over.
BUFFY We'll be here.
CHLOE/FIRST All of you? But wait. I thought They're not all gonna make it. Some will die, and there's nothing I can do that will stop it. Hey, I didn't say it. But I'll be seeing all of you. One by one. TTFN.
BUFFY What's TTFN?
RONA It's ta ta for now. It's what Tigger says when he leaves.
AMANDA Chloe loved Winnie the Pooh.
BUFFY Dawn, where's that knife?
BUFFY Is everyone here?
KENNEDY All accounted for.
BUFFY Anyone want to say a few words about Chloe? Let me. Chloe was an idiot. Chloe was stupid. She was weak. And anyone in a rush to be the next dead body I bury, it's easy. Just...think of Chloe, and do what she did. And I'll find room for you next to her and Annabelle. I'm the slayer. The one with the power. And the First has me using that power to dig our graves. I've been carrying youall of youtoo far, too long. Ride's over.
KENNEDY You're out of line!
WILLOW No, she's not.
KENNEDY You're gonna let her talk to you like that? Willow, she's not even the most powerful one in this room. With you here, she's not close.
BUFFY You're new here, and you're wrong. Because I use the power that I have. The rest of you are just waiting for me.
XANDER Well, yeah, but only because you kinda told us to. You're our leader, Buffy, as in follow the.
BUFFY Well, from now on, I'm your leader as in do what I say.
XANDER Ja wohl! But let's not try to forget, we're also your friends.
ANYA I'm not.
BUFFY Then why are you here? Aside from getting rescued, what is it that you do?
ANYA I provide much-needed... sarcasm.
XANDER Um, that would kinda be my job, actually.
BUFFY You're here because you're scared.
XANDER Same goes for everyone in this room.
BUFFY Fine. Anya, all of you, be as scared as you'd like, just be useful while you're at it.
WILLOW Come on, Buffy. You know everyone here's doing everything they can.
BUFFY The First isn't impressed. It already knows us. It knows what we can do, and it's laughing. You want to surprise the enemy? Surprise yourselves. Force yourself to do what can't be done, or else we are not an armywe're just a bunch of girls waiting to be picked off and buried. Where are you going?
SPIKE Out. Since I'm neither a girl, nor waiting. All this speechifying doesn't really apply to me, does it?
BUFFY Fine. Take a cell phone. That way, if I need someone to get weepy or whaled on, I can call you.
SPIKE If you've got something to say
BUFFY Just said it. You keep holding back, you might as well walk out that door.
SPIKE Holding back? You're blind. I've been here, right in itfighting, scrapping...
BUFFY Since you got your soul back?
SPIKE Well, as a matter of fact, I haven't quite been relishing the kill the way I used to.
BUFFY You were a better fighter then.
SPIKE I did this for you. The soul, the changesit's what you wanted.
BUFFY What I want is the Spike that's dangerous. The Spike that tried to kill me when we met.
SPIKE Oh, you don't know how close you are to bringing him out.
BUFFY I'm nowhere near him. Dawn, get the potentials upstairs, and break out that emergency kit.
DAWN What are you gonna do?
BUFFY I'm declaring an emergency.
BUFFY We thought you'd want to be here.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Yeah, you thought right.
DAWN That emergency bag's got some neat stuff in it. Weapons, charms, advanced reading assignments.
XANDER Yeah, cool stuff, but we've seen it all before.
ANYA Well, not this, we haven't. What's inside it?
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Mm, I don't know. It hasn't been opened since Well, since now.
XANDER Puppets. That's it! The First hates puppets! Now if we can just airlift Kermit, Fozzie the Bear, and Miss Piggy into town, the First'll be a-running.
WILLOW Those are Muppets.
DAWN And these things are shadow-casters. You put them in motion, and they tell you a story. It says you can't just watch, you have to see.
ANYA What the hell does that mean?
XANDER It's cryptic. I don't like it. Every time instructions get cryptic, someone gets hurtusually me.
BUFFY You can't just watch, you have to see? See what?
DAWN That's where all my fancy translating skills break down, but I think it's an origin myth. The story of the very first slayer.
BUFFY I-I saw her.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD You saw the First Slayer?
BUFFY The other nightin my dream. It's gotta mean something, right?
DAWN OK. According to this, I thinkyou put on those puppet guys one by one. They cast shadows and the shadows tell the story. First, there is the Earth.
KENNEDY What's that sound?
XANDER OK, so far, so creepy.
BUFFY What about darkness?
DAWN It says you cannot be shown. You cannot just watch, but you must see. See for yourself, but only if you're willing to make the exchange.
XANDER When did you get so good at Sumerian?
DAWN It's not in Sumerian anymore.
XANDER But what does it mean?
BUFFY It means I have to go in there.
WILLOW No, it doesn't! Where does it say that? It doesn't say that!
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Buffy, you don't even know what you're exchanging. You don't know if you're ready yet.
BUFFY That's the point.
WILLOW No. Buffy, we don't know where you're going or how we'll get you back.
XANDER Buffy, you can't.
WILLOW How will we get you back?
BUFFY Find a way.
WILLOW She's gone.
XANDER Huh.
ANYA What was that about an exchange?
XANDER Ah, this must be the exchange student.
KENNEDY Willow! Use your magic. Send him back!
WILLOW Um, trying.
KENNEDY Weapons.
SPIKE Get out of hereall of you. Unless you want to end up all dead and useless.
KENNEDY What are you gonna do?
SPIKE What I do best.
DAWN Are you injured?
KENNEDY Just hurt. Don't make a case out of it. How 'bout you?
XANDER I think we'll live.
ANYA Except maybe Spike.
KENNEDY Is getting thrown through the ceiling what he does best?
DAWN I'll go check on him.
ANYA We've got bigger problems than that.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Yeah, demon loose; no slayer.
WILLOW We need Buffy.
XANDER You gotta get her back. Looks like it's spell'o'clock.
ANYA Which spell? I mean, didn't you see that thing? And you expect to reopen the portal without sending Willow off the deep end?
WILLOW Thanks for your support.
ANYA Well, it's true. We're going to have to find another way.
WILLOW There isn't, and Buffy knew it. I've got to get her back.
KENNEDY We don't even know where she went.
BUFFY Well, guess that worked.
XANDER Dawnie, what's the book say?
DAWN Not much. Once Buffy left, it got a little tougher to read.
WILLOW Oh.
KENNEDY It's OK. We'll just start with what we know, and take it from there.
XANDER Great, so far we know Jack about squat. Let's go from there.
KENNEDY You've got the magic, use it.
WILLOW I-I-I don't even know what magic to use.
KENNEDY Why not just try all 32 flavors. Worst thing that happens is you go brunette.
WILLOW That's not the worst thing that can happen.
ANYA She's right. And you know we have a choice. We can risk Willow's life and the rest of our lives to get Buffy back, or we leave her out there.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD If we play it safe back here, Buffy could stay lost.
ANYA You missed her everyone sucks but me speech. If she's so superior, let her find her own way back.
XANDER Anya, the First is already up and running. Every second that Buffy's not here, is an opportunity for it to show up and rip us to pieces.
DAWN Willow, how would you get Buffy back?
WILLOW That's what I'm sayingI don't even know.
DAWN OK, but if another witch was to do it, where would she start?
WILLOW Uh, physics, principles, basic laws...
DAWN Such as?
WILLOW Uh, conservation of energies. You can't really create or destroy anything, only transfer.
DAWN I'm sorry, are you helping?
ANYA No, but at least I'm not galloping off in the wrong direction.
WILLOW Magic works off physics.
ANYA Not without a catalyst. If you're talking about transferring energies, you need some kind of conduit.
WILLOW Like a-a Kraken's tooth.
ANYA Yeah, skin of Draconis, um, ground up Baltic stones, something...
DAWN OK. Good.
KENNEDY Plus, we need an exchange, like you said. I'm thinking a slayer for a demon.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Right. If we want Buffy back, then we have to find that demon and send it through.
KENNEDY It matter if it's dead or alive?
SPIKE I vote dead. The slayer's counting on you, Willow. Get cracking on that portal, and don't be stingy with the mojo. The demon's mine.
KENNEDY Hate to say it, Big Bad, but you look like you can barely stand. We're trained. And the only thing we know for sure about this demon is it kicked your ass.
SPIKE It did, at that.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Where are you going?
SPIKE Something I need.
BUFFY Hello? I'm Buffy. I'm the slayer.
RED_HAT_SHADOW_MAN SUBTITLE: We know who you are.
BLACK_HAT_SHADOW_MAN SUBTITLE: And we know why you're here.
BROWN_HAT_SHADOW_MAN SUBTITLE: We've been waiting.
BUFFY Good. That's good then. Um, you know, I know we have bigger issues to deal with, but how'd I understand anything you guys just said? Oh, I know, ancient magicks. I just thought it was neat.
RED_HAT_SHADOW_MAN SUBTITLE: We have been here since the beginning.
BLACK_HAT_SHADOW_MAN SUBTITLE: Now, we are almost at the end.
BUFFY The neat of it just left. End of what?
BROWN_HAT_SHADOW_MAN SUBTITLE: You are the hellmouth's last guardian.
BUFFY Latest. You mean latest guardian.
RED_HAT_SHADOW_MAN SUBTITLE: No.
BUFFY OK, um, I have a First to fight, OK. So just tell me what I need to know. I came to learn.
RED_HAT_SHADOW_MAN SUBTITLE: We cannot give you knowledge. Only power.
BUFFY You know what I think? I'm not really here at all. None of this is actually happening. This is like a play. Like some shadow-play. Some non-reality re-enactment hologramy
KENNEDY And this is gonna help us how?
DAWN The sand forms a circle. The circle acts as a barrier. And the barrier contains the portal.
KENNEDY Now what? We hold hands and chant kumbaya or something?
WILLOW Maybe. 'Til we get the magicks up and running, I'm kinda working on my best guess here.
XANDER Will, maybe we should wait.
KENNEDY For what?
XANDER Spiketo see if he can bring back that demon.
WILLOW No, I don't think we should wait right now. Opening a portal this size could take days.
KENNEDY Better get started.
WILLOW I think I might pee my pants.
KENNEDY You can do itthe magicks, not the pants thing.
WILLOW OK.
WILLOW Dawnie, you'd better put on some coffee. This could take awhile
BUFFY What is this?
BROWN_HAT_SHADOW_MAN SUBTITLE: We are at the beginning. The source of your strength. The well of the slayer's power.
RED_HAT_SHADOW_MAN SUBTITLE: This is why we have brought you here.
BUFFY I thought I brought me here. Listen, you guys. I'm already the slayer, bursting with power. Really don't need any more.
RED_HAT_SHADOW_MAN SUBTITLE: The First Slayer did not talk so much.
RED_HAT_SHADOW_MAN SUBTITLE: Herein lies your truest strength.
BLACK_HAT_SHADOW_MAN SUBTITLE: The energy of the demon. Its spirit.
BROWN_HAT_SHADOW_MAN SUBTITLE: Its heart.
BUFFY This is how you
RED_HAT_SHADOW_MAN SUBTITLE: Created the slayer? Yes.
BROWN_HAT_SHADOW_MAN SUBTITLE: It must become one with you.
BUFFY No!
RED_HAT_SHADOW_MAN SUBTITLE: This will make you ready for the fight.
BUFFY By making me less human?
RED_HAT_SHADOW_MAN SUBTITLE: This is how it was then. How it must be now.
BLACK_HAT_SHADOW_MAN SUBTITLE: This is all there is.
BUFFY Make this stop!
RED_HAT_SHADOW_MAN SUBTITLE: This is what you came for.
BUFFY No, this isn't the way.
RED_HAT_SHADOW_MAN SUBTITLE: Do not fight this.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Where you going?
SPIKE Got a job.
PRINCIPAL_WOOD Nice coat. Where'd you get it?
SPIKE New York.
WILLOW Screw it! Mighty forces, I suck at Latin, OK? But that's not the issue. I'm the one in charge, and I'm telling you open up, portal, now!
XANDER It's not happening, Will.
KENNEDY Give her time. She's getting it.
XANDER Or something's getting her. Will, think you better back up a little.
WILLOW No!
SPIKE Oh, come on now, Nancy. Call yourself a demon? I thought you were up for a proper fight. Now we're talking.
SPIKE Yeah!
BUFFY You think I came all this way to get knocked up by some demon dust? I can't fight this. I know that now. But you guys? You're just men. Just the men who did this...to her. Whoever that girl was before she was the First Slayer.
RED_HAT_SHADOW_MAN SUBTITLE: You don't understand.
BUFFY No, you don't understand! You violated that girl, made her kill for you because you're weak, you're pathetic, and you obviously have nothing to show me.
SPIKE I don't know your feelings, big guy, but to me, a tussle like that... is good for the soul.
BUFFY I knew it. It's always the staff.
RED_HAT_SHADOW_MAN SUBTITLE: We offered you power.
BUFFY Tell me something I don't know.
RED_HAT_SHADOW_MAN SUBTITLE: As you wish.
WILLOW Hey. You OK? You've been kinda quiet since...
KENNEDY You sucked the life out of me?
WILLOW Yeah, since then. Look, it's important that you know what I am, what I'm like when I'm like that.
KENNEDY I thought it would be... I don't knowcool somehow. It just hurt.
WILLOW I'm really sorry. It's just, you were the most powerful person nearby, andwell, that'sthat's how it works. That's how I work.
KENNEDY I got that. You told me. I'll see you in the morning.
WILLOW How you doing?
BUFFY Thanks for bringing me back. Again.
WILLOW Well, that's what I do.
BUFFY I was hard on you guys today.
WILLOW Aw, it's all right. You needed to be. Although, Twinkies and kissesalso peachy motivational tools. You OK?
BUFFY I think I made a mistake.
WILLOW What?
BUFFY Those men that I metyou know, the shadow men? They offered me more power, but I didn't like the loophole.
WILLOW So, you turned it down? It's OK, Buffy. We'll get by. We always do.
BUFFY I don't know. They showed me...
WILLOW Showed you what?
BUFFY That the First Slayer was rightit isn't enough.
WILLOW Why, Buffy? What did you see? What did they show you?
