GILES Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer:
WARREN We're your arch nemesises.
WARREN Somebody! Help!
ANDREW We've got to get out of this town. Mexico.
ANYA Look, I'm not saying it's a happy scenario, but we're dealing with a big bad that can be any dead person it wants.
WARREN You know the rules. I can't take corporeal form.
ANDREW I just don't think I can kill anybody else.
WILLOW Look who I found. Guess who was buying mass amounts of blood at the butcher's shop.
BUFFY Andrew is ouractually, he's our hostage.
ANDREW I like to think of myself more as a guestage.
DAWN They're all slayers?
GILES Potential slayers. There were many more like them all over the world, but, um, now there's just a handful.
ROBIN_WOOD Uh, Buffy?
BUFFY Principal Wood.
ROBIN_WOOD I'd like to take you out to dinner, if that's all right with you.
BUFFY I'd be happy to have dinner with you.
ROBIN_WOOD Great.
BUFFY How do you know about slayers?
ROBIN_WOOD My mother was one. She was killed when I was four.
BUFFY A demon?
ROBIN_WOOD A vampire.
ANDREW Oh, hello, there, gentle viewers. You caught me catching up on an old favorite. It's wonderful to get lost in a story, isn't it? Adventure and heroics and discoverydon't they just take you away? Come with me now, if you will, gentle viewers. Join me on a new voyage of the mind. A little tale I like to call: Buffy, Slayer of the Vampyrs.
ANDREW Ouch! My goodness! Things look bad for the Slayer, don't they? She didn't see that second vampire, concealed by cover of darkness, ready ready to attack and make her his own vampirical spawn.
ANDREW Let's rejoin them now to see
ANYA For God's sakes, Andrew. You've been in here for 30 minutes. What are you doing?
ANDREW Entertaining and educating.
ANYA Why can't you just masturbate like the rest of us?
ANDREW That was great. I completely got you dusting that guy on film. Hey, why do vampires show up on video?
BUFFY I told you I didn't want you doing that. It's distracting.
ANDREW OK, I'll cut the footage together and do the intro tomorrow. She was a woman in danger, or was she?
BUFFY Are you still filming me? Stop!
ANDREW But it's a valuable record. An important document for the ages. A Slayer in action.
BUFFY A nerd in pain. Would they like that? 'Cause we could do that.
ANDREW But the story needs to be told.
ANYA Birds need to fly, and girls need to use the toilet, and why were you video taping yourself, anyway? Sounds like kinky business to me.
ANDREW The world's gonna want to know about Buffy. It's a story of ultimate triumph tainted with the bitterness for what's been lost in the struggle. It's a legacy for future generations.
ANYA If there are any. Buffy seems to think that this apocalypse is going to actually be, you know, apocalyptic. I think youryour story seems pretty pointless.
ANDREW Oh, I was gonna interview you later today, 'cause, you know, your whole perspective on the whole thing. Give it editorial balance and, uh, glamour...
ANYA Oh, well balance is important. People don't always take that into account. I could bring that to you. Absolutely.
ANDREW Let's explore the world of our story, shall we? Thisuh, Buffy lives in Sunnydale, California. Um, this is the local high school.
ANDREW There's a hellmouthhellmouthunderneath the high school. See, weird things happen on the hellmouth that attracts all sorts of, uh, bad people and demons and vampires. And now there's this thing in the basement of the high school called the-the seal of DanzalDanzalthar, and it's sort of a door to the hellmouth. Uh, due to some circumstances it got opened up... a little bit... recently...uh, and this, uh, nasty, nasty vampire thing came out of it. It was, uh, it was just awful, awful. This whole thing whole thingis being orchestrated by something called The First. It's made up of all the evil in the whole world. Oh, there's also these guys. They work for the First. We don't know much about them except that they're very ugly and they're very mobile for blind people. Is that all clear?
ANDREW It's morning in Sunnydale
RONA Who the hell's got the low-fat milk?
ANDREW It's morning in Sunnydale, and the women of command central take the time to fortify themselves for the day ahead.
XANDER Hey!
ANDREW Women and Xander. Hey, I'm gonna do your special intro later. The man who is the heart of the slayer machine.
XANDER Yeah? The heart?
ANDREW Things are tense in command central this morning. Buffy is clearly concerned with some unknown danger, and the air is filled with foreboding.
DAWN Oh, um, we're out of Raisin Bran.
ANYA I'll put it on the list.
ANDREW That's probably not the unknown danger.
SPIKE Look at this place. Damn girls' dorm is what it is.
DAWN That's nice. Second-hand stinkiness.
ANDREW Full house. I think it's a good time to do some introductions, don't you, gentle viewers?
AMANDA I'm Amanda, and I grew up right here
ANDREW Not you, sweetheart. Let's start from the top.
ANDREW You've already met Buffy. She's beautiful, with a lion's heart and and the face of an Angel. She's never afraid 'cause she knows her side will always win. Buffy and Spike have some kind of historyyou can feel the heat between them. Although, technically, as a vampire, he's room temperature. Anya, a feisty waif with a firey temper and a vulnerable heart that she hides, even from herself. This lovely girlI don't remember her name
BUFFY Oh, for God's sake. Is he doing that again? Can't we make him stop?
RONA I don't know, if we save the world, it will be kind of nice to have a record of it.
AMANDA If we don't save the world, then... nothing matters.
KENNEDY That's catchy, Amanda. Let's make that our slogan.
XANDER Yeah, it is kinda strange, how you keep saving the world, and there's not any proof.
ANYA Yeah, you know, for future generations.
WILLOW And it does help the girls with trainingyou know, viewing the tapes.
BUFFY Come on. No one else thinks this is idiotic?
XANDER Or is it important? I mean, Buff, I don't get why this is bothering you so much.
BUFFY Because it's a waste of time. Come on, someone has to agree with me. Spike?
SPIKE Long as you're not pointing that thing at me, seems like a fine way to keep the boy busy.
BUFFY This isn't about keeping busy. This is about war. I'm sorry to jump all over you guys, but... I have to tell you what's really going on. There's something new. Amanda, Dawnyou're gonna stay home from school today. We can survive what's coming, but not like this. I had a vision of what's to comea horrible vision. Hundreds upon hundreds of....
ANDREW Honestly, gentle viewers, these motivating speeches of hers tend to get a little long. I'll take you back in there inin a little while, but in the in-between time, I thought you might want to know a little about me, your humble host. You see, I am a man with a burden. A man with a dark past. You see, I was once a super villain.
ANDREW Warren was cool. And wasn't Jonathan just the cutest thing? Well, shall we see if Buffy's still talking?
BUFFY I mean mentally. And from what I've seen so far, there's is no way your girls are ready. You have to...
ANDREW She's not done. Even Willow looks bored, and she usually can take a lot of that stuff. Look at her. Ooh, ooh, do you see that? That-that's important. Willow and Kennedy have been in kind of a bad place lately, but things are looking up. You see, Kennedy pursued the reluctant Willow and won her heart, only to find herself frightened when she glimpsed the darkness that still lies within the witch's mind. Side noteI once had my own personal encounter with Dark Willow.
ANDREW She was something. Indeed she was. Hey, I think Buffy stopped talking. That usually means she had to go to work. Let's see what the little locusts left for breakfast, shall we?
BUFFY Not late. Not late 'til the bell rings. Hey! Hey! Break it up! Get to class. Uh-oh. Hey, shy girl, don't do this. Oh...
SHY_GIRL You knew I was there.
BUFFY Yeah.
SHY_GIRL You noticed me.
BUFFY It's OK, I promise. It may seem ba Wh-wh-what's wrong?
CRYING_GIRL The mirror said I was fat. It said it.
STRESSED_OUT_BOY I'm soI can't take this semester anymore. It's just so much for me to handle. So, not only does Mr. Hildebrand move up the trig exam to today, but he also makes it cover three more chapters. And I've got an English paper due tomorrow. I feel like I'm gonna explode.
BUFFY Hey, uh, I can help. You just need to relax, you know? You know, um, maybe one of you guys could give him a foot rub?
STRESSED_OUT_BOY What?
BUFFY Something bad is going on.
ROBIN_WOOD Oh, is that right?
BUFFY Ooh, you're hurt. What happened?
ROBIN_WOOD Someone threw a rock at me as I got out of my car. I didn't really get a good chance to see who.
BUFFY Yeah, well, it could have been any of them. Students, teacherssomething is going on today.
ROBIN_WOOD Yes, well, um, that occurred to me as I ducked the other two rocks. Buffy, what the hell is this?
BUFFY Everything.
ROBIN_WOOD Slowly, I may be concussed here.
BUFFY There this thing that happens here, in this school, over the hell mouth. Where the way a thing feelsit kind of starts being that way...for real. I've seen all these things before...just not all at once.
ROBIN_WOOD So, what, it's like hell's a bustin' out all over?
BUFFY Exactly.
ROBIN_WOOD So, what's the worst that can happen?
BUFFY War, pretty much.
ROBIN_WOOD Oh, I see you're being amusing now with comical exaggeration.
BUFFY Being in high school can feel like being at war. Now it's true. The students feel like the teachers are out to get them. The Chess Club resents the French Club for taking the activities room, and, well, everybody hates the cheerleaders. If we don't do something about this, we're gonna have a riot on our hands. And a lot of other nasty stuff too.
ROBIN_WOOD Like what?
BUFFY Really should have had that foot rub.
ANDREW Dawn is a typical American teenager. Bubbly and sweet with a hunger for fun and a smile that lights up the room.
DAWN Hello.
ANDREW Dawn used to be a key. I don't really know what that means.
ANDREW Hey, here's something I think you're going to be interested in, gentle viewers. Look at the fine work Xander did on that replacing that window sash. You can't even tell it's new, it blends in so well. He's extraordinary.
ROBIN_WOOD You've dealt with this before? I mean, you've seen stuff like this in a high school?
BUFFY Sure, you know, swim team monsters or killer prom dogs. Again, not all at once.
ROBIN_WOOD So, what makes now so special?
BUFFY My guessit's that seal thing in the basement. It's like all the hellmouth's energy is trying to escape in that one little spot, and it's getting all
ROBIN_WOOD Focusy.
BUFFY Careful. You're starting to speak like me now.
ANDREW This is Xander and Anya Interview Number 1 for Buffy, a Slayer of the Vampyrs.
ANYA That's what you're calling it?
ANDREW Either that or Buffy, the Slayer Who Knew No Fear.
XANDER I like that one.
ANDREW Thank you, Xander. That's sweet of you. I understand that exactly one year ago today you left Anya at the altar. Any comment on that?
XANDER Whoa. What the hell?
ANDREW I just think people will be interested.
ANYA I know I am. What do you have to say for yourself one year later?
XANDER I've apologized enough, that's what I have to say.
ANDREW But you think it was something that called for an apology?
XANDER Well, yes.
ANDREW So you don't think it was the right thing to do.
ANYA Of course he doesn't think it was the right thing to do.
XANDER It was the right thing to do.
ANYA What?
ANDREW Interesting. I think we're getting something here.
XANDER Look, Anya, if I had married you, it would have been against everything I thought was best. It wouldn't have worked.
ANYA But wewe still spark. I mean, I get jealous of you. You get jealous of me. You still love me.
ANDREW Is that true, Xander? Do you still love her?
BUFFY I swear we just covered this thing up.
ROBIN_WOOD It doesn't want to stay hidden anymore. It wants to turn these kids into monsters and victims and who knows what.
BUFFY It's more than that. Look, Robin, I, um, I had a vision the other day.
ROBIN_WOOD You have visions?
BUFFY Sometimes.
ROBIN_WOOD Oh. Well, how do you know that they're not just dreams?
BUFFY You're running to catch the bus naked? That's a dream. Army of vicious vampire creatures? That's a vision. Also, I was awake.
ROBIN_WOOD A bus to where? I mean, an army of how many?
BUFFY Hundreds. Maybe hundreds of hundreds. All I know is the last UberVamp I faced crawled out of that very hole. It makes me awfully nervous. What are you doing?
ROBIN_WOOD Now, have you ever really studied it? You know, gotten close?
BUFFY Well, I know it's a goat with its tongue out. Uh, Willow did a search on the symbolic database, but it turns out everybody loves a good goat's tongue. Rock groups, covens and greek cookbooks. She said she couldn't narrow it down.
ROBIN_WOOD And you trust her?
BUFFY Yes, why wouldn't I trust her?
ROBIN_WOOD I don't know why any of you should trust each other. You've all been evil at some point, right?
BUFFY No, that's not true. Yeah, Willow had a bad patch, but I've never been.
ROBIN_WOOD Evil is what evil does, and I know what you're doing. You're with that vampire, screwing that vampire. You filthy whore!
BUFFY Robin, are you OK?
ROBIN_WOOD Whoa. What happened?
BUFFY II think it was controlling you.
ROBIN_WOOD Buffy, we've got to get rid of this seal. We've got to shut it down before it starts affecting everyone.
BUFFY I think I have a pretty good idea who we should talk to.
ROBIN_WOOD Yeah, who's that?
BUFFY The guy that fed it it's first drop of blood.
ROBIN_WOOD God, I hope that's not a student.
SPIKE I thought I told you to piss off with this bloody camera, yet here you are again with that thing in my face. Would you sod off before I rip your throat out and eat
ANDREW OK, Spike. The light was kind of behind you.
SPIKE Oh, right. Uh, what? Is this better then? ( I thought I told you to piss off with this bloody camera, yet here you are again with that thing in my face. Would you sod off?
ANYA You keep dodging the question.
XANDER I don't mean to. It's justyou know how I feel, right? And you were the one who didn't want to keep seeing each other.
ANYA And here's where we hop on the merry-go-round of rotating knives. I blame you, and you blame me, and we both end up all cut to shreds. Please just tell Do you still love me?
XANDER Yes. I still love you. I always will. I just don't know if that means anything for us anymore.
ANYA Well, I love you too. I don't know if that means anything either.
XANDER Well, it's nice to hear. I'm not gonna find anyone out there like you, am I?
ANYA Doesn't seem likely.
XANDER I guess I'm more replaceable, obviously.
ANYA No. There's no one like you, Xander. You were willing to stand up to danger, even when your hands had no weapons. You were ready to protect me with your life.
XANDER Yeah, I guess we fit together pretty good.
ANYA We fit together great.
XANDER You know, sometimes, I want to be back in your life.
ANYA I hope you know you never left my heart.
XANDER I'm not gonna find anyone out there like you, am I?
ANYA Doesn't seem likely.
BUFFY Heads up, Andrew. We've got to talk.
ROBIN_WOOD We just spent the day keeping a lid on a war.
ANDREW Ooh, that would be very exciting on tape.
BUFFY The school is out of control with energy from the hellmouth. It's time for you to help, Andrew.
ANDREW Well, right now, I'm really more about the recording of the
BUFFY No! No more watching. The seal thing is your baby, and you gotta get in there before it tears everything apart.
JONATHAN Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
ANDREW Jesus.
JONATHAN Did you have it again? I had it again. That voice...
ANDREW Desme abdo tay deborah. What does it mean? What does it mean?
JONATHAN Let's try looking it up again in the morning in the dictionario. Holy cats, that was terrifying.
ANDREW We're fugitives, haunted by our past, tormented by a message we don't understand.
JONATHAN We're hunted men, driven mad by forces beyond our understanding.
ANDREW We're men of hidden power, tortured from within by-by a voice from out of nowhere.
JONATHAN I don't deserve this. I wasn't even that evil.
ANDREW I thought you were evil.
JONATHAN Yeah?
ANDREW Sure. I respected your ideas for evil projects, and I thought you had good follow-through.
JONATHAN Oh, well, thanks. It's nice that you noticed.
WILLOW OK, I think we're getting a little off track here.
ANDREW I don't want to do this anymore. Everyone's staring at me.
WILLOW Just focus on the charm. You have to focus on the charm to pull the memories out.
ROBIN_WOOD Tell us about the seal.
ANDREW But it tickles, and I'm all tense. Can't I have a cool, refreshing Zima?
BUFFY No Zima.
SPIKE Shut your face about the Zima. Just talk.
BUFFY You were the first one to uncover the seal and feed it blood. How did you know it was there? How did you know what to do?
ANDREW I-I don't know. Stuff happened. I forget.
KENNEDY So remember. Look at the charm.
ANDREW But, II'm not a part of this. I document, I don't participate. I'm a detached journalist, recording with a neutral eye.
BUFFY Andrew! Stop it, or I'm going to smash this camera over your head. Actually, I'm gonna do that anyway, so you might as well talk.
WILLOW Stop going off topic.
ANDREW I wasn't off topic. It's gonna get relevant in a second, because Jonathan's gonna go to the bathroom.
JONATHAN I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
ANDREW La cucaracha. La cucaracha. La la la la la.
WARREN/FIRST Did you get the knife?
ANDREW Oh, Gosh. Gosh, I'm glad to see you.
WARREN/FIRST Me too. You're looking good.
ANDREW Am I? I...probably have pillow creases.
WARREN/FIRST No, no, it's good. You're a man on the run. You got kind of a wild, desperate thing going. Did you, uh, did you get the knife?
ANDREW Yeah. It wasn't easy. I had to meet this demon guy who sells all kinds of weird weapons and stuff.
WARREN/FIRST Yeah, show me.
ANDREW Well, I didn't buy them, but there were poison arrows and this sort of collapsible sword
WARREN/FIRST Show me the knife!
ANDREW Oh, right.
WARREN/FIRST Quick, before the shortcake comes back.
ANDREW Oh, it'll be a while. He's got a shy bladder. Jonathan, you OK in there?
JONATHAN Don't talk to me. I'm fine.
ANDREW Pretty knife, except the, uh, the stabbingI don'tI don't think I can do it. Jonathan has been a good friend to me here in Mehico. He said he'll buy me a burro.
WARREN/FIRST Oh, you can stab him. It's all part of the plan. That boy's blood is a powerful tribute. It's ait's a gift to something very big, very important, and ultimately, won't even hurt him. We get a reward. You and me and him too.
ANDREW We live as gods.
WARREN/FIRST That's right, man. The trio. Living as gods.
WARREN/FIRST There's power in that knife. Drive the words deep into him. It's the only way for us to get our reward.
ANDREW Got it. If I kill him with this knife, we live as gods.
WILLOW Wait a second. Go back. What was that part again?
ANDREW You mean this part?
WILLOW Not that part. We need to see that knife. There's something there.
BUFFY Kennedy, search his stuff. Find the knife.
ANDREW It's not in my stuff. It's in the kitchen, in the cutlery drawer. You didn't have any steak knives.
WILLOW You put your old murder weapon in with our utensils?
ANDREW I washed it.
SPIKE What are you looking for?
WILLOW He said the First said something about words. Drive the words deep into him.
ANDREW There was some carving on the blade. I just thought it was a pattern.
KENNEDY Found it.
WILLOW OK, you're Mr. Demon-Summoner. How are you with demon languages?
ANDREW Whoa, you were right. It's in Tawarick. It's, uh, like proto-Tawarick. It's really, really old.
KENNEDY But, what's the big?
ROBIN_WOOD We never knew anything about this seal. Now, we know this knife and this language are connected to it somehow.
WILLOW Andrew, do you speak Tawarick?
ANDREW Yeah, I'm OK with it. It says, The blood which I spill, I consecrate to the oldest evil.
KENNEDY Creepy.
BUFFY Will, what're you thinking? You think you can do something with that?
WILLOW I let me work on it.
WILLOW I think it's got a shot.
BUFFY Guess what, Andy. You just won yourself a free vacation to the beautiful downtown hellmouth.
SPIKE So he can do what? Yell at it in its own language?
WILLOW Maybe.
ROBIN_WOOD What? II'm not following.
BUFFY Look, we have to deal with the seal right away. We already might have to just shut the school down, and I'm not losing any more territory to the First. Besides, it's the only thing we've got.
WILLOW The seal responds to this language somehow, or-or the First wouldn't have needed this knife. Andrew knows the language, can really talk to it, maybe give it commands.
BUFFY Robin, Spike, let's go.
BUFFY Riot that almost happened.
ROBIN_WOOD Looks to me like it happened after all.
SPIKE Looks to me like it's still happening.
SPIKE Nice way to run a school. There's got to be kids injured in here.
ROBIN_WOOD Yeah, easy picking for the likes of you, huh?
SPIKE Hey, here to help, you know.
ROBIN_WOOD Right.
ANDREW Check out Spike and the Principal. There's something going on there. Sexual tension you could cut with a knife.
SPIKE These kids went nuts, didn't they?
ROBIN_WOOD No kidding.
BUFFY Shh, they'll hear you.
ROBIN_WOOD Buffy, they're all the way down
BUFFY Spike!
SPIKE The kids are getting stronger.
ANDREW Oh, God. Struck down before I achieve redemption.
BUFFY Spike! Don't kill them. They're just students.
SPIKE They'll live.
BUFFY OK, Spike, Wood. I need you guys to stay here, hold our line of retreat.
ANDREW So, I'll be staying here with these men, helping out that holding the line thing. I'll be with Buffy.
ANDREW We make our way down the stairs carefully, alert for any danger.
BUFFY Oh, stop it.
ANDREW I was just
BUFFY No more.
ANDREW But I justI just want the world to see what you do.
BUFFY What I do is too important to show the world.
ANDREW Ooh, I like that.
BUFFY Be quiet! I don't want a biographer, especially a murderer.
ANDREW Yeah, well, see, about thatwe just keep tossing that word around, but that's not really what happened.
BUFFY What? You stabbed Jonathan to death. What were you trying to do? Scratch his back from the front?
ANDREW It was confusing. Jonathan and I were digging, but Warren was there, and only I could see him
ANDREW See, I'm a man trapped by circumstances into paying for a crime I didn't even What?
BUFFY No, I just thought you would say that. I saw the seal possess Wood like that earlier today.
ANDREW Yes. Yes. See...
BUFFY You just completely changed your entire story.
ANDREW Did not.
BUFFY Uh, ya did too.
ANDREW Diduh, hey, here we are.
BUFFY There's someone in there. No. We're going in. Just be prepared, OK? The seal could have done anything to them. Go.
BUFFY Nope, they're OK.
XANDER Wow.
ANYA Wow, wow.
XANDER That was nice.
ANYA Certainly was, you carpenter you.
XANDER It's too bad Buffy took Spike's chains down, huh?
ANYA You said it.
XANDER Mmm, I feel good.
ANYA Well, yeah. I'm a spitfire in the bedroom.
XANDER Yeah, I knew we'd always do that again.
ANYA Yeah, one more time anyway.
XANDER Is that what that was? One more time?
ANYA Do you think there should be more?
XANDER I don't know. It was nice. It felt, umit felt like a one more time.
ANYA I think maybe we're really over. Which isit's good, right? I mean, now we can move on.
XANDER Sure.
SPIKE Wonder what's keeping 'em. I thought they'd be up here by now. How'd they make this in here, you suppose?
ROBIN_WOOD Wood shop, I guess. It's nice to know they're paying attention in class.
ANDREW She's like a woman fighting for more than life. She fights like fighting is her life. It's like the air she breathes, and she knows she will win because there is no alternative.
BUFFY It's your turn, Andrew.
ANDREW So, you figure, what? I, uh... I stand on the seal, and hold the knife, and command it to stop glowing in Tawarick?
BUFFY Or we could do this?
ANDREW What?
BUFFY Doesn't really make sense, does it? Bringing you here to talk to it. This thing doesn't understand words, it understands blood.
ANDREW Blood opens it. You don't want to open it. Opening it would be bad.
BUFFY Yeah, Willow did a little research. Turns out, the blood of the person that awoke ityoudifferent kind of deal. It reverses the whole thing.
ANDREW So, how much blood...are you gonna
BUFFY I don't know. Maybe not enough to kill you.
ANDREW So, this is my redemption at last? I buy back my bruised soul with the blood of my heart. But-but not enough to kill
BUFFY Stop! Stop telling stories. Life isn't a story.
ANDREW Sorry. Sorry.
BUFFY Shut up. You always do this. You make everything into a story so no one's responsible for anything because they're just following a script.
ANDREW Please don't kill me. Warren said Jonathan would be OK. I trusted him, and I lost my friend.
BUFFY You didn't lose him. You murdered him.
ANDREW I know, but you don't need to kill me. You said we could all get through this.
BUFFY I made it up. I'm making it all up. What kind of hero does that make me?
ANDREW No, you're doing great. Really. Kudos.
BUFFY Yeah? Well, I don't like having to give a bunch of speeches about how we're all gonna live, because we won't. This isn't some story where good triumphs because good triumphs. Good people are going to die! Girls. Maybe me. Probably you. Probably right now.
ANDREW Don't! Please! Don't, please!
BUFFY When your blood pours out, it might save the world. What do you think about that? Does it buy it all back? Are you redeemed?
ANDREW No.
BUFFY Why not?
ANDREW Because I killed him. Because I listened to Warren, and I pretended I thought it was him, but I knewI knew it wasn't. And I killed Jonathan. And now you're gonna kill me. And I'm scared, and I'm going to die. And thisthis is what Jonathan felt.
ANDREW It stopped.
BUFFY Didn't want blood. It wanted tears.
ANDREW Thanks.
BUFFY Sorry, I had to
ANDREW Youyou weren't really going to stab me, were you?
BUFFY I wasn't going to stab you.
ANDREW What if the tears didn't work?
ROBIN_WOOD She got it done.
SPIKE Always has.
ROBIN_WOOD So far.
ANDREW Here's the thing. I killed my best friend. There's a big fight coming, and I don't know what's going to happen. I don't even think I'm going to live through it. That's, uh, probably the way it should be. I guess I'm
