GILES Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer:
BUFFY Spike!
GILES Why didn't your chip go off?
BUFFY We were at the Initiative...
SPIKE There was a choice.
BUFFY Right. Either repair the chip, or to remove it.
GILES You removed the chip?
BUFFY Yeah.
BUFFY Spike has a soul now. That's what's gonna stop him from hurting people.
GILES Buffy...
BUFFY He can be a good man, Giles. I feel it.
BUFFY How do you know about slayers?
ROBIN My mother was one. She was killed when I was four.
BUFFY Um, something got her... a demon?
ROBIN A vampire.
ROBIN So, how do you two know each other?
BUFFY He works with me. Uh, you know, in the struggle against evil.
ROBIN He's a vampire.
ROBIN Nice coat. Where'd you get it?
SPIKE New York.
SPIKE Well, all right. Got the moves, don't you? I'm gonna ride you hard before I put you away, luv.
NIKKI You sure about that? You actually look a little wet and limp to me. And I ain't your luv.
SPIKE I spent a long time trying to track you down. Don't want the dance to end so soon, do you, Nikki? The music's just starting, isn't it? By the way...love the coat.
YOUNG_ROBIN Mamma!
NIKKI You did a good job, baby boy. You stayed down just like mamma told you.
YOUNG_ROBIN Can we go home now?
NIKKI Uh-uh. It's not safe there anymore. How 'bout I leave you over at Crowley's house, and you can play with those spooky doodads that you like.
YOUNG_ROBIN No, I wanna stay with you.
NIKKI Yeah, I know you do, baby. But remember, Robin, honey what we talked about. Always got to work the mission. Look at me. You know I love you, but I got a job to do. The mission is what matters...right? That's my boy. Come on.
NIKKI Robin?
BUFFY Spike!
SPIKE Little tip, mate. Stake's your friend. Don't be afraid to use it. What?
ROBIN Just waiting for my moment.
BUFFY Situation still normal. Well, or as normal as this school ever sees.
ROBIN So it appears.
BUFFY Well, no fires, no one's head's going kablooey. And the swing choir and the marching band have gone back to their normal, healthy seething resentment.
ROBIN Yeah, it's been pretty quiet around here since you shut down that seal. You just may have stopped this thing, Buffy.
BUFFY No, it can't be that easy.
ROBIN You call that easy?
BUFFY Hey, any apocalypse I avert without dying? Yeah, those are the easy ones.
ROBIN You know, you're, uh...You're something else, Miss Summers. You know, I've been watching you when you're out patrolling, and you, um You remind me of my, um...
BUFFY Your mother?
ROBIN Yeah. Yeah, what I remember of her, anyway.
BUFFY Got to tell you, not a line every girl likes to hear, butin this case compliment taken. Maybe you're right. Maybe everything is fine.
GILES Everything's terrible. Total catastrophe.
BUFFY Giles, what's wrong?
GILES Have you seen the new library? There's nothing but computers. There's not a book to be seen. II don't know where to begin, Buffy. I mean, who do we speak to?
ROBIN Uh, that wouldthat would be me. Hi. I'm Robin Wood.
GILES Oh, sorry. Rupert Giles. Sorry. Buffy tells me you're something of a freelance demon fighter. Oh, yes, yes. I, um, I'm relieved. We're running dangerously low on allies.
BUFFY So, we didn't stop it, then?
GILES Uh, no, the seers at the coven are certain the First is continuing to gather its forces. I'm afraid war is inevitable. So, we should go before the school board.
ROBIN What?
GILES Well, I can have my backup library sent from home in the mean time. It's not much, but
BUFFY Giles.
GILES Knowledge comes from crafted bindings and pages, Buffy, not ones and zeros.
BUFFY So, did you bring back any potentials?
GILES Um, no. Actually, m-my, uh, my trip is about something else...regarding Spike.
BUFFY Spike? What about him?
GILES I told you my concerns when you recklessly chose to remove the chip from his head.
ROBIN Wait, sorry, chip?
GILES Uh, it's a long story.
BUFFY The military put a chip in Spike's head so he couldn't hurt anyone.
GILES And that would be the abridged version.
BUFFY But he wouldn't hurt anyone anymore because he has a soul now.
GILES Unless the First triggers him again.
ROBIN Triggers the chip?
BUFFY No, the trigger's a post-hypnotic thing. The First put it in his head. It wasmade him He was killing again.
ROBIN So, he has a trigger, a soul, and a chip?
GILES Not anymore.
BUFFY It was killing him, Giles.
ROBIN The trigger?
BUFFY No, the chip. The trigger's not active anymore.
ROBIN Because the military gave him a soul? Sorry.
GILES We don't know that the trigger is inactive. What I brought back may help us to disarm it, to ascertain exactly what it is that causes Spike's behavior.
BUFFY It was that song, Giles. I'm telling you, it was that song that Spike was singing.
GILES He has no memory of it. Is there any part of it that you can remember?
BUFFY It wasn't like it had a catchy hook or anything like I'm coming up, so you better get this party started. It was boring, old, and English. Just like youull. Yule Brenner. A British Yule Brenner.
ROBIN This thing you brought to keep Spike from killing again... How's it work?
GILES Well, it will require a bit of magic.
XANDER No, we couldn't have put these chains back up a week ago. Nah, we gotta work on Spike now, of all times.
SPIKE What?
XANDER Nothing.
SPIKE What are you doing here? You came to see the show?
ROBIN I thought you might need support.
SPIKE Uh-huh. Right, let's get this over with. What're you gonna do? Some hypno-beam? A disarming spell?
GILES Not exactly. The First has brainwashed you. There's something in your subconscious that it's using to provoke a violent reaction. So... we have to put this in your brain.
SPIKE Bugger that!
GILES The Prokaryote stone will move within your mind to reveal the root of the trigger's power. Can unleash ideas, images, memories... Hopefully, once you understand what it is that's...setting you off, you can break its hold on you.
DAWN Hopefully? So, it might not work?
GILES The stone's just a catalyst for the process. The rest is up to Spike.
SPIKE And how do expect to get that hunk of rubble into my cranium?
GILES Willow?
WILLOW OK. I just hope my pronunciation is in the ballpark. Kun'ati belek sup'sion. Bok'vata im kele'beshus. Ek'vota mor'osh boota'ke.
SPIKE Oh, you have got to be joking? What now?
GILES It has to access the cerebral cortex via the optic nerve.
SPIKE Oh, bollocks. With all the rubbish people keep sticking in my head, it's a wonder that there's room for my brain.
GILES I don't think it takes up that much space, do you?
SPIKE Ow. Oh, ow!
BUFFY Spike! Spike, listen to me.
SPIKE Yeah.
BUFFY Are you all right?
SPIKE How am I supposed to know if this bug-ugly's doing its job
WILLIAM Yet her smell, it doth linger, painting pictures in my mind.
WILLIAM Her eyes, balls of honey. Angel's harps her laugh.
WILLIAM Oh, lark. Grant a sign if crook'd be Cupid's shaft.
WILLIAM Hark, the lark, her name it hath spake.
WILLIAM Cecily it discharges from twixt its wee beak.
WOMAN Oh, William....
WILLIAM It's just...scribbling.
WOMAN Nonsense. It's magnificent. I wonder, though. This Cecily of whom you write so often...
WILLIAM Oh.
WOMAN Would that be the Underwood's eldest girl?
WILLIAM Uh, no, uh, no. I do not presume.
WOMAN She's lovely. You shouldn't be alone. You need a woman in your life.
WILLIAM I have a woman in my life.
WOMAN But you ne Oh...
WILLIAM Well, do not mistake me. I still have hopes that one day there will be an addition to this household, but I will always look after you, mother. This, I promise.
WILLIAM Should I send the coach for Doctor Gull?
WOMAN/MOTHER I'll be all right. It's passed. Just sit with me a while, will you?
WILLIAM Of course.
MOTHER Early one morning, just as the sun was shining, I heard a maid sing in the valley below.
MOTHER Oh, don't deceive me. Oh, never leave me. How could you use a poor maiden so?
WILLOW Dawn!
SPIKE Get these sodding things off me. I'm fine.
BUFFY Don't you think you should take a little time, calm down?
SPIKE I am calm. This stone of yours isis out, right? Did its job, so I'm de-triggered, right?
GILES Spike, what do you remember about the song?
SPIKE Oh, yeah, the song. It's called, uh, Early One Morning. Old folk ditty.
ROBIN What's it mean to you?
SPIKE Mean? Nothing. It's just, uh, my mum. It was her favorite. She used to sing it to me... when I was a baby.
GILES And...?
SPIKE No and. That's it. Look, shouldn't you check on Dawnie? I clocked the niblet pretty fierce.
BUFFY She'll be OK. She's tough.
DAWN Ow!
WILLOW I'm sorry. Doesn't look like anything's broken?
DAWN Did you use some sort of a magic x-ray?
WILLOW No, that's just what people usually say.
KENNEDY So, Spike's trigger's been active this entire time?
RONA How can Buffy take this for granted? I mean, he lives in our house, we train with him.
ANYA Don't waste your time down that road. Spike's got some sort of Get Out of Jail Free card that doesn't apply to the rest of us. I mean, he could slaughter a hundred frat boys, and Forgiveness makes us human. blah-dee-blah-blah-blah.
ANDREW Uh, Willow...call for you from L.A. Somebody named Fred. The guy sounds kind of effeminate.
GILES Spike, listen to me. What is it about your mother?
SPIKE I don't know. I got along fine with her. She was a nice lady.
GILES Well there has to be more than that.
SPIKE Well, there bloody well isn't!
GILES What are you doing?
BUFFY I'm going to unchain him.
GILES Buffy, just
BUFFY This is pointless, Giles. He doesn't know anything. Your prophylactic stone didn't work.
GILES Because he's not cooperating. This process takes time. He's blocking whatever's flooding his consciousness. And what he doeshe's endangering us all.
ROBIN So, the trigger's still working?
GILES Much as ever.
DRUSILLA Ooh, such a pretty house you have, sweet William. It smells of daffodils...and viscera.
WILLIAM Don't get too attached, now. Won't be here for long, luv.
DRUSILLA Well then... should we give it a proper goodbye?
WILLIAM You're a saucy one, aren't you? Dru...we'll bring this world to its knees.
DRUSILLA It's ripe and ready, my darling, waiting for us to devour its fruit.
WILLIAM We'll ravage this city together, my pet. Lay waste to all of Europe. The three of us will teach those snobs and elitists with their falderal just what
DRUSILLA Three?
WILLIAM You, me, and mother. We'll open up their veins and bathe in their blood as they scream our names across What?
DRUSILLA You...you want to bring your mum wif us?
WILLIAM Well, yeah. You'll like her.
DRUSILLA To eat, you mean?
MOTHER William?
WILLIAM Uh, mother.
MOTHER Where have you been? I've been beside myself for days.
WILLIAM You needn't have worried, mother. You'll never have to worry about anything again. Something has happened. I've changed.
MOTHER II don't Who's this woman?
DRUSILLA I'm the other that gave birth to your son.
MOTHER I beg your pardon?
WILLIAM It's true, mother. Drusillashe...she has made me what I am. I am no longer bound to this mortal coil. I have become a creature of the night. A vampire.
MOTHER Are you drunk?
WILLIAM A little bit. Think of it. No more sickness. No more dying. You'll never age another day. Let me do this for you.
MOTHER What are you talking about, a-and why are you acting so strangely?
WILLIAM It's all right, mother. It's only me. We'll be together forever.
MOTHER William...
WILLIAM It only hurts for a moment.
WILLOW Buffy? Hey, I, uh, just got a phone call. I'm gonna have to take off for a while. Maybe a day or two?
BUFFY What's wrong?
WILLOW Nothing you need to worry about. I'll give you the full scoop later. Maybe I'll even bring back some good news?
BUFFY Could use a little of that. OK. I guess now is as good a time as we're likely to see for a while. Just hurry back.
WILLOW Will do.
GILES Think about what you're doing.
BUFFY I have.
GILES Buffy...
BUFFY Don't.
ROBIN Mr. Giles... You got a moment?
GILES What's on your mind?
ROBIN The same thing that's on yours. We got ourselves a problem.
GILES Spike.
ROBIN Yeah, if that trigger's still working, then the First must be waiting for just the right time to use it against us.
GILES It does seem doubtful the First simply forgot it had such a powerful weapon.
ROBIN Yeah, a while back, it slipped up. It told Andrew it wasn't time yet for Spike. So, whatever the First's ultimate plan is, it's obvious that Spike must play an integral part in that. Something needs to be done.
GILES Buffy would never allow it.
ROBIN Buffy would listen to her Watcher, wouldn't she?
GILES I don't think you have much of an idea of the Watcher-Slayer dynamic.
ROBIN As a matter of fact, I was raised by a Watcher.
GILES You were?
ROBIN Bernard Crowley. Took me in when I was a young kid, trained me.
GILES Crowley. I remember the name. New York based watcher. Resigned shortly after his slayer was You're Nikki Wood's son.
ROBIN Yes.
GILES Spike killed your mother.
ROBIN Yes.
GILES Does Buffy know this?
ROBIN She knows my mother was a slayer. She...doesn't know about Spike.
GILES And this has nothing to do with personal vengeance?
ROBIN Does it matter? He's an instrument of evil. Now he's gonna prove to be our undoing in this fight, Buffy's undoing, and she will nevernever see it coming. Now, I'm talking about what needs to be done... for the greater good, Giles. And you know I'm right.
GILES What exactly do you propose?
ROBIN I just need you to keep Buffy away for a few hours.
BUFFY I don't know, Giles. Is this really a primo time for a training session?
GILES I'm still your teacher, Buffy. As adept as you are as a slayer, there are always new things to learn. Now, more than ever, it's crucial to maintain focus on your calling.
BUFFY In case you haven't noticed, our plates are kinda full right now. Plus, I'm not really sure how I feel about leaving Spike at Robin's house to watch over him.
GILES For what its worth everyone at your house seemed....quite relieved at the arrangement. Um, Buffy, uh...while I'm not technically your Watcher anymore, the fact that your life is such chaos only underscores the importance of the lessons I can impart to you.
BUFFY Fine. Impart away.
GILES We're on the verge of war. It's time you looked at the big picture.
BUFFY Hello! All I do is look at the big picture. The other day, I gave an inspirational speech to the telephone repair man.
GILES It takes more than rousing speeches to lead, Buffy. If you're going to be a general, you need to be able to make difficult decisions regardless of cost.
BUFFY Have you seen me with those girls? I mean, the way I've treated my friends and my family and... Andrew. Believe me, I know how to make hard decisions.
GILES Well, that's what we're here to find out. While we work on the basics.
SPIKE You live in the garage?
ROBIN This is just a work room. Kind of my, uh, sanctuary.
SPIKE A little place to unwind, eh?
SPIKE A hard day's prinipaling got you down, you need a place to cut loose, let your hair downso to speak.
SPIKE What the bloody hell is this?
ROBIN Well, I told you. It's my, um, sanctuary. It's the hell mouth, Spike. You can never be too careful. Just, um, stay away from the walls, and you'll be all right.
SPIKE It's a bit much, isn't it? What's your story, Wood?
ROBIN No story, really. Just trying to do what's right. Make a difference. How 'bout you? What kind of man are you, Spike?
SPIKE Sorry. Not much for self reflection.
ROBIN Yeah, makes sense. See, you strike me as the kind of guy who just careens through life, completely oblivious to the damage he's doing to everyone around him.
SPIKE That right?
ROBIN Oh, I know more about you than you think, Spike. See, I've been searching for you for a very, very long time. Ever since you killed my mother.
SPIKE I've killed a lot of people's mothers.
ROBIN Yeah. You'd remember mine. She was a slayer.
SPIKE So, that's it, innit? Brought me here to kill me?
ROBIN No, I don't wanna kill you, Spike. I wanna kill the monster who took my mother away from me.
ROBIN There he is.
WILLIAM Mother?
MOTHER Hello, William.
WILLIAM Look at you.
MOTHER Mm, yes. All better.
WILLIAM You're glowing.
MOTHER Am I? Well, I suppose I have you to thank for that, don't I? How ever will I repay you?
WILLIAM Seeing you like this is payment enough.
MOTHER Oh, William, you're so... tender.
WILLIAM Well, this is as it should be, mother. You and I together. All of London laid out before us.
MOTHER Ah, yes. Us.
WILLIAM First, we'll feast. Then the night is yours. Theater, perhaps. Dancing? Tell me, what's your pleasure?
MOTHER Pleasure? To take my leave of you, of course. The lark hath spake from twixt its wee beak? You honestly thought I could bear an eternity listening to that twaddle?
ROBIN That's right, dog. Fight back.
MOTHER I feel extraordinary. It's as though I've been given new eyes. I see everything. Understand... everything.
WILLIAM Mother...
MOTHER I hate to be cruel No, I don't. I used to hate to be cruel in life. Now, I find it rather freeing. Nothing less will pry your greedy little fingers off my apron strings, will it?
WILLIAM Stop. Please.
MOTHER Ever since the day you first slithered from me like a parasite...
WILLIAM What're you s
MOTHER Had I known better, I could have spared myself a lifetime of tedium and just
MOTHER Dashed your brains out when I first saw you.
MOTHER God, I prayed you'd find a woman to release me, but you scarcely showed an interest. Who could compare to your doddering housebound mum? A captive audience for your witless prattle.
WILLIAM Whatever I was, that's not who I am anymore.
MOTHER Darling, it's who you'll always be. A limp... sentimental fool.
ROBIN It hurts, don't it? Is this what it felt like when you beat the life out of her, toyed with her, when you snapped her neck!
GILES Don't kill him yet.
BUFFY What? Why not?
GILES Because I'm asking you not to. Would you let this vampire live if he began saving the world?
BUFFY Sure. Seems like a nice enough guy.
VAMPIRE Thanks.
BUFFY No problem.
VAMPIRE My name's Richard.
BUFFY Hi, Rich. Giles, we had this conversation when I told you that I wouldn't sacrifice Dawn to stop Glory from destroying the world.
GILES Ah, yes, but things are different, aren't they? After what you've been through, faced with the same choice now, you'd let her die.
BUFFY If I had to...to save the world. Yes.
BUFFY Can I kill this guy yet?
GILES No. So, you really do understand the difficult decisions you'll have to make? That anyone of us is expendable in this war?
BUFFY Have you heard my speeches?
GILES That we cannot allow any threat that would jeopardize our chances at winning?
BUFFY Yes, I get it.
GILES And yet there is Spike.
ROBIN Animal like you. Never cared for anyone but yourself. No one else mattered. Just all about the hunt. Yeah.
MOTHER You want to run, don't you? Scamper off and cry to your new little trollop. Do you think you'll be able to love her? Think you'll be able to touch her without feeling me? All you ever wanted was to be back inside. You finally got your wish, didn't you? Sank your teeth into me. An eternal kiss.
WILLIAM No. I only wanted to make you well.
MOTHER You wanted your hands on me. Perhaps you'd like a chance to finish off what you started.
WILLIAM I love you. I did. Not like this.
MOTHER Just like this. This is what you always wanted. Who's my dark little prince?
WILLIAM No!
MOTHER Get out. Get out! There, there, precious. It will only hurt for a moment.
WILLIAM I'm sorry.
ROBIN What?
SPIKE I'm sorry.
ROBIN Sorry? You think sorry's gonna make everything right?
SPIKE I wasn't talking to you. I don't give a piss about your mum. She was a slayer. I was a vampire. That's the way the game is played.
ROBIN Game?
SPIKE She knew what she was signing up for.
ROBIN Well, I didn't sign up for it.
SPIKE Well, that's the rub, innit? You didn't sign up for it
ROBIN You took my childhood. You took her away. She was all I had. She was my world.
SPIKE And you weren't hers. Doesn't that piss you off?
ROBIN Shut up. You didn't know her.
SPIKE I know slayers. No matter how many people they've got around them, they fight alone. Life of the chosen one. The rest of us be damned. Your mother was no different.
ROBIN No, she loved me.
SPIKE But not enough to quit, though, was it? Not enough to walk away... for you. I'll tell you a story about a mother and son. See, like you, I loved my mother. So much so I turned her into a vampire... so we could be together forever. She said some nasty bits to me after I did that. Been weighing on me for quite some time. But you helped me figure something out. You see, unlike you, I had a mother who loved me back. When I sired her, I set loose a demon, and it tore into me, but it was the demon talking, not her. I realize that now. My mother loved me with all her heart. I was her world.
SPIKE That's a nice little song you got there. Thanks, doc. You cured me after all. I got my own free will, now. I'm not under the First's or anyone else's influences now. I just wanted you to know that... before I kill you.
GILES Spike's a liability, Buffy. He refuses to see it, and so do you. Angel left here because he realized how harmful your relationship with him was. Spike, on the other hand, lacks such self-awareness.
BUFFY Spike is here because I want him here. We need him. I'm in the fight of my life.
VAMPIRE Really?
BUFFY Not you, Richard.
GILES You want Spike here even after what he's done to you in the past?
BUFFY It's different now. He has a soul.
GILES And the First is exploiting that to his advantage.
BUFFY Oh, my God. You're stalling me. You're keeping me away
GILES It's time to stop playing the role of general, and start being one. This is the way wars are won.
BUFFY Spike? What happened? Oh, my God.
SPIKE I gave him a pass. Let him live. On account of the fact I killed his mother. But that's all he gets. He even so much as looks at me funny again, I'll kill him.
BUFFY I lost my mom a couple years ago. I came home and found her dead on the couch.
ROBIN I'm sorry.
BUFFY I understand what you tried to do, but she's dead.
ROBIN Because he murdered her.
BUFFY I'm preparing to fight a war, and you're looking for revenge on a man that doesn't exist anymore.
ROBIN Buffy, don't delude yourself... That man still exists.
BUFFY Spike is the strongest warrior we have. We are gonna need him if we're gonna come out of this thing alive. You try anything again, he'll kill you. More importantly, I'll let him. I have a mission to win this war, to save the world. I don't have time for vendettas. The mission is what matters.
GILES Buffy...II understand your anger. Please believe me, we did what we
BUFFY He's alive. Spike's alive. Wood failed.
GILES Well, that doesn't change anything. What I told you is still true. You need to learn
BUFFY No, I think you've taught me everything I need to know.
