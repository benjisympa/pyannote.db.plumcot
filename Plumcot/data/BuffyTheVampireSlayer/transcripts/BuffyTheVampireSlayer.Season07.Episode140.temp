GILES Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer:
FAITH I'm Faith.
GILES We have a rogue slayer on our hands. I can't think of anything more dangerous.
BUFFY Faith, no!
BUFFY You killed a man.
FAITH I don't care.
GILES She's unstable, Buffy.
JENNY/FIRST I'm not a demon, little girl. I am something that you can't even conceive. The First Evil.
ANYA Look, I'm not saying it's a happy scenario, but we're dealing with a Big Bad that can be any dead person it wants.
WARREN/FIRST You know the rules. I can't take corporeal form. Mm-hmm.
DAWN They're all slayers?
GILES Potential slayers.
GILES There were many more like them all over the world, but, um, now there's just a handful, and they're all on their way to Sunnydale.
BUFFY That's what it wants.
GILES To erase all the slayers in training and their watchers, along with their methods.
BUFFY And then Faith, and then me. It's the end. No more slayer.
BUFFY Spike has a soul now. That's what's gonna stop him from hurting people.
GILES Buffy...
BUFFY He can be a good man, Giles. I feel it.
ANDREW Uh, Willow...call for you from L.A. Somebody named Fred.
WILLOW I'm gonna have to take off for a while. Maybe a day or two?
GILES We're on the verge of war. You need to be able to make difficult decisions regardless of cost.
BUFFY You're stalling me.
ROBIN_WOOD I've been searching for you for a very, very long time. Ever since you killed my mother.
BUFFY You try anything again, he'll kill you. More importantly, I'll let him.
BUFFY I think you've taught me everything I need to know.
GIRL Stop! Stop! Stop, please!
MAN What's goin' on?
GIRL Please get me out of here!
MAN Was someone hurt? What is it?
GIRL Drive.
MAN Well, that was, uh... Are you all right?
GIRL Thank you. Thank God you were there.
MAN Well, let's not give him credit for everything. No, I'm funning you. I don't believe it was a coincidence. I also don't believe young girls should be out in the woods late at nightshould be tucked in bed.
GIRL Wish I was.
MAN I expect you do at that. Look, I don't mean to pry, but those boys... they looked like Well, you didn't happen to fall in with devil worshipers, did you? Na, I'mI'm sorry. You, uh, you look like you've been traveling a while. I didn't think that Is there some place you'd like me to drop you? You heading some place?
GIRL Sunnydale.
MAN I'm going there myself. I ain't never been, but I expect we could find a police station or a
GIRL I just need to get to Revello Drive. Um, thanks, Father...
MAN_/_CALEB Call me Caleb. Never was nobody's daddy.
GIRL_/_SHANNON I'm Shannon.
CALEB Well, Shannon, you feel like telling me why those Freaky Joe's were after you?
SHANNON I'm not sure.
CALEB Well, do you ever think that maybe they were chasing you because you're a whore?
SHANNON What?
CALEB Now, I know what you're thinking. Crazy preacher man spoutin' off at the mouth about the whore of Babylon or some-such. That ain't me. I'm not here to lecture you. I mean, what's the point? My words just curdle in your ears. Wouldn't take in a thing. Head's filled with so much filth that ain't no room for words of truth. Well, you know what you are, Shannon? Dirty.
SHANNON What? I'm not! What're
CALEB Now, now, now. There's no blame here. You were born dirty, born without a soul. Born with that gaping maw wants to open up, suck out a man's marrow. Makes me puke to think too hard on it. Yeah, that there door's problematical. I don't know as I could recommend steppin' out at this speed anyway. You're like as not to tumble some. But, of course, there's my boys back thereOoh, they hate to miss a mark.
SHANNON Your boys?
CALEB Well, they ain't exactly my blue eyed boys but they're hard workers. And they don't truck with Satanthat was just me having fun. Satan is a little man. I don't like back-seat drivers.
SHANNON Please...don't hurt me.
CALEB Well, now, is this the part where you offer to do anything? Because I tried to make it clearyou got nothin' I want to explore.
CALEB Oh yeah. That's it! That's a cleansing fire. Hallelujah! Now, if I'm not mistaken, there's a car a little ways behind us, and I do believe there's some folk in it goin' the same place you are. Now, I want you to deliver a message for me, but it's not for them. It's for the other onethe one and only, the original, accept-no-substitutes slayer. Would you tell her something for me?
SHANNON Yes.
CALEB Thank you, Shannon. Now, let's see what we can't do about that door.
WILLOW Are you OK? Can you hear me? Can you talk? This girl's bleeding badly. We have to get her to the hospital.
FAITH Yep. Guess I'm back in Sunnydale.
XANDER I know it's hard.
POTENTIAL I haven't been able to sleep the last few nights.
XANDER Hey, listen. It's gonna be OK. Buffy knows what she's doing. She's not gonna send you into battle until she's sure you're ready for action.
POTENTIAL That's just it, though. How will I know I'm ready...for action?
XANDER You have to trust us.
POTENTIAL I'm so scared, Xander. I'm so young.
XANDER Well, believe it or not, I was younger than you when I started all this.
POTENTIAL There's just so much I haven't done, so much I need to do. It's like... I never had a real boyfriend, you know?
XANDER Yeah?
POTENTIAL I've never been with a man. I could die tomorrow, and I've never been with a man.
XANDER Well, uh
POTENTIAL_2 I've never been with a man before either.
XANDER Colleen.
POTENTIAL_2_/_COLLEEN I've never been with her in front of a man before.
POTENTIAL I've never been with her in front of a man, either.
XANDER Um...
POTENTIAL Xander...
XANDER We can't.
COLLEEN We're so scared.
XANDER The others might hear us.
COLLEEN No, they won't.
POTENTIAL They're OK.
RONA Xander!
RONA Xander!
XANDER Wha?
RONA God damn it!
XANDER What's going on? I was sleeping.
RONA Dominique has the stomach flu, and the toilet bowl is backed up.
XANDER I'll be right out. Got, uh, a leg cramp.
FAITH You sure she's one of us? She don't look like much now. Not a potential slayer, I mean.
WILLOW Don't know. Seems to fit, though. We'll know more when she regains consciousness.
FAITH If she regains consciousness. Girl's been gutted like a catfish.
WILLOW Yeah.
FAITH Something's killing girls all over the world, trying to end the slayer line. Thing like that, figure I might get a heads up.
WILLOW Faith...
FAITH Guess it doesn't really matter as long as you got the true slayer intact.
WILLOW You were in prison. Figured you were safe there.
FAITH Yeah, that's prison. Safe as a kitten.
WILLOW Sorry, I... don't know much about the big house. Was it I mean, did something happen in there?
FAITH Someone came at me with a nasty looking knife. Didn't really know why 'til now.
WILLOW Oh, Faith, we didn't
FAITH Forget it. It's cool. I get by. What're we gonna do about her?
WILLOW Uh, I guess we should find Buffy, tell her what's going on. I-I tried calling home. Dawn says she's out patrolling.
FAITH Let's go look for her. Cemetery's more fun anyway.
WILLOW Wait, somebody should wait here in case she wakes up.
FAITH Fine, sit tight. I'll be back.
WILLOW W-w-wait. Uh, maybe you meeting Buffy alone isn't the best idea.
FAITH You told her the sitch, right? She knows I'm coming. Probably been up all night hanging streamers.
WILLOW Yeah, but it's not like you're study buddies, exactly. Maybe it'd be better if I...eased her into the whole thing.
FAITH I can't stay here, Willow. Spent way too much time in hospitals. We don't click. Don't worry. I'm sure we'll all get along just fine.
FAITH Whatcha wanna do to her, vamp? Huh? Somthin' like this?
SPIKE Nice punch you got there. Lemme guess. Leather pants, nice right cross, doe eyes, holier-than-thou glower...you must be Faith.
FAITH Oh, goodie. I'm famous.
SPIKE Told you were coming. Bit of a misunderstanding here. I'm
FAITH Spike. Yeah, we've met before.
SPIKE We have? I don't think we Bloody hell! What're you doing? I'm on your side.
FAITH Yeah? Maybe you haven't heard. I've reformed.
SPIKE So have I. I reformed way before you did. Stop... hitting... me! We're on the same side.
FAITH Please. You think I'm stupid?
SPIKE Well, yeah.
FAITH You were attacking that girl.
BUFFY Sorry, Faith. I didn't realize that was you.
FAITH It's all right, B. Luckily, you still punch like you used to.
BUFFY You OK?
SPIKE Yeah. Terrific.
FAITH Are you protecting vampires? Are you the bad slayer now? Am I the good slayer now?
BUFFY He's with me. He has a soul.
FAITH Oh, he's like Angel?
SPIKE No.
BUFFY Sort of.
SPIKE I am nothing like Angel.
BUFFY He fights on my side. Which is more than I can say for some of us.
FAITH Yeah, well if he's so good, what's he doing chasing down defenseless
BUFFY That's one of the bad guys.
FAITH You should make 'em wear a sign. May I? Thanks.
SPIKE Angel's dull as a table lamp. And we have very different coloring.
FAITH OK, catching up. Anything else I gotta know?
BUFFY Nice to have you back.
FAITH Whoa. Memory Lane. Same old house.
BUFFY Yeah, well, every piece of furniture's been destroyed and replaced since you left, so, actually, new house.
DAWN Buffy?
BUFFY We have a new house guest.
FAITH Hey, got a spare bed for a wanted fugitive?
GILES Hello, Faith.
FAITH Well, I guess wanted wasn't really accurate.
DAWN Does she have to stay here? Because there's some nice hotels that welcome tried-to-kill-your-sister types.
FAITH Check it out. Brat's all woman-sized.
BUFFY Look, I need to get to the hospital. Some girl was attacked on her way into town. We think she might be a
DAWN We know. Willow's been calling.
GILES She's still there. She's gonna call if the girl wakes up.
BUFFY Fine.
GILES Well, Faith, we better, um, see if we can find some place to squeeze you in for the night.
SPIKE Not all that tension was about you. Giles was a part of a plan to kill me...for Buffy's own good.
FAITH Well, that makes me feel better about me, worse about Giles...kinda shaky about you.
CALEB Drink of this, for it is my blood. You know, I always loved the story of the Last Supper. The body and blood of Christ becoming rich, red wine. I recall, as a boy, though, I couldn't help but think: what would happen if you were at the Last Supper, and you ordered the white? A nice oaky Chardonnay or White Zin... I mean, would he make that out of his lymph or some-all? Never did bring it up. Suppose there was a reason why I never spent too long in one parish. Just looking for answers. Just looking for the Lord in the wrong damn places. Then you showed me the light.
BUFFY/FIRST Do you think I'm God?
CALEB I certainly do not. I am beyond concepts like that.
BUFFY/FIRST But you still wear the outfit.
CALEB Man can't turn his back on what he come from. Besides, black is slimming. Everyone knows that.
BUFFY/FIRST How do you like what I'm wearing?
CALEB Just another dirty girl. And, since you only dress up in dead folk, I'm guessing, one who's already been paid her wage.
BUFFY/FIRST Look hard. What do you see?
CALEB Strength. And the loneliness that comes with real strength.
BUFFY/FIRST Nothing about my pert and bouncy hairdo?
CALEB You're her.
BUFFY/FIRST The slayer.
CALEB At long last. All this time. All the work I've done for you... Blowing up the Council, organizing the Ray Charles Brigade, and stickin' all them splitsyou never showed me.
BUFFY/FIRST Well, you've earned it. And you'll be meeting her soon. Am I right?
CALEB Oh, yeah. Yeah, she'll get the message.
BUFFY/FIRST And what makes you so sure she'll come?
CALEB Curiosity. Woman's first sin. I offer her an apple. What can she do but take it? I'll see you soon.
AMANDA What the hell are you talking about? I thought Faith killed a volcanologist.
ANDREW Silly, silly...Amanda. Why would Faith kill a person who studies Vulcans?
AMANDA He studied volcanoes. He was a professor.
ANDREW Ah, yes. Well, regardless...
MOLLY I thought you weren't supposed to be doing this anymoremaking up stories.
ANDREW I'm not. This is true. Except for that...possible...word misunderstanding. They're the things you need to know about. Faith...has a history not to be taken lightly. She's a killer. Never forget that. You must stay on guard around Faith at all times. Your very lives may depend on it.
BUFFY You look better.
ROBIN_WOOD No, I don't.
BUFFY No, you don't.
ROBIN_WOOD But I'll be OK. Unless, of course, you start beating up on me now.
BUFFY I won't. Well, I thought about it. I made some doodles. As far as I'm concerned, we're on even ground. I meant what I said. I don't have time for your vendetta, but I need you in this fight. I want you on my side.
ROBIN_WOOD Thanks. That means a lot.
BUFFY So, we're good?
ROBIN_WOOD Absolutely. You're fired.
BUFFY What?
ROBIN_WOOD Effective immediately.
BUFFY You're firing me? I just refrained from kicking your ass.
ROBIN_WOOD Buffy, there's nothing here for you. I mean, people are leaving town, half the kids don't even bother showing up anymore. You've got things to deal with that are much worse than anything here. Look at the big picture.
BUFFY Right. The big picture. The one with the big war and the dead little girls.
ROBIN_WOOD Not dead. Not dead. Not if you get them ready.
BUFFY I don't want to lead them into war. It can't be the right thing.
ROBIN_WOOD Most wars aren't, you know.
BUFFY Some of these girl haven't even been tested in battle.
ROBIN_WOOD Then, I guess, maybe you should test them.
BUFFY Couldn't I just come to work part-time? I could make flyers for encounter groups and post them up all over school.
ROBIN_WOOD And you're fired again. Remember, Buffy, the mission's what matters.
SPIKE You craving a moment alone in the dank, or can I bum one?
FAITH Well, I guess you can smoke all you wantthe big C not really an issue.
SPIKE Teeth get yellow after an eternity. Gotta watch that.
FAITH Huh.
SPIKE Right. Not what it looks like.
FAITH Hey, to each his own, man. This one guy I ran with, he liked me to dress up like a school girl and take this friggin' bull-whip, and I'd be like
SPIKE I got dangerous...for a while.
FAITH This before the soul, or after?
SPIKE After, but I got over itin case you're feeling all dust-happy again after your long incarceration.
FAITH Not if you're all repenty. Takes the fun out of it. No more Starbucks for the wannabe's man. They've been spazzing for, like, hours.
SPIKE Yeah, does get a bit much up there.
FAITH They're good girls. Just green is all.
SPIKE So, why aren't you up there...imparting?
FAITH That's Buffy's thing. Anyway, I just spent a good stretch of time locked away with a mess of female-types. Kinda had my fill.
SPIKE Hm. But you waited until Angel needed your help to bust out of jail.
FAITH Three squares, nice weight room, movie every third Sunday. Could've been worse.
SPIKE What movie?
FAITH Last one was Glitter. I guess it couldn't have been worse.
SPIKE You had the power to walk away anytime. Nothing to stop you.
FAITH I stopped me. I got dangerous for a while.
SPIKE You over it?
FAITH More or less. I pull for the good guys now.
SPIKE What's the less?
FAITH The usual stuff...
SPIKE Such as?
FAITH I was thinking about looking up the guy with the bull-whip. Long incarceration.
SPIKE You could do better. School girl thing's old hat.
FAITH It's all old-hat, man. Every guy's got some whack fantasy. Scratch the surface of any granola-type dudenaughty nurses and horny cheerleaders. I figure, if you can't beat 'em
SPIKE Join 'em.
FAITH Just don't forget who's on top.
SPIKE That, I suspect, would be you.
FAITH You got that right. I've met you before, you know.
SPIKE Yeah, you made a great impression on my chin.
FAITH Not in the graveyard. Before that. I was kinda wearing a different body.
SPIKE Pity.
FAITH You seemed OK with it.
SPIKE The body swap. With Buffy.
FAITH She fill you in on that whole deal?
SPIKE She told me it went down. Failed to mention who was driving her skin around.
FAITH I may have said a few things...
SPIKE Like you could ride me at a gallop 'til my knees buckle, squeeze me 'til I pop like warm champagne. That's not the kind of thing a man forgets.
FAITH Should've known it wasn't blondie behind the wheel. She'd never throw down like that.
SPIKE Oh, you have been away.
FAITH Don't even tell me little Miss Tightly-Wound's been getting her naughty on?
SPIKE Not of late.
FAITH Wow. Everybody's just full of surprises. Hey, B.
BUFFY Well, it's nice to see you two getting along so well.
FAITH Yeah. Uh, you just know all the cool vampires.
BUFFY Yeah.
SPIKE Hey, aren't you usually at work 'bout now?
BUFFY I kind of decided to cut back on my hours.
DAWN Buffy? Is that you?
BUFFY Down here. Figured I'd be better off focusing on what's going on around here.
DAWN Buffy, Willow just called from the hospital. The girl's awake.
SHANNON He was a minister, or something... At least, he dressed like one. I thought he was trying to save me...at first.
BUFFY Hehe picked you up on the side of the road?
SHANNON Bringers were chasing me. He said they were his boys...right before he burned me.
SHANNON He wanted to tell you something. Before he...cut me...he told me to give the slayer a message.
BUFFY What is it?
SHANNON He said, I have something of yours.
BUFFY We've got a new player in town. Dresses like a preacher. Calls himself Caleb. Looks like he's working for the First. He's taunting us, calling us out. Says he's got something of mine. Could be another girl, could be something else. Don't know, don't care. I'm tired of talking. I'm tired of training. He's got something of mine? Fine. I'm getting it back, and you guys are coming with me.
CALEB You're searching for something, girl. What would that be now?
HELPLESS_GIRL Oh. You. I was looking for you.
CALEB Is that right?
HELPLESS_GIRL I heard you speakin' tonight. Preachin'. I felt your words go straight to me.
CALEB Well, the truth is like a sword, isn't it, girl? Cuts deep.
HELPLESS_GIRL Yeah.
CALEB The words I use got a power to them. A power, now. They're not just wordsthey're truth.
HELPLESS_GIRL They brought me here.
CALEB They called you. You know why? Because you're human. You got your urges. A woman's got hers. A man's got his. Our whole race can be do damnably weak... That's why we seek the strength, the power.
HELPLESS_GIRL It's not wrong to be drawn to the power, is it, preacher?
CALEB Oh, no, child. It's not wrong... Just human.
BUFFY/FIRST Most people don't like visits from their dead, you know.
CALEB Heathens. No appreciations for life's pleasures. Do it again.
BUFFY/FIRST I take requests. One of those potentials you killed, perhaps?
CALEB No, save them for later. I'm in more of an old memory lane kind of mood. Back before I met you, there was this choir girl in Knoxville I used to give singing lessons to...why, she even screamed on key. Show me her.
BUFFY/FIRST All these girls...they followed you willingly. You tricked them.
CALEB I only told them the truth. As for following, well, that seems to be what they do best.
BUFFY We need to start arming the girls. I wanna be ready to move when we find him.
WILLOW We don't even know where we're going.
BUFFY 'S why I figured we'd do a little recon first. You up for it?
FAITH Point me where you want me.
GILES And you're certain this is the best course of action? You don't even know what this man has of yoursif he, in fact, has anything.
BUFFY It could be a girl, a potential trying to get to us.
GILES Could be a stapler.
BUFFY Going in anyway.
GILES With the girls? Most of whom have yet to be in the field, let alone in a life or death situation.
BUFFY Then it's time we test them. Look, I'll just take the ones that have been here the longest. The rest can stay behind.
SPIKE Could be that's just what he wants you to dothe old bait-and-switch.
WILLOW Yeah, he lures us away and then kills the girls we leave behind.
BUFFY I know. That's why I need you to stay here with them. You're my most powerful weapon, Will. I know you can keep them safe if anything happens.
XANDER An unknown man breezes into town, says he has something of yours. Buffy, this thing's got trap written all over it.
BUFFY He won't be expecting a full attacknot this soon, that's why we have to move.
GILES We know nothing about this man. We cannot go into battle unprepared. We have to have more time.
BUFFY Giles, we don't have time. And you're not going into battle. I need you to stay behind with the others. Help the girls who still need a teacher.
FAITH No eyes, but look at him go. He got SONAR or something?
BUFFY Or something, I guess. Pretty good when they attack.
FAITH Do they just roam free around town?
BUFFY Well, normally, they show up out of nowhere, and then either stab or get stabbed, and then they run off. Looks like this guy wants to be found.
FAITH Lends weight to the whole it's a trap theory.
BUFFY I'm through waiting around for people to attack us.
FAITH Hey, I'm with you. Drop me in the hornet's nest, what the hell? You got a rough sitch here, trying to turn a bunch of little girls into an army...
BUFFY They're potential slayers, just like we were.
FAITH Right. Maybe they'll do as good as us.
BUFFY They're getting better.
FAITH I'll work with 'em. Some of 'em seem real eager. Fashion disasters, yeah, but they're ready to fight.
BUFFY Why did you come back?
FAITH Willow said you needed me. Didn't give it a lot of thought. Do youAm I getting you want me to be not here?
BUFFY No, that's not what I meant. I'm...glad that you're here. It's good. Thank you.
FAITH No problem. You know me. All about the good deeds.
BUFFY Willow said you helped out Angel.
FAITH Yeah. He says Hi.
BUFFY Really.
FAITH Sure.
BUFFY How is he?
FAITH Better. Had to do this whole magical mind-walk with him.
BUFFY You were in Angel's mind?
FAITH Buffy... What is this place?
BUFFY Look, there's more of them.
FAITH I think we just found our hornet's nest.
BUFFY Let's get the cavalry.
XANDER Now remember, we're looking for killing blows only, people. So, chest and throat if it's a vampire. Stomach, chest and face if it's a Bringer.
RONA What if it's something else?
XANDER Could happen. Something other-worldly. And here's a handy rule: don't go for the flashy tentacles just because they're waving 'em about trying to get attention. Go for the center brains, heart, eyes. Everything's got eyes.
DAWN Except the Bringers.
XANDER Except the Bringers.
MOLLY I don't want there to be tentacles. I'm not good with squishy.
KENNEDY I don't care if it's Godzilla. I want to get in this thing.
ANDREW Godzilla's mostly Tokyo-based, so he's probably a no-show.
AMANDA Besides, if Matthew Broderick can kill Godzilla, how tough is he?
ANDREW Xander...
XANDER Matthew Broderick did not kill Godzilla. He killed a big, dumb lizard. That was not the real Godzilla.
RONA You people are even crazier than her.
XANDER Than who?
RONA Buffy, man. I mean, taking us right into the bad guy's lair.
XANDER Well, that's where, generally speaking, you'd go to find the bad guy. And I don't think you came here to fight plaque.
RONA No, I came here for protection.
XANDER Well, you signed on to fight with
RONA Look, I know, but... this plan is trouble. OK, Buffy doesn't care how many of us she puts in danger
XANDER Let me tell you something about Buffy. In fact, you should all listen to this.
KENNEDY Uh, we kinda were.
XANDER I've been through more battles with Buffy than you all can ever imagine. She's stopped everything that's ever come up against her. She's laid down her lifeliterallyto protect the people around her. This girl has died two times, and she's still standing. You're scared? That's smart. You got questions? You should. But you doubt her motives, you think Buffy's all about the kill, then you take the little bus to battle. I've seen her heart, and this timenot literally. And I'm telling you, right now, she cares more about your lives than you will ever know. You gotta trust her. She's earned it.
FAITH Damn. I never knew you were that cool.
BUFFY Well, you always were a little slow.
FAITH I get that now.
BUFFY All right, let's saddle up.
BUFFY OK. Set up a perimeter. Guard the door. I don't want anything getting in behind us. My team goes in first, we check the place out. You guys are our safety-net. If this place is a trap, we give the signal, you guys come in, guns a-blazing.
XANDER So, what's the signal?
BUFFY I'm thinking lots and lots of yelling.
XANDER Got it.
BUFFY Shall we?
MOLLY What is this place?
BUFFY Looks like an old vineyard.
KENNEDY An evil vineyard, huh?
SPIKE Like Falcon Crest.
BUFFY Stay alert, you guys. Bringers are here somewhere. Just need to find out where.
SPIKE Shouldn't be too hard.
CALEB Well, now, you girls are just burning with righteousness, aren't you? Problem is, you think you're blazing like suns, when really you're burning like matchsticks in the face of the darkness. You having fun? Now, I hope my boys haven't worn you out too muchI need you fit for when I purify you.
BUFFY Save the sermon, padre. I heard you have something of mine.
CALEB Well, I do now. You liked my little message, did you? You know, I ruined a perfectly good knife on that girl. Got her soiled blood all over the place. I may have to get a new truck. So, you're the slayer. The slayer. The strongest, the fastest, the most aflame with that most precious invention of all mankindthe notion of goodness. The slayer must indeed be powerful. So, what else you got?
KENNEDY Let's go!
RONA Kennedy!
CALEB Miss, I do believe you have your own problems you should be worrying about.
CALEB Oh, good. There's more of you.
XANDER Buffy!
CALEB Well, you're the other one, aren't you. Your Cain to her Abel. No offense meant to Cain, of course.
FAITH Never was much for the good book.
CALEB Oh, it has its moments. Paul had some good stuff, for instance. But overall I find it a tad complicated Good folk, bad folk, clean folk, dirty folk...
MOLLY No...!
CALEB Yes.
BUFFY Xander, get them out of here. We have to retreat. Do it.
CALEB What can I say? I work in mysterious ways. Also some fairly straightforward ones.
SPIKE We're all leaving.
XANDER Are you OK? Let's go. Come on.
XANDER Let's go! Come on!
CALEB You're the one who sees everything, aren't you? Well, let's see what we can't do about that.
BUFFY Xander! Come on.
CALEB Now, it's a simple story. Stop me if you've heard it. I have found and truly believe that there is nothing so bad it cannot be made better with a story.
CALEB And this one's got a happy ending.
CALEB There once was a woman, and she was foul, like all women, for Adam's rib was dirtyjust like Adam himselffor what was he, but human.
CALEB But this woman, she was filled with darkness, despair, and why? Because she did not know. She could not see.
CALEB She didn't know the good news, the glory that was coming. That'd be you. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours, now and forever. You show up, they'll get in line.
CALEB 'Cause they followed her. And all they have to do is take one more step, and I'll kill them all. See? I told you it had a happy ending.
