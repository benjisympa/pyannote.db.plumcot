GILES Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer:
MAN What's goin' on?
GIRL Please get me out of here!
MAN_/_CALEB Call me Caleb. Never was nobody's daddy.
GIRL_/_SHANNON I'm Shannon.
CALEB Now, I want you to deliver a message for me. It's for the one and only, the original slayer.
FAITH Hey, got a spare bed for a wanted fugitive?
GILES Hello, Faith.
FAITH Well, I guess wanted wasn't really accurate.
BUFFY I have a mission to save the world. I don't have time for vendettas. The mission is what matters.
BUFFY I think you've taught me everything I need to know.
BUFFY Save the sermon, padre. I heard you have something of mine.
CALEB I do now.
MOLLY No...!
BUFFY Get them out of here.
CALEB I work in mysterious ways.
BUFFY Xander!
CLEM Hey, you.
BUFFY Hey.
CLEM Can you believe this mishegaas?
BUFFY Yeah. You'd think these people had never seen an apocalypse before. What about you? Just going for a quick spin to 7-Eleven... in Nebraska?
CLEM It's getting bad here. Really bad. Hellmouth acting up again, people feeling it, getting crazier. You can't swing a cat without hitting some kind of demonic activity. Not that I swing cats, or eatnope. Heh. Cuttin' way back. Cholesterolmorals. I mean, morals.
BUFFY Right.
CLEM We've seen some bad stuff in this town before but, you know, this time, it's like it just seems different, more powerful. I don't think anyone's gonna be able to stop it. I mean, I'm sure you'll do fine. Complete confidence in you. Heh. Uh, if anyone can do it, you can, because you...rock! If you save the world, I'll come back, we'll have drinks. When. When, I mean. When you save the world. It's gonna be great with all the... rocking. Maybe... maybe you should just get out of town this time.
BUFFY Yeah. I probably should.
CLEM You take care of yourself, OK? Bye.
GILES Ah, thank you, officer. Wewe appreciate your help.
OFFICER Oh, no, thank you, Inspector. We don't get a lot of contact with Interpol, so we're happy to help you with anything you need. Is there anything else we can help with?
WILLOW No. Thank you. We're fine.
OFFICER Right... because Wait... Who arewho are you?
WILLOW I'm with the Inspector.
OFFICER You're with the Inspector. Right. Well, we don't get a lot of contact with Interpol, so
CRAZY_CITIZEN A single step!
OFFICER_3 Stay on the sidewalk, folks.
CRAZY_CITIZEN A single step, and it is upon us. It is nigh! From beneath you it
OFFICER_2 Freakin' nutcase.
WILLOW Ow.
OFFICER Uh, people are acting up, getting nuts. Man, you just let us know if you need help with your guy 'cause we are itching to hand out some justice.
WILLOW Hehe doesn't seem like much of a threat.
OFFICER Andand you are?
GILES Um, I think it's time we were catching our flight to, um... Interpol.
OFFICER Right. OK.
WILLOW Good idea. My control was fading. What's up with those cops?
GILES Oh, same as everyone. The hellmouth is active again.
WILLOW Come on. I want to get back to Xander.
OFFICER_2 Who was that?
OFFICER Um, I I don't know.
OFFICER_3 Did you get one of these yet?
OFFICER No. What is that?
OFFICER_2 Fugitive. Ran to ground right here in our own backyard.
OFFICER Yeah? Sounds like a situation that needs some justice.
BUFFY And that you should expect to see some bruising when you remove the bandages. Bruising around the area. The, uh, bone structure and musculature was hit pretty hard.
XANDER OK.
BUFFY Um, also they said that thethe meds may cause you some stomach discomfort, so we're gonna have to be careful with your diet.
XANDER I can't taste anything right now anyway. I keep waiting for my other senses to improve 50%. Yeah, they should kick in any day now.
BUFFY Well, we're looking at a possible release as early as tonight. Um, we're just waiting for your labs to get back, and Dr. Kallet said that should be a couple of hours.
XANDER That's great.
BUFFY OK. Um, I think we're all caught up then. Thank you for this. This was, um, really great work.
WILLOW Oh. I thought we were gonna... There were gonna be card games.
BUFFY Oh, no, I just I should really get back. I want to get everyone started on this. I think we're really close to something.
XANDER It's OK. It's gotta be done. And I might see you tonight, without depth perception, of course, but... still.
WILLOW So, I guess you're stuck with me then, huh? Let's order some cherry-flavored off-brand gelatin, and then I think we'll be up for a rousing game of
XANDER I might need a parrot.
WILLOW Huh?
XANDER Well, to go with the eye patch, to really complete the look. I think I still have that costume from Halloween.
WILLOW Yeah, and don't underestimate the impact of a peg leg. Maybe the hospital can hook you up with a nice one. Maybe they have a 2-body-parts for the price of one kind of deal.
XANDER Oh, you know what the best part is? No one will ever make me watch jaws 3-D again.
WILLOW Yeah, and, you'll never have to...
XANDER Oh, Willow... please don't.
ANYA And so we know that a battle is coming. Ubervamps galore. We also know that the Ubervamps are hard to kill...
ANDREW Hard...to...kill.
ANYA But I have been out talking to some of my old contacts, and they've provided some surprising bits of news. Yay for them! Uh...OK. For example, Ubervamps can be staked... right through the heart. Zingpoof. Just like regular vamps. Um...we didn't know this. Of course, these guys have incredibly strong sternums, so it's a lot like driving a wooden stake through solid steel. But you guys are all super-strong, right?
KENNEDY Um...no.
ANYA Right. OK. Um... but still, heart information, still good to know since holy water seems to run off these guys like they've been scotch-guarded. And, well, sunlight would work, but guess what they're not coming out during the daytime. Uh, also, beware of their, uh, teeth and the claws they use to shred flesh.
RONA OK, you know what? I used to be really afraid of these Ubervamp guys. But then the scary preacher blew into town, and now I'm mostly terrified of him.
ANYA Right, well, um... we're working on getting info on that guy.
AMANDA Why bother? Nothing works. Nothing will.
ANYA OK... I know you're all upset... and I, myself, would much rather be sitting at the bedside of my one-eyed ex-fiance than killing time here with you people in this over-crowded and might I add increasingly ripe-smelling basement. And I would be, too, if not for a certain awkward discussion he and I recently had right over there on that cot immediately following some exciting and unexpected breakup sex. But...I need to give him some space... so I'm doing what I can do, contributing any way I can... and so will all of you. You still need to know this information. We can't stop just because something else is trying to kill you, too.
KENNEDY You got enough to share?
FAITH Trade ya for a carton of cigarettes and some soap. Sorry. Habit. Shouldn't you be down at Hogwarts?
KENNEDY Probably.
FAITH All right. Playin' hooky. Score one for the boarding school brat. Anya's technique's probably a little different than what you're used to.
AMANDA Do you think there are gonna be questions about her sex life on the test? 'Cause I really hope I don't have to study all that.
FAITH Yeah. Whenever she starts talking about getting all sweaty with Xander like that I just remind her I had him first. Shuts her right the hell up.
KENNEDY Thing is what's the point? Studying demon hot zones and pressure points doesn't do a hell of a lot of good when preacher man's out there, ready to finish the job he started.
FAITH No one's come up with any info on Caleb yet?
AMANDA No. Nothing is workingnot research, not Anya's contacts.
KENNEDY We're lousy with dead ends around here. Everyone's feeling pretty pointless. We don't even have a place to start.
BUFFY Hey, who's here?
DAWN Hey, Buffy, how's Xander?
BUFFY He's doing really well. He's ready to come home, I think.
FAITH Whatcha got?
BUFFY Info that Giles and Willow were able to pull off the police database. We figured with Caleb's, you know, overt religiosity thing if we wanna learn more about him, let's find out where he's been.
FAITH Incidents of violence and vandalism connected to California religious institutions in the last 10 years. Looks like this gives us a place to start.
BUFFY Yeah. I figure we start with California. We don't find anything there, we'll expand the search. But a guy like Caleb didn't just get in the game. He's been playing for a while, and I wanna know where. Whatever it takes. You good to help?
DAWN Well, I was gonna do lots and lots of homework, but darn the luck, they went and canceled school, so looks like I got the time.
BUFFY Good.
DAWN Hey, Buffy... How was Xander's mood, you know, exactly? And did you get a chance to talk to the doctor about the meds? Because it seemed like
FAITH Hey, pipsqueak, why don't you go get some of the stuff you've already gotten from Giles?
DAWN Or, um, we can talk about this later, maybe.
BUFFY OK.
DAWN Yeah. I'll be right back.
BUFFY Try to find anything that looks like Caleb, his church, his ring...
KENNEDY His ability to render a slayer useless in just one punch. I didn't that was stupid. I don't know why I said that.
BUFFY Uh, it's OK. Um...you know, II have to go to the school to pick up the rest of my stuff.
KENNEDY I really didn't mean
BUFFY It's fine. Really, it's fine. Don't worry about it. Hey, uh... isn't Anya doing that thing for you guys today?
KENNEDY Yeah. We were. We probably should head down there now.
BUFFY OK. I'll be back soon. See that everyone else gets started on this.
FAITH Yeah.
CALEB Oh, now, look... Things don't go exactly your way, so here come the waterworks. Ain't that just like a woman?
BUFFY Get out of here.
CALEB Now, now, little girl. Manners. I do imagine that firebrand tongue of yours has inflamed many a man, weak as they are. This here's a, uh... public school, ain't it? Kinda deserted. Only just, I suppose. Folks work so hard at keepin' the Lord out, and look what happens in return. He abandons you. Not that He could do you much good now, anyway Ah, ah, ah. Wouldn't do that were I you, swee'pea. Fightin' back didn't do you much good last time, did it? And how is poor, sweet Xander? Let him know he's in my prayers, and any time he's willin', I'm ready to... finish the job.
BUFFY Go near Xander again, and I will end you.
CALEB Mind your manners. I do believe I did warn you once. You're angry... frustrated, scared. I like that in a girl. You really should relax a little. Look at where you are. History's gonna look back at you, at me, at this place, and they're gonna see the glory. Great things are happenin' now, right here. This school, the seal... it's all gonna be a part of the great sweepin' tide of change, and you're gonna be a part of it. Now, why would you wanna miss that? More importantly, why would you want to get in its way?
BUFFY I guess I'm just ornery.
CALEB Ha ha ha! Oh, I knew you'd be a wild one
DAWN OK, well, here's the one that stood out. It's, um, a mission up north in Gilroy.
ANDREW Um, Mr. Giles, Faith stole the last meatball-and-mozzarella-flavored hot pocket out of the freezer even though I had called dibs on it.
GILES I don't see anything.
DAWN Exactly. No vandalism at all.
GILES Then why is it in the file?
DAWN The place was abandoned. Um... locals started noticing after a few days that no one was going in or out. 6 members of the order lived there, but when the cops showed up... all gone. Unsolved.
ANDREW Yup. See, the post-it's still here: Andrew's. Please do not eat. But the box is empty now.
GILES Oh.
DAWN Oh? Oh, good?
GILES Not sure. Here...
ANDREW See, it's not the hot pocket itself even though it did have that new-and-improved thicker tomato sauce it's just the fundamental lack of respect.
GILES Shut up. Pay attention. Dawn, what do you see?
DAWN What am I looking for?
GILES On the back wall, A... knothole.
DAWN That's not a knothole.
GILES Amanda, would you go down to the basement and get Spike?
DAWN Maybe this'll help...if this does bring us closer to Caleb.
FAITH Sounded like there was news.
SPIKE What's up... Rupert?
GILES Spike, I have a mission for you.
SPIKE Oh, really? 'Cause, you know, sometimes our missions end up with you trying to kill me. I'm not fond of those.
GILES This is bona fide... with real ramifications. Take a look at this.
SPIKE Looks like our boy's been here. You want me to go check it out?
GILES I need someone who can take care of themselves in case Caleb has... left some souvenirs.
ANDREW Are we gonna get to the food-stealing issue soon?
GILES Take Andrew.
ANDREW_&_SPIKE What?
DAWN Well, you are always saying you wanna get out of the house more.
ANDREW Yeah, but
GILES There may be demons... lurking about. You never know. He's a demon expert. He can help.
SPIKE Oh, please.
GILES Well, he can bring his pan flute thing along. Excellent. Off you go.
DAWN So, see? That's something, right? We'll have some news soon.
AMANDA Sure. Maybe that'll get us somewhere.
FAITH Maybe. In the meantime, the troops here gotta sit and stew, feeling crappier by the minute.
DAWN We should keep them occupied.
FAITH Yeah. I know how to keep them occupied.
NERF_HERDER Living on a wing and a prayer, out on the strip nobody cares. Scabbing off a valley chick, sleeping on the practice room floor. Pretty soon the record company will be banging on your door.
KENNEDY What kind of band plays during an apocalypse?
DAWN I think this band might actually be one of the signs.
NERF_HERDER Rock city news. You gotta pay your dues...
BUFFY Hey. Guys, how's it going?
GILES Buffy. Are you hurt?
BUFFY Oh... Caleb came back looking for seconds.
GILES My God, is h-he
BUFFY Still able to make me see cartoon birdies all around my head? You betcha. The short lack of consciousness was nice. I feel rested. So...how did those police files work out? Were they helpful?
GILES Uh...uh... yes. Very much so, I think. Um... there's evidence that Caleb may have established a foothold up north.
BUFFY That's great. That's
GILES I, um... I sent Spike to look into it.
BUFFY Spike? Is this a mission from which you intend Spike to return alive?
GILES Yes. I sent Andrew with him.
BUFFY Again I ask the question.
GILES Buffy, you weren't here. Decisions have to be made in your absence.
BUFFY Yeah, well, those are the ones that have been scaring me.
GILES I did what I thought was right.
BUFFY You sent away the one person that's been watching my backagain.
GILES We're all watching your back.
BUFFY Funny... that's not really what it feels like.
GILES Buffy
BUFFY Where did everybody go?
GILES What?
BUFFY Faith. The girls. Where are they?
GILES Um...Faith thought that the girls could do with some time off their studies. II thought...She took them to the Bronze.
CALEB You know what I figured out tonight? Every high school in this country, from one end to the other, smells exactly alike. Now, why do you suppose that is?
BUFFY/FIRST And how was our best girl?
CALEB They always think they should put up a fight.
BUFFY/FIRST Did you lay the proper groundwork?
CALEB That I did. Reckon she got the message, even if she doesn't know it yet. So now the big strong slayer goes back to those girls... she's just so ready to walk them right into it. And all we have to do is give her that one final gentle nudge.
BUFFY/FIRST Excellent.
AMANDA This is so cool. Buffy would never let us do this. You are so cool. This woman is so cool!
FAITH Hey, hey, how old are you?
AMANDA 17.
FAITH Yeah, we're gonna get you a real nice 7-up, OK?
FAITH Hey, I was wondering what was taking you boys so long. Where you been?
OFFICER We're gonna have to ask you to come with us, miss. Outstanding warrants.
FAITH Yeah, or we could try this one on instead. How 'bout you guys buy me another drink, and we see where the evening takes us.
DAWN Hey!
KENNEDY What's going on?
FAITH It's cool. I got it. It's nothin'. Getget off me.
OFFICER_4 Shut up.
FAITH I tell you right now, I'm not goin' back to jail.
OFFICER Who said anything about jail?
OFFICER Stay back. This doesn't concern you.
DAWN You can't keep us in here.
OFFICER It'll be over before you know it.
OFFICER Trust methe best thing you can do is wait here.
DAWN Don't listen to him. He won't hurt us. You know what? I'm just gonna go borrow the phone.
OFFICER Best thing you can do is wait... here.
KENNEDY You're gonna have to shoot us all to stop us.
OFFICER It doesn't really bother me.
RONA These cops are really gettin' hell mouth.
OFFICER Back up!
AMANDA No!
OFFICER What?
BUFFY Faith! What are you doing?
FAITH Just blowing off steam. Well, it started that way. Turned when the cops went evil on us.
BUFFY Girls, go home. I need to talk to Faith for a minute.
DAWN Buffy, we weren't
BUFFY Dawn you, too. Go. What is this?
FAITH They needed a break, all right? They've been running themselves into the ground. Things just got out of hand.
BUFFY Taking a break is one thingI get blowing off steambut they were fighting. And those girls were drunk! What were you thinking?!
FAITH Seemed like a good idea at the time.
BUFFY Yeah, what if someone had gotten hurt?
FAITH They didn't.
BUFFY Faith, I need to know that these girls are gonna be safe when I'm not around.
FAITH No one got hurt, B. Look, you don't even know these girls. Maybe you should have a little more confidence in 'em, let them mess up sometimes, you know, get down and dirty. How the hell else are they gonna learn?
BUFFY Learning from your mistakes is one thing. But you don't throw children into
FAITH They're not children.
BUFFY That really isn't the point.
FAITH Yeah, what about the vineyard?
BUFFY What?
FAITH How safe were they when you dragged them off to meet Caleb? How safe was Rona or Amanda or Molly?
ANDREW You sure you don't wanna stop and pick up some burgers or something, you know, road trip food?
SPIKE It's not a road trip. It's a covert operation.
ANDREW Right. Right. Gotcha. II bet even covert operatives eat curly fries. They're really good.
SPIKE Not as good as those onion blossom things.
ANDREW Ooh, I love those.
SPIKE Yeah, me, too.
ANDREW It's an onion... and it's a flower. II don't understand how such a thing is possible.
SPIKE See, the genius of it is you soak it in ice water for an hour so it holds its shape. Then you deep-fry it root-side up for about 5 minutes.
ANDREW Masterful.
SPIKE Yeah. Tell anyone we had this conversation, I'll bite you.
ANDREW Right.
ROBIN_WOOD The big meeting hasn't started yet, has it?
FAITH God, I hope so.
ROBIN_WOOD Faith?
FAITH You must be Principal Wood. Heard a lot about you.
ROBIN_WOOD It hasn't really started yet, has it? 'Cause I, uh... I hate being late.
FAITH Troops are still gathering. I think you're safe.
ROBIN_WOOD Looks like someone banged you up pretty well.
FAITH Yeah. Cops. Mostly.
ROBIN_WOOD Mostly?
FAITH Yeah. This one's from someone who just thinks she's a cop. It's my favorite of all my current bruises.
ROBIN_WOOD So someone who thinks she's a cop, huh? You gonna have to, like...ice her now or something like that?
FAITH I'm not gonna kill her. Wanted to, but didn't. By the way, bully for me since no one else said it.
ROBIN_WOOD For what? For not killing Buffy?
FAITH It's this new thing I'm tryin'.
ROBIN_WOOD She told me about you.
FAITH Believe every word.
ROBIN_WOOD So what changed? I mean... why didn't you fight back?
FAITH Other things matter more.
ROBIN_WOOD I think you're worried about her.
FAITH I think you need to brush up on your Buffy and Faith history.
ROBIN_WOOD All right, if you say so. But I read people pretty well. It's a thing I do.
FAITH You, uh, live around here, right?
ROBIN_WOOD Uh, no, not exact Well, it's the center of town, really.
FAITH This town, walking anywhere after dark is like an extreme sport. Someone who didn't know you very well might think you were out lookin' for a fight or something. Maybe you got bigger issues than what's wrong with B. I read people, too. Xander's home.
ANDREW No one's here. These kinda places make me feel funny inside.
SPIKE I'll buy that. You and me got something else in common after all.
ANDREW Spike!
XANDER Oh, God.
KENNEDY We didn't have time to do more. You have to pretend there's a big party here.
XANDER That's fine. Parties in this house, I usually end up having to... rebuild something.
BUFFY Welcome home, Xander. I wanted you to be here for this. I think you'll be interested in what I found out.
WILLOW W-what did you find out?
BUFFY I-it's about the cellar. Look, I know that night wasn't fun for any of us... but I figured out some things about that place, and I realize now what we have to do. We're going back in.
SPIKE Tell me about the mark.
MONK Oh...
SPIKE Hey! Are you part of Caleb's faction?
MONK No! No!
SPIKE Then tell me what happened.
MONK I c-can't.
ANDREW Can't is a 4-letter word! I'm Andrew. I'll be your bad cop this evening. You don't start singing, my associate here
SPIKE We're trying to fight him. Caleb. We need your help.
MONK You can't fight him. You can't stop him. You can only run.
ANDREW Run is a 4-letter wor A 3-letter word.
SPIKE Talk.
MONK I'll do better. I'll show you. One night, some time ago, a man arrived at our doors.
SPIKE And you said, come in, do some damage?
MONK We arewe are a benevolent order, and, yes, we welcomed him. We offered to feed him... but he had come for something else.
MONK Behind this, he revealed something even we didn't know was here. A secret room. He was excited, talking the whole time... destiny, that sort of thing.
SPIKE Yeah. We hear he's a real smooth talker.
MONK He was going on about this ancient inscription.
ANDREW Neat.
MONK He read it... and he didn't like what it said. His temper... He was the purest evil I've ever seen. He burned his mark upon me. And then I ran and I hid... and I listened to the others die.
ANDREW Running away...saved your life. What does it say?
SPIKE It is not for thee. It is for her alone to wield.
BUFFY Look, I know what you're thinking, but I had a visit at the school today from Caleb.
DAWN Buffy, why didn't you
BUFFY I'm fine. I mean, it wasn't fun, but I'm fine. I'm better than fine. II figured something out. He kept making all this noise about the school.
ROBIN_WOOD Is it that seal again?
WILLOW Do we need to try shutting it again?
BUFFY No, that's just it. We've spent all this time worrying about the seal and the hellmouth. Why isn't Caleb guarding them? Why doesn't he have someone there protecting it? Why is he camped out at the vineyard? The bad guys always go where the power is. So if the seal was so important to Caleb and the First, they would be there right now. They're protecting the vineyard or something at the vineyard. I say it's their power, and I say it's time we go in and take it away from them.
FAITH Or, in the alternative, how 'bout...we don't? I mean, it's a neat theory, B, but I'm not going back in that place, not without proof, and neither should you and neither should they.
BUFFY I'm not saying it's gonna be easy.
ROBIN_WOOD I think Faith had the floor.
FAITH Maybe it ends OK the way you wanna play it, but maybe it doesn't. And right now, I don't think I want you playin' the odds.
BUFFY Did you come here to fight?
FAITH Listen, we're fighters, all of us, but you gotta give me something to fight, something real, not
GILES Windmills.
BUFFY There is something there.
GILES Maybe. But we can't be sure of that. This is a hell of a lot to ask.
ROBIN_WOOD Too much.
BUFFY II don't understand this. For 7 years, I've kept us safe by doing this exactly this, making the hard decisions. And now, what suddenly you're all acting like you can't trust me?
GILES Didn't you say to me today you can't trust us? Maybe there's something there that should be addressed.
BUFFY Is that why you sent Spike away, to ambush me?
GILES Oh, come on.
RONA You know what? I am sick of your deal with this Spike guy. This isn't about him. This is about you. You're being reckless.
BUFFY What?
RONA You are! I don't even know you, and I can tell! You are so obsessed with beating Caleb, you are willing to jump into any plan without thinking.
BUFFY That's not what I'm doing.
KENNEDY Well, that's how it feels to us. People are dying.
WILLOW Kennedy...
KENNEDY Why are you always standing up for her?
WILLOW I'm not.
BUFFY What do you mean, you're not?
WILLOW With everything that's happened, I I'm worried about your judgment.
BUFFY Look, I wish this could be a democracy. I really do. Democracies don't win battles. It's a hard truth, but there has to be a single voice. You need someone to issue orders and be reckless sometimes and not take your feelings into account. You need someone to lead you.
ANYA And it's automatically you. You really do think you're better than we are.
BUFFY No, I
ANYA But we don't know. We don't know if you're actually better. I mean, you came into the world with certain advantages, sure. I mean, that's the legacy.
BUFFY I
ANYA But you didn't earn it. You didn't work for it. You've never had anybody come up to you and say you deserve these things more than anyone else. They were just handed to you. So that doesn't make you better than us. It makes you luckier than us.
BUFFY I've gotten us this far.
XANDER But not without a price.
BUFFY Xander
XANDER I'm trying to see your point here, Buff... but I guess it must be a little bit to my left... 'cause I just don't.
BUFFY Look, I'm willing to talk strategy, OK, I'll hear suggestions on how to break this down, but this is the plan. We have to be together on this or we will fail again.
GILES We are clearly demonstrating that we are not together on this!
BUFFY Which is why you have to fall in line! I'm still in charge here.
RONA Why is that, exactly?
BUFFY Because I'm the slayer.
RONA And isn't Faith a slayer, too?
FAITH What? Whoa, whoa, whoa. So not what I meant. I'm not in charge chick. I think B here needs to just...chill out for a little bit, take a siesta or something. But I'm not the one you want.
KENNEDY Maybe we need a vote... to see who wants Faith to have a turn in charge.
BUFFY No.
KENNEDY No, what?
BUFFY No. You don't get to vote until I've had my chance to pal around, you know, get everybody drunk. See, I didn't get this was a popularity contest. I should have equal time to bake them cookies, braid their hair
FAITH Learn their names?
BUFFY You're just lovin' this, aren't you?
FAITH You have no idea what I'm feeling.
BUFFY Come in here, take everything that I have... You did it before. Did you tell them that? Did you tell them how you used to kill people for fun? Hey, you guys think that's nifty?
GILES Buffy, that's enough!
FAITH I didn't come here to take anything away from you, but I'm not gonna be your little lapdog, either. I came here to beat the other guy, to do right, however it works. I don't know if I can lead. But the real question is...can you follow?
ROBIN_WOOD So we vote.
BUFFY Wait. Guys
DAWN Then you can't stay here. Buffy, I love you, but you were right. We have to be together on this. You can't be a part of it. So I need you to leave. I'm sorry, but this is my house, too.
RONA Ding dong, the witch is dead.
DAWN Shut your mouth.
FAITH Hey. Look, I swear I didn't want it to go this way
BUFFY Don't.
FAITH I mean it, I
BUFFY Don't...be afraid to lead them. Whether you wanted it or not, their lives are yours. It's only gonna get harder. Protect them, but lead them.
