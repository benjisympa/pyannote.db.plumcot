GILES Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer:
FAITH Hey, got a spare bed for a wanted fugitive?
GILES Hello, Faith.
FAITH You got a rough sitch here, trying to turn a bunch of little girls into an army...
BUFFY They're potential slayers, just like we were.
CALEB Call me Caleb.
BUFFY I heard you have something of mine.
CALEB I do now.
MOLLY No...!
CALEB I work in mysterious ways.
BUFFY Xander!
ANYA Look, I'm not saying it's a happy scenario, but we're dealing with a Big Bad that can be any dead person it wants.
CALEB At long last.
BUFFY/FIRST The slayer.
BUFFY We've spent all this time worrying about the seal and the hellmouth. The bad guys always go where the power is. They're protecting the vineyard or something at the vineyard. And I say it's time we go in and take it away from them.
FAITH How 'bout...we don't?
GILES This is a hell of a lot to ask.
BUFFY And now, what? Suddenly you're all acting like you can't trust me?
DAWN We have to be together on this. You can't be a part of it. So I need you to leave.
FAITH Look, I swear I didn't want it to go this way
BUFFY Don't.
BUFFY Whether you wanted it or not, their lives are yours.
GILES Power to the people? You sound like a child of the seventies.
KENNEDY What we're saying is we're in charge in charge of ourselves.
FAITH OK, you guys, let's just try not to freak out.
KENNEDY All I'm saying is now that Buffy's not here, we finally have some say in how and when we lose our necks.
ROBIN Maybe you don't have to be so blunt about the losing of the necks bit.
ANYA No, let the girl speak the truth. We're all on death's door repeatedly ringing the doorbell like maniacal girl scouts trying to make quota.
XANDER You know, I'm thinking that everyone here shouldn't have a say.
GILES We just have to find some way of having constructive dialogue without going completely mad.
AMANDA Do you know the parliamentary procedure? 'Cause that's a convenient way of organizing
KENNEDY I just wonder if those of us who have been here longer should have more of a say.
ROBIN Maybe we should break down into small groups so it wouldn't be so chaotic. Faith, what do you think?
AMANDA When I was involved with the Model UN, we found the parliamentary procedure to be a total lifesaver. For example, once when I was Uruguayanyway, one of those U countriesit was like here, only we had this system which allowed us to organize our conversation.
GILES She's going to be fine. Really, it's for the best.
DAWN Yeah? Then why do I feel like this?
FAITH I hear what you're saying, but
KENNEDY Shouldn't we get down to business?
WILLOW You guys, I think we're wasting time arguing about how to argue.
AMANDA Well, why don't we?
VI Please do not mention parliamentary procedure.
CARIDAD I second that.
FAITH Everyone, listen to me. Chill. All right? It's been a long night, and I don't know about you, but I'm wiped. Maybe we should catch some sleep and figure all this out in the morning.
KENNEDY Do we really have time to waste?
FAITH Look, I understand you guys are wicked stressed. Frankly, our situation blows. We've got to stay cool. That's the only way we're going to get through this. Can everyone handle that?
VI Yeah...yeah...we'll get some rest and then tomorrow, things won't seem so
CARIDAD The lights went out?
AMANDA I'll get some candles... if we have candles.
KENNEDY I'll check the fuse box.
FAITH Don't bother. All the lights on the whole street just went out.
KENNEDY Which means?
FAITH That the people from the power company have got the hell out of Sunnydale.
VI I think I'm freaking out.
MAN Don't move. Get out of my house.
BUFFY Hey. I thought the place would be empty. I was looking for a place to crash. You know, you really should leave.
MAN You can't just kick me out of my own house.
BUFFY Why not? It's what all the cool kids are doing nowadays. This is not your house. It's not your town. Not anymore. Got any Tab?
ANDREW I spy with my little eye something that begins with a T.
SPIKE Tapestry.
ANDREW Hey, good one. How did you
SPIKE Tapestry's the only thing in the whole bloody room.
ANDREW Ah...so say you, but I say look deeper.
SPIKE I'll look deep into your jugular is what I'll look at.
ANDREW Don't spazz out.
SPIKE I'm not Don't say another word.
ANDREW Rock, paper, scissors?
SPIKE What's the matter with you? Don't you understand what's happening?
ANDREW Uh...yeah. We're waiting here till it's night again so you can ride on your motorcycle without exploding.
SPIKE And every minute we're stuck here, the slayer's out there facing hell knows what.
ANDREW Come on. What's the worst thing that could happen to her?
FAITH All right. So, what do we know?
XANDER Well, we know we're basically the last humans left in Sunnydale.
CARIDAD And that all the evil in town wants us dead.
VI I don't want to die.
ANYA Don't worry. It's far more likely you'll live long enough to watch most of your friends die first. And then you'll die.
KENNEDY We also know that Caleb told Buffy that everything's going down at the seal. I think we should head
FAITH Let's not get ahead of ourselves. So, we know we've got a lot of enemies. We'll start there.
KENNEDY Faith, I'm sorry
FAITH I got this, OK? So let's go over our rogues' gallery. Who exactly do we have here?
DAWN Well, there's the First, who we can't touch.
XANDER Then there's our friend the reverend I-hate-women.
ANYA Who's basically untouchable.
DAWN There's the 'roid-rage vamps, who are pretty much the worst. And the
FAITH Bringers...I think they're our weakest link.
GILES Are you thinking of attacking the Bringers?
FAITH Maybe, or... OK, we could kidnap one.
KENNEDY And what? Hold it ransom?
XANDER Yeah, I'll get the magazines and start ripping out the letters now. Dear Mr. First, if you want your Bringer back... well, we'll be surprised because you got, like, 3 million of them. So please disregard this letter. Yours sincerely
FAITH I'm saying we think about getting us a Bringer and making it talk. Find out info on the first and Caleb that way.
ROBIN How do you think we should catch one if they don't want to be found?
KENNEDY OK, I'm not sure this is such a good idea. Why try and get information when we already know about the seal? Why don't we send a team to the high school? Do some recon and
FAITH No.
KENNEDY Just like that? You're not even listening.
WILLOW Sweetie, you're pushing too hard.
KENNEDY I thought things would be different now, but you keep shutting me down.
FAITH Things are different, because now... I'm your boss. Look, you guys, I'm not Buffy. I'm not the one who's been on your asses all this time, but I'm not one of you anymore, either. I'm your leader, which means I go first, and I make the rules, and the rest of you follow after me. Is that clear? So, Kennedy, back the hell off, and let me do my job, all right? OK, let's get down to business.
BUFFY/FIRST I was hoping you'd bring me some better news.
CALEB And I wish I had some.
BUFFY/FIRST Is this going to do anything? Or is all of this just to make the Bringers sweat? Do the Bringers sweat?
CALEB Actually, I think they pant, like dogs. And I don't know if this is going to do any good, but we have to try everything.
BUFFY/FIRST You realize what will happen if the slayer and her girls get it, don't you?
CALEB They won't.
BUFFY/FIRST That's right. They won't. Because you're going to kill all of them and everyone they know.
CALEB Hallelujah.
KENNEDY I've never been the bait before. That was, uh... actually, kind of scary.
CARIDAD We had your back.
GILES You did well. Your performance as a disgruntled minion was spot on.
KENNEDY I'm method. Let's get this back to the captain.
DAWN Oh, hey. So?
GILES Uh, the Bringer's dumb.
ANYA You were expecting, what, a Rhodes Scholar?
GILES Dumb as in mute.
FAITH Someone ripped out its tongue.
AMANDA Oh, gross.
DAWN Hey...I've been reading this old Turkish spell book. There's an old conjuration that the ancient Turks used to communicate with the dying.
WILLOW Oh, yeah. I think I've read a translation of it.
DAWN There's a translation of it?! I'm over it. Um, so the spell is used to communicate with people who can't talk. Um, like if a person was dying, this spell would let them say their good-byes or, you know, gripe about how nobody came to visit them. Would this help us with Mr. No-Tongue?
WILLOW Yeah, I think so. I just need to get together a few ingredients.
FAITH All right. Well, cool. While Willow does that, the rest of us can
ANDREW We're back!
GILES Spike.
SPIKE Hey.
ANDREW Hi, everybody. I missed you guys a lot. Sorry it took so long to get back from our mission-mission, but we had to wait out the sun. Well, I think our mission went very well. We, uh, we rode on Spike's hog, which was very cool, and, uh... uh, played some amusing games, andoh! We got some new information. You know what? I really need to urinate.
SPIKE He's a breath of fresh air, isn't he? Thank god I don't breathe. So, I think we got a lead. Where's Buffy?
DAWN Um... she's not here right now.
SPIKE When's she get back?
WILLOW Uh...while you were gone, we all got together and t-talked out some disagreements that we were having. Um... and eventually, after much discussion, Buffy decided that it would be best for all of us if she took a little time off, a little breather.
SPIKE Uh-huh. I see. Been practicing that little speech long, have you? So, uh, Buffy took some time off right in the middle of the apocalypse, and it was her decision?
XANDER Well, we all decided.
SPIKE Oh, yeah. You all decided. You sad, sad, ungrateful traitors. Who do you think you are?
WILLOW We're her friends. We just want
SPIKE Oh, that's ballsy of you. You're her friends, and you betray her like this?
GILES You don't understand
SPIKE You know, I think I do... Rupert. You used to be the big man, didn't you? The teacher all full of wisdom. Now she's surpassed you, and you can't handle it. She has saved your lives again and again. She's died for you. And this is how you thank
FAITH Hey. Why don't you take it down a notch or two? The time for speech-giving is over, bat boy.
SPIKE Oh, is that right?
FAITH Yeah, that's right. Save your lack of breath.
SPIKE All right.
FAITH You're pretty sweet on her, aren't you? I think it's cute. They way she's got you whipped.
GILES Enough!
SPIKE Finally got what you wanted, didn't you? Where is she?
FAITH I don't know.
WILLOW Speak to us.
ANDREW Maybe I should rough him up a little.
XANDER Andrew!
KENNEDY Quiet!
WILLOW I don't know, guys. That should have worked.
ANDREW I am a drone in the mind that is evil.
XANDER Could you just shut up?
ANDREW I say I'm part of the great darkness.
KENNEDY Somebody needs a reality check.
XANDER Or a muzzle.
GILES Wait.
ANDREW I'm only a fragment of the we. We work as one to serve the First.
WILLOW OK, what do youthe wedo for the First?
ANDREW We work to prepare for the inevitable battle.
KENNEDY How? Tell me exactly what the Bringers are doing.
GILES Kennedy, he can't see the knife.
ANDREW We can feel the knife.
GILES Kennedy?
ANDREW We attend to the needs of the infinite evil. We exterminate girls and destroy the legacy of the slayer. We build an arsenal beneath the dirt. We obey the commands of our teacher Caleb.
XANDER Wait. Could we go back to the dirt thing?
ANDREW We build weapons to prepare for the coming war... at the farthest edge of town. We are everywhere. We are like the ocean's waves. We watch your efforts and are not scared. We will laugh at you as you die.
ANDREW What the bananas?! You are so lucky that you did not just... magically decapitate me.
GILES We've got enough here. We need to get Faith in on this. Xander, gather some maps. We need to find a subterranean space large enough to house an armory.
ANDREW I feel used and violated, and... I need a lozenge.
SPIKE There you are. Do you realize I could just walk in here, no invite needed? This town really is theirs now, isn't it? I heard. I was over there. That bitch. She's all about smiles and reformation when you're on your feet, but the moment you're down, she's all about the kicking, isn't that right? Makes me want
BUFFY It wasn't just Faith. It was all of them. And it's not like they were wrong. Please leave.
SPIKE No. This'll change your tune. I came here 'cause I got something to tell you. You were right. Caleb is trying to protect something from you. And I think you were spot on all the way. I think it's at the vineyard. So? You were right. Buffy?
BUFFY I don't feel very right.
SPIKE You're not fooling me.
BUFFY What do you even mean?
SPIKE Well, you're not a quitter.
BUFFY Watch me.
SPIKE You were their leader, and you still are. This isn't something you gave up, it's something they took.
BUFFY And the difference is?
SPIKE We can take it back.
FAITH Sewer tunnel on the north side's closest, so guess we'll start there.
GILES Sounds fine. What time shall I tell everyone?
FAITH How about around 7:00? 7:00 sharp. So, tomorrow we fight.
GILES Tomorrow. Good night, Faith. Faith.
FAITH Yeah?
GILES You're doing just fine.
MAYOR/FIRST I'd say better than fine. I'd say you're doing a bang-up job.
FAITH Get out.
MAYOR/FIRST Well, gosh. I think, you know, a hello or a nice to see you might be a little more welcome. It's the end of humanity, Faith, not the end of courtesy.
FAITH You're wasting your time. I know who you are, what you are.
MAYOR/FIRST Yeah. Yeah. Nobody's explained to you how this works, have they? You see... I am part of the First, as you kids call it, but I'm also me, Richard Wilkins III, late mayor and founder of Sunnydale. Here. I'll prove it to you. Ask me a question only I know the answer to. Something like... Where did I hide the moon pies in my office? Or... who was my favorite character in little women? Meg. I know. I know. Most people guess Beth, but Meg, she's such a proper young lady. Remember when Jo burned her hair?
FAITH I know what you're doing, and it's not going to work. But feel free to keep talking, 'cause, hell, I could listen to you yap all night.
MAYOR/FIRST Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Language! You're a leader now. You keep throwing the h-e-double hockey sticks around, pretty soon, the girls are going to pick up on it. Then what?
FAITH You let me worry about the girls.
MAYOR/FIRST Of course. Of course. You're doing a great job with them, by the way. Much better than Buffy ever did. You were smart to kick her out.
FAITH That's not what we Buffy got them this far.
MAYOR/FIRST Why are you protecting her? You think she cares about you? She nearly killed you, Faith.
FAITH It's different now.
MAYOR/FIRST No matter what you do, Buffy will always see you as a killer, not as a person. And now you have what she so desperately wants: the respect of these girls. All she needs is an excuse, and she'll finish what she started when she stuck that knife in your belly. You stay on guard, Faith. Buffy's dangerous. If you're not careful, she'll destroy you. I'm just saying.
SPIKE No?
BUFFY No.
SPIKE You mean no as in eventually?
BUFFY You really have problems with that word, don't you?
SPIKE You can get them back.
BUFFY Can, maybe. Should? I'm just so tired.
SPIKE They need you.
BUFFY Well, I...
SPIKE It's bloody chaos over there without you.
BUFFY It is?
SPIKE Yeah! Yeah, it's, uh... There's junk... You know? Food cartons, sleeping bags not rolled up, everyone's very scared and, uh, unkempt.
BUFFY Sounds dire.
SPIKE I didn't see a lot. I came, hit Faith a bunch of times, and left.
BUFFY Really? I mean, not that I'm glad, but
SPIKE Oh, you say the word, and she's a footnote in history. I'll make it look like a painful accident.
BUFFY That's my problem. I say the word, some girl dies...every time.
SPIKE There's always casualties in war.
BUFFY Casualties. It just sounds so...casual. These are girls that I got killed. I cut myself off from them...all of them. I knew I was gonna lose some of them and I didn't You know what? I'm still making excuses. I've always cut myself off. I've always Being the slayer made me different. But it's my fault I stayed that way. People are always trying to connect to me, and I just slip away. You should know.
SPIKE I seem to recall a certain amount of connecting.
BUFFY Oh, please! We were never close. You just wanted me because I was...unattainable.
SPIKE You think that's all that was?
BUFFY Please, let's not go over the past.
SPIKE Oh, no, no. Let's hold on here. I'm hummed along to your pity-ditty, and I think I should have the mic for a bit.
BUFFY Fine. The stage is yours. Cheer me up.
SPIKE You're insufferable.
BUFFY Thank you. That really helped.
SPIKE I'm not trying to cheer you up.
BUFFY What are you trying to say?
SPIKE I don't know. I'll know when I'm done saying it. Something pissed me off, and I just Unattainable. That's it.
BUFFY Fine. I'm attainable. I'm an attain-a-thon. May I please just go to sleep?
SPIKE You listen to me. I've been alive a bit longer than you, and dead a lot longer than that. I've seen things you couldn't imagine, and done things I prefer you didn't. I don't exactly have a reputation for being a thinker. I follow my blood, which doesn't exactly rush in the direction of my brain. So I make a lot of mistakes, a lot of wrong bloody calls. A 100+ years, and there's only one thing I've ever been sure of: you. Hey, look at me. I'm not asking you for anything. When I say, I love you, it's not because I want you or because I can't have you. It has nothing to do with me. I love what you are, what you do, how you try. I've seen your kindness and your strength. I've seen the best and the worst of you. And I understand with perfect clarity exactly what you are. You're a hell of a woman. You're the one, Buffy.
BUFFY I don't wanna be the one.
SPIKE I don't wanna be this good looking and athletic. We all have crosses to bear. You get some rest now. I'll check in before first light. You can decide how you want...
BUFFY Spike? Could you...stay here?
SPIKE Sure. That diabolical old torture device, the comfy chair. It'll do me fine.
BUFFY No, I mean...here. Will you just hold me?
MAYOR/FIRST Deep down, you always wanted Buffy to accept you, to love you even. Why do you think that is?
FAITH You a shrink now?
MAYOR/FIRST You keep looking for love and acceptance from these people, these friends of yours, but you're never gonna find it. The truth is, nobody will ever love you. Not the way I love you.
FAITH Get out.
MAYOR/FIRST They'll forever see you as a killer.
FAITH I said get out.
MAYOR/FIRST I'll always be with you, firecracker, in everything you do.
ROBIN Faith?
FAITH You shouldn't sneak up like that! I almost took your head off!
ROBIN Sorry, I knocked.
FAITH Whowhat'd you see?
ROBIN Justyou're looking spooked. What happened? Are you sure you're all right?
FAITH Oh, what? You wanna rap about my problems now? Are you looking to be the guy who puts the pal in principal for me?
ROBIN OK, you know what? I came up here to talk to you about weapons.
FAITH Sorry. I don't know what I'm doing. I'm just
ROBIN Listen, I'm gonna leave you alone. I didn't mean to intrude.
FAITH It was the First.
ROBIN Well, you're really in the game now, Faith. The First doesn't show itself unless it thinks you matter.
FAITH Lucky me. I'm a player. Man, look at that. My hand's shaking. Demons, vampires, women in the penitentiary systemnone of that freaks me out.
ROBIN That's exactly what the First doesfinds your Achilles' heel.
FAITH Nah, it just talked to me. What? It does a heal thing too?
ROBIN Um, it's a phrase. Your weak spot.
FAITH Oh, school thing. I was kinda absent that decade.
ROBIN So, who was it? The First.
FAITH He was like an old boss of mine.
ROBIN Just a boss, and he's got you shaking like this? Wouldn't give you a raise, huh?
FAITH Yeah, right. Well, it sounds retarded, but he was like a dad to me.
ROBIN Oh. It was my mother when it came to me. And I mean it was her, right down to the perfume.
FAITH Sorry.
ROBIN Yeah.
FAITH I'm just so pissed off at myself. I knew it was a trick.
ROBIN Yeah, so did I, but I still wanted my mother to hold me like a little baby in a manly way, of course.
FAITH Of course.
ROBIN Listen, nobody wants to be alone, Faith. We all want someone who cares, to be touched that way. I mean, the First deals in figments, but that wanting is real.
FAITH Hitting things and a whole lot of Jack D dulls it some.
ROBIN Among other things.
FAITH When it came to you, did the First tell the truth?
ROBIN Yeah.
FAITH It said to watch out for Buffy, that Buffy's dangerous.
ROBIN Well, what do you think?
FAITH Could be. I mean, we've given her pretty good reason to be pissed off. You know the messed up thing? The First is telling me to worry about her, and I just wish she was here. In a couple hours, I'm gonna lead these girls into some serious crap, and she's the only one
ROBIN She's not the only one. You're a slayer too, Faith, and I think you're a good leader.
FAITH I'm an ex-con who didn't finish high school.
ROBIN Yeah, well I'm the principal of a school where nobody finished, and I am completely out of my league in this.
FAITH Well, I hear otherwise.
ROBIN So, um, tomorrow then?
FAITH Forget about tomorrow. This is tonight. It's been a while. Am I out of line?
ROBIN No. You're the leader.
WILLOW OK, guys. Giles said Faith wants us to start early in the morning, so What happened to the girls?
KENNEDY Looks like there's only one girl here.
WILLOW What about the other ones with their sleeping bags and their headgear and their snoring? They're not here, are they?
KENNEDY Nope.
WILLOW Well that's nice.
KENNEDY Nice... and necessary. Come here, you. Foreplay was threatening to turn into twelve-play. Something not right?
WILLOW No. No, I just, uh, guess I'm a little scared.
KENNEDY It's probably stupid to ask why, huh? Death, war, apocalypse.
WILLOW Me. I'm just scared that if we... and then I'll... and then...
KENNEDY And then? Isn't that the good part?
WILLOW Good. Yeah, g-good feeling, but also...
KENNEDY Bad stuff, like unrestrained moaning and screaming with joy?
WILLOW Well, sort of. The unrestrained part. But I've justI've kind of been in this space where I should be restrained. I've been controlling myself and I if I lose that control, let myself go, I could just go.
KENNEDY Hm. You worried you're gonna turn into big bad Willow?
WILLOW It's not stupid. When we first kissed, I turned into...Warren.
KENNEDY It's not stupid, but it's not gonna happen. I just want you to know you're safe with me.
WILLOW Yeah?
KENNEDY You can float around, and I'll tether you down.
WILLOW You'll be likelike my kite string?
KENNEDY Mm-hmm. You'll be a kite, and I'll be your kite string, OK?
WILLOW OK.
KENNEDY OK. Mmm...come here.
ANYA They could show a little respect, you know.
XANDER Hm.
ANYA I mean, they should at least acknowledge the fact that some people might not want to listen to an a capella concert of people, you know, moaning and groaning.
XANDER Hm.
ANYA Disgusting is what it is.
XANDER Little jealous, huh?
ANYA Of course I am. I'm a lot jealous. I mean, if we're done having sex, then... I think other people should just knock it off.
BUFFY/FIRST I envy them. Isn't that the strangest thing?
CALEB Well, it does throw me a tad. I mean, they're justwhy, they're barely more than animals. Feeding off each other's fleshit's nauseating. But you. You're everywhere. You're in the hearts of little children. You're in the souls of the rich. You're the fire that makes people kill and hate. The fire that will cure the world of weakness. They're just sinners. You are sin.
BUFFY/FIRST I do enjoy your sermons.
CALEB And you're in me. Give me strength no man can have.
BUFFY/FIRST And the only man strong enough to be my vessel, and I know you feel me, but I know why they grab at each other. To feel. I want to feel. I want to wrap my hands around some innocent neck and feel it crack.
CALEB Amen.
ANDREW So, it turned out that all these stone tablets basically said the same thing. The First and Caleb are protecting something, andand we don't know exactly what it is, but it's something powerful, and they don't want the slayers to get it. I'm thinking it could be a weapon, and if we're looking for an arsenal
FAITH You're not coming.
ANDREW If one is looking for an arsenal, what better place to find a
FAITH Weapon. OK. Got it. Good. Good thinking, Andrew.
ANDREW It's a pleasure, Faith. Back to you.
FAITH OK, I need you four to suss out the situation on B. I don't want you talking to her or getting in her way or, for that matter, letting her know you're there. Just do a little recon.
ROBIN Where do you want me, Faith?
FAITH By your phone. I'll call you when I need you.
DAWN What are we looking for? I mean, is there some reason we should spy on Buffy?
FAITH We're just making sure she's OK. Those of you who are coming with me to the arsenal, you know who you are. Everybody ready? Let's do this thing.
CALEB Shouldn't be long now. Prophecies say one thing. Brute strength says another. We'll get it out.
BUFFY/FIRST I heard you, Caleb.
CALEB We're almost there.
BUFFY/FIRST Yes, that's true. Now, rouse the Bringers. Get them back to work
BUFFY Hey. Heard you got something of mine.
CALEB Well, if it ain't the prodigal slayer?
BUFFY Where's it at? You know I'm gonna find it sooner or later.
CALEB No, you're not. I lay one hand on you, and you're just a dead little girl.
BUFFY Lay a hand on me...if you can.
BUFFY/FIRST Caleb, this is getting embarrassing.
CALEB Do you have to look like that?
BUFFY/FIRST Will you concentrate?
CALEB 'Cause it's just a little confusing.
BUFFY/FIRST Fine. Go. Kill.
FAITH Everybody stop. I think we just found it.
KENNEDY Look at all this.
VI I don't get it. Why'd they abandon all this stuff?
FAITH Maybe 'cause they didn't.
CALEB You whore!
BUFFY You know, you really should watch your language. If someone didn't know you, they might think you were a woman-hating jerk.
VI Is that it? I mean, not that it wasn't fun, but
KENNEDY Yo, Faith. Check this out.
FAITH Everybody get down!
