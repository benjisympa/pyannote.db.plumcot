GILES Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer:
FAITH Hey.
GILES Hello, Faith.
FAITH Trying to turn a bunch of little girls into an army...
BUFFY They're potential slayers, just like we were.
CALEB Call me Caleb.
ANYA Look, I'm not saying it's a happy scenario, but we're dealing with a Big Bad that can be any dead person it wants.
BUFFY The bad guys always go where the power is. They're protecting the vineyard or something at the vineyard.
BUFFY/FIRST You realize what will happen if the slayer and her girls get it, don't you?
CALEB They won't.
DAWN We have to be together on this. So I need you to leave.
FAITH Now... I'm your boss.
SPIKE And there's only one thing I've ever been sure of: you.
SPIKE You're the one, Buffy.
BUFFY Hey. Heard you got something of mine.
FAITH Those of you who are coming with me to the arsenal, you know who you are. Everybody ready? Let's do this thing.
FAITH Get down!
CALEB So...you found it. Not impressed. 'Cause the question now, girly girl, is can you pry it from solid rock before I come over there
CALEB Hmm. Darn.
CALEB Now, before you go hurting yourself with that thing, why don't you do yourself a courtesy and hand it over now?
BUFFY Yeah? You want it?
CALEB You don't even know what you got there.
BUFFY I know you're backing away.
CALEB You think wielding some 2-sided doo-dad's gonna make a difference?
BUFFY/FIRST Let her go, Caleb. I said let her go.
CALEB If I let her go, she slices me open with that thing.
BUFFY/FIRST No, she doesn't. She hasn't got time. She has friends. And her friends are in trouble. Faith go boom.
CALEB I'm not letting her out of here with that thing.
BUFFY/FIRST Sure you are. Then you'll come back for it later...when she's got her back turned.
AMANDA Hey! Hey, Faith! Anybody! Is anybody here?!
CARIDAD Me!
AMANDA Is anybody else alive?
CARIDAD Hello? Anyone?
VI I'mI'm here!
CARIDAD Who else we got?
VI Don't know.
AMANDA You OK?
VI I think my arm is broken. I guess I'm lucky.
KENNEDY Where's Faith?
VI I don't know.
KENNEDY Find her.
CARIDAD Maybe we should get the hell out of this place. They could
KENNEDY Find her!
VI Oh, God!
KENNEDY Is she alive?
AMANDA Breathing. Pulse.
KENNEDY We gotta get her out of here.
VI Which way is out?
AMANDA There's other girls. There's more than Faith. We don't even know how many of us are still alive.
CARIDAD What was that?
VI It could've been grinding metal. It could've been
KENNEDY No, it was one of them.
CARIDAD That's not possible.
AMANDA How'd it get in here?
VI Plans?
KENNEDY Run.
CARIDAD Oh, no! It's blocked!
VI Oh, my God!
AMANDA I told you this wasn't the way!
KENNEDY Cut the chatter! Up and over! Wounded first! Let's go!
KENNEDY Group together. Form a circle. Nobody panic. It's all of us, one of him. We can take one of these things.
ANDREW It was pretty amazing. A whole grocery store just abandoned. Food lying around everywhere. Uh, the produce was on its way to funky town, but
GILES Ooh. Jaffa cakes.
ANDREW Uh, the apples still look pretty good, so everyone should, uh, check those out.
GILES Did you find Buffy?
XANDER No.
ANDREW But you did that spell with the little lights. The locator.
ANYA It crapped out on us though.
DAWN No, it didn't...exactly.
WILLOW It just took us to an empty house. She must have moved on already.
GILES I'm afraid we have slightly worse news here. Faith hasn't returned with the other girls. Something's gone wrong.
ANDREW I've been here, keeping morale up. Because that's important.
WILLOW We have to go to her.
XANDER Guess so.
ANDREW Yes. I'll stay here, keep working on that morale thing.
KENNEDY Remember the training. Everybody, get ready! Aah!
AMANDA There's another one.
KENNEDY Move! Move! Move! Up and over!
AMANDA Not that one! That one!
CARIDAD Weapons! Over there!
BUFFY Get the wounded. We're leaving.
KENNEDY Are there more?
BUFFY There's always more. Let's move.
BUFFY Will, come here. She's losing a lot of blood.
WILLOW Got it.
BUFFY The room upstairs is ready for her.
GILES Good.
XANDER I hope we're in time.
AMANDA Is she OK? Is she gonna be OK?
KENNEDY I'm sure she'll be fine, right?
XANDER Careful!
GILES Just mind her head.
BUFFY I'll be up in a second.
KENNEDY You guys heal fast, right? You slayers?
BUFFY Yeah.
KENNEDY So...she'll be OK?
BUFFY I don't know.
CARIDAD What's with the axe thing?
BUFFY I took it from Caleb. It might be important.
VI Let's hope.
AMANDA I think we got punished.
BUFFY What?
KENNEDY We, uh...we followed her. And it was
VI It didn't work out.
BUFFY You guys, it was a trap. It's not her fault. That could've just as easily happened to me.
CARIDAD So are you... are you, like, back?
BUFFY I don't know. I guess I'm not leaving.
KENNEDY So, we got a plan now, or anything?
BUFFY Yeah, there's a plan. Get ready. Time's up.
AMANDA I still think we got punished.
XANDER Is she breathing OK?
GILES Still unconscious, though.
BUFFY We've still got work to do.
BUFFY I think it's maybe some kind of scythe. The only thing I know for sure is it made Caleb back off in a hurry.
WILLOW So it's true. Scythe matters.
GILES And, ignoring that, I'd just like to point out this is really quite ingenious.
BUFFY Kills strong bodies 3 ways.
WILLOW And you say you sense something when you hold it?
BUFFY Not much, but it's strong. And I knew it belonged to me. I just knew it.
GILES In addition to being ancient, it's clearly mystical.
BUFFY Yeah, I figured that one out when I King Arthured it out of the stone.
WILLOW So maybe it's like some kind of traditional slayer weapon.
GILES I can't imagine how something like this could exist without my having heard of it.
BUFFY Well, the good guys are not traditionally known for their communication skills.
GILES Right. Um... any chance that it might be something other than a tool for killing things?
BUFFY The First's guys clearly wanted it out of that stone. It's not just a tool. It's important. We need to find out whatever we can. Who made it, when, why? Does it have a name? I don't know, a credit report? Just find out fast.
GILES We'll start work immediately.
WILLOW Yeah, don't worry, Buff. We'll find out everything there is to know.
BUFFY Good, because right now, that thing's all we've got going for us.
ANDREW I liked the real bandages better. These bed sheets are awfully festive. Ecch!
ANYA Yeah. They're gonna look like mortally wounded Easter baskets.
WOUNDED_POTENTIAL What?
ANYA Aw.
ANDREW H-hey! We're supposed to use that to sterilize wounds. Mr. Giles said.
ANYA Come on, what does it really matter?
ANDREW Hmm. Good point.
ANYA Giles knows his single malt antiseptics.
ANDREW Blech. Everything's horrible.
ANYA Yup. Many of these girls will die. Slaughterhouse is what it is.
WOUNDED_POTENTIAL What?
ANYA Oh...trying to talk will just kill you sooner.
ANDREW We need supplies, and not just bandages and junk. Thesethese girls need stitches and painkillers.
ANYA Yeah, well, I could use a cookie, but I'm not making reckless wishes.
ANDREW No, no. We can do it. The hospital. It's gotta be all abandoned like the grocery store. Supplies just lying around for the taking. I'm going in.
ANYA You are?
ANDREW And you're coming with me.
ANYA I am?
ANDREW Well, I think you should drive 'cause that scotch made me a little dizzy.
ANYA OK. I'll get Kennedy to watch the girls. She's tough. Imminent death won't bother her.
WOUNDED_POTENTIAL What?
BUFFY You got it?
XANDER Wait. I'm not to the got it place yet. I'm still in the neighborhood of you've gotta be kidding.
BUFFY You know it's for the good.
XANDER I don't. Buffy, do you get that? If I do this, that's it for me for this fight. I feel like you're putting me out to pasture.
BUFFY Of course I'm not putting you out to pasture. What does that even mean?
XANDER Well, you know, it's like, uh... when a cow gets old and loses an eye, or its ability to be milked, the farmer takes it and puts it in a different pasture so it won't have to... fight...with the priests. Look, I don't need you to protect me.
BUFFY I'm not.
XANDER I got hurt, but I'm not done. I can still fight.
BUFFY I know. That's why I need you to do this. Xander, I need someone that I can count on no matter what happens.
XANDER I just always thought that I would... I would be there with you... you know, for the end.
BUFFY Hey.
XANDER Well, not that this is the end.
BUFFY Thanks a lot.
XANDER No, no, no. By the end, I meant, uh... a heroic, uplifting way. See, I'm still optimistic. You're just thrown off a little by this gritty-looking eye patch.
BUFFY I know what you meant.
XANDER I should be at your side. That's all I'm saying.
BUFFY You will be. You're my strength, Xander. You're the reason I made it this far. I trust you with my life. That's why I need you to do this for me.
XANDER OK.
BUFFY Also, you can't shoot a bow and arrow anymore, and every time you pick up a sword, I worry that you're gonna break one of our good lamps.
XANDER Hey
BUFFY Don't look at me. You're the one who said I'm gonna die.
XANDER I never said you were gonna die. II implied that you were gonna die. It's totally different.
BUFFY Yeah, OK. Sure.
XANDER Besides, if you die, I'll just bring you back to life. That's what I do.
WILLOW OK, before the vineyard was just, you know, a vineyard, it was a monastery. Could've been put there then. Some creepy monks messing with powers they don't understand.
GILES No, it's older than that. It's pre-Christian.
WILLOW OK. Well, I found reference to stories the monks used to tell about something older. Uh, like, some kind of pagan temple.
GILES Native American?
WILLOW No. I don't know. Ugh. OK, maybe we're just going about this the wrong way. Maybe we should research the weapon itself. Like...look. Maybe it's the Axe of Dekeron, said to have been forged in hell itself. Lost since the Children's Crusade, where it was said to have killed Oh. Children. I hope that's not it.
GILES Well, I have reference to the Sword of Moskva, the, uh...Reaper of the Tigrishow are we supposed to narrow this down? The illustrations are never clear enough. Oh, damn. We're running out of time. We really haven't got anything useful. Do you sense any of the power that Buffy spoke about?
WILLOW Gotta say no. Must be a slayer thing.
GILES Tapping into magicks might help with that.
WILLOW Maybe. But, I mean, if Caleb is scared of this thing, it must be pretty dangerous. And tapping into that...
GILES Willow, you could do it without endangering yourself.
WILLOW If I tried something big, I'd change. And then it's all black hair and veins and lightning bolts. I can hardly do a locator spell without getting dark roots.
GILES And if it was necessary?
WILLOW Honestly? I don't know.
GILES All right. Do what you can. That's all any of us can do.
WILLOW I guess so. Ugh. Man, none of these sound right. I mean, look. Here's one that's just m question mark. What the heck is that?
GILES Let me see. It's not a question mark. It's the international phonetics alphabet symbol for glottal stop.
WILLOW A whoey?
GILES It's sort of a gulping noise. I'm...remembering something here. Um... Ah. Hieroglyphs. Hieroglyphs stand for sets of consonants, as you know.
WILLOW Yes, absolutely.
GILES M plus glottal stop is represented by a picture that's commonly thought to symbolize a sickle or a scythe. It's in thousands of carvings. In Egypt, throughout the ancient world.
WILLOW Carvings like you'd have on a pagan temple?
GILES Go back. See what else we can find out about this temple. The scythe is a symbol of death. Let's see where these pagans buried their dead.
DAWN Xander, my crossbow is not out here. I told you, I don't leave crossbows around all willy-nilly. Not since that time with Miss Kitty Fantastico.
XANDER Hey, did you know I have to take a driving test every year now?
DAWN Because you're old?
XANDER No, because of my eye. It's a whole state law. They don't trust my depth perception anymore.
DAWN That sucks.
XANDER And you know what's even worse? All the stupid it's all fun and games until someone loses an eye jokes. Hey, Xander, so no more fun and games, huh?
DAWN Giles was just having fun with you.
XANDER That's not the point. It's an obvious joke. It'd be like someone calling me a cyclops.
DAWN Oh. OK, so not that funny.
XANDER I mean, uh... give me some eye of the beholder jokes. You know? Or, uh... some eye for an eye jokes. Or maybe even a post-modern I, Claudius joke, you know? It's about standards, Dawnie.
DAWN I know.
XANDER Just, uh, be creative.
DAWN Look, everyone's still kind of on guard around you. But before you know it Aah! Aah!
BUFFY/FIRST Not that I care personally, but you are wasting a lot of robust, full-bodied merlot.
CALEB Why did you let her go? You know I can take her in a fight.
BUFFY/FIRST We'll get her. Calm down.
CALEB I'm calm. You should see me when I get angry.
BUFFY/FIRST She's powerful right now. And you're weak.
CALEB You know, all of a sudden, I'm getting less calm.
BUFFY/FIRST Face it. Your strength is waning. It has been quite some time since we've... merged.
CALEB Maybe you're right. OK, let's do it.
BUFFY/FIRST Boy, you sure know how to romance a girl. No flowers, no dinner, no tour of the rectory. Just, OK, I'm ready. Let's do it. Help me. My knees are weak.
CALEB Watch what you say now. You're starting to sound like her. This is a sacred experience for me.
BUFFY/FIRST And for me as well. Look, when this is all over, and our armies spring forth, and our will sweeps the world, I will be able to enter every man, woman, and child on this Earth, just as I enter you.
CALEB Are you trying to make me jealous?
BUFFY/FIRST I'm trying to make you a God.
CALEB I am thy humble servant.
CALEB And I am ready to serve thee.
BUFFY You feel it too, don't you?
FAITH Damn. And damn, that's something.
BUFFY I know.
FAITH It's old. It's strong, and it feels like... like it's mine. I guess that means it's yours.
BUFFY It belongs to the slayer.
FAITH Slayer in charge, which, I'm guessing, is you.
BUFFY I honestly don't know. Does it matter?
FAITH It never mattered to me. Somebody has to lead. Let's vote for Chao-Ahn. It's harder to lead people into a deathtrap if you don't speak English.
BUFFY It wasn't your fault.
FAITH I'm really not looking for forgiveness.
BUFFY You're not?
FAITH What do you want me to say? I blew it.
BUFFY You didn't blow it.
FAITH Tell that to
BUFFY People die. You lead them into battle, they're gonna die. It doesn't matter how ready you are or how smart you are. War is about death. Needless, stupid death.
FAITH So, here's the laugh riot. My whole life I've been a loner.
BUFFY That's the funny part? Did I miss something?
FAITH I'm trying to
BUFFY Sorry. Sorry. Go.
FAITH No ties, no buddies, no relationships that lasted longer than... well, Robin lasted pretty long. Boy's got stamina.
BUFFY Principal Wood? And you? And in my
FAITH Don't tell me you two got wriggly.
BUFFY No. No. No, no. We're just good friends. Or mortal enemies, depending on which day of the
BUFFY was that the funny part?
FAITH OK. The point. Me, by myself all the time. I'm looking at you, everything you have, and, I don't know, jealous. Then there I am. Everybody's looking to me, trusting me to lead them, and I've never felt so alone in my entire life.
BUFFY Yeah.
FAITH And that's you every day, isn't it?
BUFFY I love my friends. I'm very grateful for them. But that's the price. Being a slayer.
FAITH There's only supposed to be one. Maybe that's why you and I can never get along. We're not supposed to exist together.
BUFFY Also, you went evil and were killing people.
FAITH Good point. Also a factor.
BUFFY But you're right. I mean, I... I guess everyone's alone. But being a slayer? There's a burden we can't share.
FAITH And no one else can feel it. Thank God we're hot chicks with superpowers.
BUFFY Takes the edge off.
FAITH Comforting.
BUFFY Mm-hmm.
SPIKE Honey, you're home.
BUFFY Yeah.
SPIKE And you did it. Fulfilled your mission. Found the Holy Grail. Or the Holy Hand Grenade, or whatever the hell that is.
BUFFY Right now we're going with scythe. You like?
SPIKE Well, pointy and wooden is not exactly the look I wanna know better, but it does have flair. Can see why a girl would ditch a fella for one of these.
BUFFY I'm sorry about that.
SPIKE It doesn't matter. You're back in the bosom. All's forgiven. And, uh, last night...was just a glitch. A bit of cold comfort from the cellar dweller. Let's don't make a thing out of it.
BUFFY Great. I have work to do.
SPIKE Oh, yeah. Another solo mission, of course.
BUFFY Yeah, it is.
SPIKE That's fine. You don't have to get shirty about it.
BUFFY I'm not shirty. And what is shirty? That's not even a word.
SPIKE All right. All right. Big secret mission. It's fine.
BUFFY It's not a secret. Well, I mean, it is, but that's the point of the mission. Find out the secret. This thing was forged by I don't even know. I mean, something about... a tomb on unconsecrated ground. That's what I have to do. I need to find out what this is and why I have it.
SPIKE And that's the thing the preacher man was so anxious to keep out of your mitts?
BUFFY That it is.
SPIKE Well, maybe I'll swing by the vineyard when you go, make sure he's sitting tight.
BUFFY Great.
SPIKE OK.
BUFFY You're a dope.
SPIKE I'm a what?
BUFFY You're a dope. And a bonehead. And you're shirty.
SPIKE Have you gone completely carrot-top?
BUFFY Do you see this? This may actually help me fight my war. This might be the key to everything. And the reason I'm holding it is because of you. Because of the strength that you gave me last night. Look, I am tired of defensiveness and weird, mixed signals. You know, I have Faith for that. Let's just get to the truth here, OK? I don't know how you felt about last night, but I will not
SPIKE Terrified.
BUFFY Of what?
SPIKE Last night was... God, I'm such a jerk. I can't do this.
BUFFY Spike...
SPIKE It was the best night of my life. If you poke fun at me, you bloody well better use that, 'cause I couldn't bear it. It may not mean that much to you, but
BUFFY I just told you it did.
SPIKE Yeah...I hear you say it, but... I've lived for soddin' ever, Buffy. I've done everything. Done things with you I can't spell, but... I've never... been close... to anyone. Least of all, you. 'Til last night. All I did was... hold you, watch you sleep. And it was the best night of my life. So, yeah... I'm... terrified.
BUFFY You don't have to be.
SPIKE Were you there with me?
BUFFY I was.
SPIKE What does that mean?
BUFFY I don't know. Does it have to mean something?
SPIKE No. Not right now.
BUFFY Maybe when...
SPIKE No. Let's just leave it.
BUFFY OK.
SPIKE We'll go be heroes.
ANDREW Ooh. This one has oxygen tanks.
ANYA They'd only be useful if something big was attacking, and then we could shove one down their throat and blow 'em up like Roy Scheider did with that shark in Jaws. What?
ANDREW You are the perfect woman.
ANYA I've often thought so. Wanna rob?
ANDREW Let's rob. Oh, cool. Gauze and alcohol... tape and, oh, sutures, if we want to get stitchy with it. Oh, and there's a... box of ointment here. I used one of these on a rash once.
ANYA Oh. Show me.
ANDREW Well, itit's healed up, but it was red and crusty with these little itchy places.
ANYA Show me the box full of ointments, you little freak. And get cotton packing for the big wounds.
ANDREW It's gonna be bad, isn't it?
ANYA Yeah.
ANDREW So how come you're here? I mean, you could just go. Right?
ANYA Yeah. I did once before.
ANDREW Before what?
ANYA Well...there was this other apocalypse... this one time, and... well, I took off. But this time, I don't...I don't know.
ANDREW Well...what's different?
ANYA Well...I guess I was...kinda new to bein' around humans before. But now I've... seen a lot more, gotten to know people... seen what they're capable of, and... I guess I just realized...how amazingly screwed-up they all are. I mean really, really screwed-up in a monumental fashion.
ANDREW Oh.
ANYA And they have no purpose that unites them, so they just drift around, blundering through life until they die...which they...they know is coming, yet every single one of them is surprised when it happens to them. They're incapable of thinking about what they want beyond the moment. They kill each other, which is clearly insane. And yet, here's the thing. When it's something that really matters, they fight. I mean, they're lame morons for fighting, but they do. They never... never quit. So I guess I will keep fighting, too.
ANDREW That was kind of beautiful. You...you love humans.
ANYA I do not.
ANDREW Yes, you do. You loooove them
ANYA Stop it! I don't love them! And I'll kill you if you tell anybody.
ANDREW I won't tell anybody. Won't get a chance to, anyway.
ANYA I don't know. You might survive.
ANDREW No, you might survive. You know how to handle a weapon, and you've been in this world for, like, a thousand years. I'm not so... I don't think I'll be OK. I'm cool with it. I think I'd like to...finish out as one of those... lame humans tryin' to do what's right.
ANYA Yeah.
ANDREW So...wheelchair fight?
WOMAN I'd forgotten. I'd forgotten how young you would be.
WOMAN Comes from the waiting. Mind plays tricks. I see you've found our weapon.
BUFFY Who are you?
WOMAN One of many. Well...time was. Now I'm alone in the world.
BUFFY So what are you? Some kind of ghost?
WOMAN Nope. I'm as real as you are. Just...well... let me put it this way I look good for my age. I've been waiting. You pulled it out of the rock. I was one of those who put it in there.
BUFFY What is it?
WOMAN A weapon. A scythe. Forged in secrecy for one like you who I'm sorry. What's your name?
BUFFY Buffy.
WOMAN No, really. We forged it in secrecy and kept it hidden from the Shadow Men, who
BUFFY Yeah. Met those guys. Didn't really care too much for 'em.
WOMAN Ahh, yes. Then you know. And they became the watchers. And the watchers watched the slayers. But we were watching them.
BUFFY Oh! So you're like... what are you?
WOMAN Guardians. Women who want to help and protect you. We forged this centuries ago, halfway around the world.
BUFFY Hence, the Luxor Casino theme.
WOMAN Forged there, it was put to use right here...to kill the last pure demon that walked upon the Earth. The rest were already driven under. And then there were men here, and then there were monks. And then there was a town, and now there was you. And the scythe remained hidden.
BUFFY I don't understand. How is it possible that we didn't know any of this?
WOMAN We hid, too. We had to until now. We're the last surprise.
BUFFY Does this mean I can win?
WOMAN That is really up to you. This is a powerful weapon.
BUFFY Yeah.
WOMAN But you already have weapons.
BUFFY Oh.
WOMAN Use it wisely and perhaps you can beat back the rising dark. One way or another, it can only mean an end is truly near.
CALEB I'm sorry. I didn't catch that last part on account of her neck snapping and all. Did she say the end is near... or here?
XANDER Hey, Dawn. Dawn, you awake?
DAWN What happened?
XANDER Um, I thought you might say that.
DAWN Actually I meant to say what the hell happened?
XANDER It was chloroform.
DAWN Color forms...what?
XANDER Chloroform. Are you still loopy?
DAWN Sorry about that. Someone knocked me out with chloroform. Xander, where are we going? What's going on? Talk to me.
XANDER Away.
DAWN What's this?
XANDER Just open it.
BUFFY Dearest Dawn, don't be angry with Xander. He only did what I told him to do. This isn't the place for either of you. Please know that I love you and that everything I do is for you. I promised once to show you this beautiful world, and I'm going to do everything I can to make that happen
CALEB Ha ha ha ha! You're not slipping out of this fight, girl. Can't you see? You can't stop me. I can just keep going back for more. It's like being reborn.
CALEB You know, I gave you ample warning. Told you not to interfere, but you chose not to heed.
CALEB I was kind of hoping it'd go this way.
MAN Hey!
ANGEL I was never much for preachers.
BUFFY Angel.
ANGEL You look good.
BUFFY You look timely. And also good.
ANGEL Heard maybe you needed a hand.
ANGEL Ah, one of those things you have to finish yourself.
BUFFY Really kinda is.
ANGEL You are so gonna lose.
ANGEL God, I missed watching this.
BUFFY See? Under control.
ANGEL Well...at least you could tell me you're glad to see me.
BUFFY/FIRST That bitch.
