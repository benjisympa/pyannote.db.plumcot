GILES Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer:
SPIKE And there's only one thing I've ever been sure of: you.
SPIKE You're the one, Buffy.
FAITH Trying to turn a bunch of little girls into an army...
BUFFY They're potential slayers.
ANYA But we're dealing with a Big Bad that can be any dead person it wants.
DAWN Where are we going?
BUFFY Dearest Dawn, don't be angry with Xander. This isn't the place for either of you.—
WOMAN A scythe. Forged in secrecy for one like you.
BUFFY Does this mean I can win?
CALEB I was kind of hoping it'd go this way.
MAN Hey!
ANGEL At least you could tell me you're glad to see me.
BUFFY/FIRST That bitch.
ANGEL Well, I guess that qualifies as "happy to see me."
BUFFY Angel, what are you doing— Don't even. I just want to bask. OK, I'm basked. What are you doing here?
ANGEL Not saving the damsel in distress, that's for sure.
BUFFY Oh, you know me. Not much with the damseling.
ANGEL Got your share of distress, though.
BUFFY You heard?
ANGEL I got coverage on the whole thing. It's very gripping. It needs a third act.
BUFFY You have to leave L.A.
ANGEL It's the First, right? The First evil. The power that tried to convince me to kill myself.
BUFFY Yeah. It's gotten a little more ambitious since then. It's raising an army.
ANGEL Yeah, well, it failed once, and I'm here to tell you—
CALEB Are you ready to finish this, bitch?!
BUFFY OK...how many times do I have to kill you? Ballpark figure.
CALEB You understand nothing.
CALEB You think you have power over me?
CALEB Stupid girl. You'll never stop me. You don't have the ba—
BUFFY Who does nowadays?
ANGEL OK, now I'm pissed. Where is he?
BUFFY He had to split.
BUFFY/FIRST Yeah, she needs you real bad.
BUFFY I'll have the guys go through that. See if there's anything new. Reliable source?
ANGEL Not remotely.
BUFFY Mm, any port in an apocalypse.
ANGEL I, uh, brought something else as well.
BUFFY I can already tell you, I have nothing that goes with that.
ANGEL It's not for you.
BUFFY Splainy?
ANGEL I don't know everything. It's very powerful and probably very dangerous. It has a purifying power, a cleansing power, possibly scrubbing bubbles. The translation is, uh—anyway, it bestows strength to the right person who wears it.
BUFFY And the right person is?
ANGEL Someone ensouled, but stronger than human. A champion. As in me.
BUFFY Or me.
ANGEL No. I don't know nearly enough about this to risk you wearing it. Besides, you got that real cool axe-thing going for you.
BUFFY So you're gonna be with me in this.
ANGEL Shoulder to shoulder. I'm yours.
BUFFY No.
ANGEL No, what?
BUFFY No. You're not gonna be in this fight.
ANGEL Why the hell not?
BUFFY 'Cause I can't risk you.
ANGEL You need me in this.
BUFFY No, I need you gone.
ANGEL Why?
BUFFY If I lose, if this thing gets past Sunnydale, then it's days—maybe hours—before the rest of the world goes. I need a second front, and I need you to run it.
ANGEL OK... that's one reason. What's the other?
BUFFY There is no other.
ANGEL Is it Spike? You're not telling me something. And his scent, I remember it pretty well.
BUFFY You vampires. Did anybody ever tell you the whole smelling people thing's a little gross?
ANGEL Is he your boyfriend?
BUFFY Is that your business?
ANGEL You in love with him? OK, maybe I'm outta line, but this is kind of a curve ball for me. I mean, we are talking about Spike here.
BUFFY It's different. He's different. He has a soul now.
ANGEL Oh. Well.
BUFFY What?
ANGEL That's great. Everyone's got a soul now.
BUFFY He'll make a difference.
ANGEL You know, I started it. The whole having a soul. Before it was all the cool new thing.
BUFFY Oh, my God. Are you 12?
ANGEL I'm getting the brush off for Captain Peroxide. It doesn't necessarily bring out the champion in me.
BUFFY You're not getting the brush off. Are you just gonna come here and go all Dawson on me every time I have a boyfriend?
ANGEL Aha! Boyfriend!
BUFFY He's not. But...he is in my heart.
ANGEL That'll end well.
BUFFY What was the highlight of our relationship? When you broke up with me or when I killed you? I'm well aware of my stellar history with guys... And, no, I don't see fat grandchildren in the offing with Spike, but I don't think that really matters right now. You know, in the midst of all this insanity, a couple things are actually starting to make sense. And the guy thing— I always feared there was something wrong with me, you know, because I couldn't make it work. But maybe I'm not supposed to.
ANGEL Because you're the slayer?
BUFFY Because—OK, I'm cookie dough. I'm not done baking. I'm not finished becoming whoever the hell it is I'm gonna turn out to be. I make it through this, and the next thing, and the next thing, and maybe one day I turn around and realize I'm ready. I'm cookies. And then, you know, if I want someone to eat— or enjoy warm, delicious cookie me, then...that's fine. That'll be then. When I'm done.
ANGEL Any thoughts on who might enjoy— Do I have to go with the cookie analogy?
BUFFY I'm not really thinking that far ahead. That's kind of the point.
ANGEL I'll go start working on the second front. Make sure I don't have to use it.
BUFFY Angel. I do... sometimes think that far ahead.
ANGEL Sometimes is something.
BUFFY Be a long time coming. Years, if ever.
ANGEL I ain't getting any older.
BUFFY Ow.
DAWN Dumbass.
XANDER Don't look at me. This is a Summers' thing. It's all very violent.
BUFFY If you get killed, I'm telling.
WILLOW Did you find out anything about the scythe?
BUFFY It slices, dices, and makes julienne preacher.
GILES Caleb?
BUFFY I cut him in half.
WILLOW All right!
ANYA He had that coming.
XANDER Hey, party in my eye socket and everyone's invited. Sometimes I shouldn't say words.
SPIKE So...where's tall, dark and forehead?
BUFFY Let me guess. You can smell him.
SPIKE Yeah, that and I also used my enhanced vampire eyeballs to watch you kissing him.
BUFFY It was...a hello.
SPIKE Most people don't use their tongues to say hello. Or I guess they do, but—
BUFFY There were no tongues. Besides, he's gone.
SPIKE Oh, just popped by for a quickie, then?
BUFFY Good, good. I haven't had quite enough jealous vampire crap for one night.
SPIKE He wears lifts, you know.
BUFFY You know, one of these days I'm just gonna put you 2 in a room and let you wrestle it out.
SPIKE No problem at this end.
BUFFY There could be oil of some kind involved.
SPIKE Where's the trinket?
BUFFY The who-ket?
SPIKE The pretty necklace your sweetie-bear gave you. The one with all the power. I believe it's mine now.
BUFFY How do you figure?
SPIKE Someone with a soul, but more than human? Angel meant to wear it, that means I'm the qualified party.
BUFFY It's volatile. We don't know—
SPIKE You'll be needing someone strong to bear it, then. You planning on giving it to Andrew?
BUFFY Angel said the amulet was meant to be worn by a champion.
SPIKE Been called a lot of things in my time.
BUFFY Faith still has my room.
SPIKE Well, you're not staying here. You can't buy me off with shiny beads and sweet talk. You got Angel breath. I'm not gonna just let you whack me back and forth like a rubber ball. I've got my pride, you know.
BUFFY I understand.
SPIKE Clearly you don't, 'cause the whole "having my pride" thing was just a smokescreen.
BUFFY Oh, thank God.
SPIKE I don't know what I would have done if you'd have gone up those stairs.
CALEB/FIRST Pretty, ain't it?
BUFFY You're not him.
CALEB/FIRST No, you killed him right and proper. Terrible loss. This man was my good right arm. 'Course, it don't pain me too much. Don't need an arm. Got an army.
BUFFY An army of vampires. However will I fight—
CALEB/FIRST Every day our numbers swell. But then you do have an army of your own. Some thirty-odd pimply-faced girls, don't know the pointy end of a stake. Maybe I should call this off.
BUFFY Have you ever considered a cool name? I mean, since you're incorporeal and basically powerless. How about "The Taunter?" Strikes fear in the heart—
CALEB/FIRST I will overrun this Earth. And when my army outnumbers the humans on this Earth, the scales will tip and I will be made flesh.
BUFFY Talk on. I'm not afraid of you.
CALEB/FIRST Then why aren't you asleep in your dead lover's arms? 'Cause he can't help you. Nor Faith, nor your friends, certainly not your wanna-slay brigade. None of those girlies will ever know real power unless you're dead. You know the drill:
BUFFY/FIRST Into every generation, a slayer is born. One girl in all the world. She alone will have the strength and skill to— There's that word again. What you are. How you'll die. Alone. Where's your snappy comeback?
BUFFY You're right.
BUFFY/FIRST Hmm. Not your best.
SPIKE I'm drowning in footwear! Weird dream. Buffy? Is something wrong?
BUFFY No. Yeah. I just realized something. Something that really never occurred to me before. We're gonna win.
BUFFY What do you think?
XANDER That depends. Are you in any way...kidding?
BUFFY You don't think it's a good idea?
FAITH It's pretty radical, B.
GILES It's a lot more than that. Buffy, what you said, it—it flies in the face of everything we've ever—every generation has ever done in the fight against evil. I think it's bloody brilliant.
BUFFY You mean that?
GILES If you want my opinion.
BUFFY I really do.
WILLOW Whoa, hey. Not to poop on the party here, but I'm the guy that's gonna have to pull this thing off.
FAITH It is beaucoup d'mojo.
WILLOW This goes beyond anything I've ever done. It's a total loss of control, and not in a nice, wholesome, my girlfriend has a pierced tongue kind of way.
BUFFY I wouldn't ask if I didn't think you could do it.
WILLOW I—I'm not sure that I'm stable enough.
GILES You can do this, Willow. We'll get the coven on the line, and we'll find out how they can help.
DAWN Oh! "Pierced tongue."
BUFFY Dawn needs to do a research thing.
GILES Yes, you do.
DAWN It's cool. Watcher junior to the library.
GILES I'll go dig up my sources. Quite literally, actually.
ANYA Come on, let's go assemble the cannon fodder.
XANDER That's not what we're calling them, sweetie.
ANYA Not to their faces. What, am I insensitive?
BUFFY I hate this. I hate being here. I hate that you have to be here. I hate that there's evil, and that I was chosen to fight it. I wish, a whole lot of the time, that I hadn't been. I know a lot of you wish I hadn't been either. But this isn't about wishes. This is about choices. I believe we can beat this evil. Not when it comes, not when its army is ready, now. Tomorrow morning I'm opening the seal. I'm going down into the hellmouth, and I'm finishing this once and for all. Right now you're asking yourself, "what makes this different? What makes us anything more than a bunch of girls being picked off one by one?" It's true none of you have the power that Faith and I do. So here's the part where you make a choice.
ROBIN It's one hell of a risky idea.
FAITH Buffy's wacky that way.
ROBIN Yeah. There's one more vent right by the stairs. We block that, they got no sewer access, should drive them straight up into the school proper.
FAITH That's assuming they get past us.
ROBIN Which, no offense, I am.
FAITH Come on, you gotta have a little Faith.
ROBIN I think I've had my share, thanks.
FAITH Well, I trundled right into that one, didn't I? Look, I'm sorry if it seemed like I was blowing you off the other day. I was just trying to, you know, blow you off.
ROBIN Yeah, you know what, I figured that one out all by myself.
FAITH It's nothing personal. It's just after I get bouncy with a guy, there's not that much more I need to know about him.
ROBIN That's bleak.
FAITH Way of the world.
ROBIN That's good to know 'cause for a second there I thought it was more defensive, isolationist slayer crap.
FAITH And he comes out swinging.
ROBIN Faith, there's a whole world out there that you don't even know about, and a lot of the men in it are pretty decent guys. They'd surprise you.
FAITH Guy looks at me, let's just say his priorities shift.
ROBIN Why, because you're so hot?
FAITH It's what it is, yo.
ROBIN Oh, please. I am so much prettier than you are. Oh, and, uh, for the record, our little encounter didn't exactly change my world.
FAITH You're tripping! That was rock 'em, sock 'em!
ROBIN No, no, no, no. It was—it was—it was nice enough, you know, and you're—you're very, um… mm, enthused, and I think with a little more experience—
FAITH Dude, I got mad skills.
ROBIN Yeah, of course. Let's finish up.
FAITH No, hell with that. We're going again, baby. You're gonna learn a little respect here, pal.
ROBIN Faith— Make me a deal, all right? We live through this, you give me the chance to surprise you.
FAITH What would be the surprise?
ROBIN You do know the meaning of the word, right?
FAITH Fine. Deal.
ROBIN Good enough.
FAITH No way you're prettier than me.
ROBIN A little bit, yeah.
WILLOW I really wish she hadn't said that about me.
KENNEDY What, the thing Buffy said? I think it's true. I'll be with you. To keep you grounded.
WILLOW Yeah, well, you might have to keep me stab-ded, if I go to the bad place.
KENNEDY You're saying I might have to kill you.
WILLOW I am.
KENNEDY Bite me.
WILLOW I will. I mean, I do... mean it. The darkest place I've ever been, this is what lies beyond that. This is too important for me to—
KENNEDY Buffy believes in you.
WILLOW You know, Buffy: sweet girl, not that bright.
KENNEDY Hey, I'm the first one to call her out when she's not making sense. In fact, this may have escaped your keen notice, but I'm kind of a brat. I've always sort of gotten my way. So you're gonna make it through this, no matter how dark it gets. Because now... you're my way.
WILLOW I better go over this again.
GILES I'm—I'm—I'm all turned around. You're here?
XANDER By the pillar, yeah. I'm protecting this area.
GILES That puts me over by the door. Demons around the perimeter— Right! I open the door.
ANDREW You go through the door and are confronted by Trogdor the Burninator.
GILES Oh, bugger it. Fight.
ANDREW Adios to 5 hit points. Trogdor has badly wounded you.
GILES Well, wait a minute. What about my... bag of illusions?
ANDREW Illusions against a Burninator? Silly, silly british man.
AMANDA I invoke a time flux on Trogdor.
ANDREW Step down, girlfriend, you can't just—
AMANDA Ninth level sorcerer, and I carry the emerald chalice. Trogdor is frozen in time. Deal with it.
XANDER Smackdown on Red Riding Hood. This could get ugly.
GILES Could it possibly get uglier? I used to be a highly respected watcher, and now I'm a wounded dwarf with the mystical strength of a doily. I just wish I could sleep.
AMANDA What kind of person could sleep on a night like this?
XANDER Only the crazy ones.
ROBIN Welcome to Sunnydale High.
ROBIN There's no running in the halls, no yelling, no gum chewing. Apart from that, there's only one rule. If they move, kill them.
BUFFY OK, potentials, in the basement. Follow Faith and Spike.
XANDER If you have to go to the bathroom, it's to your left. If you don't have to go to the bathroom, picture what you're about to face. Better to go now.
ROBIN Willow, my office is straight through there.
BUFFY It's right over the seal.
KENNEDY I'll start getting you set up.
WILLOW Thanks.
ROBIN OK, civilians. The vampires get upstairs, we have 3 areas they could get through to another building and then down into the sewers. Down the hall in the atrium, the north hall here, and the primary target, through the lounge straight to the science building. Now odds are, most of them will head there.
GILES Teams of 2 then. I suggest you and I take the lounge.
ROBIN I concur.
BUFFY Xander, I want you with Dawn.
XANDER I concur.
DAWN We'll check out the atrium.
ANYA So that leaves me and the dungeon master in the north hall?
ANDREW We will defend it with our very lives.
ANYA Yes, we will defend it with his very life.
XANDER And don't be afraid to use him as a human shield.
ANYA Good, yes, thanks.
ANDREW I just want to say how proud I am to die for this very special cause with you guys. There's some, um—there's people I'd like to thank, both good and evil. Um, a shout out to my brother Tucker, who gave me the inspiration to summon demons and also—
ANYA Nobody cares, you little monkey.
DAWN I'm gonna check out our field of engagement.
BUFFY Dawn...
DAWN No. Anything you say is gonna sound like good-bye.
BUFFY So, what do you guys want to do tomorrow?
WILLOW Nothing strenuous.
XANDER Well, mini-golf is always the first thing that comes to mind.
GILES I think we can do better than that.
BUFFY I was thinking about shopping. As per usual.
WILLOW Oh! There's an Arden B. in the new mall!
XANDER I could use a few items.
GILES Well, now aren't we gonna discuss this? Save the world to go to the mall?
BUFFY I'm having a wicked shoe craving.
XANDER Aren't you on the patch?
WILLOW Those never work.
GILES Here I am, invisible to the eye...
XANDER See, I need a new look. It's this whole eye patch thing.
BUFFY Oh, you could go with full black secret agent look.
WILLOW Or the puffy shirt, pirate slash—
GILES The earth is definitely doomed.
FAITH You first, B.
WILLOW They should be in place. OK, magic time. You ready to, heh heh, kill me?
KENNEDY Starting to be.
WILLOW Good. Fun. Great. Brace yourself.
KENNEDY Come on, red. Make it happen.
SPIKE Not to be a buzzkill, love, but my fabulous accessory isn't exactly tingling with power.
BUFFY I'm not worried.
SPIKE I'm getting zero juice here, and I look like Elizabeth Taylor.
FAITH Cheer up, Liz. Willow's big spell doesn't work, it won't matter what you wear.
BUFFY I'm not worried.
BUFFY I'm not worried.
RONA Really? 'Cause I'm flashing back to Xander's whole bathroom speech.
AMANDA Buffy—
BUFFY I'm not worried...as long as Willow can work her spell before they— see us.
BUFFY Willow...
WILLOW Oh...my...Goddess...
BUFFY So here's the part where you make a choice: What if you could have that power...now? In every generation, one slayer is born... because a bunch of men who died thousands of years ago made up that rule. They were powerful men. This woman is more powerful than all of them combined. So I say we change the rule. I say my power...
BUFFY ...should be our power.
BUFFY Tomorrow, Willow will use the essence of the scythe to change our destiny.
BUFFY From now on, every girl in the world who might be a slayer… will be a slayer. Every girl who could have the power... will have the power... can stand up, will stand up. Slayers... every one of us. Make your choice. Are you ready to be strong?
VI These guys are dust.
KENNEDY Willow?
KENNEDY You...are a goddess.
WILLOW And you're a slayer. Get this to Buffy.
WILLOW Ha! That was nifty.
KENNEDY Buffy! Catch!
KENNEDY I could get used to this.
ANDREW I think they're coming.
ANYA Oh, God. I'm terrified. I didn't think. I mean, I— I just figured you'd be terrified, and I would be sarcastic about it.
ANDREW Picture happy things... a lake, candy canes, bunnies.
ANYA Bunnies! Floppy, hoppy... bunnies.
ANDREW I have swimmer's ear!
SPIKE Buffy! Whatever this thing does, I think it's—
BUFFY Keep the line together! Drive them to the edge! We can't let them do—
FAITH Buffy!
BUFFY Hold the line.
XANDER We call that the greenhouse effect. Very dangerous—
FAITH Rona!
BUFFY/FIRST Oh no...ow! Mommy, this mortal wound is all...itchy. You pulled a nice trick. You came pretty close to smacking me down. What more do you want?
BUFFY I want you... to get out of my face.
SPIKE Oh, bollocks.
SPIKE Buffy!
BUFFY Spike!
FAITH Everybody out, now!
SPIKE I can feel it, Buffy.
BUFFY What?
SPIKE My soul. It's really there. Kind of stings.
ANDREW What... why?
ROBIN The bus. Get them on the bus.
GILES Everybody, this way!
XANDER Anya! Anya!
SPIKE Go on, then.
BUFFY No. No, you've done enough. You could still—
SPIKE No, you've beat them back. It's for me to do the cleanup.
FAITH Buffy, come on!
SPIKE Gotta move, lamb. I think it's fair to say school's out for bloody summer.
BUFFY Spike!
SPIKE I mean it! I gotta do this.
BUFFY I love you.
SPIKE No, you don't. But thanks for saying it. Now go! I wanna see how it ends.
VI Look at me! This is nothing! Stay awake! This is nothing!
ANDREW Why didn't I die?
FAITH Ease off. We're clear.
GILES I don't understand. Who did this?
BUFFY Spike.
XANDER So, did you see?
ANDREW I—I was scared. I'm sorry.
XANDER Did you see what happened? I mean, was she...
ANDREW She was incredible. She died saving my life.
XANDER That's my girl. Always doing the stupid thing.
FAITH It's not bad. You just sit here. I'll get someone to—
ROBIN Hey... did we— did we make it?
FAITH We made it. We won.
ROBIN Surprise.
FAITH Looks like the hellmouth is officially closed for business.
GILES There is another one in Cleveland. Not to spoil the moment.
XANDER We saved the world.
WILLOW We changed the world. I can feel them, Buffy. All over. Slayers are awakening everywhere.
DAWN We'll have to find them.
WILLOW We will.
GILES Yes, because the mall was actually in Sunnydale, so there's no hope of going there tomorrow.
DAWN We destroyed the mall? I fought on the wrong side.
XANDER All those shops gone. The Gap, Starbucks, Toys "R" Us. Who will remember all those landmarks unless we tell the world about them?
GILES We have a lot of work ahead of us.
FAITH Can I push him in?
WILLOW You've got my vote.
FAITH I just want to sleep, yo, for like a week.
DAWN I guess we all could, if we wanted to.
WILLOW Yeah. The First is scrunched, so... what do you think we should do, Buffy?
FAITH Yeah, you're not the one and only chosen anymore. Just gotta live like a person. How's that feel?
DAWN Yeah, Buffy. What are we gonna do now?
