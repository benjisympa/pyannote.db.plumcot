TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper So if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it and either slit is observed it will not go through both slits. If it's unobserved it will, however, if it's observed after it's left the plane but before it hits its target, it will not have gone through both slits.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Agreed, what's your point?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper There's no point, I just think it's a good idea for a tee-shirt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Excuse me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 althea Hang on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter One across is Aegean, eight down is Nabakov, twenty-six across is MCM, fourteen down is... move your finger... phylum, which makes fourteen across Port-au-Prince. See, Papa Doc's capital idea, that's Port-au-Prince. Haiti.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 althea Can I help you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Yes. Um, is this the High IQ sperm bank?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 althea If you have to ask, maybe you shouldn't be here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper I think this is the place.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 althea Fill these out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Thank-you. We'll be right back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 althea Oh, take your time. I'll just finish my crossword puzzle. Oh wait.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Leonard, I don't think I can do this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter What, are you kidding? You're a semi-pro.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper No. We are committing genetic fraud. There's no guarantee that our sperm is going to generate high IQ offspring, think about that. I have a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, this was your idea. A little extra money to get fractional T1 bandwidth in the apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper I know, and I do yearn for faster downloads, but there's some poor woman is going to pin her hopes on my sperm, what if she winds up with a toddler who doesn't know if he should use an integral or a differential to solve the area under a curve.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter I'm sure she'll still love him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper I wouldn't.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Well, what do you want to do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper I want to leave.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper What's the protocol for leaving?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter I don't know, I've never reneged on a proffer of sperm before.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Let's try just walking out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 althea Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Bye-bye
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter See you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Are you still mad about the sperm bank?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper You want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Not really.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper If the height of a single step is off by as little as two millimetres, most people will trip.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter I don't care. Two millimetres? That doesn't seem right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper No, it's true, I did a series of experiments when I was twelve, my father broke his clavicle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Is that why they sent you to boarding school?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper No, that was the result of my work with lasers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter New neighbor?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Evidently.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Significant improvement over the old neighbor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Two hundred pound transvestite with a skin condition, yes she is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny Oh, hi!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny Hi?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter We don't mean to interrupt, we live across the hall.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny Oh, that's nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Oh... uh... no... we don't live together... um... we live together but in separate, heterosexual bedrooms.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny Oh, okay, well, guess I'm your new neighbor, Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Leonard, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Hi. Well, uh, oh, welcome to the building.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny Thankyou, maybe we can have coffee sometime.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Oh, great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny Great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Great. Well, bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Should we have invited her for lunch?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper No. We're going to start Season Two of Battlestar Galactica.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter We already watched the Season Two DVDs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Not with commentary.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter I think we should be good neighbors, invite her over, make her feel welcome.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper We never invited Louis-slash-Louise over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Well, then that was wrong of us. We need to widen our circle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on myspace.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Yes, and you've never met one of them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper That's the beauty of it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter I'm going to invite her over. We'll have a nice meal and chat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Chat? We don't chat. At least not offline.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Well it's not difficult, you just listen to what she says and then you say something appropriate in response.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper To what end?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Hi. Again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Anyway, um. We brought home Indian food. And, um. I know that moving can be stressful, and I find that when I'm undergoing stress, that good food and company can have a comforting effect. Also, curry is a natural laxative, and I don't have to tell you that, uh, a clean colon is just one less thing to worry about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Leonard, I'm not expert here but I believe in the context of a luncheon invitation, you might want to skip the reference to bowel movements.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny Oh, you're inviting me over to eat?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Uh, yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny Oh, that's so nice, I'd love to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny So, what do you guys do for fun around here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Well, today we tried masturbating for money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Okay, well, make yourself at home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny Okay, thankyou.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter You're very welcome.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny This looks like some serious stuff, Leonard, did you do this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Actually that's my work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny Wow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Yeah, well, it's just some quantum mechanics, with a little string theory doodling around the edges. That part there, that's just a joke, it's a spoof of the Bourne-Oppenheimer approximation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny So you're like, one of those, beautiful mind genius guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny This is really impressive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter I have a board. If you like boards, this is my board.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny Holy smokes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper If by holy smokes you mean a derivative restatement of the kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men's room at MIT, sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Oh, come on. Who hasn't seen this differential below 'here I sit broken hearted?'
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter At least I didn't have to invent twenty-six dimensions just to make the math come out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper I didn't invent them, they're there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter In what universe?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper In all of them, that is the point.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny Uh, do you guys mind if I start?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Um, Penny, that's where I sit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny So, sit next to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper No, I sit there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny What's the difference?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper What's the difference?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Here we go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper In the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm, and yet not so close as to cause perspiration. In the summer it's directly in the path of a cross breeze created by open windows there, and there. It faces the television at an angle that is neither direct, thus discouraging conversation, nor so far wide to create a parallax distortion, I could go on, but I think I've made my point.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny Do you want me to move?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Just sit somewhere else.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, sit!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Aaah!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Well, this is nice. We don't have a lot of company over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper That's not true. Koothrapali and Wolowitz come over all the time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Yes I know, but...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Tuesday night we played Klingon boggle until one in the morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Yes, I remember.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper I resent you saying we don't have company.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter I'm sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper That is an antisocial implication.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter I said I'm sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny So, Klingon boggle?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, it's like regular boggle but, in Klingon. That's probably enough about us, tell us about you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny Um, me, okay, I'm Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need to know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion that the Sun's apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined constellations and the time of your birth somehow effects your personality.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny Participate in the what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter I think what Sheldon's trying to say, is that Sagittarius wouldn't have been our first guess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny Oh, yeah, a lot of people think I'm a water sign. Okay, let's see, what else, oh, I'm a vegetarian, oh, except for fish, and the occasional steak, I love steak.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper That's interesting. Leonard can't process corn.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Wu-uh, do you have some sort of a job?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny Oh, yeah, I'm a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Oh, okay. I love cheesecake.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper You're lactose intolerant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter I don't eat it, I just think it's a good idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny Oh, anyways, I'm also writing a screenplay. It's about this sensitive girl who comes to L.A from Lincoln Nebraska to be an actress, and winds up a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter So it's based on your life?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny No, I'm from Omaha.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Well, if that was a movie I would go see it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny I know, right? Okay, let's see, what else? Um, that's about it. That's the story of Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Well it sounds wonderful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny It was. Until I fell in love with a jerk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper What's happening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter I don't know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny Oh God, you know, four years I lived with him, four years, that's like as long as High School.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper It took you four years to get through High School?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Don't.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny I just, I can't believe I trusted him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Should I say something? I feel like I should say something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper You? No, you'll only make it worse.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny You want to know the most pathetic part? Even though I hate his lying, cheating guts, I still love him. Is that crazy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter No, it's not crazy it's, uh, uh, it's a paradox. And paradoxes are part of nature, think about light. Now if you look at Huygens, light is a wave, as confirmed by the double slit experiments, but then, along comes Albert Einstein and discovers that light behaves like particles too. Well, I didn't make it worse.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny Oh, I'm so sorry, I'm such a mess, and on top of everything else I'm all gross from moving and my stupid shower doesn't even work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Our shower works.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny Really? Would it be totally weird if I used it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper No?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter It's right down the hall.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny Thanks. You guys are really sweet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Well, this is an interesting development.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter How so?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper It has been some time since we've had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter That's not true, remember at Thanksgiving my grandmother with Alzheimer's had that episode.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Point taken. It has been some time since we've had a woman take her clothes off after which we didn't want to rip our eyes out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper So, what exactly are you trying to accomplish here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Excuse me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper That woman in there's not going to have sex with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Well I'm not trying to have sex with her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Oh, good. Then you won't be disappointed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter What makes you think she wouldn't have sex with me, I'm a male and she's a female?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Yes, but not of the same species.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter I'm not going to engage in hypotheticals here, I'm just trying to be a good neighbor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Oh, of course.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter That's not to say that if a carnal relationship were to develop that I wouldn't participate. However briefly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered when she discovers your Luke Skywalker no-more-tears shampoo?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter It's Darth Vader shampoo.Luke Skywalker's the conditioner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Wait till you see this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 raj_koothrappali It's fantastic. Unbelievable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter See what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 howard_wolowitz It's a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter This is not a good time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 howard_wolowitz It's before he became a creepy computer voice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter That's great, you guys have to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter It's just not a good time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Leonard has a lady over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Yeah, right, your grandmother back in town?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter No. And she's not a lady, she's just a new neighbor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Hang on, there really is a lady here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Uh-huh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 howard_wolowitz And you want us out because you're anticipating coitus?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter I'm not anticipating coitus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 howard_wolowitz So she's available for coitus?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Can we please stop saying coitus?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Technically that would be coitus interruptus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny Hey, is there a trick to getting it to switch from tub to shower? Oh. Hi, sorry. Hello!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Enchante Madamoiselle. Howard Wolowitz, Cal-Tech department of Applied Physics. You may be familiar with some of my work, it's currently orbiting Jupiter's largest moon taking high-resolution digital photographs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny Penny. I work at the Cheesecake Factory.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Come on, I'll show you the trick with the shower.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Bon douche.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny I'm sorry?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 howard_wolowitz It's French for good shower. It's a sentiment I can express in six languages.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Save it for your blog, Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 howard_wolowitz See-ka-tong-guay-jow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Uh, there it goes, it sticks, I'm sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny Okay. Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter You're welcome, oh, you're going to step right, okay, I'll...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny Hey, Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter The hair products are Sheldon's.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny Um, okay. Can I ask you a favour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter A favour? Sure, you can ask me a favour, I would do you a favour for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny It's okay if you say no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Oh, I'll probably say yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny It's just not the kind of thing you ask a guy you've just met.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Wow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper I really think we should examine the chain of causality here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Must we?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Event A. A beautiful woman stands naked in our shower. Event B. We drive half way across town to retrieve a television set from the aforementioned woman's ex-boyfriend. Query, on what plane of existence is there even a semi-rational link between these events?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter She asked me to do her a favour, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Ah, yes, well that may be the proximal cause of our journey, but we both know it only exists in contradistinction to the higher level distal cause.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Which is?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper You think with your penis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter That's a biological impossibility and you didn't have to come.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Oh, right, yes, I could have stayed behind and watched Wolowitz try to hit on Penny in Russian, Arabic and Farsi. Why can't she get her own TV.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Come on, you know how it is with break-ups.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper No I don't. And neither do you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Wuh, I, I broke up with Joyce Kim.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper You did not break up with Joyce Kim, she defected to North Korea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter To mend her broken heart. This situation is much less complicated. There's some kind of dispute between Penny and her ex-boyfriend as to who gets custody of the TV. She just wanted to avoid having a scene with him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper So we get to have a scene with him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter No, Sheldon, there's not going to be a scene. There's two of us and one of him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Leonard, the two of us can't even carry a TV.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny So, you guys work with Leonard and Sheldon at the University?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny Uh, I'm sorry, do you speak English?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Oh, he speaks English, he just can't speak to women.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny Really, why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 howard_wolowitz He's kind of a nerd. Juice box?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter I'll do the talking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 voice_from_buzzer#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Hi, I'm Leonard, this is Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter What did I just... Uh, we're here to pick up Penny's TV.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 Get lost.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Okay, thanks for your time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter We're not going to give up just like that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Leonard, the TV is in the building, we've been denied access to the building, ergo we are done.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Excuse me, if I were to give up at the first little hitch I never would have been able to identify the fingerprints of string theory in the aftermath of the big bang.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper My apologies. What's your plan.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper It's just a privilege to watch your mind at work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Come on, we have a combined IQ of 360, we should be able to figure out how to get into a stupid building.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper What do you think their combined IQ is?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Just grab the door.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter This is it. I'll do the talking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Good thinking, I'll just be the muscle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 kurt Yeah?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter I'm Leonard, this is Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper From the intercom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 How the hell did you get in the building?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Oh. We're scientists.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Tell him about our IQ.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper My mom bought me those pants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter I'm sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper You're going to have to call her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, I'm so sorry I dragged you through this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper It's okay. It wasn't my first pantsing, and it won't be my last.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter And you were right about my motives, I was hoping to establish a relationship with Penny that might have some day led to sex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Well you got me out of my pants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Anyway, I've learned my lesson. She's out of my league, I'm done with her, I've got my work, one day I'll win the Nobel Prize and then I'll die alone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Don't think like that, you're not going to die alone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Thank you Sheldon, you're a good friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper And you're certainly not going to win a Nobel Prize.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 howard_wolowitz This is one of my favourite places to kick back after a quest, they have a great house ale.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny Wow, cool tiger.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Yeah, I've had him since level ten. His name is Buttons. Anyway, if you had your own game character we could hang out, maybe go on a quest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny Uh, sounds interesting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 howard_wolowitz So you'll think about it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny Oh, I don't think I'll be able to stop thinking about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Smooth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter We're home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny Oh, my God, what happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Well, your ex-boyfriend sends his regards and I think the rest is fairly self-explanatory.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny I'm so sorry, I really thought if you guys went instead of me he wouldn't be such an ass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter No, it was a valid hypothesis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper That was a valid hypothesis? What is happening to you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny Really, thank you so much for going and trying you're, uh, you're so terrific. Why don't you put some clothes on, I'll get my purse and dinner is on me, okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Really? Great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Thank you. You're not done with her, are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Our babies will be smart and beautiful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Not to mention imaginary.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Is Thai food okay with you Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper We can't have Thai food, we had Indian for lunch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny So?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper They're both curry based cuisines.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny So?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper They would be gastronomically redundant. I can see we're going to have to spell out everything for this girl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny Any ideas Raj?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Turn left on Lake Street and head up to Colorado. I know a wonderful little sushi bar that has karaoke.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 penny That sounds like fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Baby, baby don't get hooked on me. Uh, baby, baby don't get hooked on me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode01 sheldon_cooper I don't know what your odds are in the world as a whole, but as far as the population of this car goes, you're a veritable Mack Daddy.
