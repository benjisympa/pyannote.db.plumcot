TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter There you go, Pad Thai, no peanuts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 howard_wolowitz But does it have peanut oil?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Uh, I'm not sure, everyone keep an eye on Howard in case he starts to swell up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Since it's not bee season, you can have my epinephrine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Are there any chopsticks?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper You don't need chopsticks, this is Thai food.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Here we go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Thailand has had the fork since the latter half of the nineteenth century. Interestingly they don't actually put the fork in their mouth, they use it to put the food on a spoon which then goes into their mouth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Ask him for a napkin, I dare you. I'll get it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Do I look puffy? I feel puffy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny Hey Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Oh, hi Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny Am I interrupting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper You're not swelling, Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 howard_wolowitz No, no, look at my fingers, they're like Vienna sausages.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny Sounds like you have company.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter They're not going anywhere. So, you're coming home from work. That's great. How was work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny Well, you know, it's the Cheesecake Factory. People order cheesecake, and I bring it to them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter So, you sort of act as a carbohydrate delivery system.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny Yeah, call it whatever you want, I get minimum wage. Yeah, anyways, I was wondering if you could help me out with something, I was ...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny Oh. Okay, great, I'm having some furniture delivered tomorrow, and I may not be here, so ... Oh! Hel ...hello!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny I'm sorry?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Haven't you ever been told how beautiful you are in flawless Russian?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny No, I haven't.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Get used to it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny Yeah, I probably won't, but ... Hey Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny Hey Raj! Still not talking to me, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Don't take it personally, it's his pathology, he can't talk to women.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 howard_wolowitz He can't talk to attractive women, or in your case a cheesecake-scented Goddess!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter So, there's gonna be some furniture delivered?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny Yeah, yeah, if it gets here and I'm not here tomorrow could you just sign for it and have them put it in my apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, no problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny Great, here's my spare key. Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Penny, wait.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny Yeah?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Um, if you don't have any other plans, do you want to join us for Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny A marathon? Wow, how many Superman movies are there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper You're kidding, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny Yeah, I do like the one where Lois Lane falls from the helicopter and Superman swooshes down and catches her, which one was that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 howard_wolowitz@leonard_hofstadter@sheldon_cooper One.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper You realize that scene was rife with scientific inaccuracy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny Yes, I know, men can't fly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Oh no, let's assume that they can. Lois Lane is falling, accelerating at an initial rate of 32 feet per second per second. Superman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Miss Lane, who is now travelling at approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Unless, Superman matches her speed and decelerates.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper In what space, sir, in what space? She's two feet above the ground. Frankly, if he really loved her, he'd let her hit the pavement. It would be a more merciful death.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Excuse me, your entire argument is predicated on the assumption that Superman's flight is a feat of strength.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Are you listening to yourself, it is well established that Superman's flight is a feat of strength, it is an extension of his ability to leap tall buildings, an ability he derives from Earth's yellow Sun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Yeah, and you don't have a problem with that, how does he fly at night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Uh, a combination of the moon's solar reflection and the energy storage capacity of Kryptonian skin cells.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny I'm just going to go wash up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter I have 26 hundred comic books in there, I challenge you to find a single reference to Kryptonian skin cells.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Challenge accepted. We're locked out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Also, the pretty girl left.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Okay, her apartment's on the fourth floor but the elevator's broken so you're going to have to oh, you're just going to be done, okay, cool, thanks. I guess we'll just bring it up ourselves.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I hardly think so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Well, we don't have a dolly, or lifting belts, or any measurable upper body strength.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter We don't need strength, we're physicists. We are the intellectual descendents of Archimedes. Give me a fulcrum and a lever and I can move the Earth, it's just a matter ... I don't have this ... I don't have this I don't have this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Archimedes would be so proud.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Do you have any ideas?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Yes, but they all involve a green lantern and a power ring.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Easy, easy Okay! Now we've got an inclined plane. The force required to lift is reduced by the sine of the angle of the stairs, call it thirty degrees, so about half.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Exactly half.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Exactly half. Let's push. Okay, see, it's moving, this is easy, all in the math.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper What's your formula for the corner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter What? Oh, okay, uh, okay, yeah, no problem, just come up here and help me pull and turn.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Ah, gravity, thou art a heartless bitch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper You do understand that our efforts here will in no way increase the odds of you having sexual congress with this woman?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Men do things for women without expecting sex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Yeah, those are men who just had sex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter I'm doing this to be a good neighbor. In any case, there's no way it could lower the odds.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Almost there, almost there, almost there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper No we're not, no we're not, no we're not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Watch your fingers. Watch your fingers. Oh God, my fingers!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter You okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper No, it hurt ... Great Caesar's Ghost, look at this place?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter So Penny's a little messy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper A little messy? The Mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy, this is chaos. Excuse me, explain to me an organizational system where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid. I'm just inferring that this is a couch, because the evidence suggests the coffee table's having a tiny garage sale.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Did it ever occur to you that not everyone has the compulsive need to sort, organize and label the entire world around them?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Well they don't. Hard as it may be for you to believe, most people don't sort their breakfast cereal numerically by fiber content.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Excuse me, but I think we've both found that helpful at times.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Come on, we should go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Hang on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Straightening up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, this is not your home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper This is not anyone's home, this is a swirling vortex of entropy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter When the transvestite lived here, you didn't care how he kept the place.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Because it was immaculate, I mean, you open that man's closet, it was left to right, evening gowns, cocktail dresses, then his police uniforms.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter What were you doing in his closet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I helped run some cable for a webcam.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny Hey guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Oh, hey Penny, this just arrived, we just brought this up, just now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny Great. Was it hard getting it up the stairs?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper No?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Well, we'll get out of your hair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny Oh, great, thank you again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Penny, I just want you to know that, you don't have to live like this. I'm here for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny What's he talking about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter It's a joke.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny I don't get it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, he didn't tell it right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon? Hello?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Sssshhhh! Penny's sleeping.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Are you insane, you can't just break into a woman's apartment in the middle of the night and clean.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I had no choice. I couldn't sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom was our living room, and just outside our living room was that hallway, and immediately adjacent to that hallway was ... this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Do you realize that if Penny wakes up, there is no reasonable explanation as to why we're here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I just gave you a reasonable explanation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter No, no. You gave me an explanation, it's reasonableness will be determined by a jury of your peers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Don't be ridiculous. I have no peers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, we have to get out of here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper You might want to speak in a lower register.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Evolution has made women sensitive to high pitched noises while they sleep, so that they'll be roused by a crying baby. If you want to avoid waking her, speak in a lower register.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter That's ridiculous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper No, that's ridiculous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Fine. I accept your premise, now please let's go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I am not leaving until I'm done.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter O-o-o-oh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper If you have time to lean, you have time to clean.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Oh, what the hell.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I have to say, I slept splendidly. Granted, not long, but just deeply and well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter I'm not surprised. A well known folk cure for insomnia is to break into your neighbor's apartment and clean.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Sarcasm?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter You think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Granted, my methods may have been somewhat unorthodox, but I think the end result will be a measurable enhancement of Penny's quality of life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter You know what, you've convinced me, maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo her carpet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper You don't think that crosses a line?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Yes! For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign every time I open my mouth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper You have a sarcasm sign?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter No, I do not have a sarcasm sign.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Do you want some cereal. I'm feeling so good today I'm going to choose from the low fiber end of the shelf. Hello, Honey Puffs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny Son of a Bitch!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Penny's up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny You sick, geeky bastards!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter How did she know it was us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I may have left a suggested organizational schematic for her bedroom closet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny Leonard!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter God, this is going to be bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Goodbye, Honey Puffs, hello Big Bran.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny You came into my apartment last night when I was sleeping?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Yes, but, only to clean.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Really more to organize, you're not actually dirty, per se.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny Give me back my key.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter I'm very, very sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny Do you understand how creepy this is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Oh, yes, we discussed it at length last night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny In my apartment, while I was sleeping.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper And snoring. And that's probably just a sinus infection, but it could be sleep apnoea, you might want to see an otolaryngologist. It's a throat doctor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Depending on the depth, that's either a proctologist or a general surgeon. Oh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny God!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Okay, look, no Penny, I think what you're feeling is perfectly valid, and maybe a little bit later today when you're feeling a little bit less, for lack of a better word, violated, maybe we could talk about this some more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny Stay away from me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Sure, that's another way to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Penny, Penny, just to clarify because there will be a discussion when you leave, is your objection solely to our presence in the apartment while you were sleeping, or do you also object to the imposition of a new organizational paradigm. Well that was a little non-responsive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter You are going to march yourself over there right now and apologize. What's funny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper That wasn't sarcasm?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Wooh, boy, you are all over the place this morning. I have a masters and two PhD's, I should not have to do this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I am truly sorry for what happened last night, I take full responsibility. And I hope that it won't color your opinion of Leonard, who is not only a wonderful guy, but also, I hear, a gentle and thorough lover. I did what I could.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny Hey Raj. Hey, listen, I don't know if you heard about what happened last night with Leonard and Sheldon, but I'm really upset about it, I mean they just, they let themselves into my place, and then they cleaned it, I mean can you even believe that? How weird is that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Ooh, she's standing very close to me. Oh my, she does smell good. What is that, vanilla?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny You know, where I come from, someone comes into your house at night, you shoot, okay? And you don't shoot to wound. I mean, alright, my sister shot her husband, but it was an accident, they were drunk. What was I saying?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 raj_koothrappali She's so chatty. Maybe my parents are right. Maybe I'd be better off with an Indian girl. We'd have the same cultural background, and my wife would sing to my children the same lullabies my mother sang to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny It's obvious that they meant well, but I'm just, I'm having a really rough time, like I said, I broke up with my boyfriend, and it's just freaking me out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny I mean, just because most of the men I've known in my life happen to be jerks, doesn't mean I should just assume Leonard and Sheldon are. Right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 raj_koothrappali She asked me a question. I should probably nod.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny That's exactly what I thought. Thank you for listening. You're a doll.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Oh-oh. Turn your pelvis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Grab a napkin, homie. You just got served.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter It's fine. You win.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 howard_wolowitz What's his problem?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Been there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Hello. Sorry I'm late. But I was in the hallway, chatting up Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Really? You? Rajesh Koothrapali, spoke to Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Actually, I was less the chatter than the chattee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter What did she say? Is she still mad at me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Well, she was upset at first, but, probably because her sister shot somebody. Then there was something about you and ... then she hugged me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 howard_wolowitz She hugged you? How did she hug you? Is that her perfume I smell?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 raj_koothrappali intoxicating, isn't it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny What's going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Um, here's the thing. Penny. Just as Oppenheimer came to regret his contributions to the first atomic bomb, so too I regret my participation in what was, at the very least, an error in judgment. The hallmark of the great human experiment is the willingness to recognize one's mistakes. Some mistakes, such as Madame Curie's discovery of Radium turned out to have great scientific potential even though she would later die a slow, painful death from radiation poisoning. Another example, from the field of ebola research ...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny We're okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Six two inch dowels.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Check.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter One package, Phillips head screws.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Check.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny Guys, seriously, I grew up on a farm, okay, I rebuilt a tractor engine when I was like twelve, I think I can put together a cheap Swedish media center.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter No, please, we insist, it's the least we can do considering.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Considering what? How great this place looks?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Oh boy, I was afraid of this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 howard_wolowitz These instructions are a pictographic representation of the least imaginative way to assemble these components. This right here is why Sweden has no space program.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny Well, uh, it looked pretty good in the store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter It is an inefficient design, for example Penny has a flat screen TV, which means all the space behind it is wasted.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper We could put her stereo back there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter And control it how?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Run an infra-red repeater, photocell here, emitter here, easy peasy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Good point, how you gonna cool it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny Hey guys, I got this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Hang on Penny. How about fans, here and here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Also inefficient, and might be loud.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 howard_wolowitz How about liquid coolant? Maybe a little aquarium pump here, run some quarter inch PVC ...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny Guys, this is actually really simple.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Hold on, honey, men at work. The PVC comes down here, maybe a little corrugated sheet metal as a radiator here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Oh, really, show me where we put a drip tray, a sluice and an overflow reservoir?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper And if water is involved we're going to have to ground the crap out of the thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny Guys, it's hot in here, I think I'll just take off all my clothes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Oh, I've got it. How about if we replace panels A, B and F and crossbar H with aircraft grade aluminium.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Right, then the entire thing's one big heat sink.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Perfect, Leonard, why don't you and Sheldon go down to the junk yard and pick up about six square meters of scrap aluminium, Raj and I will run down to my lab and get the oxy-acetaline torch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Meet back here in an hour?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Done.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Got it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode02 penny Okay, this place does look pretty good.
