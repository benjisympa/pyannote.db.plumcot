TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 howard Alright, just a few more feet, and... here we are gentlemen, the Gates of Elzebub.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon Good lord!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 raj Oooh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Don't panic, this is what the last 97 hours have been about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 howard Stay frosty, there's a horde of armed goblins on the other side of that gate guarding the Sword of Azeroth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Warriors, unsheathe your weapons, magic wielders raise your wands.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon Lock and load. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 howard Raj, blow up the gates.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 raj Blowing the gates. Control, shift, B! Oh, my God, so many goblins!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 howard Don't just stand there, slash and move, slash and move.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Stay in formation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 howard Leonard, you've got one on your tail.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard That's alright, my tail's prehensile, I'll swat him off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 raj I've got him Leonard. Tonight I spice my meat with goblin blood!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Raj, no, it's a trap, they're flanking us!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 raj Oooh, he's got me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 howard Sheldon, he's got Raj, use your sleath spell. Sheldon! Sheldon!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon I've got the Sword of Azeroth!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Forget the sword, Sheldon, help Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon There is no more Sheldon, I am the Swordmaster!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 howard Leonard look out!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Dammit man, we're dying here. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon Goodbye, peasants. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard The bastard teleported. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 raj He's selling the Sword of Azeroth on ebay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard You betrayed us for money, who are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon I'm a rogue knight elf, don't you people read character descriptions? Wait, wait, wait, somebody just clicked 'buy it now.'
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 howard I am the Swordmaster!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon Wooh, I'm all sweaty, anybody want to log on to second life and go swimming, I just built a virtual pool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard No, I can't look at you or your avatar right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 howard Sounds like your neighbor's home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Excuse me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon Don't forget the mail you took accidentally on purpose so you'd have an excuse to talk to her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Oh, right, right right right right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 howard Stealing snail mail, very old school, I like it. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Penny, the mailman did it again, he... Oh! Sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 penny Um, no, hi Leonard, this is Doug, Doug, this is my neighbor Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 doug What's up bro.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Not much. Bro. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 penny Is, is everything okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Uh, yeah, uh, I just, I got your mail again, here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 penny Thank you, I've got to talk to that mailman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Oh no, that's probably not such a good idea. Civil servants have a documented propensity to, you know, snap. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 penny Okay, well, thank you, again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard No problem. Bye. Oh, and, bye, bro!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon Penny for your thoughts. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 raj What's the matter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard No, I'm fine. Penny's fine, the guy she's kissing is really fine and...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 howard Kissing, what kind of kissing? Cheeks? Lips? Chaste? French? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard What is wrong with you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 howard I'm a romantic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon Please don't tell me that your hopeless infatuation is devolving into pointless jealousy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard No, I'm not jealous, I'm just a little concerned for her. I didn't like the look of the guy that she was with.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 howard Because he looked better than you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Yeah. He was kinda dreamy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon Well, at least now you can retrieve the black box from the twisted smouldering wreckage that was once your fantasy of dating her, and analyze the data so that you don't crash into geek mountain again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 howard I disagree, love is not a sprint, it's a marathon. A relentless pursuit that only ends when she falls into your arms. Or hits you with the pepper spray. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Well, I'm done with Penny. I'm going to be more realistic and go after someone my own speed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 raj Like who?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard I don't know. Olivia Geiger?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon The dietician at the cafeteria with the limp and the lazy eye?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon Well, I don't think you have a shot there. I have noticed that Lesley Winkle recently started shaving her legs. Now, given that winter is coming one can only assume that she is signalling sexual availability. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 howard I don't know, you guys work in the same lab.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard So?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 howard There are pitfalls, trust me, I know. When it comes to sexual harassment law I'm... a bit of a self-taught expert. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Look, Howard, if I were to ask Lesley Winkle out it would just be for dinner, I'm not going to walk into the lab, ask her to strip naked and dance for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 howard Oh, then you're probably okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Hello Lesley.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 lesley Hi Leonard. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Lesley I would like to propose an experiment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 lesley Goggles, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Right. Lesley, I would like to propose an experiment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 lesley Hang on. I'm trying to see how long it takes a five hundred kilowatt oxygen iodine laser to heat up my cup o' noodles.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Pfff, I've done it, about two seconds, 2.6 for minestrone. Anyway, I was thinking more of a bio-social exploration with a neuro-chemical overlay. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 lesley Wait, are you asking me out?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard I was going to characterise it as the modification of our colleague/friendship paradigm, with the addition of a date-like component. But we don't need to quibble over terminology. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 lesley What sort of experiment would you propose?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard There is a generally accepted pattern in this area, I would pick you up, take you to a restaurant, then we would see a movie, probably a romantic comedy featuring the talents of Hugh Grant or Sandra Bullock. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 lesley Interesting. And would you agree that the primary way we would evaluate either the success or failure of the date would be based on the bio-chemical reaction during the goodnight kiss.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Heartrate, pheromones, etc, yes. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 lesley Well, why don't we just stipulate that the date goes well and move to the key variable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard You mean, kiss you now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 lesley Yes. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Can you define the parameters of the kiss?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 lesley Closed mouth but romantic. Mint?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Thank you. . Shall I count down from three?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 lesley No, I think it needs to be spontaneous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 lesley What do you think.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard You proposed the experiment, I think you should present your findings first.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 lesley Fair enough. On the plus side, it was a good kiss, reasonable technique, no extraneous spittle. On the other hand, no arousal. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard None?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 lesley None.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Ah. Well, thank you for your time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 lesley Thank you. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard None at all?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 howard Sheldon, if you were a robot, and I knew and you didn't, would you want me to tell you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon That depends. When I learn that I'm a robot, will I be able to handle it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 howard Maybe, although the history of science-fiction is not on your side. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon Uh, let me ask you this. When I learn that I'm a robot, would I be bound by Asimov's three laws of robotics?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 raj You might be bound by them right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 howard That's true. Have you ever harmed a human being, or through inaction allowed a human being to come to harm?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon Of course not. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 howard Have you ever harmed yourself, or allowed yourself to be harmed except in cases where a human being would have been endangered?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon Well, no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 howard I smell robot. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Hey, what's going on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon The internet's been down for half an hour. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 raj Also, Sheldon may be a robot. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 howard So, how did it go with Lesley? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Oh, we tried kissing, but the earth didn't move. I mean any more than the 383 miles that it was going to move anyway. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon Oh, I've seen that look before. This is just going to be two weeks of moping and tedious emo songs, and calling me to come down to pet stores to look at cats. I don't know if I can take it. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 raj You could power down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 howard Well, as usual, Wolowitz has the solution. I happen to know a place where there are plenty of eligible women, and Leonard could have his pick.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 class_instructor Remember the Latin hips. Shoulders stay still, and we sway. One two three. Five six seven. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 howard I think Mrs Tishman's got her eye on you. I've been there, you're in for a treat. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon Oh, good lord.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard You don't know me, you don't wear my chains... God, that's a good song. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon If you're compiling a mix CD for a double suicide.Oh, I hope that scratching post is for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard I know what you're thinking, I've taken your asthma into account. There's a feline geneticist in San Diego who has developed the cutest little hypo-allergenic calicos. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon Leonard, listen to me...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard I've been thinking about names, I'm kind of torn between Einstein, Newton and Sergeant Fuzzyboots. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon Leonard, do you really think you can satisfy your need for a relationship with a genetically altered cat?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Maybe, if it's a cute little cuddly cat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon Oh, come on, Leonard! This is obviously about Penny. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard It doesn't matter. The woman's not interested in me, the woman rejected me. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon Okay, look, I think that you have as much of a chance of having a sexual relationship with Penny as the Hubble Telescope does of discovering at the center of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight searching for a circuit breaker. Nevertheless, I do feel obligated to point out to you that she did no reject you. You did not ask her out. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard You're right. I didn't ask her out, I should ask her out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon No. No, now that was not my point. My point was, don't buy a cat. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard No, but you're right. I should march over there and ask her out. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon Oh, goody, we're getting a cat. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 penny Ah, hey Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Good afternoon Penny, so hi, hey. Uh... I was wondering if you had plans for dinner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 penny Uh, do you mean dinner tonight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard There is an inherent ambiguity in the word dinner. Technically it refers to the largest meal of the day whenever it is consumed, so, to clarify here, by dinner I mean supper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 penny Supper?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Or dinner. I was thinking six thirty, if you can go, or a different time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 penny Uh, six thirty's great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Really? Great!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 penny Yeah, I like hanging out with you guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Us guys?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 penny You know, Sheldon, Howard, Raj, who all's coming?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard They... might all be there. Or a subset of them might be there, uh, algebraically speaking there are too many unknowns, for example Sheldon had Quizznos for lunch, sometimes he finds that filling, other times he doesn't, it's no fault of Quizznos, they have a varied menu.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 penny Okay, whatever, it sounds like fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Great. Did we say a time?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 penny Six thirty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard And that's still good for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 penny It's fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Cos it's not carved in stone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 penny No, six thirty's great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard I'll get my chisel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 penny Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard To... carve the... okay, I'll see you six thirty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard How do I look?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon Could you be more specific?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Can you tell I'm perspiring a little?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon No. The dark crescent-shaped patterns under your arms conceal it nicely. What time is your date?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Six thirty. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon Perfect, that gives you two hours and fifteen minutes for that dense molecular cloud of Aramis to dissipate. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Is it too much?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon Not if you're a rugby team. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard By the way, if it should ever come up, you didn't join us because you stuffed yourself with a chicken carbonara sub at Quizznos. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon Why would I join you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard No reason. Oh, you know what, maybe this isn't such a good idea. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon Oh, no, no, no, well now, there's always the possibility that alcohol and poor judgment on her part might lead to a nice romantic evening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard You're right, alcohol, poor judgment, it could go well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon Of course, there's the other possibility that this date kicks off a rather unpleasant six months of the two of you passing awkwardly in the hall until one of you breaks down and moves to another zip code.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard You could have stopped at 'it could go well.'
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon If I could of, I would of. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard I mean, I'm a perfectly nice guy. There's no reason we couldn't go to the restaurant and have a lovely dinner. Maybe take a walk afterwards, talk about things we have in common, 'you love pottery? I love pottery!' You know, there's a pause, we both know what's happening, I lean in, we kiss, it's a little tentative at first but then I realize, she's kissing me back, and she's biting my lower lip, you know, she wants me, this thing is going the distance, we're going to have sex! Oh God! Oh, my God!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon Is the sex starting now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard I'm having a panic attack.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon Oh, okay, well then, calm down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard If I could calm down I wouldn't be having a panic attack, that's why they call it a panic attack.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon Alright, alright, well, just, sit down, yes, sit down, now close your eyes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon Just do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon Now try to increase your alpha-wave activity.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon It's a bio-feedback technique, it's relaxation through brain-wave manipulation, I read a paper about it in the Journal of American Neuroscience, it was a little sparsely sourced but I think the basic science is valid, I probably have it here somewhere.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Oh, who am I kidding, I can't go through with this, you need to call her and cancel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon Me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon What should I tell her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard I don't know. Tell her I'm sick.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Not the kind of illness that will make her want to come over and take care of me, but nothing so critical that she'll feel uncomfortable going out with me in the future if I want to try this again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon Got it. So I'm assuming nothing venereal. I'll just tell her that you had a routine colonoscopy and haven't quite bounced back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Give me the phone. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon But I thought you wanted to cancel?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard I can't because if I don't show up she'll still be expecting you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon Why would she be expecting me? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Stop asking me all these questions, I need to take another shower.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 penny So are the rest of the guys meeting us here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Oh, yeah, no. Turns out that Raj and Howard had to work, and Sheldon had a colonoscopy and he hasn't quite bounced back yet. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 penny Ooh, my uncle just had a colonoscopy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard You're kidding, well, then, that's something we have in common. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 penny How?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard We both have people in our lives who... want to nip intestinal polyps in the bud. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 penny So, what's new in the world of physics?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Nothing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 penny Really, nothing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Well, with the exception of string theory, not much has happened since the 1930's, and you can't prove string theory, at best you can say 'hey, look, my idea has an internal logical consistency.'
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 penny Ah. Well I'm sure things will pick up. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard What's new at the Cheesecake Factory?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 penny Oh, uh, not much. We do have a chocolate key lime that's moving pretty well. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Good. Good. And what about your, uh, hallway friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 penny Doug? Oh, yeah, I dunno, I mean, he's nice and funny, but...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 waitress Can I get you started with some drinks?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard No, You were saying, but...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 penny I'd like a drink.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Just say the but thing about Doug and then I'll get her back. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 penny Okay, well, you know, it's just me. I'm still getting over this break-up with Kurt, and this thing with Doug would be just rebound sex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Ugh, don't get me started on rebound sex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 penny It's just, it's my pattern. I break up, then I find some cute guy, and then it's just thirty six meaningless of... well, you know. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard I'm not sure that I do. Um, is that one thirty-six hour experience, or is it thirty six hours spread out over say, one... glorious summer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 penny No, it's usually over a weekend, and trust me, you do not feel good after it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Well, chafing, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 penny Emotionally.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Of course, yeah, emotional chafing. Hey, do you want to see something cool? I can make this olive go into this glass without touching it. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 penny How?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Physics.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 penny Wow, centrifugal force!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Actually, it's centripetal force, which is an inward force generated by the glass acting on the olive. Excuse me. Now, if you were riding on the olive, you'd be in a non-inertial reference frame, and would 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 penny Are you okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Yeah, I'm okay. Did you spill ketchup?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard I'm not okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 penny Are you sure you don't want to go to the emergency room?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard No, no, I'm okay, it's stopped bleeding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 penny I know, but you did throw up. Isn't that a sign of a concussion?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Yes, but I get car sick too, so...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 penny Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Sorry about your car, by the way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 penny Oh, no, it's fine, you got most of it out the window. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard The poor guy on the bike. I had a nice time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 penny Yeah, me too. Um, good night. Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 penny Was this supposed to be a date?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard This? No. No, of course not, this was just you and me hanging out with a bunch of guys who didn't show up, because of work and a colonoscopy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 penny Okay, I was just checking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard When I take a girl out on a date, and I do, she knows she's been dated. Capital D. Bold face, underline, like Day-ted. I think I might have a little concussion, I'm going to go lay down for a while, good night. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon So, how was your date?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 leonard Awesome!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode03 sheldon Score one for liquor and poor judgment.
