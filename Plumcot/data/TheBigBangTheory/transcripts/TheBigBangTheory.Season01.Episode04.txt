TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper I've been thinking about time travel again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Why, did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Put it on the back burner. Anyway, it occurs to me, if I ever did perfect a time machine, I'd just go into the past and give it to myself, thus eliminating the need for me to invent it in the first place.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Interesting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Yeah, it really takes the pressure off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Sounds like a breakthrough, should I call the science magazines and tell them to hold the front cover?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper It's time travel, Leonard, I will have already done that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Then I guess congratulations are in order.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper No, congratulations will have been in order. You know, I'm not going to enjoy this party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter I know, I'm familiar with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper At the last department party, Dr Finkleday cornered me and talked about spelunking for 45 minutes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Yes, I was there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper You know what's interesting about caves, Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Nothing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Well then we'll avoid Finkleday, we'll meet the new department head, congratulate him, shake his hand and go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper How's this? Pleased to meet you, Dr Gablehouser. How fortunate for you that the University has chosen to hire you, despite the fact that you've done no original research in 25 years, and instead have written a series of popular books that reduce the great concepts of science to a series of anecdotes, each one dumbed down to accommodate the duration of an average bowel movement. Mahalo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Mahalo's a nice touch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Do you know there are only eight consonants in the Hawaiian language.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Interesting, you should lead with that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Oh, God, Look at this buffet. I love America.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter You don't have buffets in India?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Of course, but it's all Indian food. You can't find a bagel in Mumbai to save your life. Schmear me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Well here's an interesting turn of events.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter What. Howard brought a date?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper A more plausible explanation is that his work in robotics has made an amazing leap forward.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Hey, what up, science bitches? May I introduce my special lady friend, Summer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 summer I already told you, touching's extra.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Right. Sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Here comes our new boss, be polite.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 dr_eric_gablehauser Hi fellas, Eric Gablehouser.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Howard Wolowitz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 dr_eric_gablehauser Howard, nice to meet you, and you are?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper An actual real scientist. How was that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper I can't believe he fired me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Well, you did call him a glorified high-school science teacher whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper In my defence, I prefaced that by saying 'with all due respect.'
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Morning
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter You're making eggs for breakfast?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper This isn't breakfast, it's an experiment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Huh? Cos it looks a lot like breakfast.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper I finally have the time to test my hypothesis, about the separation of the water molecules from the egg proteins, and its impact vis-a-vis taste.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Sounds yummy. I look forward to your work with bacon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper As do I.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter You know, I'm sure if you just apologized to Gablehauser he would give you your job back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper I don't want my job back. I've spent the last three and a half years staring at greaseboards full of equations. Before that I spent four years working on my thesis. Before that I was in college, and before that, I was in the fifth grade. This is my first day off in decades, and I'm going to savour it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Okay. I'll let you get back to fixing your eggs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper I'm not just fixing my eggs, I'm fixing everyone's eggs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter And we all thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Use new eggs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 penny Hi, hey. I'm running out to the market, do you guys need anything?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Oh, well this would be one of those circumstances that people unfamiliar with the law of large numbers would call a coincidence.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 penny I'm sorry?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper I need eggs. Four dozen should suffice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 penny Four dozen?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Yes, and evenly distributed amongst brown, white, free range, large, extra-large and jumbo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 penny Okay, one more time?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Never mind, you won't get it right, I'd better come with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 penny Oh, yay!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 penny How come you didn't go into work today.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper I'm taking a sabbatical, because I won't kow-tow to mediocre minds.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 penny So you got canned, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Theoretical physicists do not get canned. But yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 penny Well, maybe it's all for the best, you know I always say, when one door closes, another one opens.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper No it doesn't. Not unless the two doors are connected by relays, or there are motion sensors involved.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 penny No, no, I meant...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Or the first door closing causes a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 penny Never mind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Slow down. Slow down, please slow down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 penny We're fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Look, you're not leaving yourself enough space between cars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 penny Oh, sure I am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper No, no. Let me do the math for you, this car weighs let's say 4,000lb, now add say 140 for me, 120 for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 penny 120?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Oh, I'm sorry, did I insult you? Is your body mass somehow tied into your self worth?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 penny Well, yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Interesting. Anyway, that gives us a total weight of, let's say, 4,400lb.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 penny Let's say 4,390.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Fine. We're travelling forward at, good Lord, 51 miles an hour. Now let's assume that your brakes are new and the callipers are aligned, still, by the time we come to a stop, we'll be occupying the same space as that Buick in front of us, an impossibility that nature will quickly resolve into death, mutilation and... oh look, they built a new put-put course.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper This is great. Look at me, out in the real world of ordinary people, just living their ordinary, colourless, workaday lives.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 penny Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper No, thank you. And thank you, ordinary person. Hey, you want to hear an interesting thing about tomatoes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 penny Uh, no, no not really. Listen, didn't you say you needed some eggs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Uh, yes, but anyone who knows anything about the dynamics of bacterial growth knows to pick up their refrigerated foods on the way out of the supermarket.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 penny Oh, okay, well maybe you should start heading on out then.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper No, this is fun. Oh, the thing about tomatoes, and I think you'll really enjoy this, is, they're shelved with the vegetables, but they're technically a fruit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 penny Interesting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Isn't it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 penny No, I mean what you find enjoyable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Oh boy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 penny What now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Well, there's some value to taking a multivitamin, but the human body can only absorb so much, what you're buying here are the ingredients for very expensive urine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 penny Well, maybe that's what I was going for.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Well then you'll want some manganese.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper That was fun. Maybe tomorrow we can go to one of those big warehouse stores.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 penny Oh, I don't know Sheldon, it's going to take me a while to recover from all the fun I had today.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Are you sure. There are a lot of advantages to buying in bulk. For example, I noticed that you purchase your tampons one month's supply at a time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Well think about it, it's a product that doesn't spoil, and you're going to be needing them for at least the next thirty years.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 penny You want me to buy thirty years worth of tampons?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Well, thirty, thirty five, hey, when did your mother go into menopause?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 penny Okay, I'm not talking about this with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Oh, Penny, this is a natural human process, and we're talking about statistically significant savings. Now, if you assume 15 tampons per cycle and a 28 day cycle, are you fairly regular? Okay, no warehouse store, but we're still on for put-put golf, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Hey, I just ran into Penny, she seemed upset about something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper I think it's her time of the month. I marked the calendar for future reference.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter What's with the fish?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper It's an experiment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter What happened to your scrambled egg research?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Oh, that was a dead end. Scrambled eggs are as good as they're ever going to be.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter So... fish.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper I read an article about Japanese scientists, who inserted DNA from luminous jellyfish into other animals, and I thought hey, fish nightlights.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Fish nightlights.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper It's a billion dollar idea. Shhhhh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Mum's the word. Sheldon, are you sure you don't want to just apologize to Gablehauser and get your job back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Oh, no, no, no. No, I've too much to do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Like luminous fish.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Shhhhh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Right... I didn't...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper That's just the beginning. I also have an idea for a bulk mail-order feminine hygiene company. Oh, glow in the dark tampons! Leonard, we're going to be rich.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Thank you for coming on such short notice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 mary_cooper You did the right thing calling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter I didn't know what else to do, he's lost all focus, every day he's got a new obsession. This is a particularly disturbing one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Mommy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 mary_cooper Hi baby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper You called my mother?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 mary_cooper Oh, you got yourself a loom, how nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 mary_cooper Honey, why did you get a loom?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper I was working with luminous fish, and I thought, hey, loom! Mom, what are you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 mary_cooper Leonard called me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper I know, but why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Because one of the great minds of the twenty-first century is raising glow-in-the-dark fish and weaving sarapes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper This is not a sarape. This is a poncho. A sarape is open at the sides, a poncho is closed, this is a poncho, and neither is a reason to call someone's mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Really, when was the last time you left the house.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper I went to the market with Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter That was three weeks ago.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Well then buckle up, in the next four to eight days she's going to get very crabby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 mary_cooper Sweetheart, your little friend is concerned about you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Yes, well I'm not a child, I'm a grown man capable of living my life as I see fit. And I certainly don't need someone telling on me to my mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Where are you going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper To my room, and no-one's allowed in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 mary_cooper He gets his temper from his daddy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 mary_cooper He's got my eyes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter I see.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 mary_cooper All that science stuff, that comes from Jesus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon? Your mom made dinner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper I'm not hungry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 mary_cooper Oh, Leonard, don't trouble yourself, he's stubborn. He may stay in there 'til the Rapture.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 penny Are we so sure that's a bad thing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 mary_cooper I'll tell ya, I love the boy to death, but he has been difficult since he fell out of me at the K-Mart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Excuse me for being so bold, but I now see where Sheldon gets his smouldering good looks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 mary_cooper Oh, honey that ain't going to work, but you keep trying. I made chicken, I hope that isn't one of the animals that you people think is magic? You know, we have an Indian gentleman at our church, a Dr Patel, it's a beautiful story, the lord spoke to him, and moved him to give us all 20% off on lasic, you know, those that needed it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter That is a lovely story, um, are we going to do anything about Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 mary_cooper Oh, we will, you have to take your time with Sheldon. His father, God rest his soul, used to say to me, Mary, you have to take your time with Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Sounds like a wise man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 mary_cooper Oh, not so wise, he was trying to fight a bobcat for some licquorish. So, everybody grab a plate, and a pretty place mat that Shelly wove.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 penny Has Shelly ever freaked out like this before.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 mary_cooper Oh, all the time, I remember one summer when he was thirteen, he built a small nuclear reactor in the shed and told everybody he was going to provide free electricity for the whole town, well the only problem was he had no, whatchacall, fissionable materials. Anyway, when he went on the internets to get some, a man from the government came by and sat him down real gentle and told him it's against the law to have yellow cake uranium in a shed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 penny What happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 mary_cooper Well, the poor boy had a fit, locked himself in his room and built a sonic death ray.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter A death ray?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 mary_cooper Well, that's what he called it, didn't even slow down the neighbor kids. It pissed our dog off to no end. You know, you two make a cute couple.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter No, we're not, we're not, not a couple, two singles, like those individually wrapped slices of cheese that... are friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 mary_cooper Did I pluck a nerve there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Oh yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 mary_cooper Okay. Alright everybody, it's time to eat. Oh Lord, we thank you for this meal, all your bounty, and we pray that you help Sheldon get back on his rocker. Now after a moment of silent meditation I'm going to end with 'In Jesus' Name' but you two don't feel any obligation to join in. Unless, of course, the holy spirit moves you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 penny Oh my God, this is the best cobbler I've ever had.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 mary_cooper It was always Sheldon' s favorite. You know what the secret ingredient is?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 penny Love?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 mary_cooper Lard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Hey, look who's come out...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 mary_cooper Shhh! You'll spook him. He's like a baby deer, you gotta let him come to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter This is ridiculous. Dammit, Sheldon, snap out of it. You're a physicist, you belong at the University doing research, not hiding in your room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 mary_cooper You don't hunt, do you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 mary_cooper Good morning, snicker-doodle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 mary_cooper Oh, well that looks awful fancy, what is that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper It's my idea of what DNA would look like in a silicon based life form.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 mary_cooper But intelligently designed by a creator, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper What do you want, mom?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 mary_cooper You know how your daddy used to say that you can only fish for so long before you got to throw a stick of dynamite in the water?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 mary_cooper Well, I'm done fishing. You put those on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper What for?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 mary_cooper Because you're going to go down to your office, you're going to apologize to your boss, and get your job back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 mary_cooper I'm sorry, did I start that sentence with the words 'if it please your highness?'
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper I'm not going to apologize, I didn't say anything that wasn't true.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 mary_cooper Now you listen here, I have been telling you since you were four years old, it's okay to be smarter than everybody but you can't go around pointing it out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 mary_cooper Because people don't like it. Remember all the ass-kickings you got from the neighbor kids? Now let's get cracking. Shower, shirt, shoes, and let's shove off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Wouldn't have been any ass-kickings if that stupid death ray had worked.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 mary_cooper Problem solved.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Really? That's impressive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 mary_cooper Leonard, the Lord never gives us more than we can handle. Thankfully he blessed me with two other children who are dumb as soup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 mary_cooper Excuse me, Dr Gablehouser, are you busy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 dr_eric_gablehauser Well, actually...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 mary_cooper Sheldon, he's just doodling, get in here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Dr Gablehouser.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 dr_eric_gablehauser Dr Cooper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 mary_cooper Let's go, baby, we're losing daylight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Um, as you know, several weeks ago in our first encounter we may have gotten off on the wrong foot, when I called you an idiot. And I just wanted to say that I was wrong. To point it out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 dr_eric_gablehauser I'm sorry, we haven't been introduced. Dr Eric Gablehouser.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 mary_cooper Mary Cooper, Sheldon's mom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 dr_eric_gablehauser Now that's impossible, you must have had him when you were a teenager.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 mary_cooper Oh, aren't you sweet, his father's dead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 dr_eric_gablehauser Recently?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 mary_cooper Long enough.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 dr_eric_gablehauser Please. Sheldon, shouldn't you be working?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Hey, how did it go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper I got my job back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Really? What happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper I'm not quite sure. It involves a part of the human experience that has always eluded me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter That narrows it down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 mary_cooper I'm very proud of you honey, you showed a lot of courage today.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Thanks, mom. Mom?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 mary_cooper Mmm-hmm?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Is Dr Gablehouser going to be my new daddy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode04 mary_cooper We'll see. Sleep tight.
