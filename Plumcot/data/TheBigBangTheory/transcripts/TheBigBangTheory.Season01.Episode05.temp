TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon Alright, I'm moving my infantry division, augmented by a battalion of Orcs from Lord of the Rings, we flank the Tennessee Volunteers, and the North once again wins the Battle of Gettysburg.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 howard Not so fast, remember the South still has two infantry divisions, plus Superman and Godzilla.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard No, no, no, no, Orcs are magic, Superman is vulnerable to magic, not to mention, you already lost Godzilla to the Illinois Cavalry and Hulk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 raj Why don't you just have Robert E. Lee charge the line with Shiva and Ganesh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Hi, you guys ready to order?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 howard Hang on, honey. Shiva and Ganesh? The Hindu Gods against the entire Union army?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard And Orcs!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny I'll be back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 raj Excuse me, Ganesh is the remover of obstacles, and Shiva is the destroyer. When the smoke clears, Abraham Lincoln will be speaking Hindi and drinking mint juleps. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Alright, my boss says you either have to order, or leave and never come back. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 howard What do you recommend for someone who worked up a man-sized appetite from a morning of weight training and cardio-funk?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny A shower. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 howard I'll take the heart smart platter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Alright, thank you, and Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon We don't eat here, I don't know what's good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Well, it's all good. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon Statistically unlikely. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Just get a hamburger, you like hamburgers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon I like the hamburgers where we usually have hamburgers, you can't make the assumption that I'll like the hamburgers here. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard I'm sorry. Give him a hamburger. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Uh, which one, the Classic Burger, the Ranch House Burger, the Barbecue Burger or the Kobe burger?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon Can't we just go to Big Boy? They only have one burger. The Big Boy. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny The Barbecue Burger is like the Big Boy. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon Excuse me, in a world that already includes the Big Boy, why would I settle for something like a Big Boy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Because you are not at Big Boy!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon Fine, I'll have the Barbecue Burger. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Make it two. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon Waitresses don't yell at you at Big Boy. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 lesley Hey Leonard, hi guys. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Hey Lesley. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 lesley I didn't know you ate here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon We don't. This is a disturbing aberration. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Lesley, this is Penny, she lives across the hall from Sheldon and me. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 howard And walks in quiet beauty like the night. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Howard, I've asked you not to do that. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Lesley and I do research together at the University. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Oh, wow, a girl scientist. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 lesley Yep, come for the breasts, stay for the brains. So, I'm glad I ran into you, the physics department string quartet needs a new cellist. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard What happened to Elliot Wong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 lesley He switched over to high energy radiation research, had a little mishap, and now the other guys are uncomfortable sitting next to him. So, are you in?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Yeah, sure, why not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 lesley Great, we rehearse on Tuesdays at your place.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Why at my place?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 lesley Yeah, the department of energy said our regular space is kind of a hot zone. Nice meeting you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Yeah, you too. Leonard, I didn't know you played the cello?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Yeah, my parents felt that naming me Leonard and putting me in advanced placement classes wasn't getting me beaten up enough. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 howard If you're into music, I happen to be a human beatbox. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Really? I'm actually not that into music. So hey, your friend's really cute, anything going on with you two. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Lesley? No, no-oh, what are you kidding?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon He asked her out once, it was an embarrassing failure. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Thank you Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon Oh, I'm sorry, was that supposed to be a secret?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Oh, that's too bad, you guys would make a cute couple. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 raj Oh dear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 howard What's the matter?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 raj She didn't take my order.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 howard How can she take your order when you're too neurotic to talk to her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 raj Nevertheless, this will be reflected in her tip. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard What did Penny mean, you'd make a cute couple?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon Well I assume she meant that the two of you together would constitute a couple that others might consider cute. An alternate, and somewhat less likely interpretation, is that you could manufacture one. As in, oh look, Leonard and Lesley made Mr and Mrs Goldfarb, aren't they adorable. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard If Penny didn't know that Lesley had already turned me down then that would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought that I should her, Lesley, out, indicating that she, Penny, had no interest in me asking her, Penny, out. But because she did know that I had asked Lesley out and that she, Lesley, had turned me down then she, Penny, could be offering consolation. That's too bad, you would have made a cute couple. But while thinking, good, Leonard remains available. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon You're a lucky man, Leonard. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard How so?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon You're talking to one of the three men in the Western hemisphere capable of following that train of thought. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Well, what do you think.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon I said I could follow it, I didn't say I cared.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 lesley I admire your fingering. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 lesley Maybe some time you can try that on my instrument. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 lesley Goodnight guys, good job.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 male_string_quartettist Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 female_string_quartettist See you next week.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard That was fun, Lesley, thanks for including me. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 lesley You're welcome. If you're up for it we could practise that middle section again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Uh, sure, why not. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 lesley Just so we're clear, you understand that me hanging back to practise with you is a pretext for letting you know that I'm sexually available. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 lesley Yeah, I'm good to go. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard I thought you weren't interested in me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 lesley That was before I saw you handling that beautiful piece of wood between your legs. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard You mean my cello?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 lesley No, I mean the obvious crude double entendre. I'm seducing you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard No kidding?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 lesley What can I say, I'm a passionate and impulsive woman. So how about it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Gee, uh ...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 lesley Is it the waitress?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Penny? What about her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 lesley Well, I thought I saw your pupils dilate when you looked at her, which, unless you're a heroin addict, points to sexual attraction.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Well, I did have a poppy seed bagel for breakfast, which could give a positive urine test for opiates but certainly not dilate my pupils, so I guess there's no point in bringing it up. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 lesley You and the waitress then?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard No. No, there's nothing going on between Penny and me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 lesley So, you're open to a sexual relationship?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Yeah. Yeah, I guess I am. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 lesley Good. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Yeah, yeah it is good. Did you want to start now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 lesley Why don't we finish the section first.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Oh. Okay. A little musical foreplay. Terrific. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard I'm good, I'm good to go. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 lesley Me too. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Oh, hey Sheldon, what's going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon I need your opinion on a matter of semiotics.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny I'm sorry?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon Semiotics, the study of signs and symbols, it's a branch of philosophy related to linguistics.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Okay, sweetie, I know you think you're explaining yourself, but you're really not. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon Just come with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon Well?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Well what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon What does it mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Oh, come on, you went to college.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon Yes, but I was eleven.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Alright, look, a tie on the doorknob usually means someone doesn't want to be disturbed because they're, you know, getting busy. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon So you're saying Leonard has a girl in there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Well, either that or he's lost his tie rack and gotten really into Bryan Adams. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 lesley Oh Leonard, you magnificent beast. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny We really shouldn't be standing here. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon This is very awkward.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Oh, come on, you know, Leonard's had girls over before, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon Oh, yes, but there's usually planning, courtship and advance notice. Last time I was able to book a cruise to the Arctic to see a solar eclipse. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Wait, you had to leave the state because your roommate was having sex?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon I didn't have to, the dates just happened to coincide. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny So, do you know who's in there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon Well, there's Leonard. And he's either with Lesley Winkle or a 1930's gangster. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Hmmm. Good for him. Good for Leonard. Okay, night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon No, no, wait, hold on. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny What's the matter?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon I don't know what the protocol is here. Do I stay, do I leave? Do I wait to greet them with a refreshing beverage? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Gee, Sheldon, you're asking the wrong girl. I'm usually on the other side of the tie. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon Hi, Leonard. It's me, Sheldon. In the living room. I just, I wanted you to know I saw the tie. Message received. You're welcome. You carry on. Give my best to Lesley. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon Big boy! Someone touched my board. Oh God, my board. Leonard! Leonard!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Hey, what's the matter? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon My equations, someone's tampered with my equations. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Are you sure?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon Of course I'm sure. Look at the beta-function of quantum chromodynamics, the sign's been changed. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Oh yeah. But doesn't that fix the problem you've been having?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon Are you insane? Are you out of your mind? Are you ... hey look, that fixes the problem I've been having. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 lesley You're welcome. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon You did this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 lesley Yeah, I noticed it when I got up to get a glass of water, so I fixed it, now you can show that quarks are asymptotically free at high energies. Pretty cool, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon Cool?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 lesley Listen, I got to hit the lab. Thanks for a great night. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Thank you, I'll see you at work. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon Uh-duh, hold on, hold on!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 lesley What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon Who told you you could touch my board?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 lesley No-one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon I don't come into your house and touch your board.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 lesley There are no incorrect equations on my board. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon Oh, that is so ... so ...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 lesley I'm sorry, I've got to run, if you come up with an adjective, text me. . 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon Inconsiderate, that is the adjective, inconsiderate. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard You can stare at your board all day Sheldon, she's still going to be right. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon I'm not staring, I'm mulling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Oh, hey Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Oh, hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny So, how's it going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Pretty good. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Just pretty good, I'd think you were doing very good. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Pretty, very, there's really no objective scale for delineating variations of good, why do you ask?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Well, a little bird told me that you and Lesley hooked up last night. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Sheldon!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon I'm coming.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny So, is it serious, do you like her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Wuh, I don't ... th-th-th-that's really two different questions, uh, I'm not ... Sheldon, we have to go! 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon Boy, you're wound awfully tight for a man who just had sexual intercourse. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Alright, well, I'll talk to you later, but, I am so happy for you Leonard. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Thank you. What did she mean, she's happy for me? Is she happy because I'm seeing someone, or is she happy because she thinks that I'm happy, because anyone who cared for someone would want them to be happy, even if the reason for their happiness made the first person unhappy. You know, because the second person, though happy, is now romantically unavailable to the first person.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon Do you realize I may have to share a Nobel Prize with your booty call?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard You know what, I'm being ridiculous. But who cares what Penny thinks, Lesley is a terrific girl, she's attractive, we like each other, she's extremely intelligent.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon She's not that intelligent.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard She fixed your equation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon She got lucky.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard You don't believe in luck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon I don't have to believe in it for her to be lucky. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Regardless, I have a chance at a real relationship with Lesley, I'm not going to pass that up for some hypothetical future happiness with a woman who may or may not want me to be happy with a woman who is currently making me happy. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Yeah. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon I still don't care. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Hey, Lesley.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 lesley Careful Leonard, liquid nitrogen, 320 degrees below zero. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Brrrr. Why are you smashing a flash frozen banana.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 lesley Because I've got a bowl of Cheerios and I couldn't find a knife.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard So anyway Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 lesley Uh, what are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Just extending the intimacy. Do you want to slip over to the radiation lab and share a decontamination shower?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 lesley Okay, uh, what exactly do you think's going on between us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard I'm not sure, but I think I'm about to discover how the banana felt. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 lesley Listen, Leonard, neither of us are neuroscientists but we both understand the biochemistry of sex, I mean, dopamine in our brains is released across synapses causing pleasure. You stick electrodes in a rat's brain, give him an orgasm button, he'll push that thing until he starves to death.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Who wouldn't? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 lesley Well, the only difference between us and a rat is that you can't stick an electrode in our hypothalamus. That's where you come in. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Yeah, well, I'm just glad to be a part of it. So what happens now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 lesley Well, I don't know about your sex drive, but I'm probably good till New Years. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Oh. Okay. Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 lesley Thank you!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard You want to make plans for New Years.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 lesley Woah, Leonard, please, you're smothering me. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 howard Hey, look, it's Doctor Stud!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Doctor what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 howard The blogosphere is a-buzzing with news of you and Lesley Winkle making eine kleine bang-bang music. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Wha ... how did it get on the internet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 howard I put it there. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Well, how did you know about it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 raj A little bird told us. Apparently you are a magnificent beast. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Well, that part's true! 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon You know, I think I may have misjudged this restaurant. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard No kidding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon I won't go out on a limb, but I think we may be looking at my new Tuesday hamburger. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Your old Tuesday hamburger will be so broken hearted. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon Way ahead of you. I was thinking of moving Big Boy to Thursdays, and just dropping Soup Plantation. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon Yeah, the name always confused me anyway, Soup Plantation. You can't grow soup. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny So, how's everything. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon Terrific, you'll be happy to know that I plan to come here every Tuesday night for the foreseeable future.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Really, oh yay!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon Who do I speak to about permanently reserving this table? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Um, I don't know, a psychiatrist? So hey, how are things with you and Lesley? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Oh, to be honest, I don't think it's going to work out. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Oh, oh that's too bad. Well hey, don't worry, I'm sure there is someone out there who is just right for you. .
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Well what did she mean by that? Was that just a generic platitude or was that a subtle bid for attention? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon You know why this hamburger surpasses the Big Boy? This is a single decker hamburger whereas the Big Boy is a double decker. This has a much more satisfying meat to bun to condiment ratio. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Are you even listening to me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon Of course I'm listening. Blah blah, hopeless Penny delusion, blah blah blah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard Okay then. You know, you can grow the ingredients for soup. .
