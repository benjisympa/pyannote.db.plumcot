TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Alright, I'm moving my infantry division, augmented by a battalion of Orcs from Lord of the Rings, we flank the Tennessee Volunteers, and the North once again wins the Battle of Gettysburg.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Not so fast, remember the South still has two infantry divisions, plus Superman and Godzilla.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter No, no, no, no, Orcs are magic, Superman is vulnerable to magic, not to mention, you already lost Godzilla to the Illinois Cavalry and Hulk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 raj_koothrappali Why don't you just have Robert E. Lee charge the line with Shiva and Ganesh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Hi, you guys ready to order?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Hang on, honey. Shiva and Ganesh? The Hindu Gods against the entire Union army?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter And Orcs!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny I'll be back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 raj_koothrappali Excuse me, Ganesh is the remover of obstacles, and Shiva is the destroyer. When the smoke clears, Abraham Lincoln will be speaking Hindi and drinking mint juleps.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Alright, my boss says you either have to order, or leave and never come back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 howard_wolowitz What do you recommend for someone who worked up a man-sized appetite from a morning of weight training and cardio-funk?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny A shower.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 howard_wolowitz I'll take the heart smart platter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Alright, thank you, and Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper We don't eat here, I don't know what's good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Well, it's all good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Statistically unlikely.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Just get a hamburger, you like hamburgers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper I like the hamburgers where we usually have hamburgers, you can't make the assumption that I'll like the hamburgers here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter I'm sorry. Give him a hamburger.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Uh, which one, the Classic Burger, the Ranch House Burger, the Barbecue Burger or the Kobe burger?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Can't we just go to Big Boy? They only have one burger. The Big Boy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny The Barbecue Burger is like the Big Boy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Excuse me, in a world that already includes the Big Boy, why would I settle for something like a Big Boy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Because you are not at Big Boy!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Fine, I'll have the Barbecue Burger.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Make it two.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Waitresses don't yell at you at Big Boy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leslie_winkle Hey Leonard, hi guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Hey Lesley.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leslie_winkle I didn't know you ate here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper We don't. This is a disturbing aberration.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Lesley, this is Penny, she lives across the hall from Sheldon and me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 howard_wolowitz And walks in quiet beauty like the night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Howard, I've asked you not to do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Lesley and I do research together at the University.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Oh, wow, a girl scientist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leslie_winkle Yep, come for the breasts, stay for the brains. So, I'm glad I ran into you, the physics department string quartet needs a new cellist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter What happened to Elliot Wong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leslie_winkle He switched over to high energy radiation research, had a little mishap, and now the other guys are uncomfortable sitting next to him. So, are you in?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, sure, why not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leslie_winkle Great, we rehearse on Tuesdays at your place.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Why at my place?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leslie_winkle Yeah, the department of energy said our regular space is kind of a hot zone. Nice meeting you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Yeah, you too. Leonard, I didn't know you played the cello?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, my parents felt that naming me Leonard and putting me in advanced placement classes wasn't getting me beaten up enough.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 howard_wolowitz If you're into music, I happen to be a human beatbox.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Really? I'm actually not that into music. So hey, your friend's really cute, anything going on with you two.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Lesley? No, no-oh, what are you kidding?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper He asked her out once, it was an embarrassing failure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Thank you Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Oh, I'm sorry, was that supposed to be a secret?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Oh, that's too bad, you guys would make a cute couple.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 raj_koothrappali Oh dear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 howard_wolowitz What's the matter?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 raj_koothrappali She didn't take my order.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 howard_wolowitz How can she take your order when you're too neurotic to talk to her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 raj_koothrappali Nevertheless, this will be reflected in her tip.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter What did Penny mean, you'd make a cute couple?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Well I assume she meant that the two of you together would constitute a couple that others might consider cute. An alternate, and somewhat less likely interpretation, is that you could manufacture one. As in, oh look, Leonard and Lesley made Mr and Mrs Goldfarb, aren't they adorable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter If Penny didn't know that Lesley had already turned me down then that would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought that I should her, Lesley, out, indicating that she, Penny, had no interest in me asking her, Penny, out. But because she did know that I had asked Lesley out and that she, Lesley, had turned me down then she, Penny, could be offering consolation. That's too bad, you would have made a cute couple. But while thinking, good, Leonard remains available.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper You're a lucky man, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter How so?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper You're talking to one of the three men in the Western hemisphere capable of following that train of thought.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Well, what do you think.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper I said I could follow it, I didn't say I cared.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leslie_winkle I admire your fingering.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leslie_winkle Maybe some time you can try that on my instrument.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leslie_winkle Goodnight guys, good job.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 male_string_quartettist#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 female_string_quartettist#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 See you next week.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter That was fun, Lesley, thanks for including me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leslie_winkle You're welcome. If you're up for it we could practise that middle section again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Uh, sure, why not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leslie_winkle Just so we're clear, you understand that me hanging back to practise with you is a pretext for letting you know that I'm sexually available.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leslie_winkle Yeah, I'm good to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter I thought you weren't interested in me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leslie_winkle That was before I saw you handling that beautiful piece of wood between your legs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter You mean my cello?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leslie_winkle No, I mean the obvious crude double entendre. I'm seducing you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter No kidding?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leslie_winkle What can I say, I'm a passionate and impulsive woman. So how about it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Gee, uh ...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leslie_winkle Is it the waitress?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Penny? What about her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leslie_winkle Well, I thought I saw your pupils dilate when you looked at her, which, unless you're a heroin addict, points to sexual attraction.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Well, I did have a poppy seed bagel for breakfast, which could give a positive urine test for opiates but certainly not dilate my pupils, so I guess there's no point in bringing it up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leslie_winkle You and the waitress then?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter No. No, there's nothing going on between Penny and me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leslie_winkle So, you're open to a sexual relationship?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Yeah. Yeah, I guess I am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leslie_winkle Good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, yeah it is good. Did you want to start now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leslie_winkle Why don't we finish the section first.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Oh. Okay. A little musical foreplay. Terrific.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter I'm good, I'm good to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leslie_winkle Me too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Oh, hey Sheldon, what's going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper I need your opinion on a matter of semiotics.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny I'm sorry?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Semiotics, the study of signs and symbols, it's a branch of philosophy related to linguistics.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Okay, sweetie, I know you think you're explaining yourself, but you're really not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Just come with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Well?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Well what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper What does it mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Oh, come on, you went to college.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Yes, but I was eleven.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Alright, look, a tie on the doorknob usually means someone doesn't want to be disturbed because they're, you know, getting busy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper So you're saying Leonard has a girl in there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Well, either that or he's lost his tie rack and gotten really into Bryan Adams.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leslie_winkle Oh Leonard, you magnificent beast.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny We really shouldn't be standing here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper This is very awkward.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Oh, come on, you know, Leonard's had girls over before, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Oh, yes, but there's usually planning, courtship and advance notice. Last time I was able to book a cruise to the Arctic to see a solar eclipse.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Wait, you had to leave the state because your roommate was having sex?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper I didn't have to, the dates just happened to coincide.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny So, do you know who's in there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Well, there's Leonard. And he's either with Lesley Winkle or a 1930's gangster.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Hmmm. Good for him. Good for Leonard. Okay, night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper No, no, wait, hold on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny What's the matter?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper I don't know what the protocol is here. Do I stay, do I leave? Do I wait to greet them with a refreshing beverage?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Gee, Sheldon, you're asking the wrong girl. I'm usually on the other side of the tie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Hi, Leonard. It's me, Sheldon. In the living room. I just, I wanted you to know I saw the tie. Message received. You're welcome. You carry on. Give my best to Lesley.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Big boy! Someone touched my board. Oh God, my board. Leonard! Leonard!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Hey, what's the matter?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper My equations, someone's tampered with my equations.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Are you sure?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Of course I'm sure. Look at the beta-function of quantum chromodynamics, the sign's been changed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Oh yeah. But doesn't that fix the problem you've been having?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Are you insane? Are you out of your mind? Are you ... hey look, that fixes the problem I've been having.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leslie_winkle You're welcome.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper You did this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leslie_winkle Yeah, I noticed it when I got up to get a glass of water, so I fixed it, now you can show that quarks are asymptotically free at high energies. Pretty cool, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Cool?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leslie_winkle Listen, I got to hit the lab. Thanks for a great night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Thank you, I'll see you at work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Uh-duh, hold on, hold on!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leslie_winkle What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Who told you you could touch my board?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leslie_winkle No-one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper I don't come into your house and touch your board.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leslie_winkle There are no incorrect equations on my board.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Oh, that is so ... so ...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leslie_winkle I'm sorry, I've got to run, if you come up with an adjective, text me. .
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Inconsiderate, that is the adjective, inconsiderate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter You can stare at your board all day Sheldon, she's still going to be right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper I'm not staring, I'm mulling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Oh, hey Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Oh, hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny So, how's it going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Pretty good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Just pretty good, I'd think you were doing very good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Pretty, very, there's really no objective scale for delineating variations of good, why do you ask?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Well, a little bird told me that you and Lesley hooked up last night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper I'm coming.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny So, is it serious, do you like her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Wuh, I don't ... th-th-th-that's really two different questions, uh, I'm not ... Sheldon, we have to go!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Boy, you're wound awfully tight for a man who just had sexual intercourse.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Alright, well, I'll talk to you later, but, I am so happy for you Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Thank you. What did she mean, she's happy for me? Is she happy because I'm seeing someone, or is she happy because she thinks that I'm happy, because anyone who cared for someone would want them to be happy, even if the reason for their happiness made the first person unhappy. You know, because the second person, though happy, is now romantically unavailable to the first person.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Do you realize I may have to share a Nobel Prize with your booty call?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter You know what, I'm being ridiculous. But who cares what Penny thinks, Lesley is a terrific girl, she's attractive, we like each other, she's extremely intelligent.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper She's not that intelligent.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter She fixed your equation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper She got lucky.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter You don't believe in luck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper I don't have to believe in it for her to be lucky.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Regardless, I have a chance at a real relationship with Lesley, I'm not going to pass that up for some hypothetical future happiness with a woman who may or may not want me to be happy with a woman who is currently making me happy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper I still don't care.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Hey, Lesley.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leslie_winkle Careful Leonard, liquid nitrogen, 320 degrees below zero.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Brrrr. Why are you smashing a flash frozen banana.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leslie_winkle Because I've got a bowl of Cheerios and I couldn't find a knife.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter So anyway Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leslie_winkle Uh, what are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Just extending the intimacy. Do you want to slip over to the radiation lab and share a decontamination shower?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leslie_winkle Okay, uh, what exactly do you think's going on between us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter I'm not sure, but I think I'm about to discover how the banana felt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leslie_winkle Listen, Leonard, neither of us are neuroscientists but we both understand the biochemistry of sex, I mean, dopamine in our brains is released across synapses causing pleasure. You stick electrodes in a rat's brain, give him an orgasm button, he'll push that thing until he starves to death.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Who wouldn't?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leslie_winkle Well, the only difference between us and a rat is that you can't stick an electrode in our hypothalamus. That's where you come in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, well, I'm just glad to be a part of it. So what happens now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leslie_winkle Well, I don't know about your sex drive, but I'm probably good till New Years.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Oh. Okay. Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leslie_winkle Thank you!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter You want to make plans for New Years.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leslie_winkle Woah, Leonard, please, you're smothering me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Hey, look, it's Doctor Stud!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Doctor what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 howard_wolowitz The blogosphere is a-buzzing with news of you and Lesley Winkle making eine kleine bang-bang music.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Wha ... how did it get on the internet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 howard_wolowitz I put it there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Well, how did you know about it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 raj_koothrappali A little bird told us. Apparently you are a magnificent beast.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Well, that part's true!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper You know, I think I may have misjudged this restaurant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter No kidding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper I won't go out on a limb, but I think we may be looking at my new Tuesday hamburger.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Your old Tuesday hamburger will be so broken hearted.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Way ahead of you. I was thinking of moving Big Boy to Thursdays, and just dropping Soup Plantation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Yeah, the name always confused me anyway, Soup Plantation. You can't grow soup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny So, how's everything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Terrific, you'll be happy to know that I plan to come here every Tuesday night for the foreseeable future.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Really, oh yay!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Who do I speak to about permanently reserving this table?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Um, I don't know, a psychiatrist? So hey, how are things with you and Lesley?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Oh, to be honest, I don't think it's going to work out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 penny Oh, oh that's too bad. Well hey, don't worry, I'm sure there is someone out there who is just right for you. .
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Well what did she mean by that? Was that just a generic platitude or was that a subtle bid for attention?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper You know why this hamburger surpasses the Big Boy? This is a single decker hamburger whereas the Big Boy is a double decker. This has a much more satisfying meat to bun to condiment ratio.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Are you even listening to me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Of course I'm listening. Blah blah, hopeless Penny delusion, blah blah blah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Okay then. You know, you can grow the ingredients for soup. .
