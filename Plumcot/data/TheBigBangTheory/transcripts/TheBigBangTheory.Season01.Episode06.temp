TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 raj Okay, if no-one else will say it, I will. We really suck at paintball.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 howard That was absolutely humiliating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard Oh, come on, some battles you win, some battles you lose.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 howard Yes, but you don't have to lose to Kyle Bernstein's Bar-Mitzvah party. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard I think we have to acknowledge, those were some fairly savage pre-adolescent Jews. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon You know, we were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of some people to follow the chain of command. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard Sheldon, let it go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon No, I want to talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the back. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 howard I shot you for good reason, you were leading us into disaster. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon I was giving clear, concise orders. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard You hid behind a tree yelling 'get the kid in the yarmulkah, get the kid in the yarmulkah.'
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Oh, hey guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard Hello Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 howard Morning ma'am. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny So, how was paintball, did you have fun?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon Sure, if you consider being fragged by your own troops fun. You clear space on your calendar, there will be an enquiry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Okay, um, oh hey, I'm having a party on Saturday so if you guys are around you should come by.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard A party? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 howard A boy-girl party?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Well, there will be boys, and there will be girls, and it is a party. So, it'll just be a bunch of my friends, we'll have some beer, do a little dancing ...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon Dancing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard Yeah, I don't know, Penny ...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon The thing is, we're not ...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard We're really more ...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard But thanks, thanks for thinking of us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Are you sure? Come on, it's Halloween.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon A Halloween party?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 howard As in, costumes? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Well, yeah. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard Is there a theme?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Um, yeah, Halloween.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon Yes, but are the costumes random, or genre specific? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny As usual, I'm not following.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard He's asking if we can come as anyone from science-fiction, fantasy ...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon What about comic-books?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon Anime?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Of course.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon TV , film, D&D, Manga, Greek Gods, Roman Gods, Norse Gods ...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Anything you want, okay? Any costume you want. Bye. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 howard Gentlemen, to the sewing machines.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard I'll get it. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 howard Bjow 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard Oh, no. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon Oh no! 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 raj Make way for the fastest man alive. Oh no!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon See, this is why I wanted to have a costume meeting. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard We all have other costumes, we can change.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 raj Or, we could walk right behind each other all night and look like one person going really fast. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 howard No, no, no, it's a boy-girl party, this Flash runs solo. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard Okay, how about this, nobody gets to be The Flash, we all change, agreed?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 all Agreed. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard I call Frodo!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 all Damn!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 raj Hey. Sorry I'm late, but my hammer got stuck in the door on the bus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard You went with Thor?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 raj What? Just because I'm Indian I can't be a Norse God? No, no, no, Raj has to be an Indian God. That's racism. I mean, look at Wolowitz, he's not English, but he's dressed like Peter Pan. Sheldon is neither sound nor light, but he's obviously the Doppler Effect. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 howard I'm not Peter Pan, I'm Robin Hood. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 raj Really, because I saw Peter Pan, and you're dressed exactly like Cathy Rigby. She was a little bigger than you, but it's basically the same look, man. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard Hey, Sheldon, there's something I want to talk to you about before we go to the party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon I don't care if anybody gets it, I'm going as the Doppler Effect. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard No, it's not ...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon If I have to, I can demonstrate. Neeeeoooowwwww!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard Terrific. Um, this party is my first chance for Penny to see me in the context of her social group, and I need you not to embarrass me tonight. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon Well, what exactly do you mean by embarrass you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard For example, tonight no-one needs to know that my middle name is Leakey. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon Well, there's nothing embarrassing about that, your father worked with Lewis Leakey, a great anthropologist. It had nothing to do with your bed-wetting. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard All I'm saying is that this party is the perfect opportunity for Penny to see me as a member of her peer group. A potential close friend and ... perhaps more. I don't want to look like a dork. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 howard Just a heads up fellas, if anyone gets lucky I've got a dozen condoms in my quiver. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Oh, hey guys. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard Hey, sorry we're late.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Late? It's 7.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon And you said the party starts at seven.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Well, yeah, when you start a party at seven, no-one shows up at, you know, seven. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon It's 7.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Yes. Yes it is. Okay, well, um, come on in. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 howard What, are all the girls in the bathroom?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Probably, but in their own homes. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon So what time does the costume parade start? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny The parade?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon Yeah, so the judges can give out the prizes for best costume, you know, most frightening, most authentic, most accurate visual representation of a scientific principle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Oh, Sheldon, I'm sorry but there aren't going to be any parades or judges or prizes. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon This party is just going to suck. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny No, come on, it's going to be fun, and you all look great, I mean, look at you, Thor, and, oh, Peter Pan, that's so cute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard Actually, Penny, he's Rob ...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 howard I'm Peter Pan! And I've got a handful of pixie dust with your name on it. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny No you don't. Oh, hey, what's Sheldon supposed to be.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard Oh, he's the Doppler Effect.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon Yes. It's the apparent change in the frequency of a wave caused by relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Oh, sure, I see it now, the Doppler Effect. Alright, I've got to shower, you guys um, make yourselves comfortable. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard Okay. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon See, people get it. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 raj Mmmm, by Odin's beard, this is good Chex Mix. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 howard No thanks, peanuts, I can't afford to swell up in these tights. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon I'm confused. If there's no costume parade, what are we doing here? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard We're socialising. Meeting new people. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon Telepathically?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Oh hey, when did you get here, Hi!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 raj Penny is wearing the worst Catwoman costume I have ever seen, and that includes Halle Berry's.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard She's not Catwoman, she's just a generic cat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon And that's the kind of sloppy costuming which results from a lack of rules and competition.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 howard Hey guys, check out the sexy nurse. I believe it's time for me to turn my head and cough. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 raj What is your move?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 howard I'm going to use the mirror technique. She brushes her hair back, I brush my hair back, she shrugs, I shrug, subconsciously she's thinking we're in sync, we belong together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard Where do you get this stuff?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 howard You know, psychology journals, internet research, and there's this great show on VH1 about how to pick up girls. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 raj Oh, if only I had his confidence. I have such difficulty speaking to women. Or around women. Or at times, even effeminate men. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 howard If that's a working stethoscope, maybe you'd like to hear my heart skip a beat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 nurse_costume_girl No thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 howard No, seriously, you can, I have transient arrhythmia.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard I to get to know Penny's friends, I just, I don't know how to talk to these people.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon Well, I actually might be able to help.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard How so?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon Like Jane Goodall observing the apes, I initially saw their interactions as confusing and unstructured, but patterns emerge, they have their own language if you will. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard Go on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon Well, it seems that the newcomer approaches the existing group with the greeting 'How wasted am I?' which is met with an approving chorus of 'Dude.'
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard Then what happens?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon That's as far as I've gotten.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard This is ridiculous, I'm jumping in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon Good luck. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard No, you're coming with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon Oh, I hardly think so. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard Come on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon Aren't you afraid I'll embarrass you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard Yes. But I need a wing-man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon Alright, but if we're going to use flight metaphors I'm much more suited to being the guy from the FAA, analyzing wreckage. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 girl_in_hippie_costume Oh, Hi!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 girl So, what are you supposed to be?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon Me? I'll give you a hint. Neeeeooooowwwww!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 girl Uh, a choo-choo train?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon Close! Neeeeeoooooowwwww!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 girl A brain damaged choo-choo train?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 girl_in_butterfly_costume How wasted am I? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon Neeeeeooooowwwwww!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 girl I still don't get it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon I'm the Doppler Effect. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 girl Okay, if that is some sort of learning disability, I think it's very insensitive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard Why don't you just tell people you're a zebra?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon Well, why don't you just tell people you're one of the seven dwarves. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard Because I'm Frodo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon Yes, well, I'm the Doppler Effect. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard Oh no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard That's Penny's ex-boyfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon What do you suppose he's doing here? Besides disrupting the local gravity field. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard If he were any bigger, he'd have moons orbiting him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon Oh, snap. So I guess we'll be leaving now. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard Why should we leave? For all we know, he crashed the party and Penny doesn't even want him here. .
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon You have a back-up hypothesis. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard Maybe they just want to be friends. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon Or maybe she wants to be friends, and he wants something more. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard Then he and I are on equal ground.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon Yes, but you're much closer to it than he is. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard Look, if this was 15,000 years ago, by virtue of his size and strength, Kurt would be entitled to his choice of female partners.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon And male partners. Animal partners. Large primordial eggplants, pretty much whatever tickled his fancy. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard Yes, but our society has undergone a paradigm shift, in the information age, Sheldon, you and I are the alpha males. We shouldn't have to back down. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon True. Why don't you text him that and see if he backs down?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard No. I'm going to assert my dominance face to face. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon Face to face? Are you going to wait for him to sit down, or are you going to stand on a coffee table?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard Hello Penny. Hello Kurt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Oh, hey guys. You having a good time?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon Given the reaction to my costume, this party is a scathing indictment of the American education system. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 kurt What, you're a zebra, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon Yet another child left behind. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 kurt And what are you supposed to be, an Elf?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard No, I'm a Hobbit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 kurt What's the difference? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard Uh, a Hobbit is a mortal Halfling inhabitant of Middle Earth, whereas an Elf is an immortal tall warrior. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 kurt So why the hell would you want to be a Hobbit?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon Because he is neither tall nor immortal, and none of us could be The Flash. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 kurt Well, whatever, why don't you go hop off on a quest, I'm talking to Penny here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard I think we're all talking to Penny here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon I'm not. No offence. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 kurt Okay, maybe you didn't hear me, go away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Alright Kurt, be nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 kurt Aw, I am being nice. Right little buddy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Kurt!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard Okay, I understand your impulse to try to physically intimidate me. I mean, you can't compete with me on an intellectual level and so you're driven to animalistic puffery. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 kurt Are you calling me a puffy animal?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Of course not, no, he's not, you're not, right Leonard? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard No, I said animalistic. Of course we're all animals, but some of us have climbed a little higher on the evolutionary tree. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon If he understands that, you're in trouble. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 kurt So what, I'm unevolved?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon You're in trouble. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 kurt You know, you use a lot of big words for such a little dwarf. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Okay, Kurt, please.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard No, Penny, it's okay, I can handle this. I'm not a dwarf, I'm a Hobbit. A Hobbit. Are misfiring neurons in your hippocampus preventing the conversion from short-term to long-term memory?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 kurt Okay, now you're starting to make me mad. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard A homo-habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 kurt What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard I think I've made my point.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 kurt Yeah, how about I make a point out of your pointy little head.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon Let me remind you, while my moral support is absolute, in a physical confrontation I will be less than useless. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard There's not going to be a confrontation, in fact I doubt if he can even spell confrontation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 kurt C - O - N ... frontation!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Kurt, put him down this instant. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 kurt He started it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny I don't care, I'm finishing it, put him down. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 kurt Fine. You're one lucky little leprechaun. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon He's a Hobbit! I've got your back. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Leonard, are you okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard Yeah, no, I'm fine. It's good, it's a good party, thanks for having us, it's just getting a little late so ...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Oh, okay, alright, well thank you for coming. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon Happy Halloween. If it's any consolation, I thought that homo-habilus line really put him in his place. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard What's that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon Tea. When people are upset the cultural convention is to bring them hot beverages. There there. You want to talk about it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon Good. There there was really all I had. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard Good night Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon Good night Leonard. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Hey Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard Hi Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Hey, I just wanted to make sure you're okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard I'm fine. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny I'm so sorry about what happened.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard It's not your fault.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Yes it is. That's why I broke up with him, he always does stuff like that. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard So why was he at your party?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Well, I ran into him last week and, he was ... just, all apologetic, about how he's changed, he was just going on and on and I believed him, and I'm an idiot because I always believe guys like that and ... I can't go back to my party because he's there, and I know you don't want to hear this and I'm upset and I'm really drunk and I just want to ... 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard There there. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny God, what is wrong with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard Nothing, you're perfect.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Gah, I'm not perfect.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard Yes you are. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny You really think so, don't you? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Yeah. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard How much have you had to drink tonight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Just ... a lot. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard Are you sure that your being drunk, and your being angry with Kurt doesn't have something to do with what's going on here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny It might. Boy, you're really smart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard Yeah, I'm a frickin' genius. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Leonard, you are so great. Why can't all guys be like you? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard Because if all guys were like me, the human race couldn't survive. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny I should probably go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard Probably. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Thank you. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard That's right, you saw what you saw. That's how we roll in The Shire. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon Coming. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 howard Hey, have you seen Koothrapali?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon He's not here. Maybe the Avenger summoned him. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 howard He's not the Marvel comic story, he's the original Norse God. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon Thank you for the clarification. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 howard I'm supposed to give him a ride home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon Well I'm sure he'll be fine. He has his hammer. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 butterfly_girl Wow, I have to say, you are an amazing man. You're gentle and passionate, and my God, you are such a good listener!
