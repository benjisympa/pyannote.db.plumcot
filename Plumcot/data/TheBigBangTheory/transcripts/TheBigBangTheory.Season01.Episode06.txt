TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 raj_koothrappali Okay, if no-one else will say it, I will. We really suck at paintball.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 howard_wolowitz That was absolutely humiliating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Oh, come on, some battles you win, some battles you lose.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 howard_wolowitz Yes, but you don't have to lose to Kyle Bernstein's Bar-Mitzvah party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter I think we have to acknowledge, those were some fairly savage pre-adolescent Jews.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper You know, we were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of some people to follow the chain of command.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, let it go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper No, I want to talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 howard_wolowitz I shot you for good reason, you were leading us into disaster.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper I was giving clear, concise orders.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter You hid behind a tree yelling 'get the kid in the yarmulkah, get the kid in the yarmulkah.'
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Oh, hey guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Hello Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 howard_wolowitz Morning ma'am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny So, how was paintball, did you have fun?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Sure, if you consider being fragged by your own troops fun. You clear space on your calendar, there will be an enquiry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Okay, um, oh hey, I'm having a party on Saturday so if you guys are around you should come by.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter A party?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 howard_wolowitz A boy-girl party?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Well, there will be boys, and there will be girls, and it is a party. So, it'll just be a bunch of my friends, we'll have some beer, do a little dancing ...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Dancing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I don't know, Penny ...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper The thing is, we're not ...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter We're really more ...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter But thanks, thanks for thinking of us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Are you sure? Come on, it's Halloween.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper A Halloween party?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 howard_wolowitz As in, costumes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Well, yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Is there a theme?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Um, yeah, Halloween.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Yes, but are the costumes random, or genre specific?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny As usual, I'm not following.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter He's asking if we can come as anyone from science-fiction, fantasy ...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper What about comic-books?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Anime?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Of course.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper TV , film, D&D, Manga, Greek Gods, Roman Gods, Norse Gods ...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Anything you want, okay? Any costume you want. Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 howard_wolowitz Gentlemen, to the sewing machines.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter I'll get it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 howard_wolowitz Bjow
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Oh, no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Oh no!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 raj_koothrappali Make way for the fastest man alive. Oh no!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper See, this is why I wanted to have a costume meeting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter We all have other costumes, we can change.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 raj_koothrappali Or, we could walk right behind each other all night and look like one person going really fast.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 howard_wolowitz No, no, no, it's a boy-girl party, this Flash runs solo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Okay, how about this, nobody gets to be The Flash, we all change, agreed?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 all@ Agreed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter I call Frodo!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 all@ Damn!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 raj_koothrappali Hey. Sorry I'm late, but my hammer got stuck in the door on the bus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter You went with Thor?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 raj_koothrappali What? Just because I'm Indian I can't be a Norse God? No, no, no, Raj has to be an Indian God. That's racism. I mean, look at Wolowitz, he's not English, but he's dressed like Peter Pan. Sheldon is neither sound nor light, but he's obviously the Doppler Effect.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 howard_wolowitz I'm not Peter Pan, I'm Robin Hood.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 raj_koothrappali Really, because I saw Peter Pan, and you're dressed exactly like Cathy Rigby. She was a little bigger than you, but it's basically the same look, man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Hey, Sheldon, there's something I want to talk to you about before we go to the party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper I don't care if anybody gets it, I'm going as the Doppler Effect.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter No, it's not ...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper If I have to, I can demonstrate. Neeeeoooowwwww!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Terrific. Um, this party is my first chance for Penny to see me in the context of her social group, and I need you not to embarrass me tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Well, what exactly do you mean by embarrass you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter For example, tonight no-one needs to know that my middle name is Leakey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Well, there's nothing embarrassing about that, your father worked with Lewis Leakey, a great anthropologist. It had nothing to do with your bed-wetting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter All I'm saying is that this party is the perfect opportunity for Penny to see me as a member of her peer group. A potential close friend and ... perhaps more. I don't want to look like a dork.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 howard_wolowitz Just a heads up fellas, if anyone gets lucky I've got a dozen condoms in my quiver.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Oh, hey guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Hey, sorry we're late.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Late? It's 7.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper And you said the party starts at seven.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Well, yeah, when you start a party at seven, no-one shows up at, you know, seven.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper It's 7.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Yes. Yes it is. Okay, well, um, come on in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 howard_wolowitz What, are all the girls in the bathroom?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Probably, but in their own homes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper So what time does the costume parade start?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny The parade?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Yeah, so the judges can give out the prizes for best costume, you know, most frightening, most authentic, most accurate visual representation of a scientific principle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Oh, Sheldon, I'm sorry but there aren't going to be any parades or judges or prizes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper This party is just going to suck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny No, come on, it's going to be fun, and you all look great, I mean, look at you, Thor, and, oh, Peter Pan, that's so cute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Actually, Penny, he's Rob ...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 howard_wolowitz I'm Peter Pan! And I've got a handful of pixie dust with your name on it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny No you don't. Oh, hey, what's Sheldon supposed to be.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Oh, he's the Doppler Effect.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Yes. It's the apparent change in the frequency of a wave caused by relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Oh, sure, I see it now, the Doppler Effect. Alright, I've got to shower, you guys um, make yourselves comfortable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper See, people get it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 raj_koothrappali Mmmm, by Odin's beard, this is good Chex Mix.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 howard_wolowitz No thanks, peanuts, I can't afford to swell up in these tights.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper I'm confused. If there's no costume parade, what are we doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter We're socialising. Meeting new people.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Telepathically?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Oh hey, when did you get here, Hi!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 raj_koothrappali Penny is wearing the worst Catwoman costume I have ever seen, and that includes Halle Berry's.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter She's not Catwoman, she's just a generic cat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper And that's the kind of sloppy costuming which results from a lack of rules and competition.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 howard_wolowitz Hey guys, check out the sexy nurse. I believe it's time for me to turn my head and cough.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 raj_koothrappali What is your move?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 howard_wolowitz I'm going to use the mirror technique. She brushes her hair back, I brush my hair back, she shrugs, I shrug, subconsciously she's thinking we're in sync, we belong together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Where do you get this stuff?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 howard_wolowitz You know, psychology journals, internet research, and there's this great show on VH1 about how to pick up girls.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 raj_koothrappali Oh, if only I had his confidence. I have such difficulty speaking to women. Or around women. Or at times, even effeminate men.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 howard_wolowitz If that's a working stethoscope, maybe you'd like to hear my heart skip a beat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 nurse_costume_girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 No thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 howard_wolowitz No, seriously, you can, I have transient arrhythmia.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter I to get to know Penny's friends, I just, I don't know how to talk to these people.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Well, I actually might be able to help.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter How so?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Like Jane Goodall observing the apes, I initially saw their interactions as confusing and unstructured, but patterns emerge, they have their own language if you will.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Go on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Well, it seems that the newcomer approaches the existing group with the greeting 'How wasted am I?' which is met with an approving chorus of 'Dude.'
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Then what happens?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper That's as far as I've gotten.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter This is ridiculous, I'm jumping in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Good luck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter No, you're coming with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Oh, I hardly think so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Come on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Aren't you afraid I'll embarrass you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Yes. But I need a wing-man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Alright, but if we're going to use flight metaphors I'm much more suited to being the guy from the FAA, analyzing wreckage.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 girl_in_hippie_costume#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 Oh, Hi!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 So, what are you supposed to be?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Me? I'll give you a hint. Neeeeooooowwwww!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 Uh, a choo-choo train?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Close! Neeeeeoooooowwwww!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 A brain damaged choo-choo train?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 butterfly_girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 How wasted am I?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Neeeeeooooowwwwww!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 I still don't get it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper I'm the Doppler Effect.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 Okay, if that is some sort of learning disability, I think it's very insensitive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Why don't you just tell people you're a zebra?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Well, why don't you just tell people you're one of the seven dwarves.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Because I'm Frodo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Yes, well, I'm the Doppler Effect.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Oh no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter That's Penny's ex-boyfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper What do you suppose he's doing here? Besides disrupting the local gravity field.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter If he were any bigger, he'd have moons orbiting him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Oh, snap. So I guess we'll be leaving now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Why should we leave? For all we know, he crashed the party and Penny doesn't even want him here. .
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper You have a back-up hypothesis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Maybe they just want to be friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Or maybe she wants to be friends, and he wants something more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Then he and I are on equal ground.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Yes, but you're much closer to it than he is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Look, if this was 15,000 years ago, by virtue of his size and strength, Kurt would be entitled to his choice of female partners.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper And male partners. Animal partners. Large primordial eggplants, pretty much whatever tickled his fancy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Yes, but our society has undergone a paradigm shift, in the information age, Sheldon, you and I are the alpha males. We shouldn't have to back down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper True. Why don't you text him that and see if he backs down?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter No. I'm going to assert my dominance face to face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Face to face? Are you going to wait for him to sit down, or are you going to stand on a coffee table?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Hello Penny. Hello Kurt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Oh, hey guys. You having a good time?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Given the reaction to my costume, this party is a scathing indictment of the American education system.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 kurt What, you're a zebra, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Yet another child left behind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 kurt And what are you supposed to be, an Elf?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter No, I'm a Hobbit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 kurt What's the difference?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Uh, a Hobbit is a mortal Halfling inhabitant of Middle Earth, whereas an Elf is an immortal tall warrior.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 kurt So why the hell would you want to be a Hobbit?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Because he is neither tall nor immortal, and none of us could be The Flash.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 kurt Well, whatever, why don't you go hop off on a quest, I'm talking to Penny here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter I think we're all talking to Penny here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper I'm not. No offence.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 kurt Okay, maybe you didn't hear me, go away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Alright Kurt, be nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 kurt Aw, I am being nice. Right little buddy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Kurt!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Okay, I understand your impulse to try to physically intimidate me. I mean, you can't compete with me on an intellectual level and so you're driven to animalistic puffery.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 kurt Are you calling me a puffy animal?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Of course not, no, he's not, you're not, right Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter No, I said animalistic. Of course we're all animals, but some of us have climbed a little higher on the evolutionary tree.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper If he understands that, you're in trouble.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 kurt So what, I'm unevolved?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper You're in trouble.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 kurt You know, you use a lot of big words for such a little dwarf.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Okay, Kurt, please.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter No, Penny, it's okay, I can handle this. I'm not a dwarf, I'm a Hobbit. A Hobbit. Are misfiring neurons in your hippocampus preventing the conversion from short-term to long-term memory?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 kurt Okay, now you're starting to make me mad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter A homo-habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 kurt What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter I think I've made my point.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 kurt Yeah, how about I make a point out of your pointy little head.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Let me remind you, while my moral support is absolute, in a physical confrontation I will be less than useless.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter There's not going to be a confrontation, in fact I doubt if he can even spell confrontation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 kurt C - O - N ... frontation!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Kurt, put him down this instant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 kurt He started it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny I don't care, I'm finishing it, put him down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 kurt Fine. You're one lucky little leprechaun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper He's a Hobbit! I've got your back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Leonard, are you okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, no, I'm fine. It's good, it's a good party, thanks for having us, it's just getting a little late so ...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Oh, okay, alright, well thank you for coming.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Happy Halloween. If it's any consolation, I thought that homo-habilus line really put him in his place.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter What's that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Tea. When people are upset the cultural convention is to bring them hot beverages. There there. You want to talk about it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Good. There there was really all I had.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Good night Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Good night Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Hey Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Hi Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Hey, I just wanted to make sure you're okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter I'm fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny I'm so sorry about what happened.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter It's not your fault.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Yes it is. That's why I broke up with him, he always does stuff like that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter So why was he at your party?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Well, I ran into him last week and, he was ... just, all apologetic, about how he's changed, he was just going on and on and I believed him, and I'm an idiot because I always believe guys like that and ... I can't go back to my party because he's there, and I know you don't want to hear this and I'm upset and I'm really drunk and I just want to ...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter There there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny God, what is wrong with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Nothing, you're perfect.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Gah, I'm not perfect.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Yes you are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny You really think so, don't you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter How much have you had to drink tonight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Just ... a lot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Are you sure that your being drunk, and your being angry with Kurt doesn't have something to do with what's going on here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny It might. Boy, you're really smart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I'm a frickin' genius.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Leonard, you are so great. Why can't all guys be like you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Because if all guys were like me, the human race couldn't survive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny I should probably go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Probably.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 penny Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter That's right, you saw what you saw. That's how we roll in The Shire.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Coming.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 howard_wolowitz Hey, have you seen Koothrapali?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper He's not here. Maybe the Avenger summoned him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 howard_wolowitz He's not the Marvel comic story, he's the original Norse God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Thank you for the clarification.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 howard_wolowitz I'm supposed to give him a ride home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Well I'm sure he'll be fine. He has his hammer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 butterfly_girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode06 Wow, I have to say, you are an amazing man. You're gentle and passionate, and my God, you are such a good listener!
