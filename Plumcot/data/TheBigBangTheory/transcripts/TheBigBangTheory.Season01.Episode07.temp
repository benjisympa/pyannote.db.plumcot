TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard Watch this, it's really cool. Call Leonard Hofstadter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howards_phone Did you say, call Helen Boxleitner?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard No. Call Leonard Hofstadter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howards_phone Did you say, call Temple Beth Sader. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard Here, let me try. Call McFlono McFloonyloo. Heh-heh. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howards_phone Calling Rajesh Koothrappali. .
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 raj Oh, that's very impressive. And a little racist. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon If we're all through playing mock the flawed technology, can we get on with Halo night, we were supposed to start at eight, it is now 8.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard So? We'll start now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon Yes, first we have to decide if those lost six minutes will be coming out of game time, bathroom time or the pizza break.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 raj We can split it two, two and two.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard If we're having anchovies on the pizza we can't take it out of bathroom time. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon Oh, what fresh hell is this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard Hey Penny, come on in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Hey guys. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard See a Penny, pick her up, and all the day you'll have good luck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny No you won't. Uh, can I hide out here for a while.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard Sure. What's going on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Well, there's this girl I know from back in Nebraska,Christy, well anyway she called me up and she's like 'Hey, how's California,' and I'm like 'Awesome' 'cause, you know, it's not Nebraska, and the next thing I know she's invited herself out here to stay with me. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon 8.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Anyway, she got here today, and she's just been in my apartment, yakkety-yakking about every guy she's slept with in Omaha, which is basically every guy in Omaha, and washing the sluttiest collection of underwear you have ever seen in my bathroom sink.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard Well, is she doing it one thong at a time, or does she just throw it all in, like some sort of erotic bouillabaisse?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny He really needs to dial it down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard So, if you don't like this Christy, why are you letting her stay? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Well, she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my brother, so she's kind of family. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon You know, I apologize for my earlier outburst, who needs Halo when we can be regaled with the delightfully folksy tale of the whore of Omaha?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard Oh, I don't think she's a whore.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny No, yeah she's definitely a whore. I mean, she has absolutely no standards, this one time, she was at ... where's Howard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard Bonjour mademoiselle, I understand you're new in town. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon Oh good grief.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Ugh, I cannot believe Christy let Howard into my apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes, but on a more serious note it's 8 and we're still not playing Halo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard Okay, fine, we'll just play one on one until he gets back. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon One on one? We don't play one on one, we play teams, not one on one. One on one!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard Well the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut Raj in half.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 raj Oh, sure, cut the foreigner in half, there's a billion more where he came from. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Hey, if you guys need a fourth, I'll play.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard Great idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon Uh, no. The wheel was a great idea. Relativity was a great idea. This is a notion, and a rather sucky one at that. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon Why? Oh, Penny, Penny, Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Oh, what, what, what? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon This is a complex battle simulation with a steep learning curve, there are myriad weapons, vehicles and strategies to master, not to mention an extremely intricate back-story.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Oh cool, whose head did I just blow off? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon Mine. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Okay, I got this, lock and load boys. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard It's the only way we can play teams. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon Yes, but whoever's her partner will be hamstrung by her lack of experience and not to mention that fact that sh ... 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Ha-ha, there goes your head again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon Okay, this isn't at all good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who's just respawned, you need to give them a chance to now come on!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon Raj, Raj, she's got me cornered, cover me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Cover this, suckers. Ha-ha-ha!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard Penny, you are on fire.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Yeah, so is Sheldon. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon Okay, that's it, I don't know how, but she is cheating. No-one can be that attractive and be this skilled at a video game. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Wait, wait, Sheldon, come back, you forgot something. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny This plasma grenade. Ha! Look, it's raining you! 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon You laugh now, you just wait until you need tech support. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Gosh, he's kind of a sore loser, isn't he?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard Well, to be fair, he is also a rather unpleasant winner. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Well, it's been fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard You know, Penny, we make such a good team, maybe we could enter a couple of Halo tournaments sometime.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Or we could just have a life. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard I guess for you that's an option.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Good night, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard Good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny As usual, nice talking to you Raj 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 raj What do you suppose she meant by that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard She's an enigma, Raj. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon And another thing, there's a certain ethic to the game, Penny, a well estab ...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard She's gone, Sheldon. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon Well she could have said goodbye. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Okay, I have a problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon It's called carpal tunnel syndrome, and quite frankly you deserve it. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard What's wrong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Um, well, Howard and Christy are ... kind of ... hooking up in my bedroom. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard Are you sure?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Look, I grew up on a farm, okay, from what I heard they're either having sex or Howard's caught in a milking machine. Do you mind if I stay here tonight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard No, take the couch, or my bed, I just got new pillows, hypo-allergenics. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Uh, the couch is good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon Hold that thought, Leonard, a moment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard Let me guess, you have a problem with this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon Where do I begin? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard It's up to you, crazy person's choice. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon Well first, we don't have house guests, frankly if I could afford the rent, I'd ask you to leave. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard Your friendship means a lot to me as well, what else? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon Well, our earthquake supplies, we have a two day, two man kit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard So? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon So, if there is an earthquake and the three of us are trapped here, we could be out of food by tomorrow afternoon. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard I'm sorry, are you suggesting that if we let Penny stay we might succumb to cannibalism?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon No-one ever thinks it will happen until it does. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard Penny, if you promise not to chew the flesh off our bones while we sleep, you can stay. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Hu... what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon He's engaging in. It's the logical fallacy of extending someone's argument to ridiculous proportions and then criticizing the result, and I do not appreciate it. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard I'll get you a blanket and a pillow. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon Okay, well since I'm obviously being ignored here, let's go over the morning schedule, I use the bathroom, plan your ablutions and bodily functions accordingly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny How am I supposed to plan my bodily functions?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon I suggest no liquids after 11pm. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard Here you go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Thanks Leonard. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon Hmmph, wrong. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny I'm listening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon Your head goes on the other end.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Why? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon It's culturally universal, a bed, even a temporary bed, is always oriented with the headboard away from the door. It serves the ancient imperative of protecting oneself against marauders.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny I'll risk it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon Hm! 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Anything else I should know?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon Yes. If you use my toothbrush I'll jump out that window. Please don't come to my funeral. Have a good night. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard Sorry about that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny That's okay. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard FYI, his toothbrush is the red one in the plexiglass case under the UV light. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Got it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard Well, sleep tight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Thanks. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard Funny expression, sleep tight. It refers to the early construction of beds which featured a mattress suspended on interlocking ropes which would occasionally ... sleep tight. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard What are you doing? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon Every Saturday since we have lived in this apartment, I have awakened at 6, poured myself a bowl of cereal, added a quarter cup of 2% milk, sat on this end of this couch, turned on BBC America and watched Doctor Who. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard Penny's still sleeping.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon Every Saturday since we have lived in this apartment, I have awakened at 6, poured myself a bowl of cereal ...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard I know, I know, look, you have a TV in your room, why don't you just have breakfast in bed? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon Because I am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating Mother's Day. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Uh, what time is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard Almost 6. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny I slept all day?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard Oh, no, it's 6 in the morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny What the hell is your problem?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon Okay, this cereal has lost all its molecular integrity, I now have a bowl of shredded wheat paste.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard Hola, nerd-migos. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Why do you people hate sleep? Are you wearing my robe?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard Oh, yeah, sorry, I'll have it cleaned.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny That's okay, keep it. Where's Christy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard In the shower. Oh, by the way, where did you get that loofah mitt? Yours reaches places that mine just won't.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Y-you used my loofah?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard More precisely we used your loofah. I exfoliated her brains out! 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny You can keep that too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard Ah, well then we'll probably need to talk about your stuffed bear collection.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 christy Howard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard In here my lady.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 christy Mmmm, there's my little engine that could.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard chka-chka-chka-chka-chka-chka-chka .
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon Well there's one beloved children's book I'll never read again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 christy Hi,Christy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard Leonard. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon I'm Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 christy Right, you're Howard's entourage. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Uh, so Christy, what are your plans?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 christy Oh, well, Howard said he'd take me shopping in Beverley Hills. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Yeah, no, I meant plans to find some place to live. Other than with me, not that I don't love having you, but it's ... a little crowded.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard Penny, you're always welcome to stay with us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon Oh, terrific, now we're running a cute little B&B .
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard Let me offer a little outside the box thinking here, why doesn't Christy stay with me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard For one thing you live with your mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard I do not, my mother lives with me. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon Well then, it's all settled,Christy will stay with Howard, Penny can go back to her apartment, and I'll watch the last 24 minutes of Doctor Who, although at this point it's more like Doctor Why Bother. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard Sheldon you just can't dictate ...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon No more talking, everybody go!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard So, what do you say, you wanna repair to Casa Wolowitz? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 christy What is that, like a Mexican deli?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard I'm sorry, I should have mentioned this earlier, my last name is Wolowitz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 christy Oh, that's so cool. My first Jew!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon I imagine there aren't many kosher corn-huskers. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 christy But you're still taking me shopping, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard Anything you want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 christy Okay, I'll go pack my stuff.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard When they perfect human cloning I'm going to order twelve of those.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard Howard, can't you see she's using you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard Who cares, last night she pulled off her blouse and I wept!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Look, Howard, I know her, okay, she'll have sex with anyone as long as they keep buying her things. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard Yay! If you'll excuse me, I have some Bar-Mitzvah bonds to cash. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon I'm sorry, we cannot do this without Wolowitz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard We can't order Chinese food without Wolowitz?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon Let me walk you through it, our standard is, the steamed dumpling appetizer, General Tso's chicken, beef with broccoli, shrimp with lobster sauce and vegetable lo-main. Do you see the problem?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard I see problem. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon Our entire order is predicated on four dumplings and four entrees divided among four people. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard So, we'll just order three entrees.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon Fine, what do you want to eliminate, and who gets the extra dumpling?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 raj We could cut it into thirds. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon Then it is no longer a dumpling, once you cut it open, it is at best a very small open faced sandwich. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 waiter Hi fellas. Oh, where's your annoying little friend who thinks he speaks Mandarin?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon He's putting his needs ahead of the collective good. Where he comes from, that's punishable by death.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 waiter I come from Sacramento. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard Can we get an order of dumplings, but with three instead of four.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 waiter No substitutions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard This isn't a substitution, it's a reduction. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 waiter Okay, no reductions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard Fine, bring us three orders of dumplings, that's twelve, we'll each have four. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 raj That works. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon No, if we fill up on dumplings we'll need to eliminate another entree. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 waiter No eliminations. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard If we have extra, we'll just take the leftovers home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon And divide it how, I'm telling you, we cannot do this without Wolowitz. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard Wolowitz is with his new girlfriend, if you had let me invite Penny, then you would have had your fourth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon Have you seen Penny eat Chinese food? She uses a fork, and she double dips her egg rolls. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard We don't order egg rolls.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon Exactly, but we'd have to if she was here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 raj Can we please make a decision, not only are there children starving in India, there's an Indian starving right here. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard Here's an idea, why don't we just go out for Indian food.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 raj Uurgh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 waiter You are nice boys. Tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to bring you the four dumplings. When I'm walking over to the table, maybe I get bumped, one of the dumplings falls to the floor, no-one has to know. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon I'll know. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 waiter 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 raj How about soup?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard Yeah, we can always divide soup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon What about the won-tons?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Oh, hey guys, what's up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon It's Halo night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Yeah. Okay. So?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard Well, with Wolowitz spending all of his time with your friend Christy, 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny She's not my friend. Friends do not get their friends care bears all sweaty. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard Right, anyway, uh, with Wolowitz occupied elsewhere, we had something we wanted to ask you. Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon Yes. Penny, we would very much appreciate it if you would be the fourth member of our Halo team. I don't think I need to tell you what an honor this is. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Oh, that's so sweet. But I'm going out dancing with a girlfriend. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon You can't go out, it's Halo night. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Well, for Penny it's dancing night. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon You go dancing every Wednesday?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Look, why don't I play with you guys tomorrow?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon Tonight is Halo night! It's like talking to a wall. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Alright, now Sheldon, you and I are about to have a problem. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard Sheldon, remember, we role-played this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon Yes, but you didn't portray her as completely irrational.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Alright fellas, I gotta go. Good luck. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard Maybe we should have asked if we could go dancing with her and her girlfriend. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon Okay, assuming we could dance, which we can't, there are three of us and two of them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard So?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon It's the Chinese restaurant all over again. I assure you that cutting a dumpling in thirds is child's play compared with three men, each attempting to dance with 67% of a woman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard Aaah, for God's sake, Sheldon, you are driving me crazy. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon Your anger's not with me, sir, but with basic mathematics.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard No, I'm pretty sure my anger's with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 raj What's happening to us? We're falling apart. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard Who are you calling?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon The only man who can restore any semblance of balance to our universe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard Hi this is Howard Wolowitz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 christy And this is Christy Van Der Bell. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard We can't get to the phone right now because we're having sex!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 christy You're not going to put that on your message are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard No, I'm just kidding, I'll re-record it. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard Sheldon, think this through, you're going to ask Howard to choose between sex and Halo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon No, I'm going to ask him to choose between sex and Halo 3. As far as I know, sex has not been upgraded to include high-def graphics and enhanced weapon systems. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard You're right, all sex has is nudity, orgasms and human contact. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon My point.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 christy I'm just saying, you can take the damned plastic off the couch once in a while.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howards_mother Why, so you and Howard can hump on it? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard Ladies, ladies, I'm sure there's a middle ground.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 christy_and_howards_mother_together Shut up, Howard! 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard You girl talk, I'm going to take my scooter out for a little spin. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 christy Are you happy? You drove your own son out of the house!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howards_mother Why don't you stop butting in where you don't belong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard What are you guys doing here? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon It's Halo night. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howards_mother He's not a man, he's a putz, and don't you take that tone with me, you gold digger.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 christy What did you call me? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howards_mother You heard me, and I'll tell you something else, you're barking up the wrong tree, 'cause as long as you're around, Howard is out of the will.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 christy You know what? I got better offers. I'm outta here!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howards_mother That's right, go back to Babylon, you whore!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard So, Halo night, huh? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 raj I thought she was the whore of Omaha?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon Shhh! 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard Sheldon, you got him in your sights, fire, he's charging his plasma rifle. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon I can't shoot now, I'm cloaking.
