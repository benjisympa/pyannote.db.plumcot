TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Watch this, it's really cool. Call Leonard Hofstadter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howards_phone#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 Did you say, call Helen Boxleitner?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard_wolowitz No. Call Leonard Hofstadter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howards_phone#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 Did you say, call Temple Beth Sader.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard_wolowitz No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Here, let me try. Call McFlono McFloonyloo. Heh-heh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howards_phone#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 Calling Rajesh Koothrappali. .
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Oh, that's very impressive. And a little racist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper If we're all through playing mock the flawed technology, can we get on with Halo night, we were supposed to start at eight, it is now 8.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter So? We'll start now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Yes, first we have to decide if those lost six minutes will be coming out of game time, bathroom time or the pizza break.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 raj_koothrappali We can split it two, two and two.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard_wolowitz If we're having anchovies on the pizza we can't take it out of bathroom time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Oh, what fresh hell is this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Hey Penny, come on in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Hey guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard_wolowitz See a Penny, pick her up, and all the day you'll have good luck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny No you won't. Uh, can I hide out here for a while.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Sure. What's going on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Well, there's this girl I know from back in Nebraska,Christy, well anyway she called me up and she's like 'Hey, how's California,' and I'm like 'Awesome' 'cause, you know, it's not Nebraska, and the next thing I know she's invited herself out here to stay with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper 8.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Anyway, she got here today, and she's just been in my apartment, yakkety-yakking about every guy she's slept with in Omaha, which is basically every guy in Omaha, and washing the sluttiest collection of underwear you have ever seen in my bathroom sink.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Well, is she doing it one thong at a time, or does she just throw it all in, like some sort of erotic bouillabaisse?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny He really needs to dial it down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter So, if you don't like this Christy, why are you letting her stay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Well, she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my brother, so she's kind of family.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper You know, I apologize for my earlier outburst, who needs Halo when we can be regaled with the delightfully folksy tale of the whore of Omaha?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Oh, I don't think she's a whore.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny No, yeah she's definitely a whore. I mean, she has absolutely no standards, this one time, she was at ... where's Howard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Bonjour mademoiselle, I understand you're new in town.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Oh good grief.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Ugh, I cannot believe Christy let Howard into my apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes, but on a more serious note it's 8 and we're still not playing Halo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Okay, fine, we'll just play one on one until he gets back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper One on one? We don't play one on one, we play teams, not one on one. One on one!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Well the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut Raj in half.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Oh, sure, cut the foreigner in half, there's a billion more where he came from.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Hey, if you guys need a fourth, I'll play.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Great idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Uh, no. The wheel was a great idea. Relativity was a great idea. This is a notion, and a rather sucky one at that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Why? Oh, Penny, Penny, Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Oh, what, what, what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper This is a complex battle simulation with a steep learning curve, there are myriad weapons, vehicles and strategies to master, not to mention an extremely intricate back-story.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Oh cool, whose head did I just blow off?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Mine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Okay, I got this, lock and load boys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter It's the only way we can play teams.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Yes, but whoever's her partner will be hamstrung by her lack of experience and not to mention that fact that sh ...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Ha-ha, there goes your head again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Okay, this isn't at all good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who's just respawned, you need to give them a chance to now come on!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Raj, Raj, she's got me cornered, cover me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Cover this, suckers. Ha-ha-ha!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Penny, you are on fire.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Yeah, so is Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Okay, that's it, I don't know how, but she is cheating. No-one can be that attractive and be this skilled at a video game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Wait, wait, Sheldon, come back, you forgot something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny This plasma grenade. Ha! Look, it's raining you!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper You laugh now, you just wait until you need tech support.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Gosh, he's kind of a sore loser, isn't he?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Well, to be fair, he is also a rather unpleasant winner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Well, it's been fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter You know, Penny, we make such a good team, maybe we could enter a couple of Halo tournaments sometime.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Or we could just have a life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter I guess for you that's an option.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Good night, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny As usual, nice talking to you Raj
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 raj_koothrappali What do you suppose she meant by that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter She's an enigma, Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper And another thing, there's a certain ethic to the game, Penny, a well estab ...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter She's gone, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Well she could have said goodbye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Okay, I have a problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper It's called carpal tunnel syndrome, and quite frankly you deserve it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter What's wrong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Um, well, Howard and Christy are ... kind of ... hooking up in my bedroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Are you sure?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Look, I grew up on a farm, okay, from what I heard they're either having sex or Howard's caught in a milking machine. Do you mind if I stay here tonight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter No, take the couch, or my bed, I just got new pillows, hypo-allergenics.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Uh, the couch is good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Hold that thought, Leonard, a moment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Let me guess, you have a problem with this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Where do I begin?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter It's up to you, crazy person's choice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Well first, we don't have house guests, frankly if I could afford the rent, I'd ask you to leave.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Your friendship means a lot to me as well, what else?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Well, our earthquake supplies, we have a two day, two man kit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter So?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper So, if there is an earthquake and the three of us are trapped here, we could be out of food by tomorrow afternoon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter I'm sorry, are you suggesting that if we let Penny stay we might succumb to cannibalism?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper No-one ever thinks it will happen until it does.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Penny, if you promise not to chew the flesh off our bones while we sleep, you can stay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Hu... what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper He's engaging in. It's the logical fallacy of extending someone's argument to ridiculous proportions and then criticizing the result, and I do not appreciate it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter I'll get you a blanket and a pillow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Okay, well since I'm obviously being ignored here, let's go over the morning schedule, I use the bathroom, plan your ablutions and bodily functions accordingly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny How am I supposed to plan my bodily functions?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper I suggest no liquids after 11pm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Here you go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Thanks Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Hmmph, wrong.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny I'm listening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Your head goes on the other end.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper It's culturally universal, a bed, even a temporary bed, is always oriented with the headboard away from the door. It serves the ancient imperative of protecting oneself against marauders.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny I'll risk it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Hm!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Anything else I should know?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Yes. If you use my toothbrush I'll jump out that window. Please don't come to my funeral. Have a good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Sorry about that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny That's okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter FYI, his toothbrush is the red one in the plexiglass case under the UV light.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Got it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Well, sleep tight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Funny expression, sleep tight. It refers to the early construction of beds which featured a mattress suspended on interlocking ropes which would occasionally ... sleep tight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Every Saturday since we have lived in this apartment, I have awakened at 6, poured myself a bowl of cereal, added a quarter cup of 2% milk, sat on this end of this couch, turned on BBC America and watched Doctor Who.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Penny's still sleeping.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Every Saturday since we have lived in this apartment, I have awakened at 6, poured myself a bowl of cereal ...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter I know, I know, look, you have a TV in your room, why don't you just have breakfast in bed?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Because I am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating Mother's Day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Uh, what time is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Almost 6.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny I slept all day?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Oh, no, it's 6 in the morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny What the hell is your problem?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Okay, this cereal has lost all its molecular integrity, I now have a bowl of shredded wheat paste.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Hola, nerd-migos.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Why do you people hate sleep? Are you wearing my robe?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Oh, yeah, sorry, I'll have it cleaned.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny That's okay, keep it. Where's Christy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard_wolowitz In the shower. Oh, by the way, where did you get that loofah mitt? Yours reaches places that mine just won't.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Y-you used my loofah?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard_wolowitz More precisely we used your loofah. I exfoliated her brains out!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny You can keep that too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Ah, well then we'll probably need to talk about your stuffed bear collection.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 christy_vanderbilt Howard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard_wolowitz In here my lady.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 christy_vanderbilt Mmmm, there's my little engine that could.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard_wolowitz chka-chka-chka-chka-chka-chka-chka .
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Well there's one beloved children's book I'll never read again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 christy_vanderbilt Hi,Christy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper I'm Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 christy_vanderbilt Right, you're Howard's entourage.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Uh, so Christy, what are your plans?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 christy_vanderbilt Oh, well, Howard said he'd take me shopping in Beverley Hills.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Yeah, no, I meant plans to find some place to live. Other than with me, not that I don't love having you, but it's ... a little crowded.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Penny, you're always welcome to stay with us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Oh, terrific, now we're running a cute little B&B .
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Let me offer a little outside the box thinking here, why doesn't Christy stay with me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter For one thing you live with your mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard_wolowitz I do not, my mother lives with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Well then, it's all settled,Christy will stay with Howard, Penny can go back to her apartment, and I'll watch the last 24 minutes of Doctor Who, although at this point it's more like Doctor Why Bother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon you just can't dictate ...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper No more talking, everybody go!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard_wolowitz So, what do you say, you wanna repair to Casa Wolowitz?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 christy_vanderbilt What is that, like a Mexican deli?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard_wolowitz I'm sorry, I should have mentioned this earlier, my last name is Wolowitz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 christy_vanderbilt Oh, that's so cool. My first Jew!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper I imagine there aren't many kosher corn-huskers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 christy_vanderbilt But you're still taking me shopping, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Anything you want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 christy_vanderbilt Okay, I'll go pack my stuff.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard_wolowitz When they perfect human cloning I'm going to order twelve of those.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Howard, can't you see she's using you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Who cares, last night she pulled off her blouse and I wept!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Look, Howard, I know her, okay, she'll have sex with anyone as long as they keep buying her things.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Yay! If you'll excuse me, I have some Bar-Mitzvah bonds to cash.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper I'm sorry, we cannot do this without Wolowitz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter We can't order Chinese food without Wolowitz?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Let me walk you through it, our standard is, the steamed dumpling appetizer, General Tso's chicken, beef with broccoli, shrimp with lobster sauce and vegetable lo-main. Do you see the problem?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter I see problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Our entire order is predicated on four dumplings and four entrees divided among four people.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter So, we'll just order three entrees.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Fine, what do you want to eliminate, and who gets the extra dumpling?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 raj_koothrappali We could cut it into thirds.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Then it is no longer a dumpling, once you cut it open, it is at best a very small open faced sandwich.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 waiter#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 Hi fellas. Oh, where's your annoying little friend who thinks he speaks Mandarin?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper He's putting his needs ahead of the collective good. Where he comes from, that's punishable by death.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 waiter#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 I come from Sacramento.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Can we get an order of dumplings, but with three instead of four.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 waiter#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 No substitutions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter This isn't a substitution, it's a reduction.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 waiter#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 Okay, no reductions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Fine, bring us three orders of dumplings, that's twelve, we'll each have four.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 raj_koothrappali That works.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper No, if we fill up on dumplings we'll need to eliminate another entree.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 waiter#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 No eliminations.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter If we have extra, we'll just take the leftovers home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper And divide it how, I'm telling you, we cannot do this without Wolowitz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Wolowitz is with his new girlfriend, if you had let me invite Penny, then you would have had your fourth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Have you seen Penny eat Chinese food? She uses a fork, and she double dips her egg rolls.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter We don't order egg rolls.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Exactly, but we'd have to if she was here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Can we please make a decision, not only are there children starving in India, there's an Indian starving right here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Here's an idea, why don't we just go out for Indian food.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Uurgh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 waiter#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 You are nice boys. Tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to bring you the four dumplings. When I'm walking over to the table, maybe I get bumped, one of the dumplings falls to the floor, no-one has to know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper I'll know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 waiter#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 raj_koothrappali How about soup?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, we can always divide soup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper What about the won-tons?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Oh, hey guys, what's up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper It's Halo night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Yeah. Okay. So?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Well, with Wolowitz spending all of his time with your friend Christy,
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny She's not my friend. Friends do not get their friends care bears all sweaty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Right, anyway, uh, with Wolowitz occupied elsewhere, we had something we wanted to ask you. Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Yes. Penny, we would very much appreciate it if you would be the fourth member of our Halo team. I don't think I need to tell you what an honor this is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Oh, that's so sweet. But I'm going out dancing with a girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper You can't go out, it's Halo night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Well, for Penny it's dancing night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper You go dancing every Wednesday?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Look, why don't I play with you guys tomorrow?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Tonight is Halo night! It's like talking to a wall.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Alright, now Sheldon, you and I are about to have a problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, remember, we role-played this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Yes, but you didn't portray her as completely irrational.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Alright fellas, I gotta go. Good luck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Maybe we should have asked if we could go dancing with her and her girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Okay, assuming we could dance, which we can't, there are three of us and two of them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter So?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper It's the Chinese restaurant all over again. I assure you that cutting a dumpling in thirds is child's play compared with three men, each attempting to dance with 67% of a woman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Aaah, for God's sake, Sheldon, you are driving me crazy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Your anger's not with me, sir, but with basic mathematics.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter No, I'm pretty sure my anger's with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 raj_koothrappali What's happening to us? We're falling apart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Who are you calling?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper The only man who can restore any semblance of balance to our universe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Hi this is Howard Wolowitz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 christy_vanderbilt And this is Christy Van Der Bell.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard_wolowitz We can't get to the phone right now because we're having sex!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 christy_vanderbilt You're not going to put that on your message are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard_wolowitz No, I'm just kidding, I'll re-record it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, think this through, you're going to ask Howard to choose between sex and Halo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper No, I'm going to ask him to choose between sex and Halo 3. As far as I know, sex has not been upgraded to include high-def graphics and enhanced weapon systems.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter You're right, all sex has is nudity, orgasms and human contact.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper My point.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 christy_vanderbilt I'm just saying, you can take the damned plastic off the couch once in a while.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 debbie_wolowitz Why, so you and Howard can hump on it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Ladies, ladies, I'm sure there's a middle ground.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 christy_vanderbilt@debbie_wolowitz Shut up, Howard!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard_wolowitz You girl talk, I'm going to take my scooter out for a little spin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 christy_vanderbilt Are you happy? You drove your own son out of the house!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 debbie_wolowitz Why don't you stop butting in where you don't belong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard_wolowitz What are you guys doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper It's Halo night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 debbie_wolowitz He's not a man, he's a putz, and don't you take that tone with me, you gold digger.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 christy_vanderbilt What did you call me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 debbie_wolowitz You heard me, and I'll tell you something else, you're barking up the wrong tree, 'cause as long as you're around, Howard is out of the will.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 christy_vanderbilt You know what? I got better offers. I'm outta here!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 debbie_wolowitz That's right, go back to Babylon, you whore!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard_wolowitz So, Halo night, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 raj_koothrappali I thought she was the whore of Omaha?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Shhh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Sheldon, you got him in your sights, fire, he's charging his plasma rifle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper I can't shoot now, I'm cloaking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Now, Raj, kill Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 raj_koothrappali I can't see him!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper That's why the call it cloaking, dead man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Well then start throwing grenades.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 raj_koothrappali I'm all out!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Hi guys, my friends and I got tired of dancing, so we came over to have sex with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter That will do, Raj, straight for the tank.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper We said no tanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 raj_koothrappali There are no rules in hell!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Son of a bitch, medpack, I need a medpack!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 penny Told yah! .
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter There's a sniper, use your rocket launcher.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 raj_koothrappali All I've got is a needler, and I'm all out of ammo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 sheldon_cooper And now you're out of life! Why did you hit pause?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter I thought I heard something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode07 raj_koothrappali What?
