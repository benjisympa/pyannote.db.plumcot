TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Damn you, walletnook.com.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Problem?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper The online description was completely misleading, they said eight slots plus removable ID, to any rational person that would mean room for nine cards, but they don't tell you the removable ID takes up one slot, it's a nightmare.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Okay, now, do you really need the honorary Justice League of America membership card?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper It's been in every wallet I've owned since I was five.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper It says keep this on your person at all times. It's right here under Batman's signature.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali And this is Leonard and Sheldon's apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Guess whose parents just got broadband.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali May I present, live from New Delhi, Dr and Mrs V. M. Koothrappali.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 dr_vm_koothrappali Lift up the camera. I'm looking at his crotch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Sorry papa.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 dr_vm_koothrappali Oh, there's much better. Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Hi!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali And over here is Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali He lives with Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 mrs_koothrappali Oh, that's nice. Like Haroun and Tanweer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali No, no, not like Haroun and Tanweer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 mrs_koothrappali Such sweet young men, they just adopted the cutest little Punjabi baby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, we're not like Haroun and Tanweer!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 dr_vm_koothrappali So are you boys academics like our son?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 together#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 dr_vm_koothrappali And your parents are comfortable with your limited earning potential?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 together#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 Not at all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Papa, please don't start.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 dr_vm_koothrappali God, it's just a question, he's so sensitive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Okay, that's my life, that's my friends, good to see you, say goodbye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 together#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 Bye!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 dr_vm_koothrappali Wait, wait. Before you go we have good news. Put the computer down and gather your friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali What is it papa.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 dr_vm_koothrappali Friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Is it just me, or does webchatting with your clothes on seem a little pointless.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 mrs_koothrappali Rajesh, do you remember Lalita Gupta?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali The little fat girl that used to kick me in the samosas and call me untouchable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 mrs_koothrappali Yes. Well, now she's a dental student at USC, so we gave her your contact information.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Why did you do that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 dr_vm_koothrappali You're 26 years old Rajesh. We want grandchildren.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali But Papa, I'm not supposed...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 mrs_koothrappali Lalita's parents approve the match.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 dr_vm_koothrappali If you decide on a spring wedding, we can avoid monsoon season.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Spring wedding?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 mrs_koothrappali It's up to you dear, we don't want to meddle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali If you don't want to meddle, then why are you meddling?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper If I may, your parents probably don't consider this meddling, while arranged marriages are no longer the norm, Indian parents continue to have a greater than average involvement in their children's lives.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Why are you telling me about my own culture?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper You seemed confused.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Sorry, Mommy, Papa, but with all due respect I really can't go through...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 mrs_koothrappali Sorry darling, we have to go. Doogie Howser is on. Grandma, it's Doogie time! Bye bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 dr_vm_koothrappali Bye bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali I don't believe it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Neither do I. Doogie Howser's been off the air for like, twenty years.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Actually, I read somewhere that it's one of the most popular programs in India.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper It might speak to a cultural aspiration to have one's children enter the medical profession.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter I bet you're right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 howard_wolowitz I bet they love Scrubs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper What's not to love?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Excuse me, hello? My parents are trying to marry me off to a total stranger, what am I going to do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper I suggest you go through with it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Romantic love as the basis for marriage has only existed since the nineteenth century. Up until then, arranged marriages were the norm, and it served society quite well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 howard_wolowitz It's the entire premise of Fiddler on the Roof.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter I'm not a big fan of musicals, but I love that show.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Me too. Of course, it speaks to me culturally.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Understandable, but there's a universality to that story which transcends ethnicity.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Let's not forget it's got some really catchy tunes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 all@
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Okay, I know what I'm going to do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Find new friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 howard_wolowitz So who wants to rent Fiddler?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper No need, we have the special edition.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Well, maybe we are like Haroun and Tanweer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper This is Dr Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I need to cancel my membership to the Planetarium. Yeah, well I'm sorry too, but there's just no room for you in my wallet. Yeah, I understand, but it was between you and the Museum of Natural History and, frankly, you don't have dinosaurs. Well I'll miss you too, bye bye. Okay, I know you're texting about me, and I'd really like you to stop.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Oh dear, I am rightly and truly screwed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Hey, I thought you were finding new friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali I've got some feelers out. In the meantime, listen to this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 lalita_gupta Hi Rajesh, this is Lalita Gupta. Your mother gave my mother your phone number to give to me. So I'm calling you, and, ah... call me back. Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Can you believe how pushy she is?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter So don't call her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali If I don't call her, I won't hear the end of it from my parents.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter So call her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali How can I call her, you know I can't talk to women.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter I'm done, anybody else?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Give me the phone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Just give it to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Don't worry, you'll thank me. Hello Lalita, Raj Koothrappali. Yes it is good to talk to you too. So, what are you wearing. Oh, not important, so, anyhow, when would you like to meet. Friday works for me. And I call you with the time and place, but in the meantime, keep it real babe. You may now thank me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali For what, making me sound like a Simpsons character?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Fine, next time make your own date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali I didn't want to make this one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Look on the bright side, she might turn out to be a nice, beautiful girl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Great, then we'll get married, I won't be able to talk to her, and we'll spend the rest of our lives in total silence.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Worked for my parents.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 penny Hi guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Oh, hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 penny I need some guinea pigs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Okay, there's a lab animal supply company in Reseda you could try, but if your research is going to have human applications may I suggest white mice instead, their brain chemistry is far closer to ours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 penny I swear to God, Sheldon, one day I'm going to get the hang of talking to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter His mom's been saying that for years. What's up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 penny Well, I finally convinced the restaurant to give me a bar tending shift, so I need to practice making drinks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Oh, great, well the key to acquiring proficiency in any task is repetition.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper With certain obvious exceptions. Suicide, for example.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 penny So Leonard, how about it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Look, Penny, we'd love to help you, but Raj is going through some stuff right now. And besides, he doesn't drink, so... Really? Um, Raj is going through some stuff right now and he'd like to take up drinking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 penny Okay, here you go, Leonard, one tequila sunrise.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Thank you. This drink is a wonderful example of how liquids with different specific gravities interact in a cylindrical container. Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 penny Okay, Raj, what'll it be?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Whatever you recommend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 penny Uh, how about a grasshopper. I make a mean grasshopper. Okay? Good. Coming up. Sheldon, what are you going to have?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper I'll have a diet coke.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 penny Okay, can you please order a cocktail, I need to practice mixing drinks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Fine. I'll have a virgin cuba libre.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 penny That's, um, rum and coke without the rum.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Yes,
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 penny So coke.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Yes. And would you make it diet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 penny There's a can in the fridge.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper A cuba libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime wedge.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 penny Then swim to Cuba.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Bartenders are supposed to have people skills.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 penny Okay, Raj, here you go. Alright, who's next?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 howard_wolowitz I'd like to try a slippery nipple.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 penny Okay, you're cut off. Anybody need a refill?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Where did my life go, Penny? One day I'm a carefree bachelor, and the next I'm married and driving a minivan to peewee cricket matches in suburban New Delhi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 penny A... are you talking to me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Is there another Penny here? I had such plans. I had dreams. I was going to be the Indira Gandhi of particle astro-physics. But with a penis, of course.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter It's amazing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Ever since I was a little boy my father wanted me to be a gynaecologist like him. How can I be a gynaecologist, I can barely look a woman in the eye. You know what, I'm not going to let my parents control my future any longer, it's time for a showdown. Somebody give me a computer with a webcam.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 penny Okay, sweetie, I think that's the grasshopper talking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali And it's about to tell my parents that I'm not riding an elephant down the aisle with Lalita Gupta.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 penny Okay, calm down, no-one can make you get married. Why don't you just meet this girl and, see what happens.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Haven't you been listening to me, I cannot talk to women.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Um... Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 howard_wolowitz No, no, let's see how long it takes him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 penny Um, Raj, honey, you say you can't talk to women but... you've been talking to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper And now we'll never know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali You're right. I... I am talking to you. Hello Penny, how are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 penny I'm fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Okay, now I just need to make sure I have a Lalita before I meet the grasshopper. It's a sweet green miracle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 penny Okay, if you're going to drink on this date just promise me you won't overdo it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Overdo what? Happiness? Freedom? This warm glow inside of me that promises everything is going to be all hunky donkey?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 penny Yeah, that. Uh, why don't you bring her to my restaurant when I'm tending the bar so I can keep an eye on you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Wait a minute, what's the plan here? Let's say he meets her and he likes her and they get married, what's he going to do, stay drunk for the rest of his life?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Worked for my parents.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali I can't believe I'm sitting here next to little Lalita Gupta.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 lalita_gupta Well, you are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Little Lalita. That's kind of fun to say. Little Lalita, Little Lalita, Little Lalita, you should try it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 lalita_gupta No, it's okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali You have lost so much weight! That must have been difficult for you because you were so, so fat! Do you remember?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 lalita_gupta Yes, I do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Of course you do. Who could forget being that fat?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 lalita_gupta Well, I've been trying.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali So you're a dental student? Hmm, are you aware that dentists have an extremely high suicide rate? Not as high as, say, air traffic controllers, but then there are far more dentists than air traffic controllers, so in pure numbers you're still winning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 lalita_gupta Yay me!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter You have a drink that'll make him less obnoxious?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 penny Drinks do not work that way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 howard_wolowitz I'd say he was doing fine, look at her, last girl my mom set me up with had a moustache and a vestigial tail.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Sorry I'm late.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter What happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Nothing, I just really didn't want to come. Virgin diet cuba libre please.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 penny Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper In a tall glass, with a lime wedge.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 penny Oh, I'll wedge it right in there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper So, how's Koothrappali d... oh my Lord.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper That's Princess Punchali.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter I'm pretty sure her name's Lalita.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper No, no, Princess Punchali from The Monkey and the Princess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Oh, yeah, I tried to watch that online, but they wanted a credit card.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper It's a children's story.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Oh, no it isn't.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper When I was a little boy and got sick, which was most of the time, my mother would read it to me. It's about an Indian princess who befriends a monkey, who was mocked by all the other monkeys because he was different. For some reason I related to it quite strongly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 penny I know the reason.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter We all know the reason. Sheldon, what are you getting at?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper That woman looks exactly like the pictures of Princess Punchali in the book. How often does one see a beloved fictional character come to life?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Every year at Comic Con. Every day at Disneyland you can hire Snow White to come to your house. Course they prefer it if you have a kid, but...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Hey guys. This is Lalita Gupta, Lalita this is Leonard and Sheldon and Howard and Penny. Isn't it great, she isn't fat any more!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Forgive me your highness, for I am but a monkey, and it is in my nature to climb. I did not mean to gaze upon you as you comb your hair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 lalita_gupta I'm sorry?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper You are the living embodiment of the beautiful Princess Punchali.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 lalita_gupta Oh, no kidding? Oh, who is that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper A beloved character from an Indian folk tale.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 lalita_gupta Oh. Us Indian, or 'come to our casino' Indian?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper You Indian.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 lalita_gupta Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper The resemblance is remarkable. I can practically smell the lotus blossoms woven into your ebony hair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 lalita_gupta Thanks. I imagine you smell very nice too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper I shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as I can.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 lalita_gupta Really, so do I.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali But you're a dentist, he's nuts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 lalita_gupta Don't be insulting Rajesh. So, Sheldon, tell me more about this princess you say I look like.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper It was said that the Gods fashioned her eyes out of the stars, and that roses were ashamed to bloom in the presence of her ruby lips.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 lalita_gupta Oh my.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Back off Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali If you do not stop hitting on my lady you will feel the full extent of my wrath.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper I'm not hitting on her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 lalita_gupta And I am not your lady.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 howard_wolowitz And you have no wrath.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali You are my lady. Our parents said so. We are for all intents and purposes one hundred percent hooked up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 lalita_gupta Okay, let's get something straight here. The only reason I came tonight was to get my parents off my case, I certainly don't need to be getting this old world crap from you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Exactly the kind of spirit with which Princess Punchali led the monkeys to freedom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Oh, screw Princess Punchali.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 lalita_gupta Hey, you can't talk to me like that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali But you're not Princess Punchali.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Luckily for you, she could have you beheaded.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 lalita_gupta Sheldon, are you hungry?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper I could eat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 lalita_gupta Let's go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali What just happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Beats the hell out of me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 howard_wolowitz I'll tell you what just happened, I just learned how to pick up Indian chicks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 mrs_koothrappali What are we supposed to say to Lalita's parents?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 dr_vm_koothrappali I play golf with her father, I won't be able to look at him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Maybe you should keep your eye on the ball, Papa.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 dr_vm_koothrappali Oh, now you're a funny man? This is not funny, Mr Funny Man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Doctor and Mrs Koothrappali, in all fairness, it wasn't entirely Raj's fault.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 dr_vm_koothrappali This is a family matter Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter No, I'm Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 dr_vm_koothrappali Oh, sorry, you all look alike to us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali But he's right, Papa, listen to him. You! You are the one who ruined everything!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 mrs_koothrappali Who is it? We can't see.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 dr_vm_koothrappali Turn us, turn us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Go ahead, tell my parents why they won't have any grandchildren.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper How would I know, do you have a low sperm count?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali This has nothing to do with my sperm count.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 mrs_koothrappali You are wearing the boxers that we sent you, aren't you Rajesh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Yes Mommy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 mrs_koothrappali Because you know what happens to the samosas when you wear the tidy whities.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Can we please stop talking about my testicles? Sheldon, tell them what you did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper What did I do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter You left with his date. Friends don't do that to each other.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Oh. Alright, noted. Sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Sorry? That's all you can say is sorry?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Take it, Raj. It's more than I've ever gotten.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper And may I point out she wouldn't have asked me to go with her if you hadn't been drunk and boring.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 dr_vm_koothrappali Drunk?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper And boring, her words.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 dr_vm_koothrappali I knew it, he moves to America and becomes an alcoholic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali I'm not an alcoholic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 dr_vm_koothrappali Then why were you drunk?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali It was just this one time, Papa, I swear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 dr_vm_koothrappali Are you in denial? Do we have to come over and do an intervention?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 mrs_koothrappali Don't embarrass him in front of his friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 dr_vm_koothrappali Alright. Carry us outside, we want to talk to you in private.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali But Papa, please...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 dr_vm_koothrappali Now, Rajesh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali I have to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 dr_vm_koothrappali Now listen to me...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Please wait until I get into the hall.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Okay, well, good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Hold on. What happened with you and Lalita?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper We ate. She lectured me on the link between gum disease and heart attacks, nothing I didn't already know, and I came home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter So you're not going to see her again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Why would I see her again? I already have a dentist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter I wonder who's going to tell his parents they're not having grandchildren.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter I don't believe it, what's gotten into him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 penny Oh, maybe a couple of virgin cuba libres that turned out to be kind of slutty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter You didn't?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode08 penny Hey, you do your experiments, I do mine.
