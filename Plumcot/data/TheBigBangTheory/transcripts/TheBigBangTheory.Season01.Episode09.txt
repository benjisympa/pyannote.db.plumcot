TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Okay, the X10s are online.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Gentlemen, I am now about to send a signal from this laptop through our local ISP, racing down fiber-optic cable at the speed of light to San Francisco, bouncing off a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon, Portugal, where the data packets will be handed off to submerged transatlantic cables terminating in Halifax, Nova-Scotia, and transferred across the continent via microwave relays back to our ISP and the X10 receiver attached to this lamp.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Look at me, look at me, I've got goosebumps.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Are we ready on the stereo?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 raj_koothrappali Go for stereo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny Hey guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 all@ Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny It's a little loud.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 howard_wolowitz No problem, turning it down. San Francisco, Lisbon, Halifax et voila.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny Okay, thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Hang on, hang on, do you not realize what we just did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny Yeah, you turned your stereo down with your laptop.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper No, we turned our stereo down by sending a signal around the world via the internet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny Oh. You know you can just get one of those universal remotes at Radio Shack, they're really cheap.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter No, no, no, you don't get it, um, Howard, enable public access.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Public access enabled.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny Boy, that's brilliant, but I'll see you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter No, hang on, hang on. See!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Someone in Sezchuan province, China is using his computer to turn our lights on and off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny Huh, well that's handy. Um, here's a question, why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 all@ Because we can.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper They found the remote controlled cars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny Well, wait, wait, what's on top of them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Wireless webcams, wave hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 howard_wolowitz The monster truck is out of Austin, Texas, and the blue Viper is being operated from suburban Tel Aviv.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper You may want to put on slacks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny What? Ew, stop it, no, leave me alone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Who's running the red Corvette?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 howard_wolowitz That would be me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper You know, in the future, when we're disembodied brains in jars, we're going to look back on this as eight hours well wasted.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 raj_koothrappali I don't want to be in a jar. I want my brain in an android body. Eight feet tall and ripped.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 howard_wolowitz I'm with you. I just have to make sure if I'm a synthetic human I'd still be Jewish. I promised my mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 raj_koothrappali I suppose you could have your android penis circumcised. But that's something your Rabbi would have to discuss with the manufacturers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Not to mention you'd have to power down on Saturdays.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Well, there's always the possibility that a trash can spontaneously formed around the letter, but Occam's Razor would suggest that someone threw it out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter It's from the Institute for Experimental Physics. They want us to present our paper on the properties of super solids at the topical conference on Bowes-Einstein condensates.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper I know. I read it before I threw it out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Okay... if I may drill down to the bedrock of my question, why did you throw it out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Because I have no interest in standing in the Rose Room of the Pasadena Marriott in front of a group of judgmental strangers, who wouldn't recognize true genius if it were standing in front of them giving a speech. Which, if I were there, it would be.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 howard_wolowitz I don't know, Sheldon, those topical conferences on Bowes-Einstein condensates parties are legendary.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Forget the parties.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Forget the parties? What a nerd.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Are there any other honors I've gotten that I don't know about? Did UPS drop off a Nobel Prize with my name on it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Leonard, please don't take this the wrong way, but the day you win a Nobel Prize, is the day I begin my research on the drag co-efficient of tassles on flying carpets.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 raj_koothrappali Hoo-hoo-hoo. The only thing missing from that insult was 'yo mamma.'
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 howard_wolowitz I've got one, hey Leonard, your mamma's research methodology is so flawed...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Shut up, Howard. Sheldon, we have to do this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper No we don't. We have to take in nourishment, expel waste, and inhale enough oxygen to keep ourselves from dying, everything else is optional.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Okay, let me put it this way, I'm doing it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper You can't. I'm the lead author.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Oh, come on. The only reason you're the lead author is because we went alphabetically.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper I let you think we went alphabetically to spare you the humiliation of dealing with the fact that it was my idea. Not to put too fine a point on it, but I was throwing you a bone. You're welcome.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Excuse me, I designed the experiment that proved the hypothesis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper It doesn't need proving.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter So the entire scientific community is just supposed to take your word?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper They're not supposed to, but they should.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Alright, I don't care what you say, I'm going to the conference and I'm presenting our findings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper And I forbid it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter You forbid it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper If I'm not taking credit for our work then nobody is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Oh, you admit that it's our work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper No, once again, I'm throwing you a bone. And once again, you are welcome.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Ah!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Oh no he dit'nt!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny So, how's it going with Sheldon, are you guys still not talking to each other?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Not only is he still not talking to me, but there's this thing he does where he stares at you and tries to get your brain to explode. You know, like in the classic sci-fi movie Scanners? You know, bzzz-pchew! Never mind. How about this one. It says, 'I know my physics, but I'm still a fun guy!'
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny Oh, hey, I didn't know they still made corduroy suits!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter They don't, that's why I saved this one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny Okay, well, let's just see what else you have. Okay, here, take this, and this, and this, and these.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Is this all stuff you want me to try on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny No, this is stuff I want you to throw out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny Seriously, don't even give it to charity, you won't be helping anyone. What's this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Oh, that's the bottled city of Kandor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny Uh-huh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter You see, Kandor was the capital city of the planet Krypton, it was miniaturised by Brainiac before Krypton exploded and then rescued by Superman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny Oh, nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter It's a lot cooler when girls aren't looking at it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny Here, why don't you put these on while I find a shirt and sport-coat to match.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Great, be right back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny Well, where you going, just put them on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny Oh, are you shy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter No, I'm not shy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny Don't worry, I won't look.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter I know you won't look, why would you look, there's nothing to see, well, not nothing...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny Sweetie, put the pants on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Putting them on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny So, you know, isn't there maybe some way you and Sheldon could compromise on this whole presentation thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter No. No. Scientists do not compromise. Our minds are trained to synthesize facts and come to inarguable conclusions. Not to mention, Sheldon is batcrap crazy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny What is this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Oh, careful. That's my original series Battlestar Galactica flight suit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny Oh, why didn't you wear it at Halloween?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Because it's not a costume, it's a flight suit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny Okay, alright, moving on, oh, wow, a paisley shirt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Uh-huh, it goes with my corduroy suit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny If you mean it should end up in the same place then, I agree. Is this your... your only tie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Ah. Technically yes, but, if you'll notice, it's reversible. So it works as two.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny Oh, sweetie, I don't think it even works as one. Is this all your clothes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Yeah. Everything since the eighth grade.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny The... the eighth grade?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter My last growth spurt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny Okay, well, I guess we're back to the corduroy suit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny Yup. I said no, put it down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny Hey Sheldon!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Hello Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny Get anything good?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Uh, just the latest copy of Applied Particle Physics Quarterly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny Oh, you know, that is so weird that yours came and mine didn't. . It was a joke. Yup, tip your waitresses, I'm here all week.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Penny, just to save you from further awkwardness know that I'm perfectly comfortable with the two of us climbing the stairs in silence.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny Oh yeah, me too. Zip it, lock it. Put it in your pocket. So you and Leonard...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Oh dear God!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny Little misunderstanding, huh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper A little misunder... Galileo and the Pope had a little misunderstanding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny Anyway, I was talking to Leonard this morning and I think he feels really bad about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Huh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny Well how do you feel?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper I don't understand the question.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny Well I'm just asking if it's difficult to be fighting with your best friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Oh. I hadn't thought about it like that. I wonder if I've been experiencing physiological manifestations of some sort of unconscious emotional turmoil.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny Wait... what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper I couldn't poop this morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny You should just talk to him, I'm sure you guys can work this out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper It's certainly preferable to my plan.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny Which was?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper A powerful laxative.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny Okay, so you absolutely should talk to him, look, I know Leonard values you as a friend, and he told me himself that without your little idea there's no way he could have come up with this whole experiment thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Excuse me, little idea?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny Yeah, I mean he tried to explain it to me, I didn't really understand it but...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Of course you didn't, he said little idea?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny Uh, well no, no, not in... not in those words.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper In what words then, exactly
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny Um, gee, the exact words aren't written... it's more the spirit in which it's
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper What did he say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny You had a lucky hunch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Hey, Sheldon, I've been thinking, instead of arguing about this why don't...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Don't you ever speak to me again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter What... .
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny Uh, he... .
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Okay, I'm leaving for the conference.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Have fun presenting my lucky hunch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon I didn't mean it like that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Then why did you say it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter I don't know, I wasn't choosing my...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Were you trying to impress Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter No, no not at all. A little bit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper How'd that work out for you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny Leonard, ready to go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Libido 1, truth zero.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Okay, I'm going to ask you one more time, we did the work together, lets present the paper together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper And I'm telling you for the last time it's pandering, it's undignified and bite me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Let's go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny Bye Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Goodbye Penny. Oooh, one of these days, Pkshhhh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny There you go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter You're right, this side does look better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny No, no, I didn't say better, I said less stained.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 howard_wolowitz I just checked the house, there's probably twenty, twenty-five people in there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter You're kidding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny Is that all?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter All? In particle physics, twenty five is Woodstock.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny Oh, well, then good!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter I wasn't expecting such a crowd, I'm a little nervous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 howard_wolowitz It's okay, just open with a joke, you'll be fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter A joke. Okay. How about this, um, okay, uh there's this farmer, and he has these chickens, but they won't lay any eggs. So, he calls a physicist to help. The physicist then does some calculations, and he says, um, I have a solution, but it only works with spherical chickens in a vacuum. Right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny Oh, sorry, I've just, I've heard it before.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Let's roll. Hey, nice suit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter It's a classic, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny I really should have brought my own car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter So, in conclusion, the data show that at temperatures approaching absolute zero, the moment of inertia changes, and the solid becomes a super-solid, which clearly appears to be a previously unknown state of matter. Thank you. Are there any questions?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 Yeah. What the hell was that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Any other questions?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Doctor Sheldon Cooper here, I am the lead author of this particular paper. Thank you. And you, sir, you have completely skipped over the part where I was walking through the park, and I saw these children on a merry-go-round, which started me thinking about the moment of inertia in gasses like helium at temperatures approaching absolute zero.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter I didn't skip it, it's just an anecdote. It's not science.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Oh, I see, was the apple falling on Newton's head, was that just an anecdote?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter You are not Isaac Newton.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper No, no that's true, gravity would have been apparent to me without the apple.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter You cannot possibly be that arrogant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper You continue to underestimate me, my good man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Look, if you weren't happy with my presentation then maybe you should have given it with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper As I have explained repeatedly, unlike you, I don't need validation from lesser minds. No offence.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Really, so why did you come?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Because I knew you'd screw this up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter I didn't screw it up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Oh, please. I admit, that spherical chicken joke, that was hilarious. But it was straight downhill from there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter I've had enough of your condescension. Maybe I didn't go to college when I was eleven like you, maybe I got my doctorate at 24 instead of 16, but you are not the only person who is smarter than everyone else in this room. No offense. And I am clearly not the only person who is tormented by insecurity and has an ego in need of constant validation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper So you admit that you're an egotist?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Yes. My name is Dr Leonard Hofstadter, and I could never please my parents so I need to get all my self-esteem from strangers like you. But he's worse.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Okay, that is it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter You cannot blow up my head with your mind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Then I'll settle for an aneurysm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Stop it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper You hit me. You saw him, he hit me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter You were trying to blow up my head.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper So it was working.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter It wasn't, it was not, you are a nutcase.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Oh we'll see about that , heads up you people in the front row, this is a splash zone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Stop, stop it, quit it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny Is this usually how these physics things go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 howard_wolowitz More often than you'd think.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Vulcan nerve pinch!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper You could have offered me a ride home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter You're lucky I didn't run you over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper I really don't understand what you're so unhappy about, you begged me to come, I came, there's just no pleasing you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter You're right, I'm the problem, I'm the one that needs help.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Well that's not much of an apology, but I'll take it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Excuse me. Is there anything you'd like to apologize for?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Yes. I'm sorry I tried to blow up your head. It was uncalled for.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 howard_wolowitz You won't believe this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 raj_koothrappali Somebody got the whole thing on a cell phone and put it on YouTube.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Now, who would do that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 howard_wolowitz That would be me. Hey, check it out, it's a featured video. .
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Oh jeez. Is this suit really look that bad?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Forget your suit, look at my arms waving, I'm like a flamingo on Ritalin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 penny Howard, would you like to explain to me why your Facebook page has a picture of me sleeping on your shoulder captioned 'Me and my Girlfriend?'
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Uh-oh, here comes 'the talk.'
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 student_one#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 What losers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 student_two#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 Yeah. Gigantic American geeks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 student_two#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 Someone from Pasadena, California named... 'Wolowizard.'
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 together#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode09 Awesome!
