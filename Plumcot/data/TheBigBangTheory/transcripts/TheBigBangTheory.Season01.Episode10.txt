TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter See, the liquid metal Terminators were created in the future by Skynet, and Skynet was developed by Miles Dyson, but that future no longer exists, due to Dyson's death in Terminator 2.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Okay, then riddle me this. Assuming all the good Terminators were originally evil Terminators created by Skynet but then reprogrammed by the future John Connor, why would Skynet, an artificial computer intelligence, bother to create a petite hot 17 year-old killer robot?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Skynet is kinky? I don't know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Artificial intelligences do not have teen fetishes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Alright, oh wait, they use it to in...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper , too late, I win.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 penny Let's go-oh-oh Ou-oooo-ut tonight. I have to go-oh-oh-oh ou-ooooo-ut tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter What the hell is that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper I don't know, but if cats could sing, they'd hate it too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 penny You wanna prowl, be my night owl, we'll take my... Hey guys, hi! Where you going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter What? Oh we just had to... mail some letters and throw away some chicken.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 penny You'll never guess what just happened.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Oh, I give up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper I don't guess. As a scientist I reach conclusions based on observation and experimentation, although as I'm saying this it occurs to me you may have been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 penny What was that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Believe it or not, personal growth. What happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 penny Alright, remember when I auditioned for that workshop production of Rent, but I didn't get it and I couldn't figure out why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper I have a conclusion based on an observation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter No you don't. No he doesn't.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 penny Well, the girl they picked to play Mimi, she dropped out and they asked me to replace her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Oh, congratulations, what a lucky break.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 penny It's not a big deal, just a one night showcase, but they invite a lot of casting people and agents so, you never know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper I think I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter No you don't. He doesn't.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 penny It's this Friday at eight, you guys want to come?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 together#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Because... uh, Friday, we are attending a symposium on molecular positronium.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper I think that's a week from Tuesday at six.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter No, it's this Friday, at eight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 penny Oh, too bad, well, I got to get to rehearsal, see you guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter See you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper You just lied to Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Yes, I did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper And you did it so casually, no rapid breathing, no increase in perspiration.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter So?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper So, lack of a physiological response while lying is characteristic of a violent sociopath.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, are you worried about your safety.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper No, I imagine if you were going to kill me you'd have done it a long time ago.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter That's very true.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Leonard, Leonard, Leonard...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper I need to speak to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter It's two o'clock in the morning
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper It's important.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter I highly doubt that. Go away. . Are you still out there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper You're right, it can wait until morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter What, what, what, what, what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Never mind. I clearly woke you up in the middle of a REM cycle, you're in no state to talk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, what is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper I'm uncomfortable having been included in your lie to Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter What was I supposed to say.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper You could have told her the truth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter That would have hurt her feelings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Is that a relevant factor?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Then I suppose you could have agreed to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter And what would I have said afterwards?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper I would suggest something to the effect of, singing is neither an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you, and if you disagree, I'd recommend you have a CAT scan, to look for a tumour pressing on the cognitive processing center of your brain.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter I couldn't say that, I would have to say, you were terrific and I can't wait to hear you sing again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter It's the social protocol, it's what you do when you have a friend who's proud of something they really suck at.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper I was not aware of that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Well now you are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Oh, alright. Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper When we played chess earlier, you were terrific and I can't wait to play you again. Goodnight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, ...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Oooaw. This would be so much easier if I were a violent sociopath. What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper I was analyzing our lie, and I believe we're in danger of Penny seeing through the ruse.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter How?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Simple. If she were to log on to www.socalphysicsgroup.org/activities/other, click on upcoming events, scroll down to seminars, download the pdf schedule, and look for the seminar on molecular positronium, well then, bippidy-boppidy-boo, our pants are metaphorically on fire.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Well, sir, my trousers will not be igniting today.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Penny, Penny, Penny, Good morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 penny Do you have any idea what time it is?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Of course I do. My watch is linked to the atomic clock in Boulder, Colorado. It's accurate to one tenth of a second. But as I'm saying this it occurs to me that once again your question may have been rhetorical.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 penny What do you want?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Remember how Leonard told you we couldn't come to your performance because we were attending a symposium on molecular positronium?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 penny I remember symposium.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Yes, well, he lied.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 penny Wait, what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper He lied, and I'm feeling very uncomfortable about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 penny Well imagine how I'm feeling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Hungry? Tired? I'm sorry this really isn't my strong suit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter You told her I lied, why would you tell her I lied?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper To help you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter I'm sorry, I'm not seeing the help.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper She was going to see through your lie eventually, so I told her that you were lying to protect me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Oh, I'm getting a bad feeling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Hunger? Indigestion, I'm sorry I'm really not very good at this. Anyway, Penny now believes that on Friday night, we're going to participate in my cousin Leopold's drug intervention.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Your cousin Leopold?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Yea, who most people call Leo, but he also answers to Lee, remember that, it's important.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter What's important?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Details, Leonard, the success or failure of our deceitful enterprise turns on details.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Do you have a cousin Leopold.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper No, I made him up. I think you'd call him Lee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter I don't get it, I already told her a lie, why replace it with a different lie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Well, first of all, your lie was laughably transparent, where mine is exquisitely convoluted. While you were sleeping I was weaving an un-unravelable web.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Un-unravelable?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Yes, if she googles Leopold Houston she'll find a facebook page, an online blog depicting his descent into drug use, and a desperate yet hopeful listing on e-harmony.com.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Okay, why would I go to a drug intervention for your cousing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Ah, because it's in Long Beach, and I don't drive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter We're going to Long Beach?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper No, of course not, there's no cousin Leo, there's no intervention, focus Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Oh, come on!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper We just leave the house on Friday night, and we return in the wee hours emotionally wrung out from the work of convincing Leo to go back into rehab.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter So he goes back into rehab?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Yes, but, he can relapse if Penny ever invites us to go hear her sing again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter You still told her I lied.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper For a noble purpose, to spare me the social embarrassment of having a drug-addled first cousin, which I'm assuming is embarrassing, yes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter I don't know. How am I supposed to remember all of this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper That's the best part, you don't have to, see I told Penny that you would be embarrassed, if you knew that she found out that you had lied, so she's agreed to operate as if the original lie was still in force.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter So she's expecting me to lie about going to a symposium in Pasadena, when in actuality we're pretending to go to a drug intervention in Long Beach?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Un-unravelable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Oh hey Penny, wow, look at you, all ready for your showcase, you look great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 penny Thanks. I just wanted to come by and wish you guys luck with your symposium.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Oh, well, thankyou.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 penny You know, I got to tell you, a lot of friends would let their friend go alone, but that's not who you are, you are the kind of guy who stands by a friend when... when he has a symposium to go to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter I don't know what to say.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 penny It's okay, Leonard
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Oh, okay, alright, good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Oh boy, group hug.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 penny Uh-huh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Uh-huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 penny Uh-huh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Okay. So what's up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Well, uh, Penny is on her way to perform in a one night showcase production of Rent, which we are unable to attend because we are going to a symposium on molecular positronium, given by Dr Emile Farminfarmian.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Wait a minute, Farminfarmian is speaking and you're Bogarding the symposium.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Howard, I'm sorry... we're... we're
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 howard_wolowitz No, no, you're quark-blocking us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter I don't know what to say.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Wow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Howard, listen...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 howard_wolowitz No, it's okay, it's your Millenium Falcon, you and Chewbacca do whatever you want to do. Me and Princess Leia here will find some other way to spend the evening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 penny Howard, wait. Sheldon, I think we should tell them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Okay, sure. I don't see a problem with that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 penny There's no symposium, Leonard lied to me, isn't that right Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Well... I don't know what to say.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 penny It's okay, I do, look, Leonard is helping Sheldon through a family crisis, he made up the whole story about the symposium with Dr Farmin..farm...ian
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Good for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 penny Hah, yeah! Because he didn't want Sheldon to be embarrassed, and there is nothing to be embarrassed okay, every family in America has a relative holed up in a garage somewhere huffing paint thinner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 howard_wolowitz No, I'm lost too, I think she skipped a step.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 penny No, look, Sheldon's cousin Leo escaped rehab, and he's in a Motel 8 at Long Beach, the whole family's going out for an intervention. Leonard is driving Sheldon down there to help him through this because he's such a good man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Oh, another hug, thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 penny Alright you guys, good luck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Thanks Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Yeah, uh, break a leg.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Break a leg.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 howard_wolowitz So, road trip to Long Beach.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter No, we're not going to Long Beach.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 raj_koothrappali Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Because Sheldon doesn't have a drug addicted cousin Leopold.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 raj_koothrappali Oh, too bad. I've always wanted to go to Long Beach.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper It's a very nice community. The Queen Mary is docked there, once the largest ocean liner in the world, it's now a hotel and restaurant where they host a surprisingly gripping murder mystery dinner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 raj_koothrappali Sounds fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 howard_wolowitz I'm game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 raj_koothrappali Shotgun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper No, no, no, Leonard gets nauseous unless he sits in front, and even then it's iffy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Wait, are we really going to Long Beach?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Leonard, Leonard, Leonard...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Let it go, Sheldon, the murderer was the first mate whether it makes sense to you or not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper No, that's the least of our worries. I've been doing some research on addiction, both the biochemical and behavioral aspects, and I think there's a problem with the current version of our lie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter What are you talking about, it's fine, she bought it, it's over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Sadly, it's not. Substance abuse is a lifelong struggle, but beyond that I have realized that the Leo I described would not have agreed to go to rehab.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Because Leo is a middle child.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter There is no Leo, how can you say that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper You didn't read the bio, did you? He's not just a middle child, he's the quintessential middle child, from a broken home to boot. Psychologically speaking, the attention he gets by rebelling even to the point of self-destruction is more emotionally valuable than the help he would get at rehab.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter I've got a solution.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Great, what is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Get out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Fine. I've hesitated to point this out, but I must now remind you that we are in our current predicament because of your initial and totally inadequate deceit. I'm just trying to clean up after your mess. We'll talk in the morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 strange_man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 Morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Who are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 I am Sheldon's cousin Leo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Oh, God! Sheldon does not have a cousin Leo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 Au contraire. I'm 26 years old, I'm originally from Denton, Texas, but I was a Navy brat so I was brought up on a variety of military bases around the world, as a result I've often felt like an outsider, never really fitting in, which is probably the reason for my substance abuse problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Excuse me, we just went over this. As the quintessential middle child, your addiction is rooted in your unmet need for attention.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 Oh, Sheldon, are we really going to go with pop psychology.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper For your information, this is all based on solid research, stick with the character profile I wrote for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper I'm sorry, Leonard, this is Toby Loobenfeld, he's a research assistant in the particle physics lab, but he also minored in theatre at MIT.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 toby_loobenfeld It was more of a double major actually. Theatre and physics. You can guess which one my bourgeois parents pushed me towards.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I got it, Sheldon, why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Well, you see, while Leo would not have gone into rehab, it is completely plausible that we would have talked him into leaving the motel, and coming home with us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Oh...!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 toby_loobenfeld Sheldon, how about this as my motivation. When I was fourteen years old I was abused in the Philippines by a club footed Navy chaplain.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper No. We're going with middle child, and a generic predisposition to inadequate serotonin production.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 toby_loobenfeld Swell, how do I play genetic predisposition?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Subtextually, of course. Just have fun with it. Morning Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 penny Hi. How did the intervention go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Unfortunately, we weren't able to convince him to go to rehab.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 penny Well, based on what you told me, I'm not surprised.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper But we did convince him to leave the motel. Come say hello. Leo, this is Penny, our friend and neighbor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 penny Hi Leo, how are you feeling?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 toby_loobenfeld Let me ask you something, Penny. Have you ever woken up in a fleabag motel, covered in your own vomit, next to a transsexual prostitute?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 toby_loobenfeld Then don't ask me how I'm feeling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Well, that's Leo. Hey, um, why don't you tell me about your showcase last night?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 penny Oh, it was okay I guess, wasn't a big turn out but they both really seemed to like it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter There were only two people there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 penny By the end. Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 toby_loobenfeld Damn you, Chaplain Horrigan!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 penny I'm... I'm sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 toby_loobenfeld The Philippines. 1992. The Subic Bay Naval Station. A young boy on the cusp of manhood. His only companions mongrel dogs and malarial mosquitos. Desperate and alone he reached out to a man who promised to introduce him to a merciful, loving God, but who instead introduced him to a gin pickled tongue shoved down his adolescent throat. What choice did he have but to drink, shoot and snort his pain away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Don't forget his genetic predisposition towards addiction.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 toby_loobenfeld That's never been proven.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper There have been studies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 toby_loobenfeld Not double blind studies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper How could there be a double blind study, who would be the control group.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter As you can see, detoxing can get pretty ugly, let's give them some privacy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 penny Yeah. Hey, do you want to come over to my place, have coffee?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Sounds good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 penny I have a video of me singing last night, do you want to see it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Gee, why wouldn't I?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 penny This is even better than you coming to the showcase, because now I get to watch you watch me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Yeah! Funny how things work out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 toby_loobenfeld And that he loved the companionship and the wisdom that his own father failed to provide.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Your parents made the right decision.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 toby_loobenfeld I cannot work like this!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 toby_loobenfeld This is amazing. Just sitting on a couch, watching TV with a woman. Not being drunk, or high, or... or... wondering if you're a dude down there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 penny Leo, you are a very sweet, really funny guy. You're gonna do okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 toby_loobenfeld One day at a time, Penny, one day at a time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter How long is he going to stay here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode10 sheldon_cooper He's a homeless drug addict, Leonard, where is he going to go? Boy, you have a lot to learn about lying.
