TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Checkmate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter O-o-o-o-h! Again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Obviously you're not well suited for three-dimensional chess, perhaps three dimensional candyland would be more your speed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Just reset the board.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper It must be humbling to suck on so many different levels.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 penny Hi guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Hey!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 penny Did you get my mail.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, right here. How was Nebraska?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 penny Oh, better than North Dakota! I guess that joke's only funny in Nebraska.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper From the data at hand you really can't draw that conclusion. All you can say with absolute certainty is that that joke is not funny here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 penny Boy, it's good to be back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter How was your family?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 penny Ugh, it was the worst trip, everyone got sick over the weekend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Sick?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Here we go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper What kind of sick?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 penny Oh, the flu I guess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper I don't need you to guess, I need you to know, now when did the symptoms first appear?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 penny Maybe Friday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Friday, was that morning or afternoon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 penny I... I don't...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Think woman, who blew their nose and when?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, relax, she doesn't have any symptoms, I'm sure she's not contagious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Oh please, if influenza was only contagious after symptoms appear it would have died out thousands of years ago. Somewhere between tool using and cave painting, homo habilus would have figured out to kill the guy with the runny nose.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Penny, you'll have to excuse Sheldon, he's a bit of a germophobe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 penny Oh, it's okay, I understand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Thanks for your consideration, now please leave.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter You'd better go before he starts spraying you with Lysol.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 penny Okay, well, thank you for getting my mail.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter No problem. Welcome home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter What the hell are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper I'm making petrie dishes to grow throat cultures.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter With lime jello?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper I need a growth medium, and someone polished off the apricot yoghurt. Here, swab my throat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter I don't think so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Leonard! If I'm going to get ahead of this thing I need to find out what's growing in my throat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, you are not sick. This is, but you are not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper We have no idea what pathogen Typhoid Penny has introduced into our environment. And having never been to Nebraska I'm fairly certain that I have no cornhusking antibodies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, don't you think you're overreacting?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper When I'm lying comatose in a hospital relying on inferior minds to cure me, these jello cultures and my accompanying notes will give them a fighting chance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter I'm going back to bed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Wait. Put this in the bathroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter What for?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper I need to measure my fluid intake and output to make sure my kidneys aren't shutting down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter I mix pancake batter in this!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper No, that measuring cup has always been for urine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter You had time to make a label for everything in this apartment, including the label maker, but you didn't have ten seconds to make one that said urine cup?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper It's right here on the bottom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Huh. I guess I owe the Betty Crocker company a letter of apology.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Oh, dear God. Leonard! Leonard, I'm sick!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Leonard! Leonard I'm sick!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Leonard! Leonard! Leonard. Leonard, my comforter fell down, and my sinuses hurt when I bend over. Leonard? Ow!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Leonard, where are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter I'm at work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper At six-thirty in the morning?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper On Sunday?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter They asked me to come in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Well, I didn't hear the phone ring.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter They texted me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Well, as I predicted, I am sick. My fever has been tracking up exponentially since 2am, and I am producing sputum at an alarming rate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter No kidding?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper No. Not only that, it has shifted from clear to milky green.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Alright, well, get some rest and drink plenty of fluids.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper What else would I drink? Gasses? Solids? Ionised plasma?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Drink whatever you want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper I want soup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Then make soup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper We don't have soup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter I'm at work, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Is that a dog?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Yes,
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper In the lab?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Yes, they're training dogs to operate the centrifuge for when they need dogs to operate the centrifuge for blind scientists, I have to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 debbie_wolowitz Howard, it's the phone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 howard_wolowitz I know it's the phone, Ma, I hear the phone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 debbie_wolowitz Well who's calling at this ungodly hour?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 howard_wolowitz I don't know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 debbie_wolowitz Well ask them why they're calling at this ungodly hour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 howard_wolowitz How can I ask them when I'm talking to you! Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Howard, it's Leonard, code Milky Green.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Dear Lord, not Milky Green!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Affirmative, with fever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 debbie_wolowitz Who's on the phone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 howard_wolowitz It's Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 debbie_wolowitz Why is he calling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Sheldon's sick.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 debbie_wolowitz Were you playing with him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 howard_wolowitz For God's sake, Ma, I'm twenty six years old.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 debbie_wolowitz Excuse me Mr Grown-up. Whadda-ya want for breakfast.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Chocolate milk and eggoes please!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Howard, listen to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Hang on, call waiting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter No, don't, don't...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Howard, I'm sick.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Howard's sleeping, this is his mother. Why are you calling at this ungodly hour?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper I need soup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Then call your own mother. It was Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter I tried to stop you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 howard_wolowitz It's my own fault, I forgot the protocol we put in place after the great ear infection of '06.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter You call Koothrappali, we need to find a place to lay low for the next eighteen to twenty four hours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Stand by. Ma, can my friends come over?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 debbie_wolowitz I just had the carpets steamed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 howard_wolowitz That's a negatory. But there's a Planet of the Apes marathon at the New Art today.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Five movies, two hours apiece. It's a start.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 waitress#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 Homeless crazy guy at table eighteen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 penny No, just crazy. Sheldon, what are you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper I'm sick, thank you very much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 penny How could you have gotten it from me, I'm not sick.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper You're a carrier. All these people here are doomed. You're doomed!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 penny Shhh! Sheldon, what do you want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper I want soup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 penny Why didn't you just... Why didn't you just have soup at home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Penny, I have an IQ of 187, don't you imagine that if there were a way for me to have had soup at home I would have thought of it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 penny You can have soup delivered.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper I did not think of that. Clearly febrile delirium is setting in, please bring me some soup while I still understand what a spoon is for.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 penny Okay, what kind of soup do you want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Well, my mother used to make me this split pea with little frankfurter slices and these home made croutons.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 penny We have Chicken Tortilla and Potato Leek.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Can I get any of those with little frankfurter slices and home made croutons?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Then surprise me. Would you call that moss green or forest green?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Look at this, everyone went chimp.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 raj_koothrappali Well I'd like to point out, I voted for orang-utan, but you shouted me down. .
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Oh, hi Penny!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 penny Hey, where are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter I'm... uh... at work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 penny You sound funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter I'm... uh... in a... I'm in a radiation suit. What's up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 penny Yeah, well I'm at work too, and you'll never guess who's here infecting my entire station.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon's at the Cheesecake Factory. Just tell him to go home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 penny He won't leave, he says he's afraid he'll pass out on the bus and someone will harvest his organs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter He's paranoid, and he's established a nest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 penny Can you please come get him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Uh, yeah, I'd be... I'd be happy to Penny. Oh my God there's a breech in the radiation unit The whole city is in jeopardy, oh my God, Professor Googenfeil is melting, gotta go, bye! I feel really guilty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 raj_koothrappali You did what you had to do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Take your stinking paws off my popcorn you damn dirty ape.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Thanks for bringing me home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 penny Oh, it's okay, I didn't really need to work today, it's not like I have rent or car payments or anything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Good. Good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 penny Okay, well, you feel better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Wait, where are you going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 penny Um, home, to write some bad checks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper You're going to leave me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 penny Sheldon, you are a grown man, haven't you ever been sick before?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Well, of course, but, not by myself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 penny Really, never?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Well, once. When I was fifteen, and spending the summer at the Heidelberg Institute in Germany.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 penny Studying abroad?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper No, visiting professor. Anyway, the local cuisine was a little more sausage-based than I'm used to, and the result was an internal blitzkrieg with my lower intestine playing the part of Czechoslovakia.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 penny And there was no-one there to take care of you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper No. No, my mom had to fly back to Texas to help my dad because the house had slipped off the cinderblocks again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 penny Again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper It was tornado season. And it was an aluminum house. Anyway, the housekeeper in the faculty residence didn't speak any English, when I finally managed to convince her I was sick, she said 'Möchtest Du eine Darmspülung?'
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 penny What does that mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Based on what happened next, I assume it means 'would you like an enema?'
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 penny Okay, sweetie, I'll take care of you, what do you need?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Well, my mom used to give me sponge baths.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 penny Okay, ground rules, no sponge baths, and definitely no enemas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Agreed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 raj_koothrappali Here we go, ten and a half hours of apey goodness.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Oh dammit, my glasses. Okay, I'm blind here guys, can you help me find them?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Sorry. Found 'em.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Oh great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Sorry, don't you have a spare.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, at home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 raj_koothrappali Well if you leave now, you can be back before the gorillas rip the crap out of Charlton Heston.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Unless Sheldon's there, in which case you'll be trapped forever in his whiny hyper neurotic snot-web.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Hi, Penny. I was wondering, is Sheldon still at the restaurant? Okay, that was very nice of you. Okay, gotta go, got kind of a full blown Chernobyl thing here, gotta go, bye. He's home, I'm screwed. Ten and a half hours of apey blurriness.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 raj_koothrappali How about Lasic?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter You want me to get eye surgery?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 raj_koothrappali Would you rather go back to the apartment and deal with Sheldon, or have a stranger carve out your corneas with a laser beam?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Well?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter I'm thinking!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 penny Okay, nice and cosy, okay, I'll see you later.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Wait. Will you please rub this on my chest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 penny Oh, Sheldon, can't you do that yourself?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Vaporub makes my hands smell funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 penny But Sheldon...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Please, please, please, please, please, please, please.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 penny I can't believe I'm doing this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper No, no, counter-clockwise or my chest hair mats.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 penny Sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Can you sing 'Soft Kitty'.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper My mom used to sing it to me when I was sick.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 penny I'm sorry, honey, I don't know it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper I'll teach you. 'Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur, happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr purr purr.' Now you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 penny Soft kitty, warm kitty...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Little ball of fur. Keep rubbing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 penny Little ball of fur.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter What do you see, what do you see.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 raj_koothrappali The living room appears to be empty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Okay, he must be in his bedroom. My spare glasses are in my bedroom, on my dresser, next to my Bat-signal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 howard_wolowitz I'm not going in there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Raj?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 raj_koothrappali No way, Jose.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Well I can't do it, I can't see anything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 howard_wolowitz It's all right, wireless mini-cam and Bluetooth headset. We'll be your eyes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 howard_wolowitz One more thing. This is a subsonic impact sensor. If Sheldon gets out of bed and starts to walk, this device will register it and send a signal to the laptop. At that point, based on the geography of the apartment and the ambulatory speed of a sick Sheldon, you'll have seven seconds to get out, glasses or no glasses.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Won't my footsteps set it off?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 howard_wolowitz No, you'll be on your hands and knees. Now you'll need to get the sensor as close as you can to Sheldon's room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Well, how do I carry it if I'm on my hands and knees?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Stay low. Bear left. Now keep true.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 howard_wolowitz It means go straight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Then just say go straight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 howard_wolowitz You don't stay go straight when you're giving bearings, you say keep true.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Alright I just hit my head.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Because you didn't keep true. Okay, turn right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 raj_koothrappali The... the picture's breaking up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Angle your head to the right. A little more. A little more. That's it, now just keep true. Alright, you're close enough to Sheldon's room, deploy the sensor. Now turn it on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter It wasn't on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 howard_wolowitz No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Then why did I have to crawl?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Oh, I guess you didn't.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Okay, it's on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Good. From this point forward you will have to crawl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Hang on, the sensor's picking up something, turn your head back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 penny You rat bastard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Told you the sensor would work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Hi!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 penny You deliberately stuck me with Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Well, I had to, you see what he's like.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Penny! Penny, I'm hungry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 penny Uh, it's okay, sweetie, good news, Leonard's home!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter No!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 penny Here you go, good luck, bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter W-wait!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Leonard, I'm hungry!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Wait! Penny! Take me with you!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper I want grilled cheese.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Do you think Penny will come here and take care of us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter I don't think Penny's ever coming here again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper I'm very congested.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, so?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Can you go to the kitchen, and get me the turkey baster labelled mucus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter If I stand, I'll vomit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Under the sink, yellow Tupperware bowl.
