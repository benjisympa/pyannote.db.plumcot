TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon Here's the problem with teleportation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard Lay it on me. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon Assuming the device could be invented which would identify the quantum state of matter of an individual in one location, and transmit that pattern to a distant location for reassembly, you would not have actually transported the individual. You would have destroyed him in one location, and recreated him in another.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard How about that. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon Personally, I would never use a transporter. Because the original Sheldon would have to be disintegrated in order to create a new Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard Would the new Sheldon be in any way an improvement on the old Sheldon? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon No, he would be exactly the same. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard That is a problem. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon So, you see it too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 dr_gablehouser Dr Hofstadter, Dr Cooper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 together Gablehouser.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 gablehouser Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet Dennis Kim. Dennis is a highly sought after Doctorial candidate and we're hoping to have him do his graduate work here. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard Graduate work, very impressive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 gablehouser And he's only fifteen years old.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon Not bad, I myself started graduate school at fourteen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 dennis Well, I lost a year while my family was tunnelling out of North Korea. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard Advantage Kim. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 gablehouser I thought maybe you boys could show Dennis around, let him see why we're the best physics research facility in the country.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 dennis I already know you're not. You don't have an open science grid computer, or a free electron laser, and the string theory research being done here is nothing but a dead end. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon Excuse me, that is my research, and it is by no means a dead end.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 dennis Well, obviously you don't see it yet, but trust me, you will.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 gablehouser Dennis, we discussed this, we're in the process of updating our equipment, and we welcome your input on our research goals, and we've agreed to look the other way if you want to use up to 20% of the grant money you attract to smuggle your grandfather out of Pyongyang. We want him here boys, make it happen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard Yes sir. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon You can count on us, we're on it. What the hell do you mean, dead end. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 dennis I mean, the whole landscape of false vacuums in string theory could be as large as ten to the five-hundredth power. In addition ... ooh, look, chocolate milk. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon I sense a disturbance in the force. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard A bad feeling I have about this, mmm-hmmm. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard So, Dennis, how long have you been in America.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 dennis A year and a half.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard No kidding, you speak English really well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 dennis So do you. Except for your tendency to end sentences with prepositions. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard What are you talking about? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 dennis That. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon He's not wrong. Alright, and this is my office.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 dennis Is this part of the tour? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon Nope. Goodbye. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard Come on, Sheldon, we've hardly shown him anything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon Oh, alright, this is my desk, these are my books, this is my door, please close it behind you. Goodbye. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 dennis Looks like you're doing work in quantum loop corrections.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon Keen observation, goodbye. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 dennis You see where you went wrong, don't you? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard Huh, yeah? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon Get him out. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard Come on, Dennis, I'll show you the rec center, they've got nautilus equipment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 dennis Do I look like I lift weights. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard Not heavy ones. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 dennis It's startling to me you haven't considered a Lorentz invariant field theory approach.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon You think I haven't considered it? You really think I haven't considered it? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 dennis Have you considered it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon Get him out Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard Come on, Dennis, I'll show you the radiation lab.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 dennis Wow, you won the Stephenson award.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon Yes, in fact I am the youngest person ever to win it. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 dennis Really, how old?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon Fourteen and a half.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 dennis You were the youngest person ever to win it. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard It's like looking into an obnoxious little mirror, isn't it? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 penny Mmm, this is really delicious, isn't it? Still can't talk to me unless you're drunk, huh? Oh, sweetie, you are so damaged. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 howard Hey, I'm damaged too. How about a hug for Howie? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 penny Sure. Raj, hug Howard. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon Uh-uh-uh. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard Something you'd like to share? A tale of woe perhaps.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon Fifteen years old. Dennis Kim is fifteen years old, and he's already correcting my work. Today I went from being Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart to ... you know, that other guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 howard Antonio Salieri?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon Oh, God, now even you're smarter than me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 howard You know, Sheldon, you don't have so many friends that you can afford to start insulting them. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard Just eat, Sheldon, you'll feel better. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon Why waste food. In Texas when a cow goes dry they don't keep feeding it, they just take her out and shoot her between the eyes. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 penny I'm confused, did Sheldon stop giving milk? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard You can't let this kid get to you. You always knew that someday someone would come along who was younger and smarter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon Yes, but I assumed I would have been dead hundreds of years, and that there would be an asterisk by his name because he would be a cyborg. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 penny So, you've got a bit of competition, I really don't see what the big deal is. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon Well of course you don't, you've never excelled at anything. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 penny I don't understand, exactly how did he get any friends in the first place? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 howard We liked Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard Well, what are you going to do, Sheldon, give up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon Yes. That's what a rational person does when his entire life's work is invalidated by a post-pubescent Asian wunderkind. He ceases his fruitless efforts, he donates his body to scientific research, and he waits to die. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 penny You know, I'm confused again, is he waiting, or do we get to shoot him between the eyes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon I've decided you're right. My career is not over. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard Great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon But, since the arrival of Dennis Kim has rendered my research pointless, I just have to find something else to focus on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard Great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon So I've decided, I'm going to collaborate with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard Great. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon What exactly is it you do? I know you chatter on about it all the time, but I've never really paid attention.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard Okay, well, right now I'm designing an experiment to study the soft component of cosmic radiation at sea-level, but I really don't need any help. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon Oh, sure you do. Now, see, what's this here in the schematic, is that a laser array?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon No. Hmmm. What happens if you use argon lasers instead of helium neon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard It would blow up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon Are you sure? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard Pretty sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon Pretty sure's not very scientific, is this how you normally work, just hunches and guesses and stuff?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard Okay, Sheldon, I understand that you're going through a bit of a career crisis, you're searching for some other area where you can feel valuable and productive but I need to tell you something and I want you to listen carefully. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon Alright.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard Go away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon If you're concerned about sharing credit with me, you're name can go first ... I'm going. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 howard It's a small brown paper bag, Ma, I'm looking at it right now. Why would I make that up, there's no ding-dong in it. How are two ding-dongs tomorrow going to help me today? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon So, this is engineering, huh? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 howard I'll talk to you later. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon Engineering. Where the noble semi-skilled laborers execute the vision of those who think and dream. Hello, oompah-loompahs of science.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 howard Sheldon, what are you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon I just came by to say hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 howard I've been at this lab for three years, you've never came by to say hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon Well, up until now I've had better things to do. So, what are we making today? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 howard A small payload support structure for a European science experimental package that's going up on the next space shuttle. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon Really, how does it work?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 howard When this is done, it will be attached to the payload bay, and the sensor apparatus will rest on it. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon Uh, huh. So it's a shelf? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 howard No, you don't understand, during acceleration it needs to stay perfectly level and provide ... yeah, okay, it's a shelf. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon Now, I notice you're using titanium, did you give any consideration to carbon nanotubes, they're lighter, cheaper and half twice the tensile strength.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 howard Sheldon, there's a diploma in my office that says I have a masters in engineering.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon And you also have a note from your mother that says I love you, bubbula. But neither of those is a cogent argument for titanium over nanotubes. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 howard Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 howard Go away. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon Did Leonard tell you to say that? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 howard No, I thought of it all by myself. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon Huh. It can't be a coincidence. There must be some causal link I'm missing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 raj Go away. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon Curiouser and curiouser. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 howard Is he here? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard If he were, I wouldn't be. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 raj Do you know what he did. He watched me work for ten minutes, and then started to design a simple piece of software that could replace me. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard Is that even possible?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 raj As it turns out, yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 howard Something's got to be done about him, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard Like what? He'll never be able to cope with the fact that some fifteen year-old kid is smarter and more accomplished than he is. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 raj Well, what if something were to happen to this boy so he was no longer a threat to Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 howard Then our problem would be solved. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard Hang on, are we talking about murdering Dennis Kim? I'm not saying no. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 howard We don't have to go that far, there are other means available.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 raj We can't send him back to North Korea. He knows how to get out. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 howard The only thing we need to do is make this Kim kid lose his focus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard That won't happen, he's not interested in anything but physics.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 howard What about biology? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 howard You know, biology? The one thing that can completely derail a world class mind. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard Howard, he's fifteen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 howard Yeah, so, when I was fifteen I met Denise Polmerry and my grade point average fell from a 5.0 to a 1.8. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 raj She was sleeping with you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 howard No, I just wasted a lot of time thinking about what it would be like if she did. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon Oh, good, you're all here. Look, I've decided that if the three of you drop whatever it is you're working on and join me, we could lick cold fusion in less than a decade, twelve years tops. Go away? Hmm. Could it be me? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 penny Oh, hey guys, what's up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 howard We need a hot fifteen year-old Asian girl with a thing for smart guys. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard Howard, that's racist, any fifteen year-old girl will do the trick. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 raj It's possible she may have misunderstood us. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 gablehouser Dr Cooper? Oh, are we interrupting?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon No, no, please, come in. Yeah, I think you'll appreciate this, very exciting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 gablehouser Oh, what are you working on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon Something remarkable. Since my prospects for the Nobel Prize in physics have disappeared, thank you very much, I've decided to refocus my efforts and use my people skills to win the Nobel Peace Prize. Look, I'm going to solve the Middle-East Crisis by building an exact replica of Jerusalem in the middle of the Mexican desert. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 gablehouser To what end?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon You know, it's like the baseball movie, build it and they will come. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 gablehouser Who will come?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon The Jewish people.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 gablehouser What if they don't come.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon We'll make it nice, put out a spread. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 gablehouser Okay, well, um, speaking of spreads, we're having a small welcoming party this afternoon for Mr Kim, who's agreed to join us here at the University.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon Of course he has, the oracle told us little Neo was the one. You can see the Matrix, can't you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 gablehouser Okay, well, uh, obviously you're very busy with your ... uh, um, come Dennis. You'll have to excuse Dr Cooper, he's been under a lot of ... um ... he's nuts. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon Ah, la-la-la, Hava Nagila. They'll come, they'll settle and I'll win the prize ...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon I really don't understand your objections, Professor Goldfarb, why wouldn't the Senoran Desert make a perfectly good promised land?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 goldfarb Go away. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon We could call it Nuevo Cherusalem. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 goldfarb Please go away. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon Said Pharoah to Moses. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 gablehouser Why are all these young women here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard It's take your daughter to work day. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 gablehouser Really, I was not aware of that. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 raj Oh, yes. There was a very official email that was sent to everyone whose insurance files indicated they had daughters between the ages of 14 and 16. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 gablehouser Hm?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 howard Smooth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 raj Thank you. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 gablehouser There's the man of the hour. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard Okay, so we now have a socially awkward genius in a room full of attractive age-appropriate women. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 howard All he has to do now is hook up with one of them. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard Does anyone else see the flaw in this plan?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 raj We need a social catalyst.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard Like what? We can't get fifteen year-old girls drunk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 howard Or can we?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard No, we can't. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 howard I don't think you mean we can't. I think you mean we shouldn't. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon Hey, Howard. You're a Jew. If there was another wailing wall, exactly like the one in Jerusalem, but close to taco stands and cheap prescription drugs, would you still be able to wail at it? Okay, it's definitely me. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard Okay, we cannot leave this to chance, lets pick a girl, and figure out how to get her together with Dennis. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 raj Okay. How about that one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 howard Uh-uh. I know the type, cheerleader, student council, goes out with jocks, won't even look at anybody in the gifted program. And if, after two years of begging, she does agree to go out with you, it turns out to be a set-up and you're in the back seat of your mom's car with your pants off while the whole football team laughs at you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 raj Are you crying?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 howard No, I have allergies. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 raj Okay, uh, how about her? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard Sure. If he wants to spend a couple of years doing her homework while she drinks herself into a stupor with non-fat White Russians, while you're the one holding her head out of the toilet while she's puking and telling you she wishes more guys were like you, and they she gets into Cornell because you wrote her essay for her, and you drive up to visit her one weekend and she acts like she doesn't even know you. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 raj Okay, so not her either. How about her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 howard Interesting, kind of pretty, a little chubby so probably low self-esteem. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard I think that's our girl. One of us should go talk to her. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 raj I can't talk to her, you do it. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard I can't just go up and talk to her. Howard, you talk to her. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 howard Oh no, she'll never go for the kid once she gets a peek at this. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 raj You know, if we were in India this would be simpler. Five minutes with her dad, twenty goats and a laptop and we'd be done.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard Well, we're not in India. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 raj Alright, why don't we do it your way then? We'll arrange for this girl to move in across the hall from Dennis so he can pathetically moon over her for months on end.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard Okay, that was uncalled for.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 raj You started it, dude. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 gablehouser Could I have everyone's attention please. What a wonderful occasion this is. And how fortunate that it should happen to fall on take your daughter to work day. We're here to welcome Mr Dennis Kim to our little family.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon Welcome Dennis Kim. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 gablehouser Mr Kim was not only the valedictorian at Stamford University, he is also the youngest recipient of the prestigious Stephenson Award.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon Youngest till the cyborgs rise up! 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 gablehouser And now, without any further ado, let me introduce the man of the hour, Mr Dennis Kim. Dennis! Dennis!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 dennis What? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 gablehouser Would you like to tell us a little bit about your upcoming research.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 dennis Um, no thanks. I'm going to the mall with Emma. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 gablehouser Well, uh, well, uh ...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard The kid got a girl. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 raj Unbelievable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 howard Did anyone see how he did it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon Don't worry, I've got this. Ladies and Gentlemen, honored daughters. While Mr Kim, by virtue of his youth and naivety, has fallen prey to the inexplicable need for human contact, let me step in and assure you that my research will go on uninterrupted, and that social relationships will continue to baffle and repulse me. Thank you. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 howard He's back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard Yeah, mission accomplished. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 raj Forget the mission, how did that little yutz get a girl on his own?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 howard I guess times have changed since we were young. Smart is the new sexy. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard Well, why do we go home alone every night, we're still smart. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 raj Maybe we're too smart. So smart it's offputting. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 howard Yeah, let's go with that. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 howard Unbelievable. Components I built are on the International Space Station, and I get a ticket for launching a model rocket in the park. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard I don't know if the ticket was so much for the launch as it was for you telling the policewoman 'you have to frisk me, I have a rocket in my pants.'
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 raj Hey, look at that. It's Dennis Kim.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 howard Wow, I almost didn't recognize him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 raj You know, I kind of feel bad about what we did to him. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 leonard Yeah, we really ruined his life. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode12 sheldon Screw him, he was weak.
