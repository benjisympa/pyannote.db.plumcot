TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 howard Ooh, more details about the new Star Trek film. There's going to be a scene depicting Spock's birth. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 raj I'd be more interested in a scene depicting Spock's conception. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon Oh, please. For Vulcans, mating, or, if you will, Pon Farr, it's an extremely private matter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard Still, I'd like to know the details. His mother was human, his father was Vulcan, they couldn't just conceive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 howard Maybe they had to go to a clinic. Imagine Spock's dad in a little room with a copy of pointy ears and shapely rears.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 raj How come on Star Trek everybody's private parts are the same. No alien lady ever told Captain Kirk, hey, get your thing out of my nose. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 penny Hi, can you help me, I was writing an email and the A key got stuck. Now it's just going 'aaaaaaa'.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard What did you spill on it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 penny Nothing. Diet coke. And yoghurt. A little nail polish. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard I'll take a look at it. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 howard Gentlemen, switching to local nerd news. Fishman, Chen, Chowdry, McNair aren't fielding a team in the university physics bowl this year. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard You're kidding, why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 howard They formed a barbershop quartet, and got a gig playing Knotsbury Farm. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 penny Wow, so in your world, you're like, the cool guys. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 howard Recognize. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard This is our year! With those guys out, the entire physics bowl will kneel before Zod. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 penny Zod?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 howard Kryptonian villain. Long story.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 raj Good story. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon Well count me out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 howard What? Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon You want me to use my intelligence in a tawdry competition? Would you ask Picasso to play Pictionary? Would you ask Noah Webster to play Boggle? Would you ask Jacques Cousteau to play Go Fish? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard Come on, you need a four person team, we're four people. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon By that reasoning we should also play bridge, hold up a chuppah and enter the Olympic bobsled competition.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 penny I want tickets to that please. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard Sheldon, what, do I need to quote Spock's dying words to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon No, don't. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard The needs of the many.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 howard Outweigh the needs of the few. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon Or the one. Dammit, I'll do it. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 raj Okay. First order of physics bowl business. We need a truly kick-ass team name. Suggestions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 howard How about the perpetual motion squad? It's beyond the laws of physics, plus a little heads up for the ladies. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard The ladies?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 howard Perpetual motion squad, we can go all night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 raj I like it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon I don't. Teams are traditionally named after fierce creatures, thus intimidating ones opponent.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 raj Then we can be the Bengal Tigers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon Poor choice. Gram for gram, no animal exceeds the relative fighting strength of the army ant. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 raj Maybe so. But you can't incinerate a Bengal Tiger with a magnifying glass. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard Let's put it to a vote. All those in favour...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon Point of order. I move that any vote on team names should be unanimous. No man should be forced to emblazon his chest with the bengal tiger, when common sense dictates it should be an army ant. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard Will the gentleman from the great state of denial yield for a question? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon I will yield.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard After we go through the exercise of an annoying series of votes, all of which the gentleman will lose, does he then intend to threaten to quit if he does not get his way?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon He does. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard I move we are the Army Ants, all those in favour?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 penny Good afternoon, and welcome to today's physics bowl practice round. I'm Penny, and I'll be your host, because apparently I didn't have anything else to do on a Saturday afternoon, and isn't that just a little sad? Gentlemen, are you ready?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon Of course. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 howard Fire away. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 penny You know, it's none of my business, but isn't a guy who can't speak in front of women going to hold you back a little?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard Oh, uh, he'll be okay once the women are mixed into the crowd. He only has a problem when they're one on one and smell nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 penny Oh, thanks Raj, it's vanilla oil.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard I was actually the one who noticed, okay, let's just start. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 penny Okay, the first question is on the topic of optics. What is the shortest light pulse ever produced? Dr Cooper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon And of course, the answer is 130 adoseconds.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 penny That is correct.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard I knew that too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 penny Good for you, sweetie. Okay, next question. What is the quantum mechanical effect used to encode data on hard disk drives? Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon And of course, the answer is giant magneto resistance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 penny Right. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 howard Hey, I buzzed in. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon But I answered, it's called teamwork. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 howard Don't you think I should answer the engineering questions? I am an engineer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon By that logic I should answer all the anthropology questions because I'm a mammal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard Just ask another one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 penny Okay. What artificial satellite has seen glimpses of Einsteins predicted frame dragging? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon And of course it's Gravity Probe B.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard Sheldon, you have to let somebody else answer. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon Why? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 penny Because it's polite.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon What do manners have to do with it? This is war. Were the Romans polite when they salted the ground of Carthage to make sure nothing would ever grow again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 penny Leonard, you said I only had to ask questions. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon The objective of the competition is to give correct answers, if I know them, why shouldn't I give them? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 howard Some of us might have the correct answers too. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon Oh please, you don't even have a PhD.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 howard Alright, that's it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard Howard, sit down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 howard Okay. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard maybe we should take a little break.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon Good idea, I need my wrist brace, all this button pushing is aggravating my old Nintendo injury. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 howard I agree.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 penny What did he say? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 howard He compared Sheldon to a disposable feminine cleansing product one might use on a summer's eve. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 penny Yeah, and the bag it came in. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon Leonard, excellent, I want to show you something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard Can it wait, I need to talk to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon Just look. I've designed the perfect uniforms for our team. The colors are based on Star Trek, the original series. The three of you will wear support red, and I will wear command gold. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard Why do they say AA? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon Army Ants. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard Isn't that confusing? AA might mean something else to certain people. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon Why would a physics bowl team be called anodised aluminum?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard No, I meant... never mind. Hey, check it out. I got you a Batman cookie jar!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon Oh neat, what's the occasion?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard Well, you're a friend, and you like Batman, and cookies, and you're off the team. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard Howard, Raj and I just had a team meeting. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon No you didn't.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard Yes we did, I just came from it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon Okay, I don't know where you just came from, but it couldn't have been a team meeting because I'm on the team and I wasn't there, ergo the team did not meet. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard Okay, let me try it this way, uh, I was at a coffee klatch with a couple of friends and one thing led to another and it turns out you're off the team. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard Because you're taking all the fun out of it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon Well, I'm sorry, is the winner of the physics bowl the team that has the most fun?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard Okay, let me try it this way, you're annoying and no-one wants to play with you any more. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon I see. Well. At this point I should inform you that I intend to form my own team and destroy the molecular bonds that bind your very matter together, and reduce the resulting particulate chaos to tears.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard Thanks for the heads up. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon You're welcome. One more thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon It's on, bitch. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 howard So who'd he get to be on his team.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard He won't say. He just smiles, and eats macaroons out of his bat jar. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 raj He's using psychological warfare. We must reply in kind. I say we wait until he looks at us, then laugh like, yes, you are a smart and strong competitor, but we are also smart and strong and we have a reasonable chance of defeating you. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard How exactly would that laugh go? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 raj Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 howard That sounds more like, we are a tall thin woman who wants to make a coat out of your Dalmatians. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard Guys, let's remember that Sheldon is still our friend and my room mate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 howard So?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard So nothing, let's destroy him. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon Gentlemen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 raj Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 howard Okay, we're going to need a strong fourth for our team.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 raj You know who's apparently very smart, is the girl who played TV's Blossom. She got a PhD in neuroscience or something. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard Raj, we're not getting TV's Blossom to join our physics bowl team. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 raj How about the girl from the Wonder Years? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 howard Gentlemen, I believe I've found the solution to all our problems. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard We can't ask Leslie Winkle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 raj Why? Because you slept together and when she was done with you she discarded you like last night's chutney? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard Yes. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 howard Sometimes you've got to take one for the team.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 raj Yeah. Sack up, dude. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard Fine. Here I go, taking one for the team. In the sack. Hey Leslie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leslie Hi guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard Leslie, I have a question for you, and it might be a little awkward, you know, given that I...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 howard Hit that thang. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leslie Leonard, there's no reason to feel uncomfortable just because we've seen each other's faces and naked bodies contorted in the sweet agony of coitus. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard There's not? Gee, cos it sure sounds like there should be. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leslie Rest assured that any aspects of our sexual relationship regarding your preferences, your idiosyncrasies, your performance, are still protected by the inherent confidentiality of the bedroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard That's all very comforting, but if it's okay, I'd like to get on with my question now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leslie Proceed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard We are entering the physics bowl and we need a fourth for our team.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leslie No thanks, I'm really busy with my like sign dilepton super symmetry search.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 howard Dilepton, schmilepton, we need you. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leslie Sorry. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 howard Well, we tried. Just have to face Sheldon mano-e-mano-e-mano. A-mano. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leslie Wait, you're going up against Sheldon Cooper? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 howard Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leslie That arrogant, misogynistic East-Texas doorknob that told me I should abandon my work with high energy particles for laundry and child bearing? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard She's in. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 penny So, how do you feel? Nice and loose? Come to play? Got your game face on? Are you ready?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard Oh, yeah. You know you don't have to stay for the whole thing. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 penny Oh, no, no, I want to. It sounds really interesting. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon Gentlemen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 howard Sheldon. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 raj Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 penny Sheldon. I'm just going to sit down. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard So, is that your team.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon Actually, I don't need a team, I could easily defeat you single-handedly. But the rules require four, so may I introduce, the third floor janitor, he lady from the lunchroom, and, my Spanish is not good, either her son or her butcher. And what about your team? What rat have you recruited to the SS Sinking Ship?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leslie Hello, Sheldon. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon Leslie Winkle? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leslie Yeah, Leslie Winkle. The answer to the question, who made Sheldon Cooper cry like a little girl? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon Yes, well, I'm polymerised tree sap and you're non-organic adhesive so, whatever verbal projectile you launch in my direction is reflected off of me, returns on its original trajectory, and adheres to you. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leslie Oh, ouch. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 dr_gablehouser Okay, if everyone could please take your seats. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard Here's your tee-shirt. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leslie PMS? It's a couple of days early, but...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard No, it stands for Perpetual Motion Squad. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leslie Oh, right, of course, what was I thinking? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 gablehouser Good afternoon everyone, and welcome to this year's physics bowl. Today's preliminary match features two great teams... AA versus PMS. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 howard All night long, y'all! 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 gablehouser Okay, well let's jump right in, first question, for ten points. What is the isospan singlet partner of the Pi Zero Meson? PMS?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard The Eta Meson.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 gablehouser Correct. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon Formal protest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 gablehouser On what grounds?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon The Velcro on my wrist brace caught on my shirt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 gablehouser Denied. Alright, for ten points, what is the lightest element on earth with no stable isotope. AA?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon And of course, the answer is Technetium.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 gablehouser Terrific. Next question, what is the force between two uncharged plates due to quantum vacuum fluctuation. PMS?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 raj Sheldon can suck on, the Casimir Effect.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 gablehouser Correct. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 gablehouser How does a quantum computer factor large numbers. PMS?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leslie Shor's Algorithm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 gablehouser Correct. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon 4.1855 times ten to the seventh ergs per calorie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard Prevost's theory of exchanges. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon Lamda equals one over Pi R squared N 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 howard 760 degrees celsius, the approximate temperature of the young lady in the front row.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 gablehouser Mr Wolowitz, this is your second warning. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon A sigma particle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leslie Yes, assuming the hypothetical planet has a mass greater than the earth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 gablehouser Correct. Ladies and gentlemen, I hold in my hand the final question. The score now stands AA 1150, PMS 1175. So, for one hundred points, and the match, please turn your attention to the formula on the screens. Solve the equation. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 raj Holy crap. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard What the hell is that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 howard It looks like something they found on the ship at Roswell. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard Come on, think, Leslie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leslie Leonard, it's not going to work if you rush me, you have to let me get there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard You're never going to let that go, are you? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 gablehouser Ten seconds. PMS.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard Sorry, I panicked. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 howard Then guess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard Um, eight. Point four. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 gablehouser I'm sorry, that's incorrect. AA, if you can answer correctly, the match is yours. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 howard He doesn't have it. He's got squat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 gablehouser AA, I need your answer. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 third_floor_janitor The answer is minus eight by alpha. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon Hang on, hang on a second, that's not our answer. What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 third_floor_janitor Answering question. Winning physics bowl. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon How do you know anything about physics?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 third_floor_janitor Here I am janitor, in former Soviet Union I am physicist. Leningrad Politechnica. Go Polar Bears. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon Well that's a delightful little story, but our arrangement was that you sit here and not say anything, I answer the questions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 third_floor_janitor You didn't answer question.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon Hey look, now maybe you have democracy now in your beloved Russia, but on this physics bowl team I rule with an iron fist. . Ow!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 gablehouser AA, I need your official answer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon Well it's not what he said.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 gablehouser Then what is it? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon I want a different question.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 gablehouser You can't have a different question. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon Formal protest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 gablehouser Denied.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon Informal protest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 gablehouser Denied. I need your official answer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon No. I decline to provide one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 gablehouser Well, that's too bad, because the answer your teammate gave was correct. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon That's your opinion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 gablehouser Alright, the winner of the match is...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard Hang on. Sheldon, is proving that you are single-handedly smarter than everyone else so important that you would rather lose by yourself than win as part of a team. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon I don't understand the question. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard Go ahead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 gablehouser The winner is PMS! 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard Sorry, somebody's sitting there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon Who?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard My Physics Bowl Trophy! 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon That trophy is meaningless, I forfeited, therefore you did not win. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard I know someone who would disagree.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon Who?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard My Physics Bowl Trophy! 'Leonard is so smart, Sheldon who?'
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon Alright that is very immature.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard You're right, I'm sorry. I'm not! 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 penny Okay, new contest. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 penny I'm settling once and for all who is the smartest around here. Okay, are you ready?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon Absolutely.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard Bring it on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 penny Okay. Marsha, Jan and Cindy were the three daughters of what TV family? The Brady Bunch. Okay, Sammy Hagar replaced David Lee Roth as the lead singer in what group?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon The Brady Bunch? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 penny Van Halen. Alright, Madonna was married to this Ridgemont High alum. Oh my God, Sean Penn!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard How do you know these things?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 penny I go outside and I talk to people. Alright, here, what actor holds the record for being named people magazine's sexiest man alive?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon William Shatner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 leonard Wait, I don't think it's Shatner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon Then it's got to be Patrick Stewart. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon Formal protest. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 penny Alright, singer who sang 'Oops I Did It Again.' Okay, Tweetie Bird, taught he taw a what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 sheldon Romulan.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode13 penny Yes. He taught he taw a Romulan.
