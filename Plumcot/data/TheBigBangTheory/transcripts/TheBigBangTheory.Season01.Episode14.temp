TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon Well, this sandwich is an unmitigated disaster. I asked for turkey and roast beef with lettuce and swiss on wholewheat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 raj What did they give you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon Turkey and roast beef with swiss and lettuce on wholewheat. It's the right ingredients but in the wrong order. In a proper sandwich the cheese is adjacent to the bread to create a moisture barrier against the lettuce. They might as well have dragged this thing through a car wash. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard I don't believe it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon I know, it's basic culinary science. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Some guy is auctioning off a miniature time machine prop from the original film and no-one is bidding on it. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 howard A time machine from the movie The Time Machine? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard No, a time machine from Sophie's Choice. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 raj Boy, Sophie could have used a time machine in that movie. Did you see it, it's rough. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 howard Oh, that's cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Uh-huh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 raj It's only $800?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Yeah. And that's my bid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon You bid $800.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard It was a spur of the moment thing, I figured it would go for thousands and I just wanted to be a part of it. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon There's only 30 seconds left in the auction.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 howard Do you have $800?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Not to blow on a miniature time machine. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 howard Don't worry, the way these things work there's people waiting 'til the last second to bid, and then they swoop in and get it, it's called sniping.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 raj Fifteen seconds.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Come on, snipers. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 raj Ten, nine, eight...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Where are your snipers?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 raj Five.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Snipe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 raj Four.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Snipe. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 raj Three.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Snipe!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 raj Two.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard SNIPE!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 raj One.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Aaaa-aw! 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 raj Congratulations, you are the proud owner of a miniature time machine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 howard You lucky duck. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon I wonder why no-one else bid, this is a classic piece of sci-fi movie memorabilia. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Yeah, I know, I still can't afford it. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 howard Why don't we share it? We'll each put in two hundred bucks and we'll take turns having it in our homes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 raj A time share time machine? I'm in. Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon Need you ask? But I still don't understand why no-one else bid. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon I understand why no-one else bid. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 raj Did the listing actually say miniature?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard I just assumed. Who sells a full sized time machine for $800?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon In a venn diagram, that would be an individual located within the intersection of the sets 'no longer want my time machine' and 'need $800'.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 howard It's actually a tremendous bargain, even with shipping it works out to less than four dollars a pound. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 raj Cocktain shrimp are $12.50.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard How are we going to get it upstairs? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 howard If we take the dish off it might fit in the elevator. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Yes but the elevator's been broken for two years. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon I've been meaning to ask you, do you think we should make a call about that? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 howard Not necessary, I have a masters in engineering, I remotely repair satellites on a regular basis. I troubleshoot space shuttle payloads. When the Mars rover started pulling to the left I performed a front end alignment from 62 million miles away. No, that baby's broken. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Come on, guys, push. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 howard If I push any harder I'm going to give birth to my colon. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 raj I can't feel my fingers, hurry up. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon It's the same amount of work no matter how fast you go, basic physics.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 raj Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon Yeah. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 raj If my fingers ever work again, I've got a job for the middle one. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 penny Oh, hey guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Uh, hi Penny. Take a break, guys! 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 penny What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Oh, just, you know, moving... something upstairs. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 penny What is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard It's... you know, time machine. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 penny Yeah, okay, neat, but I really got to get to work, so...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Uh, just give us a few minutes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 penny I don't have a few minutes, I'm running really late.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon Then I have a simple solution, go up to the roof, hop over to the next building, there's a small gap, don't look down if you're subject to vertigo, and use their stairwell. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 penny You're joking, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon Oh, I never joke when it comes to vertigo. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 penny Damn, okay, I'll just take the roof. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Hey, if you wait for us to set up the time machine, I can drop you off at work yesterday. Time travel joke, it's not... never mind. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon For what it's worth, I thought it was humorous. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Let's just do this. Guys, ready to push?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 raj In a minute. Howard stepped outside to throw up. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon I don't know what you were worried about. I think it really works in the room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Yeah. It is by far the coolest thing I have ever owned. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon The exact time machine that carried actor Rod Taylor from Victorian England into the post-apocalyptic future, which society had splintered into two factions, the sub-terranean Morlocks, who survived by feasting on the flesh of the gentle surface dwelling Eloy. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 howard Talk about your chick magnets. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 raj Oh yeah. The guy who lives next to me is always like, I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony, I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony. But wait until I tell him, I've got a time machine on my balcony. Stuff that in your speedos, Jacuzzi Bob!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon Gentlemen, I know we said we'd take turns, but I think you'd agree that practicality dictates it remain here. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 howard You can't just keep it here, what if I meet a girl and say, 'you wanna come up and see my time machine, it's at my friends house,' how lame is that? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 raj He's got a point.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon Alright, I think we're going to need some ground rules, in addition to the expected no shoes in the time machine and no eating in the time machine, I propose that we add pants must be worn at all times in the time machine. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Seconded. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 howard I was going to put down a towel. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 raj I still want it on my balcony. I say we move it on a bi-monthly basis. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard That sounds fair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon Hold on. Bi-monthly is an ambiguous term, do you mean move it every other month, or twice a month? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 raj Twice a month.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon Then no. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 raj Okay, every other month.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon No. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Sheldon, you can't be selfish, we all paid for it, so it belongs to all of us. Now out of the way so I can sit in my time machine. Okay, I am setting the dials for March 10th, 1876. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 howard Good choice, Alexander Graham Bell invents the telephone and calls out for Dr Watson.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon Wait a minute, I'd want to see that too. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard So, when it's your turn you can.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon But if we all go back to the same point in time, Bell's lab is going to get very crowded, he'll know something's up. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 raj Also, since the time machine doesn't move in space, you'll end up in 1876 Pasadena. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 howard And even if you can make it to Boston, what are you going to do, knock on the door and say to Mrs Bell, 'hey Mrs Bell, big fan of your husband, can I come in and watch him invent the telephone?'
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 raj Mrs Bell was deaf, she's not even going to hear you knock. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon Oh, I have a solution, first go into the future and obtain a cloaking device.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 raj Ooh, how far into the future?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon If I remember correctly, Captain Kirk will steal a cloaking device from the Romulans on Stardate 5027.3, which will be January 10th 2328 by pre-federation reckoning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Okay, I am setting the dials for January 10th, 2328. Here we go into the future. That was fun. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 raj My turn.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 penny Okay, first of all, what you call a gap was nearly three feet wide, I slipped and skinned my knee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Are you okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 penny Zzz-zz-zz-zz! Second of all, the door to the stairwell of the other building was locked, so I had to go down the fire escape which ends on the third floor, forcing me to crawl through the window of a lovely Armenian family, who insisted I stay for lunch. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard That doesn't sound too bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 penny It was eight courses of lamb, and they tried to fix me up with their son.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 penny Not done. By the time I finally got to work, they'd given my shift away. Yeah, that's right, I've lost an entire day's pay thanks to this... this...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon Time machine. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard The lights flash and the dish spins, you wanna try it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 penny No! I don't want to try it, my God, you are grown men, how could you waste your lives with these stupid toys and costumes and comic books and... and now that... that...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon Again, time machine. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 penny Oh please, it's not a time machine, if anything it looks like something Elton John would drive through the Everglades.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon It only moves in time. It would be worse than useless in a swamp. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 penny Pathetic. All of you, completely pathetic. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 raj My turn! 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon Leonard, it's two in the morning. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard So?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon So it's my turn. Why did you set it for the day before yesterday?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Because I want to go back and keep myself from getting a time machine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon You can't. If you were to prevent yourself from buying it in the past, you would not have it available in the present to travel back and stop yourself from buying it, ergo you would still have it. This is a classic rookie time travel mistake. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Can I go back and prevent you from explaining that to me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon Same paradox. If you were to travel back in time and, say, knock me unconscious, you would not then have the conversation that irritated you, motivating you to go back and knock me unconscious. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard What if I knocked you unconscious right now? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon It won't change the past. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard But it would make the present so much nicer. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon Are you upset about something? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard What was your first clue?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon Well, it was a number of things. First the late hour, then your demeanour seems very low energy, plus your irritability...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Yes I'm upset. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon Oh! I don't usually pick up on those things. Good for me. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Yeah, good for you. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon Oh, wait. Did you want to talk about what's bothering you? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard I don't know. Maybe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon Wow, I'm on fire tonight. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Uh, here's the thing. Girls like Penny never end up with guys who own time machines. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon I disagree. Your inability to successfully woo Penny long predates your acquisition of the time machine. That failure clearly stands on its own.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Thanks for pointing it out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon In addition, your premise is flawed. In the original film, Rod Taylor got Yvette Mimeaux with that very time machine. In Back to the Future, Marty McFly got the opportunity to hook up with his extremely attractive young mother. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Those are movies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon Well of course they're movies. Were you expecting me to come up with an example involving a real life time machine? That's absurd. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Come on, guys, push. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 howard If I push any harder I'm going to give birth to my colon. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 penny Oh, hey guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Uh, hi Penny. Take a break, guys! 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 penny What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Oh, just, you know, moving a... time machine. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 penny Yeah, okay, neat, but I really got to get to work, so...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard No problem. Hang on. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 penny But, what about your time machine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Some things are more important than toys. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 penny Oh, I'm scared. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Don't worry baby, I've got you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 penny Oh, Leonard. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon It's still my turn.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard I'm packing up all my collectibles and taking them down to the comic book store to sell. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon Well is that really necessary. If you need money you can always sell blood. And semen. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard It's not about money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 raj We brought food.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 howard Lox and bagels, the breakfast of time travellers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Terrific, does anyone want to buy my share of the time machine?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 raj Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Because I don't want it any more. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 howard Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Just... personal reasons. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon My spidey-sense tells me this has something to do with Penny. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Look, do you want to buy me out or not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 raj I'll give you a hundred dollars, which will make me half owner, and we'll put it on my balcony. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 howard Screw his balcony, I'll give you a hundred and twenty and we'll put it in my garage. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard I paid two hundred dollars for my share.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 raj Dude, everyone knows a time machine loses half its value the minute you drive it off the lot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon I'll go for two hundred, that time machine stays right where it is. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 raj Three hundred, and I'll throw in my original 1979 Mattel Millenium Falcon with real light speed sound effects. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard No, no more toys or action figures or props or replicas or costumes or robots or Darth Vader voice changers, I'm getting rid of all of it. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 howard You can't do that, look what you've created here, it's like nerdvana. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 raj More importantly, you've a Darth Vader voice changer? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Not for long.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 raj Oh, I call dibs on the Golden Age Flash.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 howard Hang on, I need that to complete my Justice Society of America collection.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 raj Too bad, I called dibs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 howard Well you can't just call dibs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 raj I can and I did, look up dibs on Wikipedia.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon Dibs doesn't apply in a bidding war. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard It's not a bidding war, I'm selling it all to Larry down at the comic book store. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 raj Why Larry? Did Larry call dibs? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 howard Will you forget dibs! 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard He offered me a fair price for the whole collection.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon What's the number, I'll match it. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 raj I'll match it, plus a thousand rupees. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon What's the exchange rate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 raj None of your business. Take it or leave it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 howard Mom, my bar-mizvah bonds, how much do I got? Thanks. I can go twenty six hundred dollars and two trees in Israel. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Forget it guys, if I sell to one of you, the other two are going to be really mad at me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon Who cares, as long as you pick me. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 raj Okay, Leonard, put down the box, let's talk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Sorry Raj, my mind is made up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon No. I can't let you do this. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Sheldon, get out of my way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon None shall pass. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Okay. I did not want to do this but, I have here the rare mint condition production error Star Trek, The Next Generation Geordi LaForge, without his visor in the original packaging. If you do not get out of my way, I will open it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 howard Okay man, be cool, we're all friends here. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 penny What the hell's going on? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon You hypocrite!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon Little Miss 'grown ups don't play with toys'. If I were to go into that apartment right now, would I find Beanie Babies? Are you not an accumulator of Care Bears and My Little Ponies? And who is that Japanese feline I see frolicking on your shorts? Hello,Hello Kitty! 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 penny Okay, okay look, if this is about yesterday, Leonard, I am really sorry about what I said, I was just a bit upset.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard No, I needed to hear it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 penny No you didn't. Look, you are a great guy, and it is things you love that make you who you are. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 howard I guess that makes me large breasts. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Still, I think it's time for me to get rid of this stuff and... you know... move on with my life. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 penny Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 penny Oh. Wow. Good for you. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Thanks. Hey, do you want to, I don't know, later...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 good_looking_man_coming_up_stairs Excuse me. Hey, Penny!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 penny Hi Mike.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 mike Are you ready to go. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 penny Yeah, I just have to change.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 mike I'll give you a hand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 penny Oh, stop it! Bye guys. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard My turn on the time machine. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon It worked. It really worked. They said I was mad, but it worked. Oh no, not Morlocks! Not flesh-eating Morlocks! He-e-e-e-e-e-e-elp! 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard Sheldon, are you okay? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon We have to get rid of the time machine. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard It is a little big for the living room, isn't it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon Yeah, that's the problem, it's too big. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 leonard I'm glad you agree. I hired some guys to help us move it, come on in fellas. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode14 sheldon Oh no, Morlocks? Eat him, eat him. Aaaaargh. Leonard!!!!!!!!
