TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter On the other hand, some physicists are concerned that if the super collider actually works, it will create a black hole and swallow up the Earth ending life as we know it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Psh, what a bunch of crybabies. No guts, no glory man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Hey, check it out, the school of pharmacology is looking for volunteers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 raj_koothrappali We are testing a new medication for social anxiety, panic attacks, agoraphobia and obsessive compulsive disorder. Why would they be looking for test subjects here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter I don't know, Raj. Maybe the comic book store doesn't have a bulletin board. What's going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Shhh! Hot girl in Sheldon's office.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon's office? Is she lost?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Don't think so. I followed her here from the parking lot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Maybe she's his lawyer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Well she's free to examine my briefs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Howard...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 howard_wolowitz I know, I'm disgusting, I should be punished. By her, oh look, I did it again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 Well, that should do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Thank you for coming by. Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Oh, hey buddy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Buddy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Sorry I'm late, I'm working on a project that may take me up on the next space shuttle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper How can you be late, I wasn't expecting you at all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Nobody ever expects me, sometimes you just look and... BAM! Howard Wolowitz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, are you going to introduce us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Oh, alright, this is Missy, Missy this is Leonard and Rajesh and you've already met Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 missy_cooper It's nice to meet you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter You too, swell, also.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter So, how do you two know each other.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 missy_cooper Oh, he once spent nine months with my legs wrapped around his head.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Excuse me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper She's my twin sister, she thinks she's funny but frankly I've never been able to see it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 missy_cooper It's because you have no measurable sense of humor, Shelly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper How exactly would one measure a sense of humor? A humormometer?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Well, I think you're delightfully droll. Or as the French say, tres drole.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 missy_cooper Okay, so let me see if I got this. Leonard, Howard and... I'm sorry what was your name again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Rajesh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter So Missy, what brings you all the way from Texas?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Was it perhaps destiny, I think it was destiny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 missy_cooper My friend's getting married in Disneyland tomorrow night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Destiny, thy name is Anaheim.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 missy_cooper And I had to drop off some papers for Shelly to sign for my dad's estate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper The papers could have been mailed, Mom just sent you here to spy on me, didn't she.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 missy_cooper I guess that's why they call you a genius.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper They call me a genius because I'm a genius. Tell Mom that I currently weigh 165 pounds, and that I'm having regular bowel movements. Enjoy the wedding, goodbye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 howard_wolowitz@leonard_hofstadter Woah, woah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter If the wedding's not until tomorrow, why don't you stay with us tonight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 missy_cooper Oh, I don't think so. Shelly doesn't like company. Even as a little boy he'd send his imaginary friends home at the end of the day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper They were not friends, they were imaginary colleagues.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Look, you're here, we have plenty of room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper No we don't.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Come on, Shelly, she's family.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper So what? I don't issue invitations to your mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 missy_cooper Well it would be nice not to have to drive out to Anaheim in rush hour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper And don't ever call me Shelly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter So it's settled. You'll stay with us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 howard_wolowitz I'll walk you to your car. You're in structure 3 level C, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper What just happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 missy_cooper So anyway, we're eight years old, and Sheldon converts my easy-bake oven to some kind of high-powered furnace.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Hee-hee, just classic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper I needed a place to fire ceramic semi-conductor substrates for home-made integrated circuits.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 missy_cooper He was trying to build some kind of armed robot to keep me out of his room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Made necessary by her insistence on going into my room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 missy_cooper Anyway, I go to make those little corn muffins they give you, there's a big flash, next thing you know my eyebrows are gone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Ha-ha, not your eyebrows?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 missy_cooper Yep. I had to go through the entire second grade with crooked eyebrows my Mom drew on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Is that what that was? I just assumed that the second grade curriculum had rendered you quizzical.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 penny Hey, Leonard, you left your underwear in the dryer downstairs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Those are not mine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 penny Really, they have your little name label in them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, no, I do, I use those... uh... just to polish up my... spear-fishing equipment. I spear fish. When I'm not crossbow hunting, I spear fish. Uh, Penny, this is Sheldon's twin sister, Missy. Missy, this is our neighbor Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 missy_cooper Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 penny Wow, you don't look that much alike.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Can I get a hallelujah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Fraternal twins come from two separate eggs, they are no more alike than any other siblings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Hallelujah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Hey, guess what. I've been accepted as a test subject for a new miracle drug to overcome pathological shyness.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 penny Hey, good for you, Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Yes, I'm very hopeful. Hello Missy. They mentioned there may be side effects.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 raj_koothrappali So, Missy. Have you ever met a man from the exotic subcontinent of India?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 missy_cooper Well, there's Dr Patel at our church.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Ah yes, Dr Patel, good man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Do you like motorcycles, 'cos I ride a hog.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 raj_koothrappali A hog? You have a two cylinder scooter with a basket on the front.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 howard_wolowitz You still have to wear a helmet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Have you ever heard of the Kama Sutra?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 missy_cooper The sex book?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 raj_koothrappali The Indian sex book. In other words if you wonder wonder who wrote the book of love, it was us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 penny Hey, Sheldon's sister's pretty cute, I w...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter I wasn't staring!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 penny I didn't say you were, I just said she was cute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Oh. Huh, um, maybe, if you like women who are tall... and perfect.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 penny Sheldon, why are you ignoring your sister?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper I'm not ignoring my sister. I'm ignoring all of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter I brought snacks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 missy_cooper Oh my! Gherkins and...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Onion dip, it's onion dip.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 missy_cooper Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter We don't entertain much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Missy, do you enjoy pajamas?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 missy_cooper I guess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 raj_koothrappali We Indians invented them. You're welcome.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Yeah, well my people invented circumcision. You're welcome!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 penny Missy, I'm going to go get my nails done. Do you want to come?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 missy_cooper God yes. Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 penny You're welcome.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 missy_cooper Bye guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Bye Missy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Bye Missy, see you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 penny Goodbye Leonard!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Uh, yeah, no, uh, bye Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Okay, you two have to back off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Why should I back off, you back off dude.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Excuse me, this is my apartment and she's my roommate's sister.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 howard_wolowitz So what, you've already got Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter How do I have Penny? In what universe do I have Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 howard_wolowitz So I can have Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Hell, no!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Excuse me, can I interject something. I'm ordering pizza online, is everyone okay with pepperoni?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, can I talk to you in private?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper I guess. Don't worry, I was going to order you cheeseless.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper That's okay. Lactose intolerance is nothing to be embarrassed about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 howard_wolowitz I'm a fancy Indian man, we invented pajamas!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Hey, look at me, I don't have a foreskin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, are you aware that your sister is an incredibly attractive woman?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Hmmm? She certainly has the symmetry and low body fat that western culture deems desirable. It's noteworth that at other points in history, heavier women were the standard for beauty because their girth suggested affluence.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter That's fascinating, but I...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper I didn't say it was fascinating, I said it was noteworthy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Alright, noted. But my point is that Koothrappali and Wolowitz... they're hitting on your sister.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Oh. Okay. You know, I don't want to criticise your rhetorical style but, we'd be a lot further along in this conversation if you'd begun with that thought.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter That's great, but I...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper What I'm saying is that we took quite an unnecessary detour from what I now understand to be your thesis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Whatever. You have to do something about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Because she's your sister.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper I don't understand. Yes, we shared a uterus for nine months, but since then we've pretty much gone our own separate ways.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Okay, uh... oh, consider this. With your father gone, it is your responsibility to make sure that Missy chooses a suitable mate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper I hadn't considered that. We do share DNA.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Uh-huh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper So there is the possibility, however remote, that resting in her loins is the potential for another individual as remarkable as myself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Exactly. And, you owe it to yourself and to posterity to protect the genetic integrity of your sister's future offspring.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper You're right. If someone wants to get at Missy's fallopian tubes, they'll have to go through me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 raj_koothrappali I am Shiva the destroyer, I will have the woman!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 howard_wolowitz I'm warning you, I was judo champion at math camp.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Alright, that's enough juvenile squabbling, stop it, stop it I say. I'm going to settle this right now. Neither of you are good enough for my sister.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Who are you to decide that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter He's the man of his family, you have to respect his wishes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper You're out too, by the way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Say what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper It's nothing personal, I'd just prefer if my future niece or nephew didn't become flatulent every time they eat an Eskimo pie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 howard_wolowitz What are you so happy about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 raj_koothrappali I'm not happy, it's the medication, I can't stop smiling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Now that Leonard's made me aware of how high the genetic stakes are, we have to face the fact that none of you are suitable mates for my sister.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Wait a minute. Leonard made you aware of that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter We all make mistakes, let's move on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Excuse me, but I think you're missing a big opportunity here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper How so?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Everybody knows genetic diversity produces the strongest offspring. Why not put a little mocha in the family latte.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper In principle you have a point, but as a practical matter, need I remind you that it takes experimental pharmaceuticals to simply enable you to speak to the opposite sex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 raj_koothrappali I think you're focussing entirely too much on the drugs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Is it 'cause I'm Jewish, 'cause I'd kill my Rabbi with a porkchop to be with your sister.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper This has nothing to do with religion. This has to do with the fact that you're a tiny, tiny man who still lives with his mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, you are really being unreasonable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Am I? Here. Eat this cheese without farting and you can sleep with my sister.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 missy_cooper Oh really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Oops.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 missy_cooper Shelly, can I speak to you for a minute? Alone?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Why does everyone suddenly want to talk to me alone? Usually nobody wants to be alone with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter We all make mistakes, let's move on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 missy_cooper Okay. I'm not even going to ask why you're pimping me out for cheese. But since when do you care at all about who I sleep with?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Truthfully, I've never given it any thought, but it has been pointed out to me that you carry DNA of great potential.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 missy_cooper What on earth are you talking about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Let me explain. You see, I'm a superior genetic mutation, an improvement on the existing mediocre stock.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 missy_cooper And what do you mean, mediocre stock?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper That would be you. But residing within you is the potential for another me. Perhaps even taller, smarter and less prone to freckling, a Sheldon 2.0 if you will.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 missy_cooper Sheldon 2.0?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Exactly. Now, I am not saying that I should be the sole decider of who you mate with. If you're not attracted to the suitor then the likelihood of conception would be reduced.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 missy_cooper You have got to be kidding me!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Not at all. Frequent coitus dramatically increases the odds of fertiliziation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 missy_cooper Okay Shelly, sit down. Now I've lived my whole life dealing with the fact that my twin brother is, as Mom puts it, one of God's special little people.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper I always thought I was more like a cuckoo bird. You know, a superior creature whose egg is placed in the nest of ordinary birds. Of course the newly hatched cuckoo eats all the food, leaving the ordinary siblings to starve to death. Luckily for you, that's where the metaphor ended.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 missy_cooper I thought it ended at cuckoo. Now you listen to me, if you want to start acting like a brother who cares about me, then terrific. Bring it on. But you try one time to tell me who I should be sleeping with, and you and I are going to go round and round the way we did when we were little. Remember?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper I have an alternate proposal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 missy_cooper Go on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper You donate eggs. We will place them in cryogenic storage. I will find an appropriate sperm donor for your eggs, have them fertilized and implanted in you, that way everybody wins.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Correction. Missy can date whoever she wants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Look, we have to settle this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter I agree. Sheldon's sister is hiding at Penny's because we've all been hitting on her at the same time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 raj_koothrappali She's not hiding. She needed privacy to call her grandmother who's apparently very sick. Oh, and then I believe she has to wash her hair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Oh, you poor, deluded bastard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Don't start with me dude.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 howard_wolowitz You want to go again? Let's go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Sit down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter If we're going to fight over Missy, let's do it the right way. The honorable way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter And he's down!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Come on, come on, get up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Stay down, bitch. Yeah, ha ha, natural selection at work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper I weep for humanity.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Excuse me while I go tell Missy the good news.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 penny Ah, hey Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Hi Penny, how's it going. Listen, that guy Mike that you were dating, is that still going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 penny Uh, pretty much, why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Nothing, just catching up. By the way, may I speak to Missy please?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 penny Of course.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 missy_cooper Hi, Leonard, what's up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Well, since you're leaving tomorrow I was wondering if you'd like to go out to dinner with me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 missy_cooper That's so sweet. But no thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Oh. You have other plans, or...?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 missy_cooper No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Oh. Alright uh... enjoy the rest of your evening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 missy_cooper Thanks. See you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Um, here's something we didn't anticipate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 penny What do you want, Howard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 howard_wolowitz I'm fine, thanks for asking. I've come to call on Missy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 penny Missy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 missy_cooper Hi Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 howard_wolowitz The amazing Howard. Do you like magic?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 missy_cooper Not really. No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Then you are in for a treat. Behold, an ordinary cane. Da-dah!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 missy_cooper No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 penny Missy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Thank you. I apprec... apprec... appreeee... oh-oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 penny Oh, honey, is your medication wearing off?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 missy_cooper Oh, hi, cutie pie. I was hoping you'd show up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 missy_cooper We had a dog who made a noise like that. Had to put him down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 missy_cooper Any news you want me to pass along to Mom?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Well, she might be interested to know that I have refocused my research from bosonic string theory to heteronic string theory.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 missy_cooper Yeah, I'll just tell her you said hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Okay, well, it was pleasant seeing you, other than that business with my testicles.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 missy_cooper Come on, Shelly. I want you to know I'm very proud of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 missy_cooper Yup, I'm always bragging to my friends about my brother the rocket scientist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper You tell people I'm a rocket scientist?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 missy_cooper Well yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper I'm a theoretical physicist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 missy_cooper What's the difference?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper What's the difference?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 missy_cooper Goodbye Shelly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode15 sheldon_cooper My God! Why don't you just tell them I'm a toll taker at the Golden Gate Bridge? Rocket scientist, how humiliating.
