TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Hey, guys, guys, some of the other waitresses wanted me to ask you something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Oh, it's called trestling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz It combines the physical strength of arm wrestling with the mental agility of tetris into the ultimate sport.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Yeah, that's terrific, but what they wanted me to ask you was to cut it the hell out. Right come on guys, come on. Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you ...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper We might as well stop, it's a stalemate. You're beating me in tetris, but you've got the upper body strength of a Keebler Elf.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 raj_koothrappali Keebler Elf? I've got your Keebler Elf right here. Okay, it's a stalemate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny So Leonard, will we be seeing you on Saturday for your free birthday cheesecake?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper He can't eat cheesecake, he's lactose intolerant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Okay, he can have carrot cake.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper What about the cream cheese frosting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny he can scrape it off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Forget about the cake, how did you know that my birthday is Saturday?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny I did your horoscope, remember, I was going to do everybody's until Sheldon went on one of his typical psychotic rants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper For the record, that psychotic rant was a concise summation of the research of Bertram Forer, who in 1948 proved conclusively through meticulously designed experiments, that astrology is nothing but pseudo scientific hokum.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Blah blah blah, a typical Taurus. So, seriously, are we going to see you Saturday?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Oh, I don't think so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter I don't celebrate my birthday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Shuddup, yeah you do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter No, it's no big deal, it's just the way I was raised. My parents focussed on celebrating achievements, and being expelled from a birth canal was not considered one of them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Uh, that's so silly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper It's actually based on very sound theories, his mother published a paper on it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny What was it called, 'I hate my son and that's why he can't have cake?'
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper It was obviously effective, Leonard grew up to be an experimental physicist. Perhaps if she'd also denied him Christmas he'd be a little better at it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Well I love birthdays, waking up to Mom's special French Toast breakfast, wearing the birthday king crown, playing laser tag with all my friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Yeah, see, that's what kids should have.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Actually that was last year.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny So you've really never had a birthday party?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter No. But it was okay. I mean, when I was little I'd think maybe my parents would change their mind, and surprise me with a party, like this one birthday I came home from my Cello lesson, and I saw a lot of strange cars parked out front, and when I got to the door I could hear people whispering, and I could smell German chocolate cake, which is my favorite.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny And?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Uh, it turns out my grandfather had died.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Oh my God, that's terrible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Oh, it was kind of like a birthday party. I got to see all my cousins and there was cake, so ...7
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny That's the saddest thing I've ever heard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz You think? Go ahead, tell her about your senior prom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Make sure they remember no peanuts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Howard, every Thai restaurant in town knows you can't eat peanuts. They see me coming they go 'ah, no peanut boy!'
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Hello Penny. Leonard just left.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny I know. I want to talk to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper What would we talk about? We've no overlapping areas of interest I'm aware of, and you know I don't care for chit-chat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Okay, can you just let me in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Well alright, but I don't see this as a promising endeavour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Okay, here's the deal, we are going to throw Leonard a kick-ass surprise party for his birthday on Saturday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper I hardly think so, Leonard made it very clear he doesn't want a party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Did someone say party?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny He just doesn't know he wants one because he's never had one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz I suppose that's possible, but for the record, I've never had a threesome and yet I still know I want one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Howard, here's the difference. The possibility exists that Leonard could have a birthday party before hell freezes over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Fine. If I do have a threesome, you can't be part of it. I'm just kidding, yes you can. Can you bring a friend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper I think a birthday party is a terrible idea. I envy Leonard for growing up without that anguish.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Anguish?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Year after year, I had to endure wearing conical hats while being forced into the crowded sweaty hell of bouncy castles, not to mention being blindfolded and spun towards a grotesque tailless donkey as the other children mocked my disorientation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Okay, sweetie, I understand you have scars that no non-professional can heal, but nevertheless we are going to throw Leonard a birthday party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Have I pointed out that I am extremely uncomfortable with dancing, loud music and most other forms of alcohol induced frivolity.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Nevertheless we are ...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper In addition I really don't think that Leonard wants a ...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Okay, here's the deal, you either help me throw Leonard a birthday party or, so help me God, I will go into your bedroom and I will unbag all of your most valuable mint condition comic books. And on one of them, you won't know which, I'll draw a tiny happy face in ink.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper You can't do that, if you make a mark on a mint comic book it's no longer mint.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Sheldon, do you understand the concept of blackmail?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Well of course I ... oh! Yeah, I have an idea, let's throw Leonard a kick ass birthday party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper That's not the secret knock. This is the secret knock.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz What difference does it make?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper The whole point of a secret knock is to establish a non-verbal signal to verify the identity of one's co-conspirators.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Is that Raj and Howard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Possibly, but unverified.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Can you just let us in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Luckily for you this is not a nuclear reactor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny So, what did you get the birthday boy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Well, Raj got him an awesome limited edition Dark Knight sculpture based on Alex Ross's definitive Batman, and I got him this amazing autographed copy of the Feynman lectures on physics.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Nice. I got him a sweater.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Okay, well, he might like that, I've seen him ... chilly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Uh, Sheldon, I didn't see your present.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper That's because I didn't bring one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Well why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Don't ask.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper The entire institution of gift giving makes no sense.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Too late.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Let's say that I go out and I spend fifty dollars on you, it's a laborious activity, because I have to imagine what you need, whereas you know what you need. Now I can simplify things, just give you the fifty dollars directly and, you could give me fifty dollars on my birthday, and so on until one of us dies leaving the other one old and fifty dollars richer. And I ask you, is it worth it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Told you not to ask.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Well, Sheldon, you're his friend. Friends give each other presents.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper I accept your premise, I reject your conclusion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Try telling him it's a non-optional social convention.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Just do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny It's a non-optional social convention.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Oh. Fair enough.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz He came with a manual.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Question, how am I going to get Leonard a present before the party? I don't drive, and the only things available within walking distance are a Thai restaurant and a gas station. I suppose I could wrap up an order of mee krob and a couple of lottery scratchers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Okay, let's do this, um, I will drive Sheldon to get a present, and Howard, you need to get rid of Leonard for about two hours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz No problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny And then Raj, you bring the stuff across the hall and start setting up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz What if guests show up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Entertain them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz What if they're women?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Stare at them and make them feel uncomfortable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Hey!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz How's it going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz So, listen, the New Art is showing the revised definitive cut of Blade Runner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Seen it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz No, you've seen the 25th anniversary final cut. This one has eight seconds of previously unseen footage. They say it completely changes the tone of the film.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Oh. Pass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Come on, afterwards there's a Q & A with Harrison Ford's body double.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Look, I am in the Halo battle of my life here, there's this kid in Copenhagen, he has no immune system so all he does is sit in his bubble and play Halo 24/7.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Can't you play him some other time?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Not if you believe his doctors.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Oh my God, do you smell gas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Yeah, no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Alright, you know they have DVDs over there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Yes, but they have DVD burners over here. Leonard needs a DVD burner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Sheldon, a gift shouldn't be something someone needs, it should be something fun, you know, something they wouldn't buy for themselves.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper You mean, like a sweater?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Well, it's a fun sweater, it's got a bold geometric print.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Is it the geometry that makes it fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Okay, the point is, one of the ways we show we care about people is by putting thought and imagination into the gifts we give them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Okay, I see, so not a DVD burner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Exactly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Something he wouldn't buy for himself. Something fun. Something like ... oh, an 802.11n wireless router.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Here you go, Copenhagen boy, how about a taste of Hans Christian Hand Grenade. Come on, come on, oh you clever little ... Come on, come on, take that!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Oh-oh. Oh-oh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter What's the matter?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz This granola bar, there's peanuts in it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Oh my God, why did you eat it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz I don't know, it was just there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Well if I had a gun there, would you have shot yourself?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Don't yell at me, I've got to go to the emergency room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz No, after my tongue has swollen to the size of a brisket.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Alright, um, just, uh, let me get my keys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Oh God, oh God, oh God, oh ... The laundry is out of the hamper. Okay Sheldon, what was it supposed to be? Fine, it's out of the washer. I'll call you when it's in the dryer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Alright, let's go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper What do you think.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Um, that one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Because of the two additional Ethernet ports.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper He doesn't need them, he's already got a 640 connect switch
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Oh, okay then this one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny I don't know, the man on the box looks so happy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Penny! If I'm going to buy Leonard a gift, I'm going to do it right. I refuse to let him experience the same childhood trauma I did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Oh, I know I'm going to regret this but, what trauma?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper On my twelfth birthday I really wanted a titanium centrifuge, so, you know, I could separate radioactive isotopes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Of course.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Instead of a titanium centrifuge, my parents bought me ... wow, this is hard. They got me ... a motorised dirt bike.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny No?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper What twelve year old boy wants a motorised dirt bike?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny All of them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Okay, so we're getting this one?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Yeah, I suppose.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Okay, let's go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 random_woman#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 Excuse me, do you know anything about this stuff?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper I know everything about this stuff.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 woman#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 Okay, I have my own wholesale flower business, and I want to hook up my computer in the front entrance with the one in my refrigerated warehouse.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Here, buy this one. Look, it's the one we're getting, see, happy guy available.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper No, no, no, no, she doesn't want that, she needs a point to point peer network with a range extender.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 woman#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 random_guy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 Which hard drive do I want, firewire or USB?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper It depends on what Bus you have.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 guy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 I drive a Chevy Cavalier.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Oh, dear lord.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Sheldon, we have to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Not now, Penny, this poor man needs me. You hold on, I'll be right with you. What computer do you have, and please don't say a white one?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Excuse me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 nurse#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 Fill this out, have a seat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz No, listen, see we're throwing my friend a surprise party and I'm supposed to keep him out of his apartment for two hours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 nurse#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 Uh-huh, fill this out and have a seat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz No, see, the only way I could get him to leave is to tell him I ate a peanut. Because I'm allergic to peanuts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 nurse#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 Oh, well in that case fill this out and have a seat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Look, all I need from you is to take me in the back and give me a band-aid so I can pretend I had a shot of epinephrine and they you tell my friend you need to keep me under observation for about an hour, hour and a half.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 nurse#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 Is that all you need?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 nurse#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 Get out of my ER.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz No, you don't understand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 nurse#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 Oh, I understand, but unfortunately this hospital is not equipped to treat stupid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Okay, I get it, I know how the world works, how about if I were to introduce you to the man who freed your people.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Hey, sorry I couldn't find a parking spot, how are you doing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Bad, very bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Really, 'cos you don't look like you're swelling up at all, maybe we should just pick up some benedryl at the drug store and go home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz We can't go home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Becauth Becauth-th-th. Brissket, Brissket! Water, need water.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Alright, I'll be right back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Penny, look, I've got a problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Yeah, well so do I, look you've got to stall Leonard a little longer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz I don't think I can.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny You have to, we all have to be there at the same time to yell 'surprise!'
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Okay, you have to understand something, we're in a hospital right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Why, is Leonard okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Leonard's fine. I'm fine, thanks for asking, by the way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Okay, I don't need your attitude, just hold him there a little longer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Look, I've done my best but he wants to go home and I don't know how to stop him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Okay, how about this. You keep him there a little longer and when you get to the party I'll point out which of my friends are easy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Don't toy with me, woman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny I've got a hot former fat girl with no self-esteem, I've got a girl who punishes her father by sleeping around and an alcoholic who's two tequila shots away from letting you wear her like a hat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Thy will be done. I'm doing this for you, little buddy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Okay, we don't have that in stock, but I can special order it for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 althea Excuse me, sir, you don't work here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Yes, well, apparently neither does anyone else.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Sheldon, we have to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Well, for one thing, we're late for Leonard's birthday party. And for another, I told him to call security.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Good luck. By the way, a six year-old could hack your computer system.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Keep walking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Yeah, 1-2-3-4 is not a secure password.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Excuse me, my friend is having an allergic reaction to peanuts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 nurse#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 No he's not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Yes he is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 nurse#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 Look, sir we are very busy here and I just don't ... holy crap!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Pees hep me!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 nurse#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 Code 4, I need a gurney, right away, right away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Fank-u.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Say what you will about the healthcare system in this country, but when they're afraid of lawsuits they sure test everything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz I really don't think the colonoscopy was necessary.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter You know, before you got all swollen up, I actually thought you were trying to keep me out of the apartment so you could throw me a surprise party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Oh, right, it's your birthday, I had no idea it was your birthday, I completely forgot, wow, what a lousy way to spend a birthday, well it's all over now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter There is a party, isn't there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Maybe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Are you mad?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter how could I be mad? You actually risked your life because you cared about me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Yeah, that's why I did it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Alright. Here we go. My first birthday party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 raj_koothrappali Dude! Everybody left an hour ago! Surprise!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 raj_koothrappali Okay Leonard, here I am at your birthday party, I don't know where you are dude, but it's really kick-ass. Everyone is very very drunk, and uh ... Oh look, there's a girl taking her shirt off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny That's my friend Carol. Remind me, I've got to introduce her to Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 raj_koothrappali Oh sweet Krishna, shake it, that-a rupee maker.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny I'm so sorry you didn't get your party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Oh, it's okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 penny Happy birthday anyways.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Hey Penny, when, uh, when's your birthday?
