TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon Wo de zhing shi Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 howard No, it's Wo de ming zi shi Sheldon. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon Wo de ming zi shi Sheldon. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 howard What's this? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon That's what you did. I assumed as in a number of languages that the gesture was part of the phrase.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 howard Well it's not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon How am I supposed to know that? As the teacher it's your obligation to separate your personal idiosyncrasies from the subject matter. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 howard You know, I'm really glad you decided to learn Mandarin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 howard Once you're fluent you'll have a billion more people to annoy instead of me. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard Hey! 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon Mai du lui tsa.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 howard You just called Leonard a syphilitic donkey. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon My apologies Leonard, I'm only as good as my teacher. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard Why are you learning Chinese?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon I believe the Szechuan Palace has been passing off orange chicken as tangerine chicken and I intend to confront them. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard If I were you, I'd be more concerned by what they're passing off as chicken. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny I need to use your window.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard Oh, yeah, no, sure, go ahead. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny Hey Jerkface, you forgot your iPod! 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard What's going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny Oh, I'll tell you what's going on, that stupid self-centered bastard wrote about our sex life in his blog. Drop dead, you stupid self-centered bastard! Thank you. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon Okay, where were we? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 howard Not now, I have a blog to find. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard Penny, are you okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny I'm fine, Leonard, just go away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard Look, I understand that breaking up with someone can be very painful...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny GO AWAY!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard Okay, feel better, bye. She doesn't want to talk. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon Not surprising. Penny's emotional responses originate from the primitive portion of the brain known as the Amygdala, while speech is centered in the much more recently developed Neocortex. The former can easily overpower the latter giving scientific credence to the notion of being rendered speechless. Or maybe she just doesn't want to talk. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 raj Hey, look, I found an iPod. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 howard It's smashed beyond repair, what are you going to do with it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 raj What else? Sell it on ebay as slightly used. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard It was Penny's boyfriend's, they broke up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 howard Apparently he posted intimate details of their physical relationship on his blog, which I cannot find anywhere. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard You know what, I'm going to go back and try talking to her again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 howard Good idea. Sit with her, hold her, comfort her, and if the moment feels right, see if you can cop a feel. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard I'm not going to do that, Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon I'm not aware of any social convention that requires you to intervene at all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard What about 'damsel in distress?'
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon Twelfth century code of chivalry, not exactly current. You'd also have to be knighted for that to apply. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard I don't care. She's upset, I'm going over there. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 howard Remember to sit on your hands a bit so they're warm. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard I'm her friend, I'm not going to take advantage of her vulnerability.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 howard What, so you're saying that if in the depths of despair she throws herself at you and demands you take her, right there, right now, you'll just walk away?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard I said I'm her friend. Not her gay friend. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard Hey, listen, I know you said that you didn't want to talk...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny I don't. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard Sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny Wait. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard Wait, did you say wait?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny Tell me the truth. Am I just an idiot who picks giant losers? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard No. No. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny Okay, so I pick good guys, but turn them into losers. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard Of course not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny Well, it's got to be one or the other, which is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard I'm sorry, what were the choices again? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny I really thought Mike was different, I thought he was sensitive and smart. I mean, not you smart, normal non-freaky smart. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard Yeah, no, sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny You know, and then he just goes and has to humiliate me by writing about me on his blog so the entire world can read it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard Actually it's not all that easy to find. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny Yeah, really, well my friends at work found it, my sister found it, judging by my email a number of prisoners at the Michigan State Penitentiary found it. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard Okay, well, what exactly did this guy write, not that I need to know the details of your sex life, I just thought... never mind. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny Nope, you know what, you might as well read it, everybody else has, go ahead. Oh God, I just feel so betrayed and embarrassed. I just want to crawl into a hole and die.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard Okay, well, you know, this isn't that bad. It just paints the picture of a very affectionate woman who's open to expressing her affection in non traditional locales. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny Oh God!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard Elevators, parks, movie theaters, out of curiosity, is this subway the transportation system or subway the sandwich shop? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny Sandwich shop.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard Doesn't that violate the health code?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny No, at the sub shop we were only making out. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard Huh. Okay. But my point is that you have absolutely no reason to be embarrassed. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny Really, do you think I overreacted?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard Maybe a little.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny 'Cause I do that, I do overreact. Maybe I should call Mike and apologize.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard No. No, no, that, that would be underreacting. He did break the implied confidentiality of the bedroom and, in your case, the elevator, parks and fast food franchise.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny Yes. You're right. I should just say I'm done with him. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard Yes, you should, go ahead, say it. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny But I never gave the man a chance to explain. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard What is there to explain, it's all right here, it's a betrayal. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny No, you were right the first time, this is a man who loves me, but in his own stupid way he was just trying to show people how he feels. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard I'm pretty sure I never said that. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny No, you did better than that, you helped me see it on my own. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard Aw, good for me. Where are you going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny I'm going over to Mike's. Leonard, thank you so much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard Oh, sure. Huh, maybe I am her gay friend. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon Howard, I'm going to need another Mandarin lesson. I obviously didn't make my point with those people. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 howard For God's sake, Sheldon, if you don't like the tangerine chicken, don't order the tangerine chicken.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon I like tangerine chicken, I'm not getting tangerine chicken.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard Can we please change the subject.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 raj Sure. Tell us again how you screwed up and got Penny back together with her old boyfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard Just roll the dice. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 raj Enslaved by warlocks, stay here till you roll 2, 4 or 6...7
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard She was mad at him! She was done with him, the relationship was broken beyond repair and I walked over there and I fixed it!
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 howard Boy, that story gets better every time you hear it. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon Actually, I thought the first two renditions were far more compelling. Previously I felt sympathy for the Leonard character, now I just find him to be whiny and annoying. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard Just eat your tangerine chicken. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon I'd love to, but I don't have tangerine chicken. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny Thank you so much for your stupid advice. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 raj Incredible. You managed to screw up the screw-up. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard I'm back. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny I'm sorry I yelled at you. It's not your fault. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard What happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny Well, I went over to Mike's to make up with him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard Yeah, I know, I know that part. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny But he had already moved on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard Already, that was quick.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny That's what I said to the woman who had her legs wrapped around his neck. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard Oh, Penny, I am so sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny How could he do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard Oh, well, you know, you did throw an 8 gig iPod... yeah, no, how could he do that. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny I swear to God, I am done with guys like that. You know, macho, with the perfect body and the hair, and the money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard Yeah, that must get old quick. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny You know, just once, I would like to go out with someone who is nice, and honest, and who actually cares about me. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard What about me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny What about you what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard What about if you went out with me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny Are you asking me out?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard Um... yes... I am... asking you out. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny Wow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard I was just going off your comment about the nice guy...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny No, I know, I got that. Yeah, totally.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard ...thing and honest but, it's no big deal...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny Yes. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard Yes what? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny Yes, I will go out with you. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny Yeah. Why not, I mean, what do I have to lose?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard Yeah. That's the spirit. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon Show me your citrus peels. Gei wo kan, ni jud di zi pei. Show me your citrus peels. Gei wo kan, ni jud di zi pei. Show me your...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny I'm sorry. Look, do you have a second.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon A second what? Pair of underwear? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny I was just wondering if I could talk to you? It's about Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon Why me? Why not Koothrappali or Wolowitz?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny Well, Raj can't talk to me unless he's drunk, and Wolowitz is, you know, disgusting. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon Yes, I suppose he is. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny All I'm saying is, you know Leonard the best. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon Not necessarily. I'm often surprised by my lack of familiarity with Leonard. Just the other day I discovered, he not only has a loofah, he hides it. Why do you suppose a man would be ashamed of having a loofah? I myself prefer to have my excess epithelial cells slough off naturally, but I don't condemn those who seek to accelerate the process. And until recently I had no idea that despite his lactose intolerance, he can tolerate small amounts of non-fat ice cream without producing a noxious gas that I maintain in the right concentration could be weaponized. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny Leonard might come home, can we talk in my apartment. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon We're not done? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon Ach, why not? We're already through the looking glass anyway. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny Okay, so, here's the thing. I guess you're aware that Leonard asked me out. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon Well, he didn't actually say anything, but when he came back to the apartment he was doing a dance that brought to mind the happy hippos in Fantasia. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny Oh, that's nice. Anyhow, the thing I wanted to talk to you about is, you know, since Leonard and I have become friends, I was just... want to sit down? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon Oh, I wish it were that simple. You see, I don't spend much time here and so I've never really chosen a place to sit. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny Well, choose.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon There are a number of options and, I'm really not familiar enough with the cushion densities, air flow patterns and dispersion of sunlight to make an informed choice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny Alright, why don't you just pick one at random, and then if you don't like it you can sit somewhere else next time. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon No, no, that's crazy. You go ahead and talk while I figure it out. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny Okay. Um, here's the thing. So, I've known for a while now that Leonard has had a little crush on me...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon A little crush? Well I suppose so, in the same way Menelaus had a little crush on Helen of Troy. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny Alright, yeah, I don't really know who they are...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon Well Menelaus was the brother of Agamemnon...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny Yeah, I don't care, I don't care. The point is Leonard isn't the kind of guy I usually go out with.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon Leonard isn't the kind of guy anyone usually goes out with. Would you be open to rotating the couch clockwise thirty degrees? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny No. What I'm saying is, Leonard might be different in a good way. Obviously my usual choices have not worked out so well. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon The last one worked out well for Koothrappali. He got a free iPod. Oh, glare! 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny But on the other hand, if things don't go well with Leonard, I risk losing a really good friend. I mean, I guess he's not looking for a fling, he's the kind of guy that gets into a relationship for, I don't know, like you would say light years. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon I would not say that. No-one would say that, a light year is a unit of distance, not time. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny Thank you for the clarification. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon Draft. You see people hear the word year and they think duration. Foot pound has the same problem, that's a unit of work, not of weight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny Right, thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon It's a common mistake.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny Not the first one I've made today. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon Okay. I think this will be my seat. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny Sheldon, do you have anything to say that has anything to do with, you know, what I'm talking about. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon Well, let's see. We might consider Schrodinger's Cat. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny Schrodinger? Is that the woman in 2A?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon No. That's Mrs Grossinger. And she doesn't have a cat, she has a Mexican hairless, annoying little animal, yip yip yip yip...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny Sheldon! 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon Sorry, you diverted me. Anyway, in 1935, Erwin Schrodinger, in an attempt to explain the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics, he proposed an experiment where a cat is placed in a box with a sealed vial of poison that will break open at a random time. Now, since no-one knows when or if the poison has been released, until the box is opened, the cat can be thought of as both alive and dead. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny I'm sorry, I don't get the point. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon Well of course you don't get it, I haven't made it yet. You'd have to be psychic to get it, and there's no such thing as psychic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny Sheldon, what's the point? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon Just like Schrodinger's Cat, your potential relationship with Leonard right now can be thought of as both good and bad. It is only by opening the box that you'll find out which it is. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny Okay, so you're saying I should go out with Leonard. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon No, no, no, no, no, no. Let me start again. In 1935, Erwin Schrodinger...
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard Two seats right there. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon Chong sho sha pwe. Xie xie. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard Sheldon, I think I've made a mistake. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon I can see that. Unless you're planning on running a marathon, choosing both stuffing and mashed potatoes is a starch filled redundancy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard No, it's about Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon A mistake involving Penny? Okay, you'll have to narrow it down. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard I don't think I can go out with her tonight. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon Then don't.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard Other people would say 'why not?' 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon Other people might be interested. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard I'm going to talk anyway.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon I assumed you would. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard Now that I'm actually about to go out with Penny, I'm not excited, I'm nauseous. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon Ah, then your meal choice is appropriate. Starch absorbs fluid which reduces the amount of vomit available for violent expulsion. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard Right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon You also made a common grammatical mistake, you said nauseous when you meant nauseated. But go on. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard Sheldon, this date is probably my one chance with Penny, what happens if I blow it. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon Well, if we accept your premise, and also accept the highly improbable assumption that Penny is the only woman in the world for you then we can logically conclude that the result of blowing it would be that you end up a lonely, bitter old man with no progeny. The image of any number of evil lighthouse keepers from Scooby Doo cartoons comes to mind. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard You're not helping. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon Alright, what response on my part would bring this conversation to a speedy conclusion?
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard Tell me whether or not to go through with the date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon Schrodinger's Cat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard Wow, that's brilliant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon You sound surprised. Mmm, hou zi shui zai li du. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard Hi. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny come on in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard Thank you. You look very nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny Thank you. So do you. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard I made an eight o'clock reservation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny Okay, great, listen, um, maybe we should talk first. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard Oh. Okay. But before you say anything, have you ever heard of Schrodinger's Cat? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny Actually, I've heard far too much about Schrodinger's Cat. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 leonard Good. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 penny Alright, the cat's alive, let's go to dinner. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon Show me your mucus! Your mucus! 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 owner Blow your own nose and go away. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon This is not a tangerine bicycle. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 owner Crazy man. Call the police. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season01.Episode17 sheldon No. Don't call the library. Show me your mucus. Oxen are in my bed! Many, many oxen! Oy Vey!
