TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter So you see, what you’re eating is not technically yoghurt, because it doesn’t have enough live acidophilus cultures. It’s really just iced milk with carragenin added for thickness.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 penny Oh, that’s very interesting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter It’s also not pink and has no berries.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 penny Yeah, but it doesn’t really answer my question.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter What was your question again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 penny Do you want some.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Oh, right, no, I’m lactose intolerant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 penny Right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter So, gas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 penny Got it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Well, good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 penny What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter There was a draft.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 penny I didn’t feel a draft.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Why don’t we just go into your….
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 penny Oh, yeah, you know what, maybe we should just slow things down a little.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter No, no, I didn’t mean to go into your apartment to… go fast.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 penny No, I know, I… I know what you meant, it’s just… it’s only our first date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, okay, sure, no problem, why don’t we just figure out where we’re going, and when we want to get there, and then rate of speed equals distance over time. Solve for R.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 penny Or we could just wing it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter That might work too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 penny Goodnight Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Goodnight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 raj_koothrappali He’s coming. Screen saver.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Oh, hey, Leonard, how was your date?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Bite me. Sheldon, how could you just sit there and let them spy on me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper They were clever, Leonard. They exploited my complete lack of interest in what you were doing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 howard_wolowitz You should thank us. When future generations try to determine why your relationship with Penny crashed and burned, this right here is the black box.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter What are you talking about, the date went fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Dude, she said she wants to slow things down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Okay, so, she said she wants to slow things down. It’s like saying “I’m really enjoying this meal, I’m going to slow down and savour it.”
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 howard_wolowitz No, it’s like “this fish tastes bad, so I’m going to slow down and spit it out.”
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 raj_koothrappali You being the fish.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter I’m not the fish.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Oh really, did you make a second date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Well, we sort of decided to wing it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Oh, even I know that’s lame.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Okay, alright, let’s assume your hypothesis. We went to dinner, we talked, we laughed, we kissed, where could I have possibly gone wrong.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Think back, Leonard, the littlest things can set women off. Like, hey, the waitress is hot, I bet we could get her to come home with us. Or, how much does your mom weigh, I want to know what I’m getting into.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter I didn’t say anything like that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Good, ‘cos they don’t work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 raj_koothrappali They also don’t care for it if you stare at them and hyperventilate. Sadly, that’s my home run swing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Look, everything went fine. I didn’t even have to refer to my impromptu conversation starters. The woman across the hall is into me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Let’s go to the tape. Look at her reaction to the goodnight kiss, no change in respiration, pupils un-dilated, no flushing of the chest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Nice close up, by the way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Interesting, her jaws are clenched, no tongue access, clearly a bad sign amongst mating humans.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter That’s not a bad sign.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Please, you might as well have been two iguana with no dewlap enlargement.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 raj_koothrappali And the worst sign of all is, you’re here and not there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter I’m not there because I’m taking things slow. Which, by the way, compared to you guys approaches warp speed. And take down that camera.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 raj_koothrappali He was a lot more fun when he had no hope.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Give him time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 penny Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Oh, hi Penny. FYI, the hot water is inadequate on machine 2 so colours only, and 4 is still releasing the fabric softener too early in the cycle so I’d avoid using that for your delicates.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 penny Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Oh, good Lord. Why don’t you just take your clothes down to the river and beat them with a rock?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 penny Sheldon, may I ask you a question?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper I would prefer that you not, but I won’t go so far as to forbid it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 penny Alright, I heard yes, so… okay, here’s my question, has Leonard ever dated, you know, a regular girl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Well I assume you’re not referring to digestive regularity? Because I’ve come to learn that such inquiries are inappropriate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 penny No, I meant has he ever been involved with someone who wasn’t a braniac?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Oh. Well, a few years ago he did go out with a woman who had a PhD in French Literature.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 penny How is that not a braniac?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Well, for one thing, she was French. For another, it was literature.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 penny So, do you think that if Leonard and I keep dating he’ll eventually get bored with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper That depends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 penny On what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Do you have a working knowledge of quantum physics?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Do you speak Klingon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Do you know any card tricks?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 penny Okay, okay, you know, I get it, Leonard has no business being involved with a waitress slash actress who felt so insecure that she lied to him about finishing community college.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Why would you lie about that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 penny Well, he was going on and on about this college and that grad school and I didn’t want him to think I was some stupid loser.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper You thought the opposite of stupid loser was community college graduate?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 penny You know, there are a lot of successful people in this country who are community college graduates.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Yeah, but you were neither.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 penny Right, okay look, this is between you and me, you cannot tell Leonard any of this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper You’re asking me to keep a secret?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 penny Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Well I’m sorry, but you would have had to express that desire before revealing the secret, so that I could choose whether or not I wanted to accept the covenant of secret keeping. You can’t impose a secret on an ex post facto basis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Secret keeping is a complicated endeavour. One has to be concerned not only about what one says, but about facial expression, autonomic reflexes, when I try to deceive, I myself have more nervous tics than a lyme disease research facility. It’s a joke. It relies on the hominymic relationship between tick the blood-sucking arachnid, and tic the involuntary muscular contraction. I made it up myself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 penny Okay, look, if Leonard finds out that I lied, I will absolutely die of embarrassment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Physiologically impossible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 penny Oh Sheldon, please, look, I’m asking you as a friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper So you’re saying that friendship contains within it an inherent obligation to maintain confidences?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 penny Well, yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Interesting. See, one more question, and perhaps I should have led with this, when did we become friends?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper I.e, I couldn’t become Green Lantern unless I was chosen by the guardians of Oa, but given enough start-up capital and an adequate research facility, I could be Batman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter You could be Batman?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Sure. I’m Batman. See.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 penny Hi guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Hi Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Hey, Penny, if you’re not doing anything Friday night I thought maybe we could go and see a movie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 penny Oh, um, you know, I think I have the dinner shift on Friday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter What about Saturday?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 penny You know, I’m not sure, the manager hasn’t posted the schedule yet, how about I let you know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Great. So you just let me know when you know. So… Oh God, I am the bad fish! What did I do wrong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Why are you asking me, I have no information about your interactions with Penny other than what you provided me, nor do I have any method of learning such things.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter What does that mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Nothing. You seem to be implying an informational back channel between me and Penny where obviously none exists.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter No I didn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper I just think you need to be careful how you phrase things, sir.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter What’s going on with you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Well I might ask you the same question. Why do you insist on attempting to drag me into matters which have nothing to do with me? But exist between you and Penny. A person to whom I barely speak.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter What’s wrong with your face?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper There’s no reason to bring my looks into this. Good day, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper I said Good Day!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Good day?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 penny Also today we have a fresh caught Alaska salmon, and that’s served with a teriyaki glaze and sticky rice. Our soup of the day…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper You must release me from my oath.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 penny Sheldon, I’m working.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Why don’t you take a minute to decide I can’t keep your secret Penny. I’m going to fold like an energy based anobo protein in conformational space. Like a renaissance triptych. Like a cheap suit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 penny Oh, look, why is it so hard for you to keep one little secret?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper I’m constitutionally incapable. That’s why I was refused clearance for a very prestigious government research fellowship at a secret military supercollider, located beneath a fake agricultural station 12.5 miles south east of Travers City, Michigan. Which you did not hear about from me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 penny Look, just forget I told you about me not graduating from community college. Okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Forget! You want me to forget? This mind does not forget. I haven’t forgotten a single thing since the day my mother stopped breast feeding me. It was a drizzly Tuesday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 penny Okay, look, you promised me you would keep my secret so you’re just going to have to figure out a way to do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Leonard, I’m moving out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter What do you mean, you’re moving out? Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper There doesn’t have to be a reason.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, there kind of does.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Not necessarily. This is a classic example of munchausen’s trilemma. Either the reason is predicated on a series of sub-reasons leading to an infinite regression, or it tracks back to arbitrary axiomatic statements, or it’s ultimately circular, i.e., I’m moving out because I’m moving out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter I’m still confused.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Leonard, I don’t see how I could have made it any simpler.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Hey, qu’est q’wass up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 raj_koothrappali We just got back from that exhibit of those plasticised human cadavers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 howard_wolowitz And some of those skinless chicks were hot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper If you’ll excuse me, I’m going to pack.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 howard_wolowitz That’s kind of an overreaction to a little harmless necrophilia.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter It’s not you, Howard, he says he’s moving out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 raj_koothrappali What did you do? Did you change the contrast or brightness settings on the television?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Did you take a band aid off in front of him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Did you buy generic ketchup, forget to rinse the sink, talk to him through the bathroom door?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Adjust the thermostat, cook with cilantro, pronounce the T in often?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Did you make fun of trains?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter I didn’t do anything, he’s just gone insane.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Well, we all knew this day was coming.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter That was fast.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper It’s my pre-packed disaster evacuation bag. Recommended by the department of homeland security. And Sarah Connor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Where are you gonna live?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Until I find a permanent place I will stay with friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Bye
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Well you can’t stay with me, I have a teeny tiny apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Excuse me, but isn’t hosting guests an aspect of Menushya Yajna, one of the five central religious duties or sacrifices of the Hindu householder?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 raj_koothrappali I hate trains.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Don’t be ridiculous, you love trains.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Yes I do, come on. See you later Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter This could work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper This is a very old building.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Sixty years. Used to be a watch factory.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Uh-oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 raj_koothrappali What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Don’t you worry about the residual radium from the luminous dials?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Not until now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper I can’t believe I didn’t bring my gieger counter. You know, I had it on my bed and I didn’t pack it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Well, if you’re not comfortable staying here, Sheldon…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper I’m kidding, I packed it. It was a joke, I was subverting the conversational expectations. I believe they call that the, um, old switcheroo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Terrific.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Is that woman Aishwarya Rai?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Yes, isn’t she an amazing actress.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Actually, I’d say she’s a poor man’s Madhuri Dixit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 raj_koothrappali How dare you. Aishwarya Rai is a Goddess. By comparison Madhuri Dixit is a leprous prostitute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Sorry, I didn’t mean to offend you. Obviously you’re not that familiar with Indian cinema.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Who is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 Strippergram.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Tag. You’re it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Shouldn’t you have put him in a brown paper bag and set him on fire?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper I’ve never slept on an air mattress before. No lumbar support whatsoever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Maybe you’d be happier on a park bench?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper I don’t see any way to get a park bench in here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Do you want to switch?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper No, that’s fine. I’m perfectly comfortable sleeping on a bouncy castle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Get out of bed, we’re switching.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Now, only if you want to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Just get in the bed!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 debbie_wolowitz What’s going on? Are you boys roughhousing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 howard_wolowitz We’re just talking ma.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 debbie_wolowitz If you don’t settle down right now, I’m not going to let you have any more sleepovers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 howard_wolowitz For God’s sake, ma, I’m 27 years old. It’s not even a school night! Comfy now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Meh. That poster of Halle Berry’s a little unnerving.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 howard_wolowitz So don’t look at it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper She’s like my fourth favourite catwoman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 howard_wolowitz No kidding?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Yeah, Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer, Eartha Kitt and then her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 howard_wolowitz What about Lee Meriwether?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Oh, I forgot about Lee Meriwether.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Well I’m glad that’s settled.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper That makes Halle Berry my fifth favourite catwoman. There’s Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer, Eartha Kitt, Lee Meriwether…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Please, I’m begging you, go to sleep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper I’m trying, I’m counting catwomen. She did make a fine mutant in the X-Men movies though.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Oh for God’s sake.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper But she’s not my favourite of the X-Men, in order that would be Wolverine, Cyclops, oh wait, I forgot Professor X. Professor X, Wolverine, Cyclops, Iceman, then Storm, Angel, the Beast, oh wait, Nightcrawler. Professor X, Nightcrawler, Wolverine, Cyclops, Iceman, then Storm, Angel….
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter I’m coming!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Hey, there he is, there’s my old buddy-bud-bud.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter What’s with him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Koothrappali dumped him on me, and he couldn’t get to sleep, so I gave him a glass of warm milk with a handful of my mom’s valium in it. But he still wouldn’t shut up, so, tag, you’re it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper I’m ba-ack!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter I still don’t know why you left.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper I can’t tell you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Why not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper I promised Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter You promised Penny what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper That I wouldn’t tell you the secret. Shhhhh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter What secret. Tell me the secret.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Mom smokes in the car. Jesus is okay with it, but we can’t tell Dad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Not that secret, the other secret.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper I’m Batman. Shhhhh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Dammit, Sheldon! You said Penny told you a secret, what was the secret.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Okay, I’ll tell you, but you can’t tell Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter I promise.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Penny lied about graduating from community college because she is afraid she’s not smart enough for Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter So it’s nothing I did? It’s her problem?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper I drank milk that tasted funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Penny thinks I’m too smart for her, that’s ridiculous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 sheldon_cooper I know, most of your work is extremely derivative. Don’t worry, that’s not a secret. Everybody knows.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 penny Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, hi, listen, I know what’s been bothering you about us, and I have the answer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 penny What are you talking about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter First I want to say that it’s not Sheldon’s fault, he tried very hard to keep your secret, if Howard hadn’t drugged him he would have taken it to his grave.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 penny He told you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Yes, but it’s okay. Now that we know what the problem is, there’s a simple solution.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 penny Pasadena city college?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter A place for fun, a place for knowledge. See, this man here’s playing hacky sack, and this girl’s going to be a paralegal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 penny Wow, I get it, because Dr Leonard Hofstadter can’t date a girl without a fancy college degree.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Well, it’s really not that fancy, it’s just a city college.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 penny Right, but I have to have some sort of degree to date you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter That doesn’t matter to me at all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 penny So, it’s fine with you if I’m not smart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Absolutely. Okay, this time I know where I went wrong. Oh bite me!
