TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Worst Renaissance Fair ever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Please let it go, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper It was rife with historical inaccuracies. For example, the tavern girl serving flagons of mead, now her costume was obviously Germanic, but in 1487 the Bavarian purity laws or Rhineheitsgebot severely limited the availability of mead. At best they would have had some sort of spiced wine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter You’re nitpicking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Oh-ho! Really? Well here’s another nit for you. The flagons would not have been made of polypropylene.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Renaissance fairs aren’t about historical accuracy. They’re about taking chubby girls who work at Kinko’s and lacing them up in corsets so tight their bosom jumps out and says howdy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Bosoms would not have said howdy in the fifteenth century. If anything they would have said “huzzah!”
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 howard_wolowitz I don’t care what the bosoms say, Sheldon, I just want to be part of the conversation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 penny Hi guys. Looks like you’ve been to the Renaissance fair. I’m hoping.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Renaissance fair? More of a medieval slash age of enlightenment slash any excuse to wear a codpiece fair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 penny Okay, fine, whatever, um, you guys, this is my friend Eric.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 eric Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter So, yeah, good to see you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 penny Yeah, yeah, it’s good to see you too. We should really go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 eric Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 penny Bye guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 eric Like your hat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Thanks, my mom made it. Penny with a new guy, tres awkward.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter It wasn’t awkward. It wasn’t fun. Besides, what’s the big deal, we dated, we stopped dating, and now we’re both moving on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 raj_koothrappali By moving on, do you mean, she’s going out with other men and you spent the afternoon making fifteenth century soap with Wolowitz?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper That was not fifteenth century soap, my God those people need to learn you can’t just put “ye olde” in front of anything and expect to get away with it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Can we please just go in, my chain mail is stuck in my underwear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper You’re wearing modern underwear?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Relatively modern. Why, what are you wearing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I fashioned historically accurate undergarments out of linen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter You went out and bought linen?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Don’t be silly, I borrowed one of your pillow cases.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Borrowed?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter You know what, I’m happy that Penny’s moving on. It gives me the freedom to move on myself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Are you saying that you’ve been holding back?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Of course. Out of respect.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 howard_wolowitz So, how do you explain the ten years before Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Who were you respecting then?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter What? I’ve dated plenty of women. There was Joyce Kim, Leslie Winkle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Notify the editors of the Oxford English Dictionary, the word plenty has been redefined to mean two.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Uh, what about that girl last year at Comic-con?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Doesn’t count.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 raj_koothrappali What happens in costume at Comic-con, stays at Comic-con.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 howard_wolowitz You’re only saying that because of what happened to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter What happened to you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 raj_koothrappali N-n-n-nothing happened to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 howard_wolowitz It wasn’t your fault, Raj, he was dressed as a green Orion slave girl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 raj_koothrappali H-h-h-how did we get on me, we were mocking Leonard for not moving on. Dude, you have totally not moved on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Yes I have, it’s just a matter of actually making a date with someone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Like who?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Well, there’s Joyce Kim, but she defected back to North Korea so it’s a little geographically undesireable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 raj_koothrappali What about Leslie Winkle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Oh no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Her research methodology is sloppy, she’s unjustifiably arrogant about loop quantum gravity, and to make matters worse she’s often mean to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 raj_koothrappali I think she’s smoking hot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 howard_wolowitz I’d hit that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper You’d hit particulate soil on a colloidal suspension. Mud.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Look, I like Leslie, but she’s not interested in dating as much as using men as tools for stress release.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Yeah, so, be a tool. Go get yourself a little rebound stress release.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Technically it would only be rebound if he and Penny had actually engaged in physical intimacy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 howard_wolowitz You mean like you and Richard the slave girl?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 raj_koothrappali I bought him dinner and we kissed once, that was it. And he told me his name was Kimberley!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper You know how I know we’re not in The Matrix?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter How?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper If we were, the food would be better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leslie_winkle Hey, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Hey, Leslie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leslie_winkle Hey, dummy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Hello to you, insufficiently intelligent person.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leslie_winkle Ooh, rush me to the burn unit. Hey, Leonard, do you have a second, I need to ask you something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Uh, sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Well, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to go do work that promises significant results, as opposed to what you do, which does not. Yeah, you heard me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leslie_winkle Wow. So, I heard your relationship with Penny crashed to the ground like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Where did you hear that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leslie_winkle Actually I read it. Wolowitz texted me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory. Yep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leslie_winkle I thought it was a pretty good one, I gave him an L-O-L. Anyway, it got me thinking, now that you’re unattached maybe we can revisit our previous attachment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Are you suggesting another bout of stress release.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leslie_winkle No, I’m all done with casual sex. From now on I’m fully committed to the traditional relationship paradigm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Really, what changed?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leslie_winkle It’s hard to say, I guess there’s just a time in every woman’s life when she gets tired of waking up on a strange futon with a bunch of people she doesn’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I can see how that would… a bunch of people?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leslie_winkle Anyway, I just figure it’s time to slow things down and who better to slow things down with than you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Oh, I’m flattered. So, how do you suggest we proceed?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leslie_winkle Your place, we’ll order Chinese, you’ll rent a movie, artsy but accessible, then light petting, no coitus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Sounds fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leslie_winkle I’ll leave the details up to you, I think it’s better if you assume the male role.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Thank you, that’s very thoughtful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leslie_winkle Great. Call me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Great news. My mom sent me my old Nintendo 64.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Terrific.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper You know what this means, don’t you? Break out the Red Bull, it’s time to rock Mario old school.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter I kind of have other plans tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper But it’s Friday. Friday’s always vintage game night. Look, mom included the memory card, we can pick up where I left off in 1999 when I had pernicious anaemia.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Well, the thing is, someone’s coming over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Well then, no problem, I have three controllers, the more the merrier.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, it’s a date, I have a date coming over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Oh, well you can’t blame me for not jumping to that conclusion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Why, what’s so unusual about me having a date?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Well, statistically speaking…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Alright, alright. Well, uh, nevertheless, I have one now and I would appreciate it if you would, you know, make yourself scarce.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Leonard, I am a published theoretical physicist with two doctorates and an IQ which can’t be accurately measured by normal tests, how much scarcer could I be?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter You know what I mean, could you just give us a little privacy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper You want me to leave the apartment?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper You mean just go someplace else and be… someplace else?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Well, why should I leave, this is my apartment too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter I know it is, and if science ever discovers a second member of your species and you two would like some privacy I would be more than happy to get out of your way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Well alright then.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 penny Sheldon? What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Playing Super Mario on a poorly coded Nintendo 64 emulator.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 penny Yeah, but why are you doing it on the stairs?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I’m a modern day Napoleon exiled to the Elba of the staircase because Leonard, get this, has a date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 penny Oh. Oh, well, good for him. Yeah but, why are you sitting here, why don’t you just go to a movie or something?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Alone?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 penny Yeah, why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper What if I choke on my popcorn, who will administer the Heimlich manoeuvre.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 penny Well then don’t order popcorn.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper No popcorn at the mo… listen to yourself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 penny Well why don’t you go to a coffee shop.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I don’t drink coffee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 penny They have other things.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper What do they have?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 penny I don’t know, you know, cookies, pastries…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Pastries such as bearclaws?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 penny Yeah, sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I don’t like bearclaws.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leslie_winkle Heya Penny. Dumbass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Leslie Winkle. Of all the overrated physicists in all the labs in all the world, why does it have to be Leslie Winkle?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 penny Well, they have a lot in common. I mean they’re both scientists.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Oh please. The only way she could make a contribution to science would be if they resume sending chimps into space.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 penny Okay, well I have a date too, so see ya.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Everybody has a date. Even you, Mario, going after Princess Peach. And what am I doing, I’m just enabling you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leslie_winkle This is pretty good Orange Chicken.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, it’s from Changs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leslie_winkle Not Chows?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter No, Changs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leslie_winkle What happened to Chows?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter It changed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leslie_winkle Oh. So, how many children do you think we should have? I’m sorry, that was a little abrupt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter A little.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leslie_winkle I mean there are so many things to talk about before we discuss reproduction.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter I sure hope so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leslie_winkle Besides shortness, what genetic weaknesses run in your family?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I’m sorry to interrupt, batteries dying continue.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leslie_winkle Uh, genetic weaknesses, right, um, there’s the lactose intolerance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Don’t forget the male pattern baldness. When his uncles sit around the dinner table they look like a half carton of eggs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Okay, now my uncles are bald, but my Aunt Edna is one of the hairiest women you will ever meet. So… Sweet lady. It always tickles when she hugs me. What now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I have to make pee-pee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Listen, I’m sorry about all of Sheldon’s interruptions, he can be a bit of an eccentric.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leslie_winkle If by eccentric you mean passive-aggressive East Texas blowhole, I agree.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Well, I think tonight was a very good start.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leslie_winkle Me too. You’re sure you’re okay postponing intercourse until our relationship is past the initial viability test?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter No problem, I’m very skilled at postponing intercourse. So I guess I’ll call you and we’ll arrange another evening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leslie_winkle Yes. I believe protocol dictates that you wait a minimum of 18 hours before you call so I’m not repulsed by your cloying eagerness.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leslie_winkle Again, it’s your decision, you’re the man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 penny No, it wasn’t my cat, it was an experiment designed by this guy named Schrodinger.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 eric From the Charlie Brown cartoons?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 penny No, he was some kind of scientist, let me start again. Oh, hey Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 penny Leslie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leslie_winkle Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Okay, well, goodnight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 penny Okay, well, goodnight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leslie_winkle That ain’t going to make your point. Okay, that’s enough. Call me
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Right
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 penny Okay, goodnight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 eric What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 penny Had a great time, ciao
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I’m sorry, I am not going back to the Renaissance Fair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Come on, Sheldon, there’s so few places I can wear my jester costume.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I don’t care. There are far too many historical anomalies for my comfort.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Oh, okay, how about this. You can go dressed as a Star Trek science officer exploring a planet similar to Earth in the 1500s.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper You mean like Spock?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Fascinating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leslie_winkle Hey fellow scientists. Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Hey, why don’t we all move over there so Leslie can join us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Hmm, let’s do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper If you’re having trouble deciding where to sit may I suggest one potato two potato, or as I call it the Leslie Winkle experimental methodology.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Don’t make this hard for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper It’s not hard. It’s simple. You can either sit with me, your friend, colleague and roommate, or you can sit with an overrated scientist you might have sex with.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter You’re right, it is simple.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 penny Hey, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 penny Third floor tonight. Mixing it up? Oh. You know, I still don’t understand why you just don’t go to dinner or something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Alright, let’s say I go to dinner alone. And during the meal I have to use the rest room. How do I know someone’s not touching my food?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 penny Goodnight Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Penny, hold on. Are you sure things can’t work out with you and Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 penny Excuse me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I’m just wondering if you really gave it the old college try? Or in your case the old community college try?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 penny Okay, where is this coming from?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Leonard is upstairs right now with my arch enemy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 penny Your arch enemy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Yes, the Doctor Doom to my Mr Fantastic. The Doctor Octopus to my Spiderman. The Doctor Sivana to my Captain Marvel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 penny Okay, I get it, I get it, I get it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Do you know, it’s amazing how many supervillains have advanced degrees. Graduate school should probably do a better job of screening those people out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 penny Sheldon, come back, you’re losing me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Leslie Winkle, Penny. She belittles my research.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 penny Oh, sweetie, I’m sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper She called me dumbass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 penny I know. I heard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Given this situation, I have no choice but to withdraw my previous objections to your ill considered relationship with Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 penny Oh, gee, well, thankyou for that. But, um, I think for now Leonard and I are just going to stay friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper No, that response is unacceptable to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 penny Sheldon, you are a smart guy, you must know…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Smart? I’d have to lose 60 IQ points to be classified as smart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 penny Are you going to let me talk?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I’m sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 penny You must know that if Leonard and Leslie want to be together, nothing you can do is going to stop it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper You continue to underestimate my abilities madam.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 penny Okay, let me put it this way, if you’re really Leonard’s friend you will support him no matter who he wants to be with.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Wait a minute, why am I doing all the giving here? If Leonard’s really my friend, why doesn’t he have to support me in my hatred of Leslie Winkle?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 penny Because love trumps hate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Oh now you’re just making stuff up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 penny Okay. Goodnight Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Oh Mario. If only I could control everyone the way I control you. Hop, you little plumber, hop, hop, hop.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper When the two of you reach a natural stopping point I’d like to have a word.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter If the word is pee-pee, just do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Leonard, you are my friend. And friends support their friends, apparently. So I am withdrawing my objection to your desire to have a relationship with Leslie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I will graciously overlook the fact that she is an arrogant sub-par scientist, who actually believes loop quantum gravity better unites quantum mechanics with general relativity than does string theory. You kids have fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leslie_winkle Hang on a second. Loop quantum gravity clearly offers more testable predictions than string theory.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I’m listening, amuse me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leslie_winkle Okay, well, for one thing we expect quantii space-time to manifest itself as minute differences in the speed of light for different colours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Balderdash. Matter clearly consists of tiny strings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leslie_winkle Are you going to let him talk to me like that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Okay, well, there is a lot of merit to both theories.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leslie_winkle No there isn’t, only loop quantum gravity calculates the entropy of black holes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, don’t make that noise, it’s disrespectful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I hope so, it was a snort of derision.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leslie_winkle You agree with me, right, loop quantum gravity is the future of physics.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Sorry Leslie, I guess I prefer my space stringy not loopy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leslie_winkle Well, I’m glad I found out the truth about you before this went any further.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Truth, what truth? We’re talking about untested hypotheses, uh, it’s no big deal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leslie_winkle Oh, it isn’t, really? Tell me Leonard, how would we raise the children?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter I guess we let them wait until they’re old enough and let them choose their own theory.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leslie_winkle We can’t let them choose, Leonard, they’re children.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Wait, where are you going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leslie_winkle I’m sorry, I could have accepted our kids being genetically unable to eat ice-cream or ever get a good view of a parade, but this? This is a deal breaker.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Look on the bright side.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter What’s the bright side?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Only nine more months to comic-con.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Oh yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Captain, I’m getting an unusual reading.
