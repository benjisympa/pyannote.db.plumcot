TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Fellow warriors, this is Sheldor the Conqueror. We are about to enter Axel’s fortress. Now this is a long run, so let’s do another bladder check. Alright Barry, we’ll wait for you again, but you really should see a doctor. Sheldor is AFK. Penny, are you experiencing some sort of difficulty?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Yes, I can’t get my stupid door open.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper You appear to have put your car key in the door lock, are you aware of that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Yeah!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Alright then.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Would it be possible for you to do this a little more quietly?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny I can’t get the damned key out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Well that’s not surprising. That Baldwin lock on your door uses traditional edge mounted cylinders, whereas the key for your Volkswagon uses a centre cylinder system.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Thankyou, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper You’re welcome. Point of inquiry, why did you put your car key in the door lock?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Why? I’ll tell you why. Because today I had an audition, it took me two hours to get there, I waited an hour for my turn, and before I could even start they told me I looked too Midwest for the part. Too Midwest? What the hell does that even mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Well, the American Midwest was mostly settled by Scandinavian and Germanic peoples who, well they have a characteristic facial bone structure….
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny I know what it means, Sheldon! God, you know, I have been in L.A. for almost two years now, and I haven’t got a single acting job, I have accomplished nothing, haven’t gotten a raise at work, haven’t even had sex in six months, and just now when I was walking up those stairs a fly flew in my mouth and I ate it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Well, actually, insects are a dietary staple in many cultures, they’re almost pure protein.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Oh, sonofabitch!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper I believe the condensation on your frozen foods weakened the structural integrity of the bag. But returning to your key conundrum, perhaps you should call a locksmith and have him open the door for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny I did, and he said he’ll get here when he gets here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper And you’re frustrated because he phrased his reply in the form of a meaningless tautology?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny No! I am frustrated because I am a failure at everything and my breath smells like fly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper There there. Would you prefer to wait in our apartment?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny No Sheldon, I’d rather sit on this freezing cold floor sobbing like a three year-old.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Alright then.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny For God’s sake!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Just when I think I’ve gotten the hang of sarcasm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Make yourself comfortable. Not there. Sheldor is back online.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Sheldor?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper The Conqueror.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper AFK. I’m playing Age of Conan, an online multiplayer game set in the universe of Robert E. Howard’s Conan the Barbarian.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Sheldor, back online.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny What’s AFK?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper AFK. Away from keyboard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny OIC.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper What does that stand for?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Oh, I see?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Yes, but what does it stand for?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Now just click on the enchanted boots to put them on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Oh, I don’t know. Can I see them in another colour?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Just click on them. Congratulations, you are now a level three warrior.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Leonard, guess what, I’m a level three warrior.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Great, you know there are groceries outside of your apartment?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Yeah yeah yeah, shhh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter I only bring it up because your ice-cream is melting and it’s starting to attract wildlife.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Uh-huh, yeah, do I stay in the jungle or go towards the beach?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper It doesn’t matter, right now you’re looking for treasure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Okay. Wait, wait, where are you going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper You’re okay, if you run into crocodiles just kick them with your boots.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Want to catch me up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Well let’s see, uh, she attempted to open her apartment with her car key, because her face is overly Midwestern, um, she hasn’t had sex in six months, and she ate a fly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Uh-huh. Seriously, six months?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Oh my God, a treasure chest, I’m rich!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Level three and she thinks she’s rich! What a noob.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Okay, we’re all set.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Let her rip.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Hi!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Hey, check it out, it’s just corn starch and water.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper They make up a non-Newtonian fluid which is liquid, but solid under the percussive action of the speaker.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 howard_wolowitz That’s what makes it get all funky.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Yeah, okay. Listen, I need to talk to Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 howard_wolowitz No, that’s what she said, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Okay, look, I bought the game, and I’ve been exploring the Island of Tordage but I can’t figure out how to get past the guard captain.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Do you have the enchanted sword?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny No, no, I’ve a bronze dagger.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper You can’t slay the guard captain with a bronze dagger, my Lord it’s like the car key in your apartment door all over again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Alright, alright, how do I get the sword?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Well, have you been to the Temple of Mithra?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Is that the place on the hill with the weird priests in front of it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper No, no, no, it’s… oh for God’s sakes, gimme.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Thank you, I really appreciate this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper You’re going to have to learn to do these things for yourself, Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Don’t patronise me, just get the sword.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 howard_wolowitz What the frak?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Beats me. They were playing all last night too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 raj_koothrappali It’s like some kind of weird comic book crossover.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Like if Hulk were dating Peppermint Patty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 raj_koothrappali I always thought Peppermint Patty was a lesbian?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter No, that’s Marcie. Peppermint Patty’s just athletic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper There you go, one enchanted sword.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Right, gimme, gimme, gimme, I want to kill the guard captain. .
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper That girl needs to get a life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Sheldon. Shel-don.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Danger, danger.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny No danger, look, it’s just me, Penny, look, I got to level 25 and reached Purple Lotus Swamp, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper You’re in my bedroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Yeah. Leonard gave me an emergency key.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper People can’t be in my bedroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Okay, well can we go talk in the living room?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper I’m not wearing pyjama bottoms.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper I spilled grape juice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Well, wear different pyjamas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper I can’t wear different pyjamas, these are my Monday pyjamas. Penny, people cannot be in my bedroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Okay, just tell me, is it too soon to join a quest to the Black Castle?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper You were invited on a quest to the Black Castle?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Yeah, yeah, by some guys in Budapest, I’m just not sure it’s the right move for my character.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Of course it’s not, you’re only a level 25, the Hungarians are just using you for dragon fodder.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Really? Boy, you’d think you could trust a horde of Hungarian barbarians.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Please Penny, enough, I have to sleep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Okay, well you were great, thanks. Oh, hey Leonard, listen, don’t got in Sheldon’s room, he’s not wearing bottoms.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, you want to catch me up again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 dr_eric_gablehauser People, I am very busy today.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper I realise that Dr Gablehauser but it is your job, as head of the department, to mediate all inter-departmental disputes. University policy manual chapter four, subsection two, mediation of inter-departmental disputes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 dr_eric_gablehauser Fine. Dr Winkle, what colourful name did you call Dr Cooper this time?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leslie_winkle Dr Dumbass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 dr_eric_gablehauser Dr Cooper, Dr Winkle apologises.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper No she doesn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leslie_winkle No I don’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Here’s the problem. I was clearly signed up to use the mainframe in Buckman 204, and Dr Winkle just wantonly ripped the sign-up sheet off the wall.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leslie_winkle It wasn’t even an official sign-up sheet. He printed it himself and he put his name down in every slot for the next six months.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper If it is a crime to ensure that the universities resources are not being squandered chasing sub-atomic wild geese then I plead guilty. Oh, Penny!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 dr_eric_gablehauser You need to get that Dr Cooper?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper God, no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leslie_winkle Well don’t turn it off, you might miss your call from the Nobel committee letting you know you’ve been nominated as dumbass laureate of the year.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Oh yeah, well, you wouldn’t even be nominated. Dr Gablehauser, I have a series of important multi-bit calculations and simulations to run. All she’s doing is reducing irrelevant data and making a mock…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 dr_eric_gablehauser Excuse me. Gablehauser. It’s for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Hello. Penny, this is not a good time. No, I told you, you’re not prepared for the Sanctum of Burning Souls. You need to be in a group of at least five for that quest, and one should be a level 35 healer. Penny, I can’t log on and help you. We’ll talk when I get home. I’m not getting the computing time, am I?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leslie_winkle Dumbass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Leonard, you have to do something about Penny. She is interfering with my sleep, she’s interfering with my work, and if I had another significant aspect of my life, I’m sure she’d be interfering with that too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Why should I do something, you’re the one who introduced her to online gaming.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Well, yes, but you’re the one who said hello to her when she moved in. If you’d simply restrained yourself none of this would be happening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Why don’t you just tell her to leave you alone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper I did. I told her, I texted her, I sent out a very emphatic twitter. I even changed my facebook status to Sheldon Cooper wishes Penny would leave him alone. I don’t know what else to do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Well, what am I supposed to do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper I don’t know, but if you don’t figure something out, I warn you I shall become very difficult to live with.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter You mean, up until now we’ve been experiencing the happy funtime Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter I’ll go talk to her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny No, Fritz, I need you on my flank. No, I don’t know German. Flankenzie, flankenzie!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Hey Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Busy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I see that. Shouldn’t you be at work?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny I don’t work on Mondays.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter It’s Thursday. Listen, Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Uh, Queen Penelope AFK. What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Okay, um, here’s the thing, um, sometimes people, good people, you know, they start playing these games and they find themselves through no fault of their own, you know, kind of, addicted.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Yeah, get to the point, I’m about to level up here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Well, i-i-i-it’s just if a person doesn’t have a sense of achievement in their real life it’s easy to lose themselves in a virtual world where they get a false sense of accomplishment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Yeah, jabber jabber jabber, okay boys, Queen Penelope’s back online.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Penny, you’ve got cheetos in your hair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Oh, thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Wow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 warrior#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 Hey Penny, it’s me again, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Leonard, I said not now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I know, I’m just a little concerned about you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny I said not now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Okay, maybe later.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Hey guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 howard_wolowitz@leonard_hofstadter Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Hey, what’s with him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Penny’s been keeping him up at night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Me too. But probably in a different way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter She’s gotten really hooked on Age of Conan, she’s playing non-stop.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Ah, yes, online gaming addiction. There’s nothing worse than having that multi-player monkey on your back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, wake up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Danger, danger.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leslie_winkle Afternoon men. Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Oh yeah, well your attempt at juvenilizing me by excluding me from the set of adult males…. oh, I’m too tired to do this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leslie_winkle Right, I heard you’ve been pulling all nighters with middle-earth Barbie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper She comes into my room. No-one’s supposed to be in my room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leslie_winkle Well, I would postulate that she’s escaping into the online world to compensate for her sexual frustration.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 howard_wolowitz I do that too. But probably in a different way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter That’s not what she’s doing, Leslie, she’s just trying to shore up her self esteem, it has nothing to do with sex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leslie_winkle Everything has to do with sex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Mmmm, testify.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leslie_winkle I’m not touching that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Leslie, you are way off base here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Hang on, Leonard, while I have no respect for Leslie as a scientist, or a human being for that matter, we have to concede her undeniable expertise in the interrelated fields of promiscuity and general sluttiness.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leslie_winkle Thank you. My point is that Tinkerbell just needs to get her some.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Some what? Oh, yes, some sexual intercourse.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 howard_wolowitz I’ll take the bullet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Excuse me, this whole idea is insane.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Yeah, yeah, enough debate, I’m going to take action. Excuse me, are you currently involved in a sexual relationship?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Would you like to be?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 Uh, sure, why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Zip it pip it. Can I have your phone number?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 Uh… Yeah, yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper There, problem solved.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leslie_winkle Dumbass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Okay, I’m at the gate to the Treasury of the Ancients, I’m going in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Stay close to the wall. Avoid the mummies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Got it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper I must say, you’re playing very well for a woman of 23?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny 22.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Right. 22.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Oh, here come the mummies, which spell do I use? The hateful strike, or the frenzy stance?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper What happened to the rest of your group?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny I dumped them, they’re a bunch of wussies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Frenzy stance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper So listen, would you describe your ideal vacation as a wild adventure to unknown lands, or staying at home curled up with a good book?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper These are market research questions. I’m filling out the online registration for your game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Oh, okay, wild adventure. Oh, frenzy stance isn’t working, die you undead mummy, die!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Drink a healing potion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper You’re welcome. Anyhow, on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being always initiated by him, and 5 being always initiated by you, how do you prefer your sexual encounters to begin?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny That’s on the registration?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Oh yes, it’s quite extensive. But if we complete it, we get a free expansion pack, 75 additional quests.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Ooh, awesome, okay, I totally like to initiate I’m a big old five.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Good to know. Big old five.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Leonard, this is Tom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Hi Tom. Sheldon? Didn’t I explain to you about your little mistake in the cafeteria?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Yes, you were very clear, as was everyone else at the table. Tom, however, has been chosen by science as a suitable mate for Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Chosen by science?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Well, what passes for science on dating sites. They claim to use heuristic algorithms, but it may well be hokum.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter You got Penny to sign up for online dating?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper No, of course not. No, I used trickery and deceit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter This is bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Tom is a paramedic with the fire department, but he’s going to med school at night, uh, he likes the outdoors, and, uh, strong women who initiate sex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Really, really bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper I’m surprised you struck out with Penny. Apparently she’s a big old five.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Sheldon, what do you want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Oh, good, you got my note. Penny, I’d like you to meet Tom, uh, Penny, this is Tom, Tom, may I present Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 tom Hi Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Yeah, Hi, listen, as long as I’m here, I’m on a quest with a bunch of noobs, they don’t know what they’re doing, we’ve got one assassin, three spellcasters and no tank.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Can we talk about this later.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny No, no, no, no, I need you now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 sheldon_cooper But wouldn’t you prefer to socialise with Tom, who is a sexually passive outdoorsman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 penny Whatever, I’ll figure it out myself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode03 tom Bye, Penny. I’m sorry, dude.
