TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Let’s see, Raj was the Kung Palo Chicken.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 penny I’m the dumplings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Yes, you are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 penny Creepy, Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Creepy good or creepy bad?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Who was the Shrimp with Lobster Sauce?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 howard_wolowitz That would be me. Come to Poppa, you un-kosher delight. I’m not necessarily talking to the food.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 penny Sit over there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Sit over there. Baby wipe?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 penny What do you have….
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 howard_wolowitz@leonard_hofstadter Don’t! Don’t! Don’t!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper I’ll tell you why.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 howard_wolowitz@leonard_hofstadter O-o-o-oh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper I had to sanitize my hands because the university replaced the paper towels in the rest rooms with hot air blowers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 penny I thought the blowers were more sanitary?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 howard_wolowitz@leonard_hofstadter Why? Don’t!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Hot air blowers are incubators and spewers of bacteria and pestilence. Frankly it would be more hygienic if they just had a plague infested gibbon sneeze my hands dry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Hey guys, I just got the most amazing new… ew-ew-ew
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 penny Gosh, Raj, do you think you’ll ever be able to talk in front of me without being drunk? Okay, well, I’ll just, um, go eat by myself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Penny, you don’t have to do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 penny No, it’s okay, between him not talking, him talking and… him, I’m better off alone, so, goodbye you poor strange little man
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali She’s so considerate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 howard_wolowitz So what’s your news?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Remember that little planetary object I spotted beyond the Kuiper belt?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Oh yeah, two zero zero eight NQ sub seventeen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Or as I called it, Planet Bollywood. Anyway, because of my discovery, People magazine is naming me one of their thirty under-30 to watch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 howard_wolowitz@leonard_hofstadter Well, wow, that’s incredible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Excuse me. Thirty what, under thirty what, to watch what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Thirty visionaries under thirty years of age to watch as they challenge the preconceptions of their fields.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper If I had a million guesses I never would have gotten that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali It’s pretty cool, they’ve got me in with a guy who’s doing something about hunger in Indonesia, and a psychotherapist who’s using dolphins to rehabilitate prisoners, and Ellen Page, star of the charming independent film Juno.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Oh, I’d so do her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter You’d do the dolphins.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Do I get an honourable mention for designing the telescope camera mounting bracket you used.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Sorry, it’s not part of my heartwarming and personal narrative, in which a humble boy from New Delhi overcame poverty and prejudice and journeyed to America to reach for the stars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Poverty? Your father’s a gynaecologist, he drives a Bentley.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali It’s a lease.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper I’m confused. Was there some sort of peer review committee to determine which scientists would be included?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Peer review? It’s People magazine. People picked me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper What people?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali The people from People.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Yeah, but exactly who are these people? What are their credentials, how are they qualified, what makes accidentally noticing a hunk of rock that’s been traipsing around the solar system for billions of years more noteworthy than any other scientific accomplishment made by someone under thirty?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Boy, I bet Ellen Pages friends aren’t giving her this kind of crap.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Are you proud of yourself?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper In general, yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Oh, there’s my missing neutrino. You were hiding from me as an unbalanced charge, weren’t you, you little subatomic Dickens?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Hi Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Here, look, look, I found my missing neutrino.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Oh, good, we can take it off the milk cartons.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Well, we’re going to go apologise to Raj and invite him out to dinner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Apologise, for what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Well, he came over last night with some pretty good news, and we weren’t very supportive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper I sense you’re trying to tell me something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 howard_wolowitz You were a colossal ass-hat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Oh! No, I beg to differ. Of the three of us, I was by far the most supportive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Really, do tell.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper How will Raj ever reach true greatness if his friends lower the bar for him? When I was eleven, my sister bought our father a “world’s greatest dad” coffee mug, and frankly the man coasted until the day he died.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Okay, let’s try it this way, what if the People magazine thing is the best Raj is ever going to achieve?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper I had not considered that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Come on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper I often forget other people have limitations. It’s so sad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 howard_wolowitz He can feel sadness?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Not really, it’s what you and I would call condescension.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter And when we go in there, let’s show Raj that we’re happy for him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper But I’m not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Well then fake it. Look at me, I could be grinding on the fact that without my stabilizing telescope mount he never would have found that stupid little clump of cosmic schmutz, but I’m bigger than that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Fine, what do you want me to do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Smile.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Oh crap, that’s terrifying.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter We’re here to see Koothrappali, not kill Batman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Try less teeth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Close enough, come on. Hi Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Hey guys, what’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 howard_wolowitz We just wanted to invite you out to dinner tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Celebrate your thirty under thirty thing. Right Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali It’s very nice of you, I would like that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 dr_eric_gablehauser Hello boys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Dr Gablehouser.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 dr_eric_gablehauser Dr Koothrappali.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Dr Gablehauser.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 dr_eric_gablehauser Dr Hoffstadter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Dr Gablehauser.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 dr_eric_gablehauser Dr Cooper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Dr Gablehauser.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 dr_eric_gablehauser Mister Wolowitz. Boys, I’ve got a question for you. Who in this room discovered a star?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Actually, 2008 NQ sub 17 is a planetary body.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 dr_eric_gablehauser I’m not talking about you, I’m talking about me. You, my exotic young friend are my star.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Well, you didn’t discover him, you merely noticed he was here, much like he did with 2008 NQ sub 17.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Oh, sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 dr_eric_gablehauser Well, we’ve got to get you into a better office, something more suited to your status.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Really, you don’t have to go to any trouble.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 dr_eric_gablehauser How about if I put you in Von Gerlick’s old office?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali I’d rather have Fishbine’s, it’s bigger.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 dr_eric_gablehauser Done.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Wait a minute, I called dibs on Fishbine’s office the day he started showing up at work in his bathrobe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper He gets a new office, I can’t even get paper towels in the men’s room?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Damn, this is hard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 dr_eric_gablehauser Let me ask you something, what do you think the business of this place is?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Science?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 dr_eric_gablehauser Money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Told you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 dr_eric_gablehauser And this boy’s picture in People magazine is going to raise us a pile of money taller than… well, taller than you
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 howard_wolowitz I have a master’s degree.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 dr_eric_gablehauser Who doesn’t? Dr Koothrappali, have you ever had lunch in the President’s dining room?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali I didn’t even know there was a President’s dining room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 dr_eric_gablehauser It’s the same food as the Cafeteria, only fresh. Come on little buddy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Okay, big buddy. See you tonight guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter You can stop smiling now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Aaaah!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali So anyway, after a fantastic lunch I was whisked off to the People magazine photo shoot… have any of you boys ever been to a photo shoot?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali It’s fantastic, apparently the camera loves me and I it. They shot me in front of a starry background where I posed like this. They’re going to digitally add a supernova, they say it’s the perfect metaphor for my incandescent talent.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Right, a ball of hot flaming gas that collapses in on itself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Excuse me. Oh, it’s my assistant Trevor. Go for Koothrappali. Uh-huh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 howard_wolowitz They gave him an assistant? If I want a new pen I have to go to the bank with wire cutters.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Have we at this point met our social obligations?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Not yet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Okay, just put it on my calendar but start thinking of a reason why I can’t go, alrighty? Koothrappali out. God bless that boy, I don’t know what I’d do without him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter You just got him this afternoon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Yes, but I’m finding that having a lackey suits me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter A lackey?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Oh, I’m sorry, is that politically incorrect? In India we just call them untouchables.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Almost.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Speaking of untouchables, I’ve got great news for you guys. People magazine is having a reception this Saturday, and I managed to get you invited.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Oh, gee, thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Oh, you’re welcome. Of course, I couldn’t get you into the VIP section, because, you know, that’s for VIPs, and you guys are just, you know, Ps.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper There’s a tribe in Papua New Guinea where, when a hunter flaunts his success to the rest of the village they kill him, and drive away evil spirits with a drum made of his skin. Superstitious nonsense of course, but one can see their point.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 penny Here you go, Raj, you might want to drink this one slowly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Okay, so, Saturday night, can I count on my posse?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Gee, I’d love to Raj, but I can’t make it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Oh, okay, Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Well, uh, no I… the… no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper I can make it, but I won’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 penny What are you guys talking about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Well, there’s a reception for my magazine article on Saturday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 penny And you guys aren’t going? I can’t believe you, Raj is celebrating a tremendous accomplishment and you’re not even going to be there to support him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper A tremendous accomplishment would be if the planetary body he discovered were plummeting toward Earth and he exploded it with his mind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 howard_wolowitz That would be cool. I’d go to that reception.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 penny Come on, this is huge, Raj is going to be in People magazine. And he didn’t even have to knock up one of the Spears sisters.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Would you like to go with me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 penny Of course I would, I would be honoured.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Really? Cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 penny Shame on you guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Look at that. I got a date with Penny. I can’t believe it took you a whole year.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Hey, buddy. I’m going to be in people magazine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 charlie_sheen Yeah, call me when you’re on the cover.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 penny Oh, Raj, look at you!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali I know, I am resplendent like the noonday sun, am I not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 penny Um, yeah, starting with the champagne a little early aren’t you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali It was in the limo. They sent a limo. I have a limo. I just love saying limo. Here, sip on this while you’re getting ready.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 penny Oh, I’m ready.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali That’s what you’re wearing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 penny Um, yeah, why what’s wrong with it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Nothing, I was just hoping for something a little more, you know, redonkulous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 penny Yeah, well, this is all the donkulous you’re gonna get.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Okey dokey, let’s roll. Alright, it’s time to raise the roof. Oo-ooh, oo-ooh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 penny Hey Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Dude.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter You look very nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 penny@raj_koothrappali Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 penny Uh, come on, good night Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Hey, Leonard, did you see my limo downstairs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali It’s bigger than the house my grandfather grew up in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Terrific.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali It has more food too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 penny Alright, come on, come on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali I’m coming up so you better get this party started.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Hey, good news, you don’t have to sulk about Penny any more, look, there are hundreds of Croatian women just waiting for you to contact them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Anythingforagreencard.com?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 howard_wolowitz I’ll lend you my user name, it’s wealthybigpenis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter You’re joking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Well, you gotta make it easy for them, they’re just learning English.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Pass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 howard_wolowitz So you’re just going to sit around here and mope while Penny is out with Doctor Apu from the Kwik-e-Mart?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter It’s not a date, and that’s racist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 howard_wolowitz It can’t be racist, he’s a beloved character on the Simpsons.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Let’s just eat so I can get to bed. With any luck tonight will be the night my sleep apnoea kills me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced not shredded?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Even though the menu description specifies shredded?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Brown rice, not white?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Did you stop at the Korean grocery and get the good hot mustard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Did you pick up the low sodium soy sauce from the market?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter You’re welcome.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper What took you so long?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Just sit down and eat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Alright, it’s shredded, what do you want me to do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper I want you to check before you accept the order.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Were you distracted by the possibility that Koothrappali might have intercourse with Penny tonight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter He’s not going to have intercourse with Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Then there’s no excuse for this chicken. You know, this situation with Koothrapali brings to mind a story from my childhood.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Oh goody, more tales from the panhandle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper That’s Northwest Texas, I’m from East Texas, the Gulf region, home to many Vietnamese shrimpers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Do the shrimpers feature in your story?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper No. Anyway, when I was eight, a Montgomery-Ward delivery van ran over our cat, Lucky.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Lucky?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Yes, Lucky.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter He’s irony impaired, just move on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Okay, dead cat named Lucky, continue.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper While others mourned Lucky, I realised his untimely demise provided me with the opportunity to replace him with something more suited to my pet needs. A faithful companion that I could snuggle with at night, and yet would be capable of killing upon telepathic command.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 howard_wolowitz So, not a puppy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Please, no, nothing so pedestrian. I wanted a griffin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter A griffin?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Yes, half eagle, half lion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter And mythological.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Irrelevant. See, I was studying recombinant DNA technology and I was confident I could create one, but my parents were unwilling to secure the necessary eagle eggs and lion semen. Course my sister got swimming lessons when she wanted them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Sheldon, not that we don’t all enjoy a good lion semen story, what’s your point.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper My point is, if Koothrappali is moving on to a new life of shallow, undeserved fame, perhaps this is an opportunity to create a better cohort.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter You want to breed a new friend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper That’s one option, but who has the time? But consider this, the Japanese, they’re doing some wonderful work with artificial intelligence, now, you combine that with some animatronics from the imagineers over at Disney, next thing you know, we’re playing Halo with a multi-lingual Abraham Lincoln.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Sheldon, don’t take this the wrong way, but, you’re insane.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter That may well be, but the fact is, it wouldn’t kill us to meet some new people.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Uh, for the record, it could kill us to meet new people. They could be murderers, or the carriers of unusual pathogens, and I’m not insane, my mother had me tested.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter If we do get a new friend, he should be a guy you can trust. A guy who has your back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 howard_wolowitz And he should have a lot of money, and live in a cool place down by the beach where we could throw parties.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 sheldon_cooper He should share our love of technology.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 howard_wolowitz And he should know a lot of women.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, let’s see, money, women, technology, okay we’re agreed, our new friend is going to be Iron Man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Welcome to the Raj Mahal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 penny Yes, it’s very nice, goodnight Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali No, wait, the evening’s not over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 penny Yes it is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali No, it’s time to put on some R. Kelly and suck face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 penny Oh, wow, is the evening over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Wait, wait, that’s my mummy and daddy calling from India. I want you to meet my parents.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 penny Wait, meet them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Hello mummy and daddy, good to see you. I’m not drunk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 mrs_koothrappali Why would you say that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Just making conversation. Mummy, daddy, I want you to meet my new squeeze, Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 penny I am not your squeeze. There is no squeezing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 dr_vm_koothrappali I can’t see her, centre her in the frame.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Here you go, cute huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 mrs_koothrappali She’s not Indian.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 dr_vm_koothrappali So, she’s not Indian, the boy’s just sowing some wild oats.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 penny No, no, there’s no sowing, no squeezing, and no sucking face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 mrs_koothrappali What if he gets her pregnant. Is this little hotsy-totsy who you want as the mother of your grandchildren.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali What right do you have to pick who I can have children with?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 dr_vm_koothrappali Look, Rajesh, I understand, you’re in America, you want to try the local cuisine. But trust me, you don’t want it for a steady diet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Now you listen to me, I am no longer a child, and I will not be spoken to like one. Now if you’d excuse me, I have to go throw up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 mrs_koothrappali What’s wrong with him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 penny I don’t know, maybe it’s the local cuisine. Okay, well, it’s nice to meet you, just gonna set you on down over here, and I’m going to leave so, Namaste. And FYI, you’d be lucky to have me as a daughter-in-law.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 dr_vm_koothrappali She’s feisty. I like that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 penny Raj, what are you doing. . No. No notes. If you have something to say to me, say it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode04 penny Oh, sweetie, it’s okay.
