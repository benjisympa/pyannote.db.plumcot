TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Good morning, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard Uh-huh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Yeah, we’re going to have to stop by Pottery Barn on the way to work, I bought these Star Wars sheets but they turned out to be much too stimulating to be compatible with a good night’s sleep. I don’t like the way Darth Vader stares at me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard I’m not going to work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Oh, just because your career’s been stagnant for a few years, that’s no reason to give up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard Sheldon, I was up all night using the new free-electron laser for my X-ray diffraction experiment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Did the laser accidentally burn out your retinas?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Then you can drive. Let’s go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard Didn’t I tell you I’d be working nights, and that you’d have to make other arrangements.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon You did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard And?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon I didn’t. Let’s go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard Goodnight, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon But how am I going to get to work?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard Take the bus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon I can’t take the bus any more. They don’t have seatbelts. And they won’t let you lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard You tried to lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon I didn’t try, I succeeded. For some reason it alarmed the other passengers and I was asked to de-bus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard Oh, you’re a big boy, you’ll figure it out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Don’t talk to me like I’m a child. Now, take me to return my star wars sheets!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Penny, Penny, Penny…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Sheldon, what is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Leonard’s asleep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Thanks for the update 
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon No, wait. You have to drive me to work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Yeah, uh, I really don’t think I do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon But I don’t drive, and I can’t take the bus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Yeah, honey, you’ll be fine as long as you don’t do that bungee cord thing, okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Penny. Didn’t you recently state that you and I are friends?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Yes, Sheldon, we are friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Then I hereby invoke what I’m given to understand is an integral part of the implied covenant of friendship. The favour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Oh, dear God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon I’m sorry, I didn’t realize I was interrupting your morning prayers. When you’re done, we’ll go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Thank you for driving me to work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny You know this is my day off, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Oh, good. I’m not keeping you from anything. Your check engine light is on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Mm-hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Typically that’s an indicator. To, you know, check your engine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny It’s fine, it’s been on for, like, a month.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Well, actually, that would be all the more reason to, you know, check your engine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Sheldon, it’s fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon If it were fine, the light wouldn’t be on. That’s why the manufacturer installed that light, to let you know it’s not fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Uh, maybe the light’s broken.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Is there a “check the check engine light light”? O-o-o-oh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Studies have shown that performing tasks such as eating, talking on a cell phone or drinking coffee while driving reduces one’s reaction time by the same factor as an ounce of alcohol.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Do you have any alcohol?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Of course not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Too bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon You’re going up Euclid Avenue?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Mm-hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Leonard takes Los Robles Avenue.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Well, good for Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Euclid Avenue is shorter as the crow flies, but it has speed bumps, which appreciably increase point-to-point drive time, making it the less efficient choice. But you have the conn. Of course, if you’re not going to slow down for the speed bumps, I withdraw my previous objection. Here’s a fun question. Do you know what the most common street name is?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon The answer’s tricky. It’s Second Street. You see, you’d think it would be First Street, but in most towns, First Street eventually gets renamed to something else, you know, like Main Street, Broad Street, Michigan Avenue. Leonard and I often use our commute time to exercise our minds with brain-teasers like that. We also play games. Would you like to play one?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Oh, come on, it’s fun. Ooh! Another bump. Okay. I’ll say an element, and uh, you say an element whose name starts with the last letter of the one I said, okay? I’ll start. Helium. Now, you could say Mercury. That would give me a Y. Ooh.  Very clever, that’s a tough one. So I go Ytterbium, which gets you back to M. So you go Molybdenum, and I say Magnesium,you say Manganese,and I say Europium,and, and you’re left with Mendelevium, and there are no more M’s because I believe that Meitnerium should still be called Ekairidium, so congratulations, you win. Do you wanna go again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny How about we just have a little quiet time now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon All right. Hmm, huh, I’m sorry, I’m finding your reckless nonchalance regarding the check-engine light to be very troubling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Get out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Well, I have to tell you that while I do have a theoretical understanding of the workings of an internal combustion engine, I’m not sure I’m capable of performing diagnostics.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny I said, get out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Okay. I’ll give it a shot. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Oh, Leonard, there you are, I’m ready to go home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard I just got here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Good, perfect timing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard Sheldon, I told you, I only have access to the free-electron laser at night. I can’t drive you for the next few weeks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon No, you said you couldn’t drive me to work, this is from work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard Howard, help me out here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 howard No, just for the fun of it, I’m gonna take his side.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Now, how do you propose I get home?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard How did you get here in the first place?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Penny. But I sense that’s no longer an option.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard Look, I need to get to the laser lab, you’re just going to have to find someone else to take you home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 howard Oh damn, I picked the wrong side.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Oh God, not Euclid Avenue! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 raj Why did Howard leave you in the middle of the road anyway?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon We had a difference of opinion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 raj Over what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Whether or not he was trying to kill me. For the record, I maintain he was. Where are you going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 raj I’m taking you home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Oh, but I’m not going home. It’s Wednesday, Wednesday is new comic book day, we have to go to the comic book store. And then we have to stop at Soup Plantation, it’s creamy tomato soup day, and Radio Shack, there’s a sale on triple-a batteries. Plus, we have to go to Pottery Barn and return my Star Wars sheets.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 raj I have a better idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon You want to go to pottery barn first?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Can you drive me to Pottery Barn? Maybe if I turn off the night-light, I can keep the sheets.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Good morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 all Good morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard Sheldon, sit down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon She’s in my spot. Don’t look at me like that, everybody knows that my spot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Sheldon,you know that we care about you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 howard And it’s because we care about you that we’ve decided we have to speak up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny You’re hurting the people around you, sweetie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard So we made you an appointment, and we want you to keep it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Department of motor vehicles new driver handbook? But I don’t have a problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard Sheldon, you need to learn how to drive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 howard This madness has to stop.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard Penny’s taking you to the DMV, I’m going to bed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Why Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard Because rock breaks scissors, goodnight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny All right, come on Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Hold on, I have one condition.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon We have to stop at Pottery Barn.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon And Radio Shack.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon And the comic book store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny All right! 
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 howard Ooh, I want to go to the comic book store. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 raj I like comic books.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon I just don’t see why I need a driver’s license, Albert Einstein never had a driver’s license.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 howard Yeah, but Albert Einstein didn’t make me wet myself at 40 miles an hour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Yeah, and I never wanted to kick Albert Einstein in the nuts. You know, I gotta ask, why didn’t you just get a license at 16 like everybody else?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon I was otherwise engaged.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Doing what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Examining perturbative amplitudes in n=4 supersymmetric theories leading to a re-examination of the ultraviolet properties of multi-loop n=8 supergravity using modern twistor theory.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Well, how ’bout when you were 17?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 dmv_lady Take this to the testing area, put your name at the top, sign the bottom, answer the questions, bring it back, next! Application?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon I’m actually more of a theorist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 howard The application in your hand, give it to her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 dmv_lady Take this to the testing area, put your name at the top, sign the bottom, answer the questions, bring it back, next!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Excuse me, but I have some concerns about these questions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 dmv_lady Look at that sign up there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Yes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 dmv_lady Does it say I give a damn?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 dmv_lady That’s because I don’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Just, look, see, this first question makes no sense, how many car lengths should you leave in front of you when driving? There’s no possible way to answer that, a car length is not a standardized unit of measure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 dmv_lady Look at the sign.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Sheldon, it’s C, just put down C.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon I don’t need your help, Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 dmv_lady Listen to that little girl, honey, put C. Next!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon No, no, wait, no, hang on, look at this next question.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 howard Sheldon, why are you arguing with the DMV?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon How else are they going to learn? Look, question 2, when are roadways most slippery? Now, okay, there are three answers, none of which are correct. The correct answer is, when covered by a film of liquid sufficient to reduce the coefficient of static friction between the tire and the road to essentially zero, but not so deep as to introduce a new source of friction.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 dmv_lady Here’s your learner’s permit. Go away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon But I’m not done. I have many additional concerns about these questions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 dmv_lady Don’t make me climb over this counter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Come on, let’s go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 dmv_lady Next!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Aced it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 howard Okay, that’s it, let’s boot it up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard Booting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 howard This is a state-of-the-art simulator. I adapted it from something a friend of mine designed for the army.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Is that why I appear to be in downtown Fallujah, behind the wheel of an up-armored Humvee?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 howard I haven’t configured it yet. Let’s see…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Ooh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 howard Here we go, red 2006 Ford Taurus on the streets of Pasadena.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Hmmmm?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 howard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Statistically, red cars are stopped by police far more often than any other colour. I don’t want any hassles with the fuzz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 howard Fine, what colour do you want?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon You know the pale blue of Luke Skywalker’s lightsaber, before it was digitally remastered?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 howard Black it is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard Okay, now, what you want to do first is turn on the ignition and shift into drive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon I haven’t fastened my seat belt yet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard Okay, fasten your seat belt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Click. Now, are there air bags?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard You don’t need air bags.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon What if a simulated van rear-ends me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny I’ll hit you in the face with a pillow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard Okay, now shift into drive, pull out slowly into traffic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 howard Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard Watch out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 howard Oh God!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard Watch, watch out, watch out for pedestrians!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Oh God, wait, slow, hit the brakes, hit the brakes!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Sorry… excuse me… my bad… student driver…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard How did you manage to get on the second floor of the Glendale galleria?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon I don’t know. I was on the Pasadena freeway, I missed my exit, flew off the overpass, and one thing led to another.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard Maybe you want to give it a rest and try again tomorrow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon No. I quit. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard Aw, the pet store?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Remind me to compliment Wolowitz on the software, it’s amazingly detailed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard So wait,you’re just gonna give up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon No, I’m not giving up, I never give up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard So what is it you’re doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon I’m transcending the situation. I’m clearly too evolved for driving.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard What does that mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Leonard, have you ever wondered why my little toes and lateral incisors are significantly smaller than the average for someone of my size?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard I wonder a lot of things about you, Sheldon, but not… not that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Well, those are indicators that I’m farther along the evolutionary scale than the average human.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard No kidding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Well, no, no, I’m not going to go so far as to say that I represent a distinct new stage in humankind, you know, a Homo Novus, if you will, no, that’s for anthropologists to decide. But I am convinced that the reason I cannot master the plebeian task of driving is because I’m not meant to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard Yes, you are, you’re meant to learn how to drive. Please learn how to drive!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon No, no. Leonard, I’m meant for greater things, like unraveling the mysteries of the universe, not determining when it’s safe to pass a stopped school bus on a country road.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard It’s never safe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Yeah, well, I know that now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard Fine. Assuming that everything you say is true, how does the biologically superior Homo Novus get to work tomorrow morning?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Homo Novus doesn’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard Well, hang in there, maybe you’ll evolve into something with wings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon Good morning, gentlemen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 raj Good morning. Is there some new kind of casual Friday I don’t know about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard No, he lives here now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 howard Really? Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard Well, since he won’t take the bus and he’s too evolved to drive, he decided it would be easier to just sleep in his office and shower in the radiation lab until I’m finished with my experiment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 raj But you finished your experiment a week ago.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard Yep
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 cleaning_lady_1 Oh my God, again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 cleaning_lady_2 It must be rats.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 cleaning_lady_1 Rats don’t make toast and cut off the crust.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon You saw nothing!
