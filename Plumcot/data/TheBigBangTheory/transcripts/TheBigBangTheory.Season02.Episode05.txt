TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Good morning, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Uh-huh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Yeah, we’re going to have to stop by Pottery Barn on the way to work, I bought these Star Wars sheets but they turned out to be much too stimulating to be compatible with a good night’s sleep. I don’t like the way Darth Vader stares at me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter I’m not going to work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Oh, just because your career’s been stagnant for a few years, that’s no reason to give up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, I was up all night using the new free-electron laser for my X-ray diffraction experiment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Did the laser accidentally burn out your retinas?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Then you can drive. Let’s go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Didn’t I tell you I’d be working nights, and that you’d have to make other arrangements.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper You did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter And?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper I didn’t. Let’s go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Goodnight, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper But how am I going to get to work?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Take the bus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper I can’t take the bus any more. They don’t have seatbelts. And they won’t let you lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter You tried to lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper I didn’t try, I succeeded. For some reason it alarmed the other passengers and I was asked to de-bus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Oh, you’re a big boy, you’ll figure it out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Don’t talk to me like I’m a child. Now, take me to return my star wars sheets!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Penny, Penny, Penny…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Sheldon, what is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Leonard’s asleep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Thanks for the update
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper No, wait. You have to drive me to work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Yeah, uh, I really don’t think I do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper But I don’t drive, and I can’t take the bus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Yeah, honey, you’ll be fine as long as you don’t do that bungee cord thing, okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Penny. Didn’t you recently state that you and I are friends?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Yes, Sheldon, we are friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Then I hereby invoke what I’m given to understand is an integral part of the implied covenant of friendship. The favour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Oh, dear God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper I’m sorry, I didn’t realize I was interrupting your morning prayers. When you’re done, we’ll go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Thank you for driving me to work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny You know this is my day off, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Oh, good. I’m not keeping you from anything. Your check engine light is on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Mm-hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Typically that’s an indicator. To, you know, check your engine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny It’s fine, it’s been on for, like, a month.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Well, actually, that would be all the more reason to, you know, check your engine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Sheldon, it’s fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper If it were fine, the light wouldn’t be on. That’s why the manufacturer installed that light, to let you know it’s not fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Uh, maybe the light’s broken.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Is there a “check the check engine light light”? O-o-o-oh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Studies have shown that performing tasks such as eating, talking on a cell phone or drinking coffee while driving reduces one’s reaction time by the same factor as an ounce of alcohol.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Do you have any alcohol?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Of course not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Too bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper You’re going up Euclid Avenue?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Mm-hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Leonard takes Los Robles Avenue.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Well, good for Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Euclid Avenue is shorter as the crow flies, but it has speed bumps, which appreciably increase point-to-point drive time, making it the less efficient choice. But you have the conn. Of course, if you’re not going to slow down for the speed bumps, I withdraw my previous objection. Here’s a fun question. Do you know what the most common street name is?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper The answer’s tricky. It’s Second Street. You see, you’d think it would be First Street, but in most towns, First Street eventually gets renamed to something else, you know, like Main Street, Broad Street, Michigan Avenue. Leonard and I often use our commute time to exercise our minds with brain-teasers like that. We also play games. Would you like to play one?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Oh, come on, it’s fun. Ooh! Another bump. Okay. I’ll say an element, and uh, you say an element whose name starts with the last letter of the one I said, okay? I’ll start. Helium. Now, you could say Mercury. That would give me a Y. Ooh. Very clever, that’s a tough one. So I go Ytterbium, which gets you back to M. So you go Molybdenum, and I say Magnesium,you say Manganese,and I say Europium,and, and you’re left with Mendelevium, and there are no more M’s because I believe that Meitnerium should still be called Ekairidium, so congratulations, you win. Do you wanna go again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny How about we just have a little quiet time now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper All right. Hmm, huh, I’m sorry, I’m finding your reckless nonchalance regarding the check-engine light to be very troubling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Get out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Well, I have to tell you that while I do have a theoretical understanding of the workings of an internal combustion engine, I’m not sure I’m capable of performing diagnostics.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny I said, get out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Okay. I’ll give it a shot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Oh, Leonard, there you are, I’m ready to go home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter I just got here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Good, perfect timing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, I told you, I only have access to the free-electron laser at night. I can’t drive you for the next few weeks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper No, you said you couldn’t drive me to work, this is from work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Howard, help me out here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 howard_wolowitz No, just for the fun of it, I’m gonna take his side.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Now, how do you propose I get home?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter How did you get here in the first place?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Penny. But I sense that’s no longer an option.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Look, I need to get to the laser lab, you’re just going to have to find someone else to take you home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Oh damn, I picked the wrong side.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Oh God, not Euclid Avenue! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 raj_koothrappali Why did Howard leave you in the middle of the road anyway?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper We had a difference of opinion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 raj_koothrappali Over what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Whether or not he was trying to kill me. For the record, I maintain he was. Where are you going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 raj_koothrappali I’m taking you home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Oh, but I’m not going home. It’s Wednesday, Wednesday is new comic book day, we have to go to the comic book store. And then we have to stop at Soup Plantation, it’s creamy tomato soup day, and Radio Shack, there’s a sale on triple-a batteries. Plus, we have to go to Pottery Barn and return my Star Wars sheets.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 raj_koothrappali I have a better idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper You want to go to pottery barn first?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Can you drive me to Pottery Barn? Maybe if I turn off the night-light, I can keep the sheets.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Good morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 all@ Good morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, sit down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper She’s in my spot. Don’t look at me like that, everybody knows that my spot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Sheldon,you know that we care about you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 howard_wolowitz And it’s because we care about you that we’ve decided we have to speak up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny You’re hurting the people around you, sweetie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter So we made you an appointment, and we want you to keep it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Department of motor vehicles new driver handbook? But I don’t have a problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, you need to learn how to drive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 howard_wolowitz This madness has to stop.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Penny’s taking you to the DMV, I’m going to bed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Why Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Because rock breaks scissors, goodnight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny All right, come on Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Hold on, I have one condition.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper We have to stop at Pottery Barn.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper And Radio Shack.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper And the comic book store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny All right!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Ooh, I want to go to the comic book store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 raj_koothrappali I like comic books.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper I just don’t see why I need a driver’s license, Albert Einstein never had a driver’s license.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Yeah, but Albert Einstein didn’t make me wet myself at 40 miles an hour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Yeah, and I never wanted to kick Albert Einstein in the nuts. You know, I gotta ask, why didn’t you just get a license at 16 like everybody else?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper I was otherwise engaged.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Doing what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Examining perturbative amplitudes in n=4 supersymmetric theories leading to a re-examination of the ultraviolet properties of multi-loop n=8 supergravity using modern twistor theory.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Well, how ’bout when you were 17?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 dmv_lady#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 Take this to the testing area, put your name at the top, sign the bottom, answer the questions, bring it back, next! Application?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper I’m actually more of a theorist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 howard_wolowitz The application in your hand, give it to her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 dmv_lady#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 Take this to the testing area, put your name at the top, sign the bottom, answer the questions, bring it back, next!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Excuse me, but I have some concerns about these questions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 dmv_lady#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 Look at that sign up there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Yes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 dmv_lady#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 Does it say I give a damn?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 dmv_lady#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 That’s because I don’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Just, look, see, this first question makes no sense, how many car lengths should you leave in front of you when driving? There’s no possible way to answer that, a car length is not a standardized unit of measure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 dmv_lady#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 Look at the sign.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Sheldon, it’s C, just put down C.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper I don’t need your help, Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 dmv_lady#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 Listen to that little girl, honey, put C. Next!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper No, no, wait, no, hang on, look at this next question.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Sheldon, why are you arguing with the DMV?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper How else are they going to learn? Look, question 2, when are roadways most slippery? Now, okay, there are three answers, none of which are correct. The correct answer is, when covered by a film of liquid sufficient to reduce the coefficient of static friction between the tire and the road to essentially zero, but not so deep as to introduce a new source of friction.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 dmv_lady#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 Here’s your learner’s permit. Go away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper But I’m not done. I have many additional concerns about these questions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 dmv_lady#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 Don’t make me climb over this counter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Come on, let’s go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 dmv_lady#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 Next!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Aced it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Okay, that’s it, let’s boot it up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Booting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 howard_wolowitz This is a state-of-the-art simulator. I adapted it from something a friend of mine designed for the army.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Is that why I appear to be in downtown Fallujah, behind the wheel of an up-armored Humvee?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 howard_wolowitz I haven’t configured it yet. Let’s see…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Ooh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Here we go, red 2006 Ford Taurus on the streets of Pasadena.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Hmmmm?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 howard_wolowitz What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Statistically, red cars are stopped by police far more often than any other colour. I don’t want any hassles with the fuzz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Fine, what colour do you want?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper You know the pale blue of Luke Skywalker’s lightsaber, before it was digitally remastered?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Black it is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Okay, now, what you want to do first is turn on the ignition and shift into drive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper I haven’t fastened my seat belt yet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Okay, fasten your seat belt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Click. Now, are there air bags?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter You don’t need air bags.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper What if a simulated van rear-ends me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny I’ll hit you in the face with a pillow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Okay, now shift into drive, pull out slowly into traffic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Watch out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Oh God!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Watch, watch out, watch out for pedestrians!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 penny Oh God, wait, slow, hit the brakes, hit the brakes!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Sorry… excuse me… my bad… student driver…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter How did you manage to get on the second floor of the Glendale galleria?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper I don’t know. I was on the Pasadena freeway, I missed my exit, flew off the overpass, and one thing led to another.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Maybe you want to give it a rest and try again tomorrow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper No. I quit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Aw, the pet store?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Remind me to compliment Wolowitz on the software, it’s amazingly detailed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter So wait,you’re just gonna give up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper No, I’m not giving up, I never give up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter So what is it you’re doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper I’m transcending the situation. I’m clearly too evolved for driving.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter What does that mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Leonard, have you ever wondered why my little toes and lateral incisors are significantly smaller than the average for someone of my size?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter I wonder a lot of things about you, Sheldon, but not… not that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Well, those are indicators that I’m farther along the evolutionary scale than the average human.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter No kidding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Well, no, no, I’m not going to go so far as to say that I represent a distinct new stage in humankind, you know, a Homo Novus, if you will, no, that’s for anthropologists to decide. But I am convinced that the reason I cannot master the plebeian task of driving is because I’m not meant to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Yes, you are, you’re meant to learn how to drive. Please learn how to drive!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper No, no. Leonard, I’m meant for greater things, like unraveling the mysteries of the universe, not determining when it’s safe to pass a stopped school bus on a country road.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter It’s never safe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Yeah, well, I know that now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Fine. Assuming that everything you say is true, how does the biologically superior Homo Novus get to work tomorrow morning?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Homo Novus doesn’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Well, hang in there, maybe you’ll evolve into something with wings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Good morning, gentlemen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 raj_koothrappali Good morning. Is there some new kind of casual Friday I don’t know about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter No, he lives here now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Really? Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Well, since he won’t take the bus and he’s too evolved to drive, he decided it would be easier to just sleep in his office and shower in the radiation lab until I’m finished with my experiment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 raj_koothrappali But you finished your experiment a week ago.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Yep
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 cleaning_lady_1#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 Oh my God, again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 cleaning_lady_2#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 It must be rats.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 cleaning_lady_1#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 Rats don’t make toast and cut off the crust.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode05 sheldon_cooper You saw nothing!
