TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard So, if any of you are considering going into experimental physics, my door is always open. Once again, I’m sorry that the demonstration didn’t quite work out, but now we know what happens when you accidentally spill peach Snapple into a helium neon laser. Short answer is… don’t. And now to tell you about the theoretical physics department is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Dr. Cooper?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon Forget it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard Excuse me. Sheldon, we both agreed to do this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon It’s a waste of time. I might as well explain the laws of thermodynamics to a bunch of labradoodles.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard If you don’t do this, I won’t take you to the comic book store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon Hello. Nice work with the laser, by the way. Looking out at your fresh young faces, I remember when I too was deciding my academic future as a lowly graduate student. Of course, I was 14, and I’d already achieved more than most of you could ever hope to, despite my 9 o’clock bedtime. Now, there may be one or two of you in this room who has what it takes to succeed in theoretical physics, although, it’s more likely that you’ll spend your scientific careers teaching fifth graders how to make paper mache volcanoes with baking soda lava.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard Oh, good God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon In short, anyone who told you that you would someday be able to make any significant contribution to physics played a cruel trick on you, a cruel trick indeed. Any questions? Of course not. I weep for the future of science. Now if you’ll excuse me, the latest issue of Batman is out. Come, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard Laser demonstration’s looking pretty good now, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 raj I love this time of the year. The leaves are turning, there’s a bracing chill in the air.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 howard Plus there’s a whole new crop of female grad students about to put on just enough winter weight to make them needy and vulnerable. That’s right, honey, have another calzone, Daddy can wait.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 raj Isn’t there a university policy against dating graduate students?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard No, if you can talk to them, you can ask them out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 raj Damn, there’s always a catch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leslie_winkle Hey, guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard Hey, Leslie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leslie So, dumbass, I heard you made a grad student throw up last night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon The truth can indeed be a finger down the throat of those unprepared to hear it. But why should I cater to second-rate minds?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leslie Because first-rate minds call you “dumbass”?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon Oh, yeah? Well… you’re a mean person.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 girl Excuse me, Dr. Cooper, I’m Ramona Nowitzki, I was at your talk last night. I think you’re just brilliant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon That is the prevailing opinion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leslie Oh, now I’m gonna throw up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 howard Howard Wolowitz, department of engineering, co-designer of the International Space Station’s Liquid Waste Disposal System.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona Ew. Dr. Cooper, I’ve read everything you’ve published. I especially liked your paper on grand unification using string-network condensates and was wondering how you determined that three-dimensional string-nets provided a unified picture of fermions and gauge bosons?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon Amazing, an intelligent labradoodle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 howard Woof.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon The fact is I’m quite close to a breakthrough in showing how neutrinos emerge from a string-net condensate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona Oh, my God, that would change the way we view the entire physical universe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon It’s what I do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 howard You know, the Pishkin-Wolowitz Liquid Waste Disposal System is turning a few heads as well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona Again, ew. You know, I’d love to hear more about how you intend to add neutrinos. Could we get a cup of coffee sometime?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon I don’t drink coffee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 howard I do. I love me a cup of joe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona Well, it doesn’t have to be coffee. How about dinner?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon I do eat dinner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona Great. I know a terrific little Italian place.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon I never eat in strange restaurants. One runs the risk of non-standard cutlery.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona Excuse me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard Sheldon lives in fear of the three-tined fork.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon Three tines is not a fork, three tines is a trident. Forks are for eating, tridents are for ruling the seven seas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona What if I brought food to your place?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon That would be acceptable. On Mondays, I eat Thai food. Mee krob and chicken sate with extra peanut sauce from Siam Palace.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona You got it. I already have your address.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon What a nice girl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 howard Sheldon, do you have any idea what just happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon Yes. Apparently I’m getting a free dinner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 penny Oh, yeah, no, this thing’s majorly out of order. See? Sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona That’s okay. Guess I’m taking the stairs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 penny Where you going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona 4-A.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 penny Oh, are you here to see Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona No, Dr. Cooper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 penny Dr. Sheldon Cooper?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona We’re having dinner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 penny Sheldon Cooper? Tall, thin, looks a little like a giant praying mantis?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona He is cute, isn’t he?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 penny Sheldon Cooper?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona Hi, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard Hey, Ramona. Come on in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona Thanks. Where should I put this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard Uh, the kitchen’s fine. Hey, what are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 penny I need to see this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard Uh-huh. The viewing area’s right over there. Sheldon, your girl… date… person… Ramona’s here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon Oh, hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona Oh, sorry I’m late. I just got so caught up reading the draft of your latest paper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon Did you enjoy the humorous footnote where I illustrate mirror-symmetry by likening it to the Flash playing tennis with himself?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona So funny. But the idea that you might be able to incorporate gravity, I have to tell you, I found it physically exhilarating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon My hypotheses tend to have that effect.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona I’m sorry I didn’t bring enough for your friends. I assumed we were going to be alone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard Oh, yeah. No, we were just going.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 howard To watch, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard No, come on, now, we’re going out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 penny Oh, come on, we’ll be quiet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard Let’s go. Okay, you two, just, have a nice… whatever this is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 penny Okay, you guys, look, I know this is none of my business, but I just, I have to ask, what’s Sheldon’s deal?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard What do you mean “deal”?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 penny You know, like what’s his deal? Is it girls? Guys? Sock puppets?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard Honestly, we’ve been operating under the assumption that he has no deal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 penny Come on, everybody has a deal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 howard Not Sheldon. Over the years, we’ve formulated many theories about how he might reproduce. I’m an advocate of mytosis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 penny I’m sorry?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 howard I believe one day Sheldon will eat an enormous amount of Thai food and split into two Sheldons.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard On the other hand, I think Sheldon might be the larval form of his species, and someday he’ll spin a cocoon and emerge two months later with moth wings and an exoskeleton.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 penny Okay, well, thanks for the nightmares.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard Hey, do you want to hang out with us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 penny What are you guys gonna do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard Uh…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 howard My mom’s making a brisket tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard The one with the little onions? Mmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 penny Yeah, I’m busy, so, goodnight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 howard Her loss. Let’s go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 raj Brisket party! B-to-the-R-to-the-I-S-K… To-the-E-to-the-T… Ooh…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard Don’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard Hey, aren’t you having breakfast?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard Are you experimenting with nutritional suppositories again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon Not in these pants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard So, how’d it go with Ramona last night?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon Oh, great. She’s smart, insightful and she has a very unique way of, you know, revering me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona Here’s your spinach mushroom omelette .
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon Thank you. Did anyone touch it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona Gloves were worn by everyone involved. I was vigilant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon Ramona pointed out that I’ve been wasting 20 minutes a day standing on cafeteria lines.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona Time which would be better spent tackling the great physics problems of our day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon You don’t tackle the big issues, Ramona. You fence with them. En garde. Riposte.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard Touche.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leslie Morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard Ah, hey Leslie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leslie So, Sheldon, I see you’re organizing your papers for the Smithsonian Museum of Dumbassery.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona There won’t be any room until they get rid of the permanent Leslie Winkle exhibit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon Oh, good one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leslie I see you got a grad student to fight your battles for you. I’ll let you keep your lunch money today.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona Okay, Dr. Cooper is on the verge of a breakthrough. If you’re going to stay, you’ll have to be respectful and quiet. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard Wait for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona So have you worked out the neutrino issue?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon Well, to paraphrase Mozart, all the subatomic particles are there, I just have to put them in the right order.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona You’re so witty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon Aren’t I?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 penny Hey, guys, this package came for y…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona Dr. Cooper is working.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon Yes, I’m close to a breakthrough. Ooh, it tickles
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 penny Sorry. Holy crap on a cracker.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard Hey, Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 penny Hi. You know, you probably don’t want to go in there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard Why? What are they doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 penny You know, the only way I could explain it would be in a therapist’s office with dolls.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard Hoo-boy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona Dr. Cooper’s working.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard Yeah, I can see that. Sheldon, Halo night, Koothrappali’s. You coming?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon Oh, yes, it’s Halo night. Let me just dry my tootsies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona You’re not going to Halo night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon Yes, I am. It’s Wednesday. Wednesday’s Halo night.</i>
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona Didn’t a great man once say, “Science demands nothing less than the fervent and
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon He did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona And who was that great man?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon Me. Sorry, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard Seriously? You’re not coming?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon You heard her. How can I argue with me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard Okay, well, once again, you guys have a good… whatever this is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona Dr. Cooper, I have to tell you, your friends are holding you back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon I prefer to think of it as I’m pulling them forward.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona Halo night? A man with your intellectual gifts doesn’t waste an evening playing video games.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon He does on Wednesdays.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona Not if he wants a Nobel Prize.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon He does want that. Does a man with my intellectual gifts play paintball on weekends?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona What do you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon Drat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona Now shall we get back to work?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon I suppose. Battlestar Galactica comes on tonight. I guess I can wait for the DVD. And then never ever watch it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 montage_of_scenes To the sound of “You Can Be My Yoko Ono” by Barenaked Ladies we see 1. the guys set off for paintball while Sheldon, dressed in paintball gear,sadly waves them goodbye, 2. Ramona catch Sheldon hiding behind the shower curtain playing on a Nintendo DS, 3. Ramona remove a book Sheldon is reading to reveal a Batman comic underneath, 4. Sheldon escape the apartment in his paintball gear only to be chased back inside by Ramona returning with groceries, she finds him sitting in his underpants with his paintball helmet still on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon Penny, Penny, Penny
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 penny Sheldon, honey, I’ve told you, it’s a small apartment, you only have to knock one time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon Please, please, I don’t have a lot of time. Look, Ramona finally dozed off, and I need you to help me get rid of her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 penny Get rid of her how?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon I don’t know, but apparently I’m in some kind of relationship, and you seem to be an expert at ending them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 penny Excuse me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon I see man after man leaving this apartment never to return.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 penny Okay, first of all, it is not man after man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona Dr. Cooper?!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon Hide me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 penny Hide you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon I formally request sanctuary.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona Why aren’t you working?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon Um… she distracted me. I told you, Penny, I don’t have time for your nonsense, I have important things to do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 penny Oh, man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona I know what’s going on here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 penny Really? Well, then will you explain it to me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona You’re in love with Dr. Cooper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 penny Uh, yeah, no, that’s not it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona Don’t try to deny it. He’s a remarkable man, but you have to let him go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 penny Oh, gee, okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona I know it’s hard, but he’s a gift to the whole world, and we can’t be selfish.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 penny Yeah, he’s a gift all right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona Sisters?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 penny Um, sure, sisters. Holy crap on a cracker.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard Sheldon? What are you doing?!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon It’s Morse code.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon So we can communicate through the wall.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard We are communicating through the wall.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon Yes, but the communication is not encrypted.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard I don’t know Morse code.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon It’s very simple. This is A this is B this is C…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard Sheldon, I’m not going to learn Morse code at three o’clock in the morning!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard Don’t come in here, don’t come in here, don’t come in here, don’t Aw! What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon Shh! Ramona’s sleeping on the couch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard I know. When is she going home?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon Never, that’s the problem. I need your help.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard What are you talking about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon I’m invoking the Skynet clause of our friendship agreement.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard That only applies if you need me to help you destroy an artificial intelligence you created that’s taking over the Earth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon Come on! Don’t nitpick!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard Good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon Shh. All right, I’m invoking our bodysnatchers clause.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard The bodysnatchers clause requires me to help you destroy someone we know who’s been replaced with an alien pod.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon Yes. She’s in the living room. Go, I’ll wait here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona Sheldon, what are you doing out of bed?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon Now! Do it!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona You know you need your sleep in order for your cognitive processing to perform at optimum levels. Now come on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon Godzilla clause?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard Not unless she destroys Tokyo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon Rats.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon I’ve got it! I finally reconciled the black hole information paradox with my theory of string-network condensates!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona It’s unbelievable! It’s paradigm-altering!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon And I could not have done it without you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona Oh, please, I just offered a little encouragement.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon It was a lot more than that. You helped me work out the masses of all the fermions, and you pumiced my hammer toe. How can I ever repay you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona Well, would you consider naming it the Cooper-Nowitzki Theorem?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon Who’s Nowitzki?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona I’m Nowitzki.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon Oh, you want me to share credit?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona Uh-huh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon Get out!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 penny Oh, hey, hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 ramona Oh, bite me!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 penny Sisters?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 girl Excuse me, Dr. Cooper, I’m Kathy O’Brien. I just finished reading your paper reconciling the black hole information paradox with your theory of string-network condensates, and it just took my breath away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon Maybe when I publish it, I’ll include an inhaler.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 kathy Would you possibly have any time for me to pick your brain?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon Let’s see, today’s Thursday. Thursday nights, I eat pizza from Giacomo’s. Sausage, mushrooms, light olives.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 kathy Great. I’ll bring it to your place. I have the address.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon What a nice girl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard Sheldon, do you see what just happened here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon Yes, I’m getting a free pizza. I’m on a roll.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon More Pad Thai, please.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 howard Sheldon, you’ve already had four servings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 raj You might want to slow down a bit, buddy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon Just one more bite.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard Sheldon? Sheldon, are you okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 sheldon I’m just so… full.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode06 leonard That’s it. No more Thai food.
