TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Time. Alright Klingons, pencils down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Okay, I have pokh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 all@ Have it. Got it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Potl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 all@ Yup. Have it. Have it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Pukhpa.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 all@ Have it. Got it. Yup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 howard_wolowitz I have Chorrr.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 raj_koothrappali@sheldon_cooper Got it. Yup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Nekhmakh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 raj_koothrappali@sheldon_cooper Yeah. Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 howard_wolowitz And Kreplach.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Hold on a second. Kreplach?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 raj_koothrappali That isn’t Klingon, it’s Yiddish for meat-filled dumpling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Well, as it turns out, it’s also a Klingon word.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Really? Define it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Kreplach, A hearty Klingon… dumpling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Judge’s ruling?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Bilurrrbe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Hey, guys, I need to use your TV.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper What’s wrong with your TV?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny I don’t know, it just died, I’m getting a bunch of static.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Did you pay your cable bill?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Excuse me, Penny, but we’re…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter No,no, don’t tell her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper …playing Klingon Boggle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Aw!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 howard_wolowitz What do you mean, aw? Like she didn’t know we were nerds?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper All right, if you must watch, then mute it with closed captions, please.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper All right, Boggle warriors, kapla’!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Look at those women.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter They’re gorgeous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Oh! Worf, nice! Too bad that’s a proper noun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Oh, look, the’s the future Mrs. Wolowitz. No, wait, that’s the future Mrs. Wolowitz. With her head in the lap of, what a coincidence. It’s the future Mrs. Wolowitz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, and they can all move in with you and your mother, the current Mrs. Wolowitz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Is qochbe’ spelled with a or a ?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Why is that Mrs. Wolowitz crying?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Oh. That’s Anais, none of the other girls in the house like her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 howard_wolowitz House? What house?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny They all live in a house together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 howard_wolowitz A house, where?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny I don’t know. Somewhere in L.A.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Wait a minute, you’re telling me that I’m within driving distance of a house filled with aspiring supermodels?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Yeah, I guess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 howard_wolowitz And they live together and shower together and have naked pillow fights?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Hey, wh-where are you going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny To pay my cable bill.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper All right, pencils down! I have lokh, makh, and cherrrkh. Anybody got those?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Did I miss anything? Did they kick Giselle off?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Not yet, but her underwater photo shoot was an embarrassment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Sadly, Mrs. Giselle Wolowitz is sensitive to chlorine. Lucky for her I like my fashion models pruny and bug-eyed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, the food’s here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 raj_koothrappali There’s the house, freeze frame, freeze frame.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Marking the star positions and physical landmarks so we can find the house of the supermodels.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Isn’t it obvious? Every week, they kick out a beautiful girl, making her feel unwanted and without self-esteem, a.k.a. the future Mrs. Howard Wolowitz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Is my hamburger medium well?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Dill slices, not sweet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Individual relish packets?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Onion rings?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Extra breading?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter I asked.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper What did they say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Did you protest?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Vociferously?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Well, then what took you so long?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Just eat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Hey, guys, what’d I miss? What’d I miss?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Giselle’s hanging by a thread.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Oh, good, I hate her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Then you’re not invited to our wedding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Here you go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Oh, do we have to suffer through this transparently manipulative pseudo-reality again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 all@ Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper You and I have a standing TV schedule which is the result of extensive debate and compromise. Any alterations except for breaking news have to be pre-approved at the weekly roommate meeting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Put it on the agenda.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper But you have to make a motion to put it on agenda.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Oh, I’ll make a motion, but you’re not going to like it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Fine. Mock Parliamentary procedure. At least put it on mute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Oh, Giselle’s not getting kicked off. It’s totally going to be Summer. What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon’s onion ring. Just put it back!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny It’s one onion ring.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Just put it back before he comes!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter No, no, no, no, I don’t think that’s where it was.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Okay, here he comes, deny, deny, people, wall of silence.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Who touched my…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 all@ Penny! Penny did it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Why would you do that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny I don’t know. I was hungry? What’s the big deal?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper The big deal is that nobody touches food on my plate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny All right. Look, I didn’t know, I’m sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Well, I’m sorry, but that is your second strike.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper You have two strikes. Three strikes and you’re out. It’s a sports metaphor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny A sports metaphor?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Yes, baseball.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny All right, yeah, I’ll play along. What was my first strike?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper March 18th. You violated my rule about forwarding email humour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny I did?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper The photo of the cat who wants to “has cheezburger”?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Oh, come on, everybody loves LOLcats. They’re cute and they can’t spell ’cause they’re cats.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper I trusted you with my email address, and you betrayed that trust by sending me Internet banality, strike one. Touching my food, strike two.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Don’t worry. They only stay on your record for a year.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 howard_wolowitz You can get them removed early, but you have to take his class.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Come on, I touched one onion ring.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper And then you put it back, compromising the integrity of all the other onion rings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Oh, honey, the buses don’t go where you live, do they?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Look, Penny, I wish I could be more lenient with you, but since you’ve become a permanent member of our social group I have to hold you to the same standards as everybody else.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Congratulations. You’re officially one of us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 howard_wolowitz One of us, one of us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Well, what a thrill.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper You’re sitting in my spot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Oh, jeez, you’ve got to be kidding me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Leonard, she’s in my spot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, yeah. Uh, see, here’s the thing, after you leave, I still have to live with him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny I don’t care. I’m taking a stand. Metaphorically.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper All right, that’s it. Strike three.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Ooh, strike three.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny I’m banished? What the hell kind of crap is that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Listen, don’t worry. I’ll talk to him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Yeah, you do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Just so I know, would you be open to taking his class? You can do it online!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 howard_wolowitz So based on our triangulation we’ve narrowed down the location of the top model house to three square miles in the Hollywood Hills.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Or possibly Durham, North Carolina.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 howard_wolowitz When we find it, you want to go with us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter To do what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Party with the pretty girls, dude!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Are you insane? You’re not going to party with them, you’re not even going to get anywhere near that place.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 howard_wolowitz That’s what they said to Neil Armstrong about the moon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper No one said anything of the kind to Neil Armstrong, the entire nation dedicated a decade of effort and treasure to put a man on the moon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Well, my fellow Americans, before this year is out we will put a Wolowitz on one of America’s top models.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 raj_koothrappali And a large number of people will believe it never happened.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Okay, let me guess. A quesadilla with soy cheese for the lactose-intolerant Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Shrimp Caesar salad with no almonds for the highly allergic kosher-only-on-the-high-holidays Howard, and for our suddenly back on the Hindu wagon Raj, meatlover’s pizza, no meat. Coming right up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Wait. Excuse me. You forgot my barbecue bacon cheeseburger, barbecue sauce, bacon and cheese on the side.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Oh, I didn’t tell you? You’re banished from the Cheesecake Factory.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Well, you have three strikes. One, coming in. Two, sitting down. And three, I don’t like your attitude.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper You can’t do that. Not only is it a violation of California state law, it flies directly in the face of Cheesecake Factory policy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Yeah, no, there’s a new policy. No shoes, no shirt, no Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 howard_wolowitz I bet we could sell that sign all over Pasadena.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Penny, can I talk to you for a minute? Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Look, here’s the thing, um, I talked to Sheldon and he feels terrible and he agrees that he was unreasonable and out of line.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Really? Well, that’s great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, so just apologize to him, okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny What? I’m not going to apologize to that nutcase.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Oh, come on, it’s easy, he’ll even tell you what to say.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Leonard, don’t you get it? If you guys keep going along with his insanity, you’re just encouraging him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter We’re not encouraging. It’s more like knuckling under.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Look, I like hanging out with you guys, but I’m not going to apologize for something I didn’t do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Well, actually, technically, you did do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny That’s strike one, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny There you go, quesadilla, salad, there’s your pizza, and thanks to Sheldon’s heated discussion with my manager one barbecue bacon cheeseburger, barbecue sauce, bacon and cheese on the side.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Go ahead, eat it. I dare you
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 howard_wolowitz That’s it. There’s the house, I found America’s top models!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Are you sure?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Look, on the roof, Anais and Giselle are sunbathing. European-style.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter You can recognize people on Google Earth?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Of course not, I got a buddy of mine at NORAD to have a spy drone fly over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter NORAD? You’re using military aircraft?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 howard_wolowitz It was already targeted to poke around a nuclear reactor in Siberia, I took it an hour out of its way, tops.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Okay, where is he?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon? I just dropped him off at the comic book store. Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Here. Try and go online.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Problem with the WiFi?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny No, just try.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Greetings, hamburger toucher. You are probably wondering why you cannot IM with your little friends about how much you heart various things. Well, this recorded message is alerting you that I am putting an end to your parasitic piggybacking upon our WiFi. If you want to remedy the situation you can contact the phone company, set up your own WiFi and pay for it, or you may apologize to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Well?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter I reiterate, knuckle under.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny No, no, no, no, no. It is on. I am gonna introduce your friend to a world of hurt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Oh, Penny, you don’t want to get into it with Sheldon. The guy is one lab accident away from being a supervillain.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny I don’t care, I was in junior rodeo, I can hogtie and castrate him in 60 seconds.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 howard_wolowitz No need to neuter the nerd, I can get you back online.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter There, see? Problem solved.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Voila!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Hello, puny insects. As a consequence of your efforts to circumvent my will, everyone is awarded one additional strike.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Thanks a lot, Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 howard_wolowitz What are you complaining about? I’m the one who has to take the class again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Oh! Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Time to do your laundry, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper It’s Saturday night. Saturday is laundry night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny I know. Every Saturday at 8:15, easy to anticipate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper What are you implying?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny I’m implying that you’re a creature of habit, and if something were to prevent you from doing your laundry on Saturday at 8:15, you might find it unpleasant. Knuckle under, my ass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Oh, no, are all the machines taken? What are you gonna do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper No problem, I’ll just do my laundry another night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Another night? Well, I guess you can try, but deep inside your heart you’ll know that laundry night is always Saturday night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Woman, you are playing with forces beyond your ken.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Yeah, well, your ken can kiss my Barbie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Sheldon Sheldon Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Yes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Where are my clothes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Your clothes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Yes, I left them in the washers and when I went down to get them, they were gone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Really? Despite the sign that says “Do not leave laundry unattended”?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Sheldon, where are my clothes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper You know, I do recall seeing some female undergarments. Where was that? Oh, yes, earlier this evening I happened to gaze out the window and a brassiere caught my eye. Do those look familiar?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny How the hell did you get them up on that telephone wire?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper When you understand the laws of physics, Penny, anything is possible. And may I add, mwah-ha-ha!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Get them down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Apologize.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Never.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Well, then may I suggest you get a very long stick and play panty pinata.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Look, wait, Sheldon, this has gotten out of hand, okay? I’ve done some stupid things, you’ve done some stupid things, how about we just call it even and move on with our lives?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper I’ve done no stupid things.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Look, you’ve got to meet me halfway here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper I am meeting you halfway, I’m willing to concede that you’ve done some stupid things.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Hey, you guys are talking again. Good. What happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Leonard, remember when I said it was on? Well, now it’s junior rodeo on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Oh, not junior rodeo. What did you do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper I had no choice, Leonard, she ruined laundry night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter A-a-a-aw!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Mwah-ha-ha.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Telephone wires can’t electrocute you, can they?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter No. Look, this has to stop.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Oh, no, no, no. It is just beginning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter All right, I really didn’t want to do this, but… here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny What’s this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon’s Kryptonite.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Oh, my God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter He can never know that I gave that to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Look, I said I wanted to hurt him, but, but this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter It’ll shorten the war by five years and save millions of lives.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Oh, pause it. That’s it. Confirmed. We now have the address of the top model house.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 howard_wolowitz God bless you, Google Street View registered trademark.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Okay, for the record what you’re doing is really creepy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 howard_wolowitz You know what? If it’s creepy to use the Internet, military satellites, and robot aircraft to find a house full of gorgeous young models so that I can drop in on them unexpectedly, then fine, I’m creepy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Hello. Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. I’ll get him. Sheldon, it’s for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Who is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Your mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Oh, good. Hi, Mom. How are you? But, Mom, she keeps sitting in my spot. And, and she touched my food. Okay, yes, I took her clothes, but she started it. No, that’s not fair. Why should I have to apologize? Yeah, I really don’t think this is the kind of thing Jesus concerns himself with. No, you’re right, I don’t really know what Jesus thinks about. All right, good-bye. Did you tell on me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Are you kidding me? I already have two strikes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Penny,Penny,Penny… I am very, very sorry for what I have done. Here’s your laundry, I rescind your strikes and you are no longer banished.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Can I sit wherever I want? No, no, never mind, never mind, that’s, that’s not important. Sheldon, this was big of you. Thank you. I really appreciate it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Good night, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Yes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Well played.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 penny Understood.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 model Can I help you
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Yes, we here to fix the cable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 model I think we have satellite.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 howard_wolowitz That’s what I meant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode07 model Oh. Okay, come on in.
