TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon Oh look, Saturn 3 is on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 raj I don’t want to watch Saturn 3. Deep Space Nine is better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon How is Deep Space Nine better than Saturn 3?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 raj Simple subtraction will tell you it’s six better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard Compromise. Watch Babylon 5.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon In what sense is that a compromise?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard Well, five is partway between three… Never mind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 raj I’ll tell you what, how about we go rock-paper-scissors?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon Ooh, I don’t think so. No, anecdotal evidence suggests that in the game of rock-paper-scissors, players familiar with each other will tie 75 to 80% of the time due to the limited number of outcomes. I suggest rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 raj What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon It’s very simple. Look, scissors cuts paper. Paper covers rock. Rock crushes lizard. Lizard poisons Spock. Spock smashes scissors. Scissors decapitates lizard. Lizard eats paper. Paper disproves Spock. Spock vaporizes rock. And as it always has, rock crushes scissors.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 raj Okay, I think I got it. (They prepare)
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 together Rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock! (Both hold up the symbol for Spock) Oh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_ Hello, boys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard Ahoy, matey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard Noticed the eye patch, did you? It’s all part of a technique I’ve been studying for picking up women. You employ a visual display designed to make yourself distinctive and memorable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon Oh yes, like the male peacock with brilliant plumage or the rutting baboon with engorged hindquarters.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard Or in this case, the bar mitzvah boy with pinkeye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard Mock me if you will, but it works. You show up at a club in something distinctive, scope out your target and toss out some negs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 raj What are negs?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard A neg is a negative compliment that throws a pretty woman off her game, like “Normally, I’m not turned on by big teeth, but on you, they work.” I’ve got a whole list of ’em. Who wants to be my wingman?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard You’re not gonna need wingman, you’re gonna need a paramedic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 penny_ Howard, your scooter’s blocking my car. Aw, did you get pinkeye again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard Step one, she notices the eye patch. May I say, Penny, not a lot of women could look as hot as you do with such greasy hair? (She reaches out, pulls his eye patch away from his face, then lets go allowing the elastic to spring it back into place.)
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 penny Yeah, just move your stupid scooter before I pick it up and throw it in the dumpster.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard Ow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon I’m sorry, but I’m not going to watch the Clone Wars TV series until I’ve seen the Clone Wars movie. I prefer to let George Lucas disappoint me in the order he intended.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard Well, I want to watch it now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon Then I believe we’ve arrived at another quintessential rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock moment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard Watch whatever you want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 raj I saw what you did there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon What did I do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_ Hello. Hey, Howard. What’s wrong? Okay. Okay, we’ll be right there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon What happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard Howard’s at the Mars Rover lab. He says he’s in trouble. Defcon 5.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon Defcon 5? Well, there’s no need to rush.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon Defcon 5 means no danger. Defcon 1 is a crisis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard How can 5 not be worse than 1?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 raj Yeah, Star Trek V, worse than I.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon Okay, first of all, that’s a comparison of quality, not intensity. Secondly, Star Trek I is orders-of-magnitude worse than Star Trek V.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 raj Are you joking? Star Trek V is the standard against which all badness is measured.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon No, no, no. Star Trek V has specific failures in writing and direction, while Star Trek I fails across the board, art direction, costuming, music, sound editing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard Can we just forget I said Defcon and go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 raj Star Trek V!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 raj I have three words for you. Wrath of Khan.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard Oh, thank God, you’re here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard What’s the emergency?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard I got the Mars Rover stuck in a ditch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon Where?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard On a dusty highway just outside Bakersfield. Where do you think? On Mars!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 woman_ Howard, is everything okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard Yeah, baby, I’ll be right in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon You brought a girl to the Mars Rover control room?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard Yeah, I picked her up in the bar. She’s a doctor. One free barium enema and my mother won’t care she’s not Jewish.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard Wait a minute, so the eye patch and the insults worked?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard No, there were three other guys with eye patches, iIt was a fiasco. What did work was, “How’d you like to visit a secret government facility?”
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon So what exactly do you want us to do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard I need you and Raj to help me get the Rover out of the ditch, and I need you to get Stephanie out before somebody notices she’s here. She doesn’t exactly have clearance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon Really? They don’t let strange women from honky-tonks come in and play with $200million government projects on distant planets?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard Yes, I was bad. Maybe she’ll spank me. Can we please move on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 girl Hey, Howard, you know, it’s getting late, so do I get to drive this thing or what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard Yeah. No. I’m sorry, but something’s come up. Kind of a Mars Rover, Mars Rover, can Howard come over, situation. So my friend Leonard is gonna take you home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 girl Oh, okay. Let’s go, friend Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard I’ll call ya.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 girl Yeah. So are you a scientist like Howard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard No one’s a scientist like Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard My mother is so gonna love her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon Oh, how nice. Maybe they can carpool when they visit you in federal prison.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 girl I’m sorry. I totally interrupted you. What, what, what were you saying?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard Just said Howard’s a terrific guy. He’s got a great sense of humour, he loves his mother, a lot, some people say too much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 girl I really like that you’re such a loyal friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard Yeah, I am loyal. You know, if you look at the big picture. Just, out of curiosity, did he ever have a shot with you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 girl Are you insane? The guy was wearing an eye patch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard Then why did you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 girl He said that I could drive a car on Mars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard Got it. So, can I see you again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 girl You’re not gonna see me now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard Ooh. Cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard Anything?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 raj Actually, I was just checking my e-mail. But, uh, no, the Rover is not responding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon I believe the appropriate metaphor here involves a river of excrement and a Native American water vessel without any means of propulsion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard Hang on, there’s got to be other options.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 raj You could try calling Triple-A, but based on NASA’s latest timetable, they won’t get there for 35 years.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon Plus I understand you have to be standing next to the vehicle with your card when they arrive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 raj Oh, snap.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon Snap what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard OK, I guess we have to turn to Plan B.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 raj What’s Plan B?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard Erase all the hard drives, scrap the surveillance tapes, wipe our fingerprints off every surface and run.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon Why wasn’t that Plan A?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard Thank God for Plan B.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 penny Howard, didn’t you say you worked on the Mars Rover?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard No, you’re mistaken.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 penny Yeah, when we first met, you said that if I went out with you, I could drive a car on Mars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard I don’t know what you’re talking about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard Psst! Psst!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon Will you all excuse me? Leonard is subtly signalling that he’d like to talk to me in private.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 penny No. Yeah, I remember specifically. You started by asking if I was from Mars because my ass was out of this world.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard Well, that does sound like me, but no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon Is there some problem?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard Yeah. Listen, I have to kinda sneak out for a while.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon All right, goodbye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard No, wait! If anyone asks you where I went, you don’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon Where are you going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard I can’t tell you that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon Who would ask me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard I can’t tell you that, either.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon So you brought me in here to inform me that you can’t tell me where you’re going and you can’t tell me who might ask?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard Yeah, I really didn’t think this through.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon Leonard, a moment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon If someone, and of course, we don’t know who this would be, does ask where you’ve gone, what should I say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard I don’t know. Just tell them I went to the office.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon Are you going to the office?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon Then how can I say it convincingly?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard Just say, Leonard went to the office.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon All right. Leonard went to (exaggerated) the office.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard What is? No, not like that! Just, Leonard went to the office.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon This would have worked out a lot better if you’d just told me you were going the office.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard I’m going to the office.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon See? Why don’t I believe you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard I’m going out for a while.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon Doesn’t anyone want to know where he’s going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 penny Okay, where is he going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon Leonard is going to (exaggerated) the office.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard So how was work today?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 girl Busy. I removed an appendix, a gall bladder and about a foot and a half of bowel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard I’m hoping that’s three different guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 girl No, just the one. He didn’t make it. So, how was your day?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard Oh, you know, I’m a physicist, so, I thought about stuff.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 girl That’s it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard Well, I wrote some of it down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 girl Are you done eating?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard Uh, yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 girl Oh, good. (Kisses him)
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard If I knew you were waiting, I would’ve swallowed that lasagna whole.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 phone_rings_answering_machine You’ve reached Dr. Stephanie Barnett. Leave a message. Beep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_ Hey, Steph, it’s me again, Howard. Listen, if you’re free Friday, maybe we could have a little something to eat at my place. My mom cooks a hell of a brisket. Let me know. It’s Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard I’ve had her brisket. Melts in your mouth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 steph Maybe we should think about going to the bedroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard That’s a good idea. There’s a bed in there, and I’m very, very, very pro-bed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 phone_rings_answering_machine You’ve reached Dr. Stephanie Barnett. Leave a message. Beep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_ Hey, it’s me again. Just want to let you know the head count for dinner Friday has gone up. My Aunt Betty and Uncle Elliot are coming in from Palm Springs. Oh, and if anybody should ask, you’re half-Jewish on your mother’s side. Okay, call me. It’s Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard Don’t you think we should tell him you’re not interested?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 steph Do you want me to stop and call him back right now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard Dear God, no!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 steph_ Oh, Leonard…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 phone_rings_answering_machine You’ve reached Dr. Stephanie Barnett. Leave a message. Beep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_ Hey, it’s me again. Howard. Listen, my cousins from Fort Lauderdale are flying in to meet you so that means we’re gonna have to move the dinner to a restaurant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howards_mother_ Tell her we’re going to the Olive Garden! I have a coupon from the paper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_ We’re not going to the Olive Garden, Mom!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howards_mother_ Oh, Mr. Bigshot with his Red Lobster.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_ I’ll call you back when we firm up the details. It’s Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 penny Oh, hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 penny New shirts?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard Yeah, a couple.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 penny Nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard  Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 penny So, who’s the girl?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard I’m sorry?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 penny Well, last time you bought a new shirt was when we were dating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard So, uh, what we did was in fact dating?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 penny Well, yeah, we did have a date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard Exactly. Thank you. Do me a favour, tell Koothrappali that next time you see him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 penny So, who is she?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard Oh, she’s a doctor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 penny Oh, nice. A doctor doctor, or a you kind of doctor?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard Doctor doctor. Surgical resident. Smart, pretty. Let me ask you something. If your friend thinks he’s dating someone, but he’s not because, in fact, you’re dating her, does that make you a bad person?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 penny Well, that depends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard On what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 penny Is that friend Wolowitz?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 penny Screw him. You’re fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard Are you sure?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 penny Well, have you slept with her yet? You dog! Good for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard Does that change things?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard So why’d you ask?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 penny I’m nosy. See ya.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howards_mother_ Howard, get the door!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_ Really? Is that what you do when someone knocks? Thank you. I had no idea! (opening door) Hey, buddy. What brings you to my little slice of hell?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howards_mother_ Who is it?!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard It’s Leonard!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howards_mother_ You’re gonna have to play outside! I’m not dressed to receive!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard No one cares, Ma! So, what’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard Listen, I need to talk to you about something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_ Momentito. Yello. Oh, Stephanie, thanks for calling me back. I was worried… Oh… Uh-huh… Uh-huh… Uh-huh… No, I understand… Sure, we can be friends. Absolutely. Thanks for calling. Yeah, you have a nice day, too. (To Leonard) You are dead to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 raj Okay, who gets the extra dumpling?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 all Rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon Okay, one of us is going to have to stop putting up Spock.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard How do we decide that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 all Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock. Oh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard Oh, hey, guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 raj Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard Hi, Howard. Howard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon Howard is employing a schoolyard paradigm in which you are, for all intents and purposes, deceased. He intends to act on this by not speaking to you, feigning an inability to hear you when you speak and otherwise refusing to acknowledge your existence.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard That’s just ridiculous. Why are you cooperating with him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon I don’t make the rules, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard Howard, come on, I didn’t plan on this. These things just happen. Usually not to me, but they do happen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard Did someone just feel a cold breeze?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon I believe this is an extension of the death metaphor. The cold breeze is the so-called ectoplasmic issue of a disembodied soul passing by.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 raj You know, screw it, I’m just gonna eat the dumpling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_ Oh, hi, Steph, come on in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 steph  Is this a bad time?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard Yeah, but I don’t see a better one on the horizon, so…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard Oh, if it isn’t Mrs. Dead to Me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 steph Hello, Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon Look I’m sorry, you violated the terms of your metaphor by acknowledging her existence. I’m out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard He just won’t listen to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 steph Okay, I guess it’ll just be the three of us then.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard Hmm. Lisa’s gonna be disappointed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 steph Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard Lisa?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 steph Yeah, my roommate. She just went through a really bad breakup and I thought she might like to meet somebody fun like you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard Leonard, Stephanie, you’re alive, it’s a miracle!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard So, anyway, Lisa, I just wanted to tell you again how much I enjoyed the other night, and again, I’m sorry for how it ended. But again, if you could let me know about Friday. My mother needs a head count so she can know how big a brisket to get.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard Howard, Howard, look at this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard Anyway, call me. It’s Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 voice_from_tv The possibility of life on Mars has long fascinated scientists and laypersons alike. It’s unclear how the Mars Rover got into the crevice, but one thing’s certain, the data which it has sent back contain the first clear indications that there may have been life on Mars. It’s a scientific discovery that has staggering implications for all mankind. Unfortunately, we’ll never know who’s responsible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard Son of a bitch.
