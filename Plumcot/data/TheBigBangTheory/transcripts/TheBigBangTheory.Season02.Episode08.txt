TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Oh look, Saturn 3 is on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 raj_koothrappali I don’t want to watch Saturn 3. Deep Space Nine is better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon_cooper How is Deep Space Nine better than Saturn 3?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Simple subtraction will tell you it’s six better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Compromise. Watch Babylon 5.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon_cooper In what sense is that a compromise?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Well, five is partway between three… Never mind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 raj_koothrappali I’ll tell you what, how about we go rock-paper-scissors?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Ooh, I don’t think so. No, anecdotal evidence suggests that in the game of rock-paper-scissors, players familiar with each other will tie 75 to 80% of the time due to the limited number of outcomes. I suggest rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 raj_koothrappali What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon_cooper It’s very simple. Look, scissors cuts paper. Paper covers rock. Rock crushes lizard. Lizard poisons Spock. Spock smashes scissors. Scissors decapitates lizard. Lizard eats paper. Paper disproves Spock. Spock vaporizes rock. And as it always has, rock crushes scissors.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Okay, I think I got it. (They prepare)
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 together#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 Rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock! (Both hold up the symbol for Spock) Oh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Hello, boys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Ahoy, matey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Noticed the eye patch, did you? It’s all part of a technique I’ve been studying for picking up women. You employ a visual display designed to make yourself distinctive and memorable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Oh yes, like the male peacock with brilliant plumage or the rutting baboon with engorged hindquarters.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Or in this case, the bar mitzvah boy with pinkeye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Mock me if you will, but it works. You show up at a club in something distinctive, scope out your target and toss out some negs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 raj_koothrappali What are negs?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_wolowitz A neg is a negative compliment that throws a pretty woman off her game, like “Normally, I’m not turned on by big teeth, but on you, they work.” I’ve got a whole list of ’em. Who wants to be my wingman?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter You’re not gonna need wingman, you’re gonna need a paramedic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 penny Howard, your scooter’s blocking my car. Aw, did you get pinkeye again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Step one, she notices the eye patch. May I say, Penny, not a lot of women could look as hot as you do with such greasy hair? (She reaches out, pulls his eye patch away from his face, then lets go allowing the elastic to spring it back into place.)
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 penny Yeah, just move your stupid scooter before I pick it up and throw it in the dumpster.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Ow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon_cooper I’m sorry, but I’m not going to watch the Clone Wars TV series until I’ve seen the Clone Wars movie. I prefer to let George Lucas disappoint me in the order he intended.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Well, I want to watch it now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Then I believe we’ve arrived at another quintessential rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock moment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Watch whatever you want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 raj_koothrappali I saw what you did there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon_cooper What did I do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Hello. Hey, Howard. What’s wrong? Okay. Okay, we’ll be right there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon_cooper What happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Howard’s at the Mars Rover lab. He says he’s in trouble. Defcon 5.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Defcon 5? Well, there’s no need to rush.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Defcon 5 means no danger. Defcon 1 is a crisis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter How can 5 not be worse than 1?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Yeah, Star Trek V, worse than I.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Okay, first of all, that’s a comparison of quality, not intensity. Secondly, Star Trek I is orders-of-magnitude worse than Star Trek V.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Are you joking? Star Trek V is the standard against which all badness is measured.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon_cooper No, no, no. Star Trek V has specific failures in writing and direction, while Star Trek I fails across the board, art direction, costuming, music, sound editing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Can we just forget I said Defcon and go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Star Trek V!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 raj_koothrappali I have three words for you. Wrath of Khan.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Oh, thank God, you’re here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter What’s the emergency?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_wolowitz I got the Mars Rover stuck in a ditch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Where?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_wolowitz On a dusty highway just outside Bakersfield. Where do you think? On Mars!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 woman_#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 Howard, is everything okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Yeah, baby, I’ll be right in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon_cooper You brought a girl to the Mars Rover control room?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Yeah, I picked her up in the bar. She’s a doctor. One free barium enema and my mother won’t care she’s not Jewish.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Wait a minute, so the eye patch and the insults worked?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_wolowitz No, there were three other guys with eye patches, iIt was a fiasco. What did work was, “How’d you like to visit a secret government facility?”
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon_cooper So what exactly do you want us to do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_wolowitz I need you and Raj to help me get the Rover out of the ditch, and I need you to get Stephanie out before somebody notices she’s here. She doesn’t exactly have clearance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Really? They don’t let strange women from honky-tonks come in and play with $200million government projects on distant planets?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Yes, I was bad. Maybe she’ll spank me. Can we please move on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 Hey, Howard, you know, it’s getting late, so do I get to drive this thing or what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Yeah. No. I’m sorry, but something’s come up. Kind of a Mars Rover, Mars Rover, can Howard come over, situation. So my friend Leonard is gonna take you home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 Oh, okay. Let’s go, friend Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_wolowitz I’ll call ya.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 Yeah. So are you a scientist like Howard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter No one’s a scientist like Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_wolowitz My mother is so gonna love her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Oh, how nice. Maybe they can carpool when they visit you in federal prison.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 I’m sorry. I totally interrupted you. What, what, what were you saying?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Just said Howard’s a terrific guy. He’s got a great sense of humour, he loves his mother, a lot, some people say too much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 I really like that you’re such a loyal friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I am loyal. You know, if you look at the big picture. Just, out of curiosity, did he ever have a shot with you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 Are you insane? The guy was wearing an eye patch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Then why did you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 He said that I could drive a car on Mars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Got it. So, can I see you again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 You’re not gonna see me now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Ooh. Cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Anything?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Actually, I was just checking my e-mail. But, uh, no, the Rover is not responding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon_cooper I believe the appropriate metaphor here involves a river of excrement and a Native American water vessel without any means of propulsion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Hang on, there’s got to be other options.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 raj_koothrappali You could try calling Triple-A, but based on NASA’s latest timetable, they won’t get there for 35 years.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Plus I understand you have to be standing next to the vehicle with your card when they arrive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Oh, snap.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Snap what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_wolowitz OK, I guess we have to turn to Plan B.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 raj_koothrappali What’s Plan B?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Erase all the hard drives, scrap the surveillance tapes, wipe our fingerprints off every surface and run.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Why wasn’t that Plan A?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Thank God for Plan B.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 penny Howard, didn’t you say you worked on the Mars Rover?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_wolowitz No, you’re mistaken.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 penny Yeah, when we first met, you said that if I went out with you, I could drive a car on Mars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_wolowitz I don’t know what you’re talking about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Psst! Psst!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Will you all excuse me? Leonard is subtly signalling that he’d like to talk to me in private.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 penny No. Yeah, I remember specifically. You started by asking if I was from Mars because my ass was out of this world.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Well, that does sound like me, but no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Is there some problem?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Yeah. Listen, I have to kinda sneak out for a while.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon_cooper All right, goodbye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter No, wait! If anyone asks you where I went, you don’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Where are you going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter I can’t tell you that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Who would ask me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter I can’t tell you that, either.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon_cooper So you brought me in here to inform me that you can’t tell me where you’re going and you can’t tell me who might ask?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I really didn’t think this through.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Leonard, a moment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon_cooper If someone, and of course, we don’t know who this would be, does ask where you’ve gone, what should I say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter I don’t know. Just tell them I went to the office.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Are you going to the office?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Then how can I say it convincingly?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Just say, Leonard went to the office.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon_cooper All right. Leonard went to (exaggerated) the office.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter What is? No, not like that! Just, Leonard went to the office.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon_cooper This would have worked out a lot better if you’d just told me you were going the office.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter I’m going to the office.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon_cooper See? Why don’t I believe you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter I’m going out for a while.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Doesn’t anyone want to know where he’s going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 penny Okay, where is he going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Leonard is going to (exaggerated) the office.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter So how was work today?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 Busy. I removed an appendix, a gall bladder and about a foot and a half of bowel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter I’m hoping that’s three different guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 No, just the one. He didn’t make it. So, how was your day?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Oh, you know, I’m a physicist, so, I thought about stuff.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 That’s it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Well, I wrote some of it down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 Are you done eating?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Uh, yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 Oh, good. (Kisses him)
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter If I knew you were waiting, I would’ve swallowed that lasagna whole.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 phone_rings_answering_machine#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 You’ve reached Dr. Stephanie Barnett. Leave a message. Beep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Hey, Steph, it’s me again, Howard. Listen, if you’re free Friday, maybe we could have a little something to eat at my place. My mom cooks a hell of a brisket. Let me know. It’s Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter I’ve had her brisket. Melts in your mouth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 dr_stephanie_barnett Maybe we should think about going to the bedroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter That’s a good idea. There’s a bed in there, and I’m very, very, very pro-bed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 phone_rings_answering_machine#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 You’ve reached Dr. Stephanie Barnett. Leave a message. Beep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Hey, it’s me again. Just want to let you know the head count for dinner Friday has gone up. My Aunt Betty and Uncle Elliot are coming in from Palm Springs. Oh, and if anybody should ask, you’re half-Jewish on your mother’s side. Okay, call me. It’s Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Don’t you think we should tell him you’re not interested?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 dr_stephanie_barnett Do you want me to stop and call him back right now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Dear God, no!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 dr_stephanie_barnett Oh, Leonard…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 phone_rings_answering_machine#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 You’ve reached Dr. Stephanie Barnett. Leave a message. Beep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Hey, it’s me again. Howard. Listen, my cousins from Fort Lauderdale are flying in to meet you so that means we’re gonna have to move the dinner to a restaurant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 debbie_wolowitz Tell her we’re going to the Olive Garden! I have a coupon from the paper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_wolowitz We’re not going to the Olive Garden, Mom!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 debbie_wolowitz Oh, Mr. Bigshot with his Red Lobster.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_wolowitz I’ll call you back when we firm up the details. It’s Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 penny Oh, hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 penny New shirts?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, a couple.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 penny Nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 penny So, who’s the girl?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter I’m sorry?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 penny Well, last time you bought a new shirt was when we were dating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter So, uh, what we did was in fact dating?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 penny Well, yeah, we did have a date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Exactly. Thank you. Do me a favour, tell Koothrappali that next time you see him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 penny So, who is she?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Oh, she’s a doctor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 penny Oh, nice. A doctor doctor, or a you kind of doctor?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Doctor doctor. Surgical resident. Smart, pretty. Let me ask you something. If your friend thinks he’s dating someone, but he’s not because, in fact, you’re dating her, does that make you a bad person?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 penny Well, that depends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter On what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 penny Is that friend Wolowitz?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 penny Screw him. You’re fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Are you sure?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 penny Well, have you slept with her yet? You dog! Good for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Does that change things?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter So why’d you ask?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 penny I’m nosy. See ya.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 debbie_wolowitz Howard, get the door!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Really? Is that what you do when someone knocks? Thank you. I had no idea! (opening door) Hey, buddy. What brings you to my little slice of hell?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 debbie_wolowitz Who is it?!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_wolowitz It’s Leonard!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 debbie_wolowitz You’re gonna have to play outside! I’m not dressed to receive!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_wolowitz No one cares, Ma! So, what’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Listen, I need to talk to you about something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Momentito. Yello. Oh, Stephanie, thanks for calling me back. I was worried… Oh… Uh-huh… Uh-huh… Uh-huh… No, I understand… Sure, we can be friends. Absolutely. Thanks for calling. Yeah, you have a nice day, too. (To Leonard) You are dead to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Okay, who gets the extra dumpling?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 all@ Rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Okay, one of us is going to have to stop putting up Spock.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_wolowitz How do we decide that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 all@ Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock. Oh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Oh, hey, guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Hi, Howard. Howard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Howard is employing a schoolyard paradigm in which you are, for all intents and purposes, deceased. He intends to act on this by not speaking to you, feigning an inability to hear you when you speak and otherwise refusing to acknowledge your existence.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter That’s just ridiculous. Why are you cooperating with him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon_cooper I don’t make the rules, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Howard, come on, I didn’t plan on this. These things just happen. Usually not to me, but they do happen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Did someone just feel a cold breeze?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon_cooper I believe this is an extension of the death metaphor. The cold breeze is the so-called ectoplasmic issue of a disembodied soul passing by.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 raj_koothrappali You know, screw it, I’m just gonna eat the dumpling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Oh, hi, Steph, come on in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 dr_stephanie_barnett Is this a bad time?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, but I don’t see a better one on the horizon, so…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Oh, if it isn’t Mrs. Dead to Me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 dr_stephanie_barnett Hello, Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Look I’m sorry, you violated the terms of your metaphor by acknowledging her existence. I’m out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter He just won’t listen to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 dr_stephanie_barnett Okay, I guess it’ll just be the three of us then.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Hmm. Lisa’s gonna be disappointed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 dr_stephanie_barnett Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Lisa?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 dr_stephanie_barnett Yeah, my roommate. She just went through a really bad breakup and I thought she might like to meet somebody fun like you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Leonard, Stephanie, you’re alive, it’s a miracle!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_wolowitz So, anyway, Lisa, I just wanted to tell you again how much I enjoyed the other night, and again, I’m sorry for how it ended. But again, if you could let me know about Friday. My mother needs a head count so she can know how big a brisket to get.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Howard, Howard, look at this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Anyway, call me. It’s Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 voice_from_tv#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 The possibility of life on Mars has long fascinated scientists and laypersons alike. It’s unclear how the Mars Rover got into the crevice, but one thing’s certain, the data which it has sent back contain the first clear indications that there may have been life on Mars. It’s a scientific discovery that has staggering implications for all mankind. Unfortunately, we’ll never know who’s responsible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Son of a bitch.
