TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon Penny, hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny Hey, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon What is shaking?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny I’m sorry?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon It’s colloquial, a conversation opener. So, do you find the weather satisfying? Are you currently sharing in the triumph of some local sports team?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny What’s wrong with you? you’re freaking me out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon I’m striking up a casual conversation with you. S’u’up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny Please don’t do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon All right, But I’m given to understand that when you have something awkward to discuss with someone, it’s more palatable to preface it with banal chit chat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny So, this wasn’t the awkward part?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny Oh, all right. S’u’up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon Oh, good, I used that right. Anyway, you’re aware that Leonard has entered into a new romantic relationship which includes a sexual component?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny Okay, feeling the awkward now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon Her name is Dr. Stephanie Barnett and she is a highly distinguished surgical resident at Freemont Memorial.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny Yeah, Leonard told me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon Good. What he may have left out is how important this relationship is to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny To you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon Yes, see, of the handful of women Leonard’s been involved with, she’s the only one I have ever found tolerable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny Well, what about me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon The statement stands for itself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny Well, aren’t you sweet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon Anyway, should you have any interaction with her, it would be most helpful that she not see you as a sexual rival.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny Yeah, I think she’s pretty safe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon You say that now, but consider the following scenario, you’re sitting in your apartment, it’s late, you’re alone, your hypothalamus is swimming in a soup of estrogen and progesterone and suddenly even Leonard seems like a viable sexual candidate, or a, uh, hookup as it’s referred to by today’s urban youth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon Yes. Now, should that happen, I would ask you to find some way to suppress your libido.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny I could think about you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon Fine, whatever works.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny Always nice talking to you, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon Uh, peace out!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon Well, this is very pleasant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard I’m glad you’re enjoying yourself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon And you said there’d never be enough pasta for the three of us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard I stand corrected.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon You know, Italian housewives have a rule of thumb. A handful of dry pasta about an inch in diameter is sufficient for each person as it doubles in volume when cooked.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 steph That’s very interesting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard She doesn’t mean it. She’s just being nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon Well, Stephanie, since Leonard seems to be dropping the conversational ball, I guess I’ll just have to pick it up. Have you ever witnessed a violent crime?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 steph No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon Good. What’s your favourite fruit?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 steph Ih-uh, strawberries.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon Hmm, technically not a fruit, but all right. Where did you do your medical internship?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 steph Uh, Lawrence Memorial in Galveston, Texas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon Really? That’s where I was born!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 steph You’re kidding!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon I spent so much of my childhood at that hospital. When I was 12, I got to ride there in a helicopter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 steph Why, what-what-what happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon Radiation burns. A little mishap while I was building my own cat scanner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 steph I’m sorry, you tried to build your own cat scanner?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon No, I didn’t try, I succeeded. In fact, I was briefly able to see the inside of my sister’s guinea pig, Snowball, before he caught fire. It led to an interesting expression in our house, not a snowball’s chance in a cat scanner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard Uh, Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon Excuse me. When I come back, just for fun, the subject will be alternative history. Specifically, how would the civil war have gone differently if Lincoln had been a robot sent from the future? Look at that, there’s even pasta left over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard Do you understand that this was supposed to be a date?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon I do. Do you? Because frankly, you’ve been in a foul mood since I sat down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard Okay, here’s my question, why did you sit down?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon To help. Look, if you fail at this relationship, and history suggests you will, then we risk losing the medical officer that our landing party has always needed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard What landing party?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon You’re Kirk, I’m Spock, Wolowitz is Scotty, Koothrappali is the guy who always gets killed, and now we’ve got McCoy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 steph So, we’re all standing around looking at the post-op x ray and there it is, clear as day, right in the guy’s chest cavity, one of my earrings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard Oh, my god, what did you do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 steph What do you think I did? I discreetly slipped off the other earring, put it in my pocket and then got the hell out of there!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon I have a bone to pick with you, sir.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard Oo-oo-oh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 steph Hi, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon Hi, Stephanie. I’m sorry I’m late, but your companion left the most indecipherable invitation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard What invitation?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon We’re going to the movies. What movie? What theatre? What time? If you were trying to make it impossible to locate you, you couldn’t have done a better job.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard Oh, clearly I could have.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon It took me nearly 20 minutes to go through the browser history on your computer to see what movie times you looked up. Wait here, I’ll find us seats.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 steph No, no, we have seats.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard Not the right seats. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 steph What is he doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard He’s finding the acoustic sweet spot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 steph Does he always do this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard Sometimes he brings a toy xylophone. I am really sorry about this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 steph No, it’s fine. you know, he’s sweet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon My apologies, you’ve been sitting in it all along. Leonard, you want to slide over one?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard No, just sit here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon Oh, yeah, this is it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon Leonard Leonard Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard What, Sheldon? What, Sheldon? What, Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon Tell me what you see here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard The blunt instrument that will be the focus of my murder trial?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon This is Stephanie’s facebook page. Now, where it should say in a relationship, what does it say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard Stephanie Barnett is single.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon Yeah, furthermore, earlier this evening, she threw a digital sheep at some guy named Mike. Who’s Mike? Why does he get a digital sheep and not you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard It’s just her facebook page and we’ve only been going out a couple of weeks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon You don’t see it, do you? We’re losing her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard Okay, I’m going to make this very simple for you. You are not in this relationship, I am. Ergo, you have no say in anything that happens between me and Stephanie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon I’m afraid I can’t allow that. Pursuant to Starfleet General Order 104 Section A, you are deemed unfit and I hereby relieve you of your command.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard General Order 104, Section A does not apply in this situation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon Give me one good reason why not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard Because this is not Star Trek
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon Penny Penny Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon This is banana bread.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny This is a door knob.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon It’s my understanding that an unsolicited gift of food can be a precursor to an impromptu invitation to come in and chat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny Sheldon, would you like to come in?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon I suppose I could spare a few minutes. Were you robbed?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon How can you be sure?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny Sheldon, what do you want?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon I’m certain this will come as no surprise to you, but Leonard is failing in yet another relationship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny He’s having problems with Stephanie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon She’s sending virtual livestock to random men on the internet. If I have any hope of keeping them together, I need data. Specifically, I need to know exactly what Leonard did that caused you to pop an emotional cap in his buttocks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon Again, urban slang. In which, I believe I’m gaining remarkable fluency. So, what is the down and the low? And don’t worry, this is all entirely confidential, so, you feel free to include any and all shortcomings in the bedroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny We never got to the bedroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon Because?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny Oh, okay, all right, you know what? I’ll tell you what happened. We were young, we were very much in love, but we could only communicate through a time-traveling mailbox at my lake house.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon It’s not enough that you made me watch that movie, but now you mock me with it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon Gentlemen, I have a question about dating and relationships.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 raj You told me you were going to have the talk with him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 howard I’ve been waiting for someone to have the talk with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon More to the point, it’s about finding a way to keep Leonard and Stephanie together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 howard Oh, I don’t think you can.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon Well, why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 howard Look at Leonard’s record. 27 days with Joyce Kim.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 raj During which she defected to North Korea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 howard Two booty calls with Leslie Winkle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 raj For which she awarded him the nickname “speed of light Leonard.”
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 howard And a three hour dinner with Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 raj Which would have been two and a half if they ordered the souffle when they sat down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 howard Based on the geometric progression, his relationship with Stephanie should have ended after 20 minutes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon Yes, I’m aware of the math, Y equals 27 days over 12 to the nth, the issue remains, how do we circumvent his inevitable rejection?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 raj Well, if you want to guarantee his appeal to Stephanie, your best bet would be to kill all the other men on the planet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 howard I’ll tell you what you shouldn’t do. Don’t spritz him with that body spray from the commercial where the women undress when they smell it, that doesn’t work at all, no matter how much you put on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon So, that’s all you’ve got? Apocalyptic genocide and go easy on the cologne?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 howard Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 raj Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon Penny Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon Penny. Zucchini bread.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny Oh, thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon May I come in?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon I see. Apparently my earlier inquiry regarding you and Leonard crossed some sort of line. I apologize.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny Well, thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon So, have you and I returned to a social equilibrium?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon Great. New topic. Where are you in your menstrual cycle?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon I’ve been doing some research online, and apparently female primates, you know, uh, apes, chimpanzees, you, they find their mate more desirable when he’s being courted by another female. Now, this effect is intensified when the rival female is secreting the pheromones associated with ovulation. Which brings me back to my question, where are you in . Clearly, I’m 14 days too early.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard All I’m saying is if they can cure yellow fever and malaria, why can’t they do something about lactose intolerance?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 steph Leonard, you’re going to have to let this go. You had a little cheese dip, you farted, I thought it was cute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon Oh, hi Stephanie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 steph Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard Want some more wine?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 steph Yeah, I assume I’m not driving anywhere tonight. .
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon I have a craving for white asparagus that apparently is destined to go unsatisfied.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard Excuse me. What the hell is wrong with you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon I’m helping you with Stephanie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard By making constipated moose sounds?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon When I fail to open this jar and you succeed it will establish you as the alpha male. You see, when a female witnesses an exhibition of physical domination she produces the hormone oxytocin. If the two of you then engage in intercourse this will create the biochemical reaction in the brain which lay people naively interpret as falling in love.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard Huh? Would it work if I just punched you in the face?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon Yes, actually it would, but let’s see how the lid goes. I’m not strong enough, Leonard, you’ll have to do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard Oh, for god’s sakes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon Go ahead, it’s pre-loosened.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 steph Do you want some help with that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard No, no, no, I got it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon No, yeah, yeah, he’s got it, and that’s not surprising. This is something I long ago came to peace with in my role as the beta male. Open it. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 steph Oh my god, are you okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard No, I’m not. I’m bleeding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon Like a gladiator!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 steph Oh, honey, you’re going to need stitches.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard Stitches? With a needle?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 steph Well, yeah, I mean, just a few.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard Oh, okay, yeah, hang on a sec. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon FYI, I was defrosting a steak in there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon What a beautiful job Stephanie did. I might have gone with a mattress suture instead of a blanket stitch, but you can’t argue with her results. It’s a shame it won’t scar, the war wound is a time-honoured badge of masculinity.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard I can’t remember a time when you weren’t talking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon Just for the record, my efforts to establish you as the alpha male were not aided by you bursting into tears.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard I did not burst into tears, my eyes just got a little watery.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon Watery?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard She stuck a needle into my hand!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 steph Hey, how’s my big cry baby?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard I didn’t cry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 steph Okay, I’m just teasing you. But, yeah, you did. Alright, it’s all good. what do you say we get you home and put you to bed?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard Oh, are you still going to spend the night?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 steph Uh, no, I think that you probably need to rest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon She’s right, as long as you’re vomiting, coitus is contra-indicated.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard Thank you, Dr. Cooper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon You’re welcome, Dr. Hofstadter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 steph Okay, I’m going to go get your discharge papers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon Well, you seem like a perfectly pleasant person. I just can’t understand why women have such a hard time loving you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard Hey, can you open this for me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 raj Can I see your stitches?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard Sure. .
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 raj Answering the question once and for all why Wolowitz bailed out of medical school.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny Leonard, congratulations.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard What for?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny Your facebook status update. Leonard Hofstadter is in a relationship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard What? no. no, that’s not right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 howard Oh, man, did you switch your status before she did? Speaking as an expert, way to look needy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny Seriously? You went first, after only two weeks? That’s bold.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard It’s not bold, it’s a mistake. I didn’t change my status.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny Well, then who did?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon I had no choice, he cried in front of her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard You hacked my facebook account?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon Oh, it’s hardly hacking when you use the same password for everything, Kal-el.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard Are you insane? Now she’s going to think I’m desperate. You’ve destroyed this relationship! And you want to know what the worst part is? You don’t even understand what you did wrong because you can’t conceive of something that you are not an expert in!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon In which I am not an expert.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard Don’t even! I don’t want to hear another word out of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny What’s wrong, Lassie? Timmy fall down the well? Oh, wow. She just updated her facebook status.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 howard Stephanie Barnett is in a relationship with Leonard Hofstadter.”
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard Really? Oh, look at that, I have a girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon If I am permitted to speak again, Dr. Sheldon Cooper for the win.
