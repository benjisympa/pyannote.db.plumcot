TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Penny, hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny Hey, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper What is shaking?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny I’m sorry?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper It’s colloquial, a conversation opener. So, do you find the weather satisfying? Are you currently sharing in the triumph of some local sports team?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny What’s wrong with you? you’re freaking me out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper I’m striking up a casual conversation with you. S’u’up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny Please don’t do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper All right, But I’m given to understand that when you have something awkward to discuss with someone, it’s more palatable to preface it with banal chit chat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny So, this wasn’t the awkward part?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny Oh, all right. S’u’up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Oh, good, I used that right. Anyway, you’re aware that Leonard has entered into a new romantic relationship which includes a sexual component?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny Okay, feeling the awkward now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Her name is Dr. Stephanie Barnett and she is a highly distinguished surgical resident at Freemont Memorial.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny Yeah, Leonard told me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Good. What he may have left out is how important this relationship is to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny To you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Yes, see, of the handful of women Leonard’s been involved with, she’s the only one I have ever found tolerable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny Well, what about me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper The statement stands for itself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny Well, aren’t you sweet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Anyway, should you have any interaction with her, it would be most helpful that she not see you as a sexual rival.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny Yeah, I think she’s pretty safe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper You say that now, but consider the following scenario, you’re sitting in your apartment, it’s late, you’re alone, your hypothalamus is swimming in a soup of estrogen and progesterone and suddenly even Leonard seems like a viable sexual candidate, or a, uh, hookup as it’s referred to by today’s urban youth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Yes. Now, should that happen, I would ask you to find some way to suppress your libido.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny I could think about you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Fine, whatever works.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny Always nice talking to you, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Uh, peace out!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Well, this is very pleasant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter I’m glad you’re enjoying yourself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper And you said there’d never be enough pasta for the three of us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter I stand corrected.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper You know, Italian housewives have a rule of thumb. A handful of dry pasta about an inch in diameter is sufficient for each person as it doubles in volume when cooked.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 dr_stephanie_barnett That’s very interesting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter She doesn’t mean it. She’s just being nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Well, Stephanie, since Leonard seems to be dropping the conversational ball, I guess I’ll just have to pick it up. Have you ever witnessed a violent crime?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 dr_stephanie_barnett No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Good. What’s your favourite fruit?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 dr_stephanie_barnett Ih-uh, strawberries.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Hmm, technically not a fruit, but all right. Where did you do your medical internship?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 dr_stephanie_barnett Uh, Lawrence Memorial in Galveston, Texas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Really? That’s where I was born!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 dr_stephanie_barnett You’re kidding!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper I spent so much of my childhood at that hospital. When I was 12, I got to ride there in a helicopter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 dr_stephanie_barnett Why, what-what-what happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Radiation burns. A little mishap while I was building my own cat scanner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 dr_stephanie_barnett I’m sorry, you tried to build your own cat scanner?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper No, I didn’t try, I succeeded. In fact, I was briefly able to see the inside of my sister’s guinea pig, Snowball, before he caught fire. It led to an interesting expression in our house, not a snowball’s chance in a cat scanner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Uh, Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Excuse me. When I come back, just for fun, the subject will be alternative history. Specifically, how would the civil war have gone differently if Lincoln had been a robot sent from the future? Look at that, there’s even pasta left over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Do you understand that this was supposed to be a date?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper I do. Do you? Because frankly, you’ve been in a foul mood since I sat down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Okay, here’s my question, why did you sit down?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper To help. Look, if you fail at this relationship, and history suggests you will, then we risk losing the medical officer that our landing party has always needed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter What landing party?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper You’re Kirk, I’m Spock, Wolowitz is Scotty, Koothrappali is the guy who always gets killed, and now we’ve got McCoy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 dr_stephanie_barnett So, we’re all standing around looking at the post-op x ray and there it is, clear as day, right in the guy’s chest cavity, one of my earrings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Oh, my god, what did you do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 dr_stephanie_barnett What do you think I did? I discreetly slipped off the other earring, put it in my pocket and then got the hell out of there!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper I have a bone to pick with you, sir.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Oo-oo-oh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 dr_stephanie_barnett Hi, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Hi, Stephanie. I’m sorry I’m late, but your companion left the most indecipherable invitation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter What invitation?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper We’re going to the movies. What movie? What theatre? What time? If you were trying to make it impossible to locate you, you couldn’t have done a better job.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Oh, clearly I could have.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper It took me nearly 20 minutes to go through the browser history on your computer to see what movie times you looked up. Wait here, I’ll find us seats.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 dr_stephanie_barnett No, no, we have seats.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Not the right seats.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 dr_stephanie_barnett What is he doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter He’s finding the acoustic sweet spot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 dr_stephanie_barnett Does he always do this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Sometimes he brings a toy xylophone. I am really sorry about this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 dr_stephanie_barnett No, it’s fine. you know, he’s sweet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper My apologies, you’ve been sitting in it all along. Leonard, you want to slide over one?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter No, just sit here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Oh, yeah, this is it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Leonard Leonard Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter What, Sheldon? What, Sheldon? What, Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Tell me what you see here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter The blunt instrument that will be the focus of my murder trial?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper This is Stephanie’s facebook page. Now, where it should say in a relationship, what does it say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Stephanie Barnett is single.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Yeah, furthermore, earlier this evening, she threw a digital sheep at some guy named Mike. Who’s Mike? Why does he get a digital sheep and not you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter It’s just her facebook page and we’ve only been going out a couple of weeks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper You don’t see it, do you? We’re losing her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Okay, I’m going to make this very simple for you. You are not in this relationship, I am. Ergo, you have no say in anything that happens between me and Stephanie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper I’m afraid I can’t allow that. Pursuant to Starfleet General Order 104 Section A, you are deemed unfit and I hereby relieve you of your command.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter General Order 104, Section A does not apply in this situation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Give me one good reason why not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Because this is not Star Trek
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Penny Penny Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper This is banana bread.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny This is a door knob.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper It’s my understanding that an unsolicited gift of food can be a precursor to an impromptu invitation to come in and chat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny Sheldon, would you like to come in?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper I suppose I could spare a few minutes. Were you robbed?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper How can you be sure?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny Sheldon, what do you want?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper I’m certain this will come as no surprise to you, but Leonard is failing in yet another relationship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny He’s having problems with Stephanie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper She’s sending virtual livestock to random men on the internet. If I have any hope of keeping them together, I need data. Specifically, I need to know exactly what Leonard did that caused you to pop an emotional cap in his buttocks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Again, urban slang. In which, I believe I’m gaining remarkable fluency. So, what is the down and the low? And don’t worry, this is all entirely confidential, so, you feel free to include any and all shortcomings in the bedroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny We never got to the bedroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Because?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny Oh, okay, all right, you know what? I’ll tell you what happened. We were young, we were very much in love, but we could only communicate through a time-traveling mailbox at my lake house.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper It’s not enough that you made me watch that movie, but now you mock me with it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Gentlemen, I have a question about dating and relationships.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 raj_koothrappali You told me you were going to have the talk with him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 howard_wolowitz I’ve been waiting for someone to have the talk with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper More to the point, it’s about finding a way to keep Leonard and Stephanie together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Oh, I don’t think you can.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Well, why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Look at Leonard’s record. 27 days with Joyce Kim.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 raj_koothrappali During which she defected to North Korea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Two booty calls with Leslie Winkle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 raj_koothrappali For which she awarded him the nickname “speed of light Leonard.”
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 howard_wolowitz And a three hour dinner with Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 raj_koothrappali Which would have been two and a half if they ordered the souffle when they sat down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Based on the geometric progression, his relationship with Stephanie should have ended after 20 minutes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Yes, I’m aware of the math, Y equals 27 days over 12 to the nth, the issue remains, how do we circumvent his inevitable rejection?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 raj_koothrappali Well, if you want to guarantee his appeal to Stephanie, your best bet would be to kill all the other men on the planet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 howard_wolowitz I’ll tell you what you shouldn’t do. Don’t spritz him with that body spray from the commercial where the women undress when they smell it, that doesn’t work at all, no matter how much you put on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper So, that’s all you’ve got? Apocalyptic genocide and go easy on the cologne?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 raj_koothrappali Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Penny Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Penny. Zucchini bread.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny Oh, thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper May I come in?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper I see. Apparently my earlier inquiry regarding you and Leonard crossed some sort of line. I apologize.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny Well, thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper So, have you and I returned to a social equilibrium?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Great. New topic. Where are you in your menstrual cycle?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper I’ve been doing some research online, and apparently female primates, you know, uh, apes, chimpanzees, you, they find their mate more desirable when he’s being courted by another female. Now, this effect is intensified when the rival female is secreting the pheromones associated with ovulation. Which brings me back to my question, where are you in . Clearly, I’m 14 days too early.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter All I’m saying is if they can cure yellow fever and malaria, why can’t they do something about lactose intolerance?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 dr_stephanie_barnett Leonard, you’re going to have to let this go. You had a little cheese dip, you farted, I thought it was cute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Oh, hi Stephanie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 dr_stephanie_barnett Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Want some more wine?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 dr_stephanie_barnett Yeah, I assume I’m not driving anywhere tonight. .
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper I have a craving for white asparagus that apparently is destined to go unsatisfied.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Excuse me. What the hell is wrong with you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper I’m helping you with Stephanie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter By making constipated moose sounds?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper When I fail to open this jar and you succeed it will establish you as the alpha male. You see, when a female witnesses an exhibition of physical domination she produces the hormone oxytocin. If the two of you then engage in intercourse this will create the biochemical reaction in the brain which lay people naively interpret as falling in love.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Huh? Would it work if I just punched you in the face?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Yes, actually it would, but let’s see how the lid goes. I’m not strong enough, Leonard, you’ll have to do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Oh, for god’s sakes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Go ahead, it’s pre-loosened.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 dr_stephanie_barnett Do you want some help with that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter No, no, no, I got it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper No, yeah, yeah, he’s got it, and that’s not surprising. This is something I long ago came to peace with in my role as the beta male. Open it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 dr_stephanie_barnett Oh my god, are you okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter No, I’m not. I’m bleeding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Like a gladiator!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 dr_stephanie_barnett Oh, honey, you’re going to need stitches.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Stitches? With a needle?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 dr_stephanie_barnett Well, yeah, I mean, just a few.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Oh, okay, yeah, hang on a sec.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper FYI, I was defrosting a steak in there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper What a beautiful job Stephanie did. I might have gone with a mattress suture instead of a blanket stitch, but you can’t argue with her results. It’s a shame it won’t scar, the war wound is a time-honoured badge of masculinity.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter I can’t remember a time when you weren’t talking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Just for the record, my efforts to establish you as the alpha male were not aided by you bursting into tears.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter I did not burst into tears, my eyes just got a little watery.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Watery?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter She stuck a needle into my hand!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 dr_stephanie_barnett Hey, how’s my big cry baby?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter I didn’t cry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 dr_stephanie_barnett Okay, I’m just teasing you. But, yeah, you did. Alright, it’s all good. what do you say we get you home and put you to bed?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Oh, are you still going to spend the night?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 dr_stephanie_barnett Uh, no, I think that you probably need to rest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper She’s right, as long as you’re vomiting, coitus is contra-indicated.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Thank you, Dr. Cooper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper You’re welcome, Dr. Hofstadter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 dr_stephanie_barnett Okay, I’m going to go get your discharge papers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Well, you seem like a perfectly pleasant person. I just can’t understand why women have such a hard time loving you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Hey, can you open this for me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 raj_koothrappali Can I see your stitches?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Sure. .
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 raj_koothrappali Answering the question once and for all why Wolowitz bailed out of medical school.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny Leonard, congratulations.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter What for?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny Your facebook status update. Leonard Hofstadter is in a relationship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter What? no. no, that’s not right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Oh, man, did you switch your status before she did? Speaking as an expert, way to look needy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny Seriously? You went first, after only two weeks? That’s bold.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter It’s not bold, it’s a mistake. I didn’t change my status.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny Well, then who did?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper I had no choice, he cried in front of her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter You hacked my facebook account?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Oh, it’s hardly hacking when you use the same password for everything, Kal-el.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Are you insane? Now she’s going to think I’m desperate. You’ve destroyed this relationship! And you want to know what the worst part is? You don’t even understand what you did wrong because you can’t conceive of something that you are not an expert in!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper In which I am not an expert.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Don’t even! I don’t want to hear another word out of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 penny What’s wrong, Lassie? Timmy fall down the well? Oh, wow. She just updated her facebook status.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Stephanie Barnett is in a relationship with Leonard Hofstadter.”
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Really? Oh, look at that, I have a girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode09 sheldon_cooper If I am permitted to speak again, Dr. Sheldon Cooper for the win.
