TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 dr_stephanie_barnett I don’t see anything at all, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Well, you’re the doctor, but I am constantly hearing this annoying sound.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Is it a high-frequency whistle?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter No, it’s more of a relentless, narcissistic drone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 dr_stephanie_barnett Yup, there’s no inflammation at all, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Then it must be a tumour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 dr_stephanie_barnett I Seriously doubt it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Maybe it’s a lingering bacterial infection from all those childhood toilet swirlies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Is that possible? I used to get those all the time. Even in church.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 dr_stephanie_barnett Well, you know, if it is from a swirly, there’s something I can do. Okay, circle, circle, dot, dot, now you have a cootie shot! I’m going to bed
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Okay, I’ll be right in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 sheldon_cooper It’s not enough that she mocks me, but that isn’t even the correct procedure for a cootie shot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Do you understand that Stephanie’s not here to treat your imaginary ailments?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 sheldon_cooper How is it imaginary that I keep hearing an octave above Middle C? Is that imaginary? I don’t think so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Leonard, there’s one more thing. Under Article One, Section Three of our Roommate Agreement, I’m calling an emergency meeting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter No, you’re not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Leonard moves the meeting not occur. Is there a second? None heard, the motion fails. I’d like to begin the meeting by congratulating you on the progress in your relationship with Dr. Stephanie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 sheldon_cooper That being said, we have to discuss the implementation of the agreed upon “cohabitation” rider which has been activated now that the two of you are living together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter We’re not living together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter That’s absurd.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 sheldon_cooper You initialed it. See? L.H., L.H., L.H.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Wait, I only initialed it because I never thought it would happen! I initialed another clause naming you my sidekick in case I get superpowers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Hmm, yes, you did. Now, to review the following provisions are hereby activated. In the refrigerator, as opposed to us having two separate shelves and one communal shelf, the three of us now get individual shelves and the door becomes communal. Next, apartment vacuuming shall be increased from two to three times a week to accommodate the increased accumulation of dead skin cells. Third,the bathroom schedule. Now, I’m given to understand women have different needs, so, we’ll have to discuss that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter I’m going to bed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 sheldon_cooper At least take this with you. Look, and have Stephanie initial here, here, here, here and here. This states that she does not now nor does she intend to play a percussive or brass instrument. Sure it sounds like a tumor pressing on the auditory nerve.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter No, absolutely not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 sheldon_cooper It’s not a big deal. We have latex gloves.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter I don’t care what the symptoms are, my girlfriend is not going to give you a prostate exam.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 dr_stephanie_barnett Hi, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Good morning, Dr. Stephanie. I trust Leonard satisfied you sexually last night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Oh come on! Sheldon, we don’t ask questions like that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 sheldon_cooper I heard you ask it over and over. How is it inappropriate for me to ask it once?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 dr_stephanie_barnett He did very nicely.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 sheldon_cooper See? She’s not offended. And now you finally have an answer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 penny Out of coffee. Need coffee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 dr_stephanie_barnett Uh, hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 penny Hi! Stephanie, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 dr_stephanie_barnett Uh-huh. And, and, and you are?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 penny I’m Penny, I live across the hall. I’ve heard a lot about you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 dr_stephanie_barnett Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 penny Mm-hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 dr_stephanie_barnett I haven’t heard a thing about you. Leonard? Why haven’t I heard a thing about this woman who lives across the hall and comes into your apartment in the morning in her underwear?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter She’s heard about you because we’re, you know, involved and you haven’t heard about her because… I never slept with her, I swear!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 sheldon_cooper In Leonard’s defence, it wasn’t for lack of trying.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Thank you, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 sheldon_cooper You’re welcome, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Look, I’m just saying, um, Penny is one of our many neighbours, you know, and in our building, neighbours come and go, it’s very casual, no dress code. In fact, some mornings I’ll just mosey down to the third floor in my pyjamas and have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Really? I have never once been invited to have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter She doesn’t like you. Um, well, uh, you have a gall bladder to remove and I have to get in the shower and Penny has clothes to put on, so…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 dr_stephanie_barnett Well, it was very nice meeting you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 penny Nice to finally meet you, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 dr_stephanie_barnett And I’ll see you tonight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Okay, bye-bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 dr_stephanie_barnett Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 sheldon_cooper What could I possibly have done to offend Mrs. Vartabedian?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 penny So, that’s Stephanie, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Why do I feel like I’m the one that just got the prostate exam?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 penny You know, she seems very nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Oh, she is. She’s terrific, and she’s proving to be a valuable roommate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 penny Roommate? You guys are living together?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Like hippies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter We’re not living together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Do I have to pull out the paperwork again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter We’re not living together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 penny Are you sure?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter How could I not be sure?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 penny Well, let’s find out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Don’t you think if a woman was living with me I’d be the first one to know about it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 penny Oh, sweetie, you’d be the last one to know about it. Hmm, cute dresses. I bet this looks great on you!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter We’re not living together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 penny Okay, hmm, scented candles, fuzzy slippers, ooh, floral bed sheets?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter We’re not living together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 penny Okay, moving on. Now, who are these guys at Disney World?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Uh, the big dog is Goofy, and the older couple with the mouse ears , I have no idea. We’re not living together!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 penny You’re going to go down swinging, huh? All right, well, we got your body lotion, your InStyle Magazine, your jewellery box.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter We’re not… Where’s my Bat Signal?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 penny You have a Bat Signal?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter I did. It was right here. She must’ve… Oh, my God, we’re living together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 penny Really? What was your first clue?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 howard_wolowitz New pants?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, Stephanie got them for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Nice. Cotton?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Actually, I think it’s more of wool, fire ant blend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 howard_wolowitz So, the girlfriend’s buying clothes for you, huh? Sounds serious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter It is actually. In fact, I gave it a lot of thought and I decided it was time for us to live together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Uh, Leonard, huge mistake. There’s a whole buffet of women out there and you’re just standing in the corner eating the same devilled egg over and over again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter At least I have an egg. What do you have?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 howard_wolowitz A veritable smorgasbord of potential sexual partners. See the blonde over there? I can hit on her and you can’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter So, go hit on her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 howard_wolowitz She’s not my type.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 raj_koothrappali Too bad, ’cause she was checking you out before.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 howard_wolowitz She was?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 raj_koothrappali Of course not. Look at her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter I don’t care what you guys think, Stephanie and I are very happy living together. I will give either of you 20 dollars, right now to trade pants with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 dr_stephanie_barnett Sheldon, what are you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Hang on. 130 over 80. A little high. We can attribute that to the stress of sneaking past the security desk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 dr_stephanie_barnett Where did you get the stethoscope and the blood pressure cuff?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 sheldon_cooper My aunt Marion gave them to me for my 12th birthday. She thought if I failed at theoretical physics that I should have a trade to fall back on. And by the way, the blood pressure cuff is called a sphygmomanometer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 dr_stephanie_barnett Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Didn’t they teach you that in medical school?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 dr_stephanie_barnett I’m kinda busy here, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 sheldon_cooper I understand. All I need is for you to authorize these tests.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 dr_stephanie_barnett A cardiac stress test, a full body MRI, an electromyogram, a CBC, baseline glucose, upper GI?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Oh, and an exploratory laparoscopy. Last time I had hiccups, it felt like my diaphragm was just going through the motions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 dr_stephanie_barnett Go home, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Can I at least have the upper GI? I already drank the barium!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 penny Oh hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Oh, good. Do you have any fabric softener?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 penny Yeah, sure. What are you washing? A crocodile?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter No, the pants that Stephanie got me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 penny Oh, sweetie, you can’t machine wash these. They’ll be ruined.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Are you sure?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 penny Absolutely.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Oh, no. I wish you’d told me that sooner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 penny Are you guys having problems?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter No, everything’s fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 penny Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Yeah. It’s wonderful. Okay, maybe this whole living together happened kind of suddenly, but it’s fine, it’s great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 penny Okay, Leonard, honey, you know, if you’re uncomfortable with the way things are going, you’re allowed to say something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Are you sure? That doesn’t sound right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 penny Believe me, your feelings are just as important as hers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter No that doesn’t sound right either.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 penny Just tell her you need the relationship to move at a pace that you both are comfortable with.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I could say something like that to her. I’ll go do that. Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 penny Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter You have a really good grasp on this. Maybe you could talk to her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 penny You’re kidding, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter No, but that’s okay. I’ll go talk to her. Want to come with?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 penny Go! Wow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 dr_stephanie_barnett Oh, no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Wha??
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 dr_stephanie_barnett You were right. Your larynx is terribly inflamed. I mean, I’ve never seen anything like it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 sheldon_cooper I knew it! What do I do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 dr_stephanie_barnett You’re going to need to stop talking immediately.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 sheldon_cooper For how…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 dr_stephanie_barnett Du-du-du-du! Immediately.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 dr_stephanie_barnett Oh, hi, honey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon. What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 dr_stephanie_barnett I just performed a Sheldonectomy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Careful, if you don’t get it all, it’ll only come back worse.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 dr_stephanie_barnett Gotcha.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Listen, we need to talk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 dr_stephanie_barnett Oh-oh. Do we need to talk or do we “need to talk”?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter I don’t know what that means.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 dr_stephanie_barnett Okay, why don’t you just tell me what it is you have to tell me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Okay, um, well, look, it’s just that things between you and me have been going pretty quick.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 dr_stephanie_barnett And?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter It’s just a little scary.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 dr_stephanie_barnett Well, yeah, but scary good, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Sure, when is scary not good? But, okay, um, I have feelings, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 dr_stephanie_barnett Uh-huh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Okay, and it’s perfectly okay to express those feelings, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 dr_stephanie_barnett Of course honey why don’t you tell me what it is you’re feeling?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Okay, well, I ju… I think it’s important to remember that we move at a pace that is our speed and… oh, shoot, I had it!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 dr_stephanie_barnett Okay, how about this? How about I tell you what I’m feeling?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter What’s that? Really? Right now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 dr_stephanie_barnett Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter I just ate, aren’t you supposed to wait an hour?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 dr_stephanie_barnett I think that’s for swimming.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Oh, okay. I just hope I don’t get cramps.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 dr_stephanie_barnett Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 penny Hey. Oh, I put your clothes in the dryer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 penny Your pants are ruined.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 penny So, how did the talk with Stephanie go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Well, um, on one level, really, really well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 penny So, you told her you wanted to slow things down?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Not specifically, but, uh, I did tell her that I had feelings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 penny Good, good. And then what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter And then the, the subject got changed somehow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 penny You had sex, didn’t you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Um, little bit. What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 penny Nothing. Okay, well, it sounds like things are going to work out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, yeah it’s all good. Everything’s going to work out. One way or another.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 penny Come on, Leonard, you are entitled to try and make things go the way you want them to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 penny Yes, you don’t always have to go along with what the woman wants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Huh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Nothing, just rethinking my whole life. Okay, here’s the thing, I’m afraid that if I ask her to move out, she’ll just dump me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 penny Well, it’s a chance you have to take. I mean, look, if it’s meant to be, it’ll be.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Very comforting. Okay, so what do I say to her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 penny I don’t know. I mean, what have women said to you when they wanted to slow a relationship down?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter I really like you, but I want to see how things go with Mark?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 penny Yeah, that’ll slow it down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 dr_stephanie_barnett I’m sorry, I totally interrupted you. What were you saying?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Oh, right, yeah, um, so, Stephanie, here’s the thing. I really like you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 dr_stephanie_barnett Oh, God, here comes the speech.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter What speech?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 dr_stephanie_barnett I really like you, but maybe we should spend a little less time together ‘cause I need my space but I’ll call you on Tuesday, and then you never call me so I call you, but you don’t call me back and then when I run into you at the coffee shop you pretend like you’ve been having problems with your voice mail and I know that you’re lying, but I pretend like I don’t care even though I’m dying inside!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter No! No, no! I wasn’t going to say any of that. I was just going to say, I really like you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 dr_stephanie_barnett Oh. Oh, good! ‘Cause I really like you, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Terrific.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 raj_koothrappali Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Hey. Nice sweater.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, Stephanie got it for me. It’s kind of fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 raj_koothrappali It’s got a big bird on it, dude.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, yeah, that’s the fun part. We’re also getting new curtains for my bedroom, and a dust ruffle, and a duvet, and I don’t even know what a duvet is but I’m pretty sure if I did I wouldn’t want one, but every time I talk to her about moving out she cries and we have sex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 raj_koothrappali You’re lucky. With me, it’s usually the other way around.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 howard_wolowitz You know, if you can’t talk to her, why don’t you just text her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Isn’t that kind of cowardly?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Oh, yeah. It’s beyond contemptible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 raj_koothrappali It’s true, but on the other hand you are wearing a bird sweater.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Sold. “I think it would be better for our relationship if you moved back to your place.” There. It’s done.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Good for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, good for me. I’ll never have sex again. I was wrong. See ya.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 penny Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 computer_voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 I have an inflamed larynx.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 penny Okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 computer_voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 We’re out of herbal tea. Do you have any?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 penny Okay, let me check.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 computer_voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 Some hiney would be nice, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 penny Hiney?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 computer_voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode10 Honey.
