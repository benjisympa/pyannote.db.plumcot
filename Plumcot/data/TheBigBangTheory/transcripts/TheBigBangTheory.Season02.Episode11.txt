TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Your argument is lacking in all scientific merit. It is well established Superman cleans his uniform by flying into Earth’s yellow sun, which incinerates any contaminate matter and leaves the invulnerable Kryptonian fabric unharmed and daisy fresh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 howard_wolowitz What if he gets something Kryptonian on it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Like what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 howard_wolowitz I don’t know. Kryptonian mustard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 sheldon_cooper I think we can safely assume that all Kryptonian condiments were destroyed when the planet Krypton exploded.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 raj_koothrappali Or it turned into mustard Kryptonite, the only way to destroy a rogue Kryptonian hotdog threatening Earth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Raj, please, let’s stay serious here. Superman’s body is Kryptonian, therefore his sweat is Kryptonian.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Yeah, what about Kryptonian pit stains?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Superman doesn’t sweat on Earth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Okay, he’s invited for dinner in the Bottle City of Kandor. He miniaturizes himself, enters the city where he loses his superpowers. Now, before dinner, his host says, “who’s up for a little Kryptonian tetherball?” Superman says “sure,” works up a sweat, comes back to Earth, his uniform now stained with indestructible Kryptonian perspiration.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 raj_koothrappali Booya.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Superman would have taken his uniform to a Kandorian dry cleaner before he left the Bottle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 raj_koothrappali “Kandorian dry cl…” I give up, you can’t have a rational argument with this man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Hey, isn’t that the guy who won the MacArthur genius grant last year? No, not all at once.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 raj_koothrappali Then how?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Leonard. Now, Raj. Now, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 raj_koothrappali I didn’t get a good look. Can I go again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 howard_wolowitz No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter It’s David Underhill. So what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 sheldon_cooper So what? His observation of high-energy positrons has provided the first conclusive evidence for the existence of galactic dark matter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter I have two words for you. The first is big, the other’s whoop.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 sheldon_cooper It is a big whoop. It made almost all the work you’ve done since you’ve been here completely useless.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Did not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Did, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Did…okay,maybe some of it,but,look,the guy was just in the right place, at the right time with the right paradigm-shifting reinterpretation of the universe. He got lucky.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 raj_koothrappali In more ways than one. He’s a very handsome man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Doesn’t do anything for me. If I was gonna go that way, I’m more of a Zac Ephron kinda guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 raj_koothrappali Oh, yeah, like you have a shot with Zac Ephron.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 dr_david_underhill Excuse me, Are you Leonard Hofstadter?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Uh, yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 dr_david_underhill I’m David Underhill.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Uh, y-yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 dr_david_underhill Yeah, Dr. Gablehauser said if I wanted to set something up in the photomultiplier lab, that you’d be able to give me a hand?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter You want to work with me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 dr_david_underhill Well, if you have a little time, yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Wow, y-yeah, sure. Yeah, no problem. Uh, Here’s my home number, here’s my cell, here’s my office, here’s my parents’ number up in New Jersey, they always know how to reach me. So…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 dr_david_underhill Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Congratulations on the MacArthur Grant, by the way. Big fan.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 dr_david_underhill Thanks. I’ll call you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Okay. Bye-bye! What are you looking at?You’ve never seen a hypocrite before?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 raj_koothrappali Trailing badly, Wolowitz needs a strike if he has any hopes of catching up with Sheldon Cooper, who is dominating in the ninth frame with a career-best 68.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Hey, guys!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 howard_wolowitz That doesn’t count. Do over! Do over!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 sheldon_cooper There are no do-overs in Wii bowling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 howard_wolowitz There are always do-overs when my people play sports.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Where were you that’s more important than Wii bowling night?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Actually, I was…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 sheldon_cooper It’s a rhetorical question. There is nothing more important than Wii bowling night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Come on, it’s just a video game. And we suck at it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Nice motivational speech from the team captain.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Where were you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter I was working with Dave Underhill.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Ooh, “Dave.” Sounds like Leonard’s got a new BFF.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Actually, he’s pretty cool. I mean, not only is he a brilliant scientist, but it turns out he’s a Black Diamond skier, he collects vintage motorcycles, he plays in a rock band.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 howard_wolowitz So? We’re in a rock band.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter No, we play Rock Band on our X-Box.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Nice motivational speech from our lead guitarist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter He’s funny, too. He does this hysterical impersonation of Stephen Hawking having phone sex. What are you wearing? That’s not, he does it better. Anyway, he said he was gonna take me to the gym tomorrow, so I’m gonna go practice my situps.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 raj_koothrappali Whoa. Humongous man crush, dude.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Yep. It’s officially a bro-mance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny Hey, Sheldon, are you and Leonard putting up a Christmas tree?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 sheldon_cooper No, because we don’t celebrate the ancient pagan festival of Saturnalia.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny Saturnalia?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Gather round, kids, it’s time for Sheldon’s beloved Christmas special.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 sheldon_cooper In the pre-Christian era, as the winter solstice approached and the plants died, pagans brought evergreen boughs into their homes as an act of sympathetic magic, intended to guard the life essences of the plants until spring. This custom was later appropriated by Northern Europeans and eventually it becomes the so-called Christmas tree.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 howard_wolowitz And that, Charlie Brown, is what boredom is all about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny Okay, well, thank you for that, but I got you and Leonard a few silly neighbour gifts, so I’ll just put them under my tree.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Wait! You bought me a present?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny Uh-huh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Why would you do such a thing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny I don’t know. ‘Cause it’s Christmas?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Oh, Penny. I know you think you’re being generous, but the foundation of gift-giving is reciprocity. You haven’t given me a gift, you’ve given me an obligation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Don’t feel bad, Penny, it’s a classic rookie mistake. My first Hanukkah with Sheldon, he yelled at me for eight nights.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny Now, honey, it’s okay.You don’t have to get me anything in return.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Of course I do. The essence of the custom is that I now have to go out and purchase for you a gift of commensurate value and representing the same perceived level of friendship as that represented by the gift you’ve given me. It’s no wonder suicide rates skyrocket this time of year.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny Okay, you know what? Forget it. I’m not giving you a present.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 sheldon_cooper No, it’s too late. I see it. That elf sticker says to Sheldon. The die has been cast, the moving finger has writ, Hannibal has crossed the Alps.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 howard_wolowitz I know. It’s funny when it’s not happening to us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny Sheldon, I am very, very sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 sheldon_cooper No. No, I brought this on myself by being such an endearing and important part of your life. I’m going to need a ride to the mall.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 howard_wolowitz It’s happening to us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Ow! Ow!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 dr_david_underhill Are you gonna make it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I guess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 dr_david_underhill All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Thanks for letting me try out your motorcycle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 dr_david_underhill No problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter I had no idea it was so heavy. The thing just fell right over on me, didn’t it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 dr_david_underhill Yeah. Lucky for you it wasn’t moving.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny Oh, hey, Leonard. Ooh, are you okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Oh, yeah. It’s just a little motorcycle accident.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny My God, how fast were you going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter I don’t know. It’s all such a blur.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 dr_david_underhill Ha ha ha. Good one. He couldn’t even get it started. Hi. Dave.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny Hi. Penny. So it’s your motorcycle?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 dr_david_underhill Uh-huh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny Oh, is it okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 dr_david_underhill It’s fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, lucky for the bike it landed on my leg.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 dr_david_underhill You mind giving me a hand with speed racer here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure. So, um, Dave, how do you know Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 dr_david_underhill I’m a physicist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny Ha-ha. No, you’re not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 dr_david_underhill Why is that so surprising?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny Uh, well, it’s just that the physicists I know are indoorsy and pale.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter I’m not indoorsy. I just wear the appropriate sun block because I don’t take melanoma lightly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny So, are you and Leonard working on an experiment together?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 dr_david_underhill Yeah, actually we are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, we’re examining the radiation levels of photomultiplier tubes for a new dark matter detector.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny Uh, sweetie, sweetie, Dave was talking. You know, I love science.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Since when?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny Since always. Call me a geek, but I am just nuts for the whole subatomic particle thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 dr_david_underhill The last thing I would ever call you is a geek.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny Ha. Well, that’s what I am, queen of the nerds.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 dr_david_underhill Well, if you like, I could show you the lab we’re working in. We’ve got some cool toys, you know, lasers and stuff.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny You know, I have always wanted to see a big science lab.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Since when?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny Since always.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 dr_david_underhill Leonard, are you okay here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Uh, yeah. I guess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 dr_david_underhill How ’bout we go see it now? Maybe afterwards we take the bike up the coast, we grab a little bite to eat…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny Um,yeah, yeah, that sounds great, let me just get my jacket.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 dr_david_underhill Boy, she’ll do, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, if you like that type.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 dr_david_underhill So, you and her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter No, just neighbours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 dr_david_underhill Really. I don’t know how you live next door to that without doing something about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Actually, science is my lady.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny Okay. Let’s go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 dr_david_underhill All right. See you tomorrow, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter See ya. ‘Bye, Penny. Have fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Yes? Did you forget your key?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 sheldon_cooper I don’t see anything in here a woman would want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 howard_wolowitz You’re kidding. You’ve got lotions and bath oils and soaps, that’s the estrogen hat trick.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter What it is is a cacophonous assault of eucalyptus, bayberry, cinnamon and vanilla. It’s as if my head were trapped in the pyjamas of a sultan.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 raj_koothrappali Sheldon, if you don’t like this stuff, let’s just go next door and build her a bear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 sheldon_cooper I told you before, bears are terrifying.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Come on, bath stuff, it’s perfect! You got a scented candle, a cleansing buff, spearmint and green tea scented bath oil, promotes relaxation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 sheldon_cooper That presupposes Penny is tense.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 raj_koothrappali She knows you. She’s tense. We all are. Buy a basket!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Excuse me, we’re ready.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 sheldon_cooper No, we’re not. Let’s say for a moment that I accept the bath item gift hypothesis, I now lay the following conundrum at your feet, which size?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 howard_wolowitz This one. Let’s go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 sheldon_cooper You put no thought into that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 howard_wolowitz I’m sorry. Uh, this one. Let’s go!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 sheldon_cooper I have insufficient data to proceed. Excuse me, miss?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 assistant#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 Yes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 sheldon_cooper If I were to give you this gift basket, based on that action alone and no other data, infer and describe the hypothetical relationship that exists between us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 assistant#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 Excuse me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Here. Now, are we friends? Colleagues? Lovers? Are you my grandmother?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 assistant#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 I don’t understand what you’re talking about and you’re making me a little uncomfortable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 howard_wolowitz See? Sounds just like you and Penny. We’ll take it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 dr_david_underhill Hey, Leonard. Come, join us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Oh, hey, Dave. And Penny, what a surprise.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny Hey, Leonard. Dave was just showing me around the university. You know, this place is unbelievable!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I know. I’ve been offering to show you around for a year and a half. You always said you had yoga.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny I never said that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Maybe I heard you wrong. A lot of words sound like yoga.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 dr_david_underhill This is an amazing woman, Leonard. She has a curious and agile mind, not to mention being curious and agile in other respects.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny Oh, shut up!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Yes, please shut up. So, um, Dave, don’t you think you and I should get back to the lab? You know, that dark matter isn’t going to detect itself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 dr_david_underhill Actually, I was thinking about taking the afternoon off so I could work on another experiment with Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny Really? We’re going to do an experiment?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 dr_david_underhill Uh-huh. We’re going to explore the effects of tequila shots on a gorgeous 22-year-old woman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny It’s not an experiment! You saw what happened last night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 dr_david_underhill You ready to go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny Yeah. Oh, can I drive the motorcycle?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 dr_david_underhill Yeah, why not? You can’t do any worse than Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter That’s funny. By the way, my leg is killing me. Thanks for asking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Mmm, great news, Leonard, I’ve solved my Penny gift dilemma.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Yippee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 sheldon_cooper You see, the danger was that I might under or over-reciprocate, but I have devised a foolproof plan. See, I will open her gift to me first and then excuse myself, feigning digestive distress.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Brilliant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 sheldon_cooper It is, isn’t it? Is it okay if I hide them in your room? The smell makes me nauseated.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Do whatever you want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Thank you, that’s very gracious. Gentlemen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Why couldn’t you have just done what Leonard did and get Penny a new boyfriend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter My leg is killing me. Thanks for asking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Okay, I have just one question for you. While I am perfectly happy with the way things are between us, you said that you didn’t want to go out with me because I was too smart for you! Well, news flash, lady, David Underhill is ten times smarter than me! You’d have to drive a railroad spike into his brain for me to beat him at checkers! Next to him, I’m like one of those sign-language gorillas who knows how to ask for grapes! So, my question is, what’s up with that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny Why are you yelling at me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry! Never mind, we’re cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny Dave is not smarter than you. He’s an idiot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Really? Why would you say that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny Because a smart guy takes the nude photos of his wife off his cell phone before he tries to take nude photos of his girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter He tried to take nude photos of you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny That’s what you took from that? The guy is married!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Oh, yeah. I’m so… oh, that’s terrible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny And you, if you are so okay with the way things are between us, why are you so jealous?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Well, uh, the important thing is he’s married and that’s terrible!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny Nice save, genius. Eggnog?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Lactose.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny It’s just rum. It stopped being eggnog like half an hour ago.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Smooth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny Smoother than you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Come on, it’s Christmas, just give me this one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny Okay, Merry Christmas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter By the way, my leg is killing me. Thanks for asking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny Merry Christmas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Merry Christmas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny How’s your leg?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Very good, thanks for asking. Come on in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Ah, good, Penny, you’re here to exchange gifts. You’ll be pleased to know I’m prepared for whatever you have to offer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny Okay, here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 sheldon_cooper I should note I’m having some digestive distress, so, if I excuse myself abruptly, don’t be alarmed. Oh, a napkin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny Turn it over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 sheldon_cooper To Sheldon, live long and prosper. Leonard Nimoy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny Yeah, he came into the restaurant. Sorry the napkin’s dirty. He wiped his mouth with it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 sheldon_cooper I possess the DNA of Leonard Nimoy?!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny Well, yeah, yeah, I guess. But look, he signed it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Do you realize what this means? All I need is a healthy ovum and I can grow my own Leonard Nimoy!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny Okay, all I’m giving you is the napkin, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Be right back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny Here. Open it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Oh, a gift certificate for motorcycle lessons. Very thoughtful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny Yeah, and I checked. Not letting the bike fall on you while standing still is lesson one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Oh, then, I think you’ll appreciate what I got you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny Okay. 101 Totally Cool Science Experiments for Kids.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter You know, ’cause you’re so into science.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny Sheldon! What did you do?!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 sheldon_cooper I know! It’s not enough, is it? Here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 penny Leonard, look! Sheldon’s hugging me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter It’s a Saturnalia miracle.
