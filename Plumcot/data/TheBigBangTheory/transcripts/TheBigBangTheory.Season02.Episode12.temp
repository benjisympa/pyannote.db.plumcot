TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howard All right, that’s the last servo. Behold the Mobile Omnidirectional Neutralization and Termination Eradicator. Or…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 all MONTE.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howard Featuring one articulated razor-sharp killing saw, one polycarbonate grinding and flipping wheel, steel armour plate exoskeleton top and bottom, and enough horsepower to drive a 110 pounds of mechanized death from zero to holy crap in 4.8 seconds.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 sheldon Is it wrong to say I love our killer robot?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 raj As with my father, I both love and fear it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howard All right, enough chitchat, let’s destroy something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 together One, two, three, go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 raj Okay. What shall be first to taste the wrath of Monte?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 leonard Maybe we should start small.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 raj Okay. Ooh, perhaps today is the day we finally find out what’s inside the Magic Eight Ball.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 sheldon Did it when I was four. It’s an icosahedral dye floating in tinted blue water.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 raj Man, call spoiler alert before you say things like that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 leonard How about the toaster oven?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 sheldon What did the toaster oven ever do to you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 leonard What did I ever do to Jimmy Mullins in the third grade? He still punched me in the face with my own fists. Sorry, you little nerd, you were just in the wrong boys’ room at the wrong time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howard Gentlemen, goggles.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 sheldon Yeah, this is an auspicious moment. Yeah, like Robert Oppenheimer or Neil Armstrong, we need the appropriate words to mark this historic scientific event.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 raj How about “Die, toaster, die”?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 leonard That’ll do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 raj All right, what’s next?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 penny No, I think I’m just going to stay in tonight and do laundry. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howard Oh yeah, they still got the full Monte.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 penny Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 leonard Uh-huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 penny What the hell?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 leonard Killer robot. We built it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 penny Yeah, well, it almost killed me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 sheldon If it wanted to kill you, you’d be dead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 penny So, who exactly does it want to kill?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 sheldon I’m sorry, are you unaware of the upcoming Southern California Robot Fighting League Round Robin Invitational?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 penny You know, since I moved last year, not all my mail has been forwarded.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howard It’s a big deal. There’s an awards banquet and a dance afterward. Perhaps you’d like to come with me. I know the other fellas would be really excited to see a girl there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 penny How is it supposed to be a dance if I’m the only girl?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howard Well, that may be a slight exaggeration. You’d be the only doable girl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 penny You’re a pig, Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howard How is doable anything but a compliment?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 leonard Howard, why don’t we just work on the robot?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howard Please, Leonard, not now. Once again, Penny and I have begun our little tango.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 penny Our tango?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howard The carnal repartee, the erotic to and fro. But as delicious as the appetizer might be, at some point we will have to succumb and eat the entree while it’s still… hot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 leonard I’m begging you, stop talking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 penny Look, normally I can just ignore you. I mean, I get it, you’re a little peculiar. You know, like Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 sheldon Yeah, excuse me, Penny, but in this room, you’re the one who’s peculiar.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 penny Yeah, you might be right. But back to you. I know you think you’re some sort of smooth-talking ladies’ man, but the truth is, you are just pathetic and creepy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howard Um, so what are you saying?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 penny I am saying it is not a compliment to call me doable. It’s not sexy to stare at my ass and say, “Ooh, it must be jelly ’cause jam don’t shake like that.” And most important, we are not dancing a tango, we’re not to’ing and fro’ing. Nothing is ever going to happen between us. Ever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howard Wait a minute. This isn’t flirting, you’re serious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 penny Flirting? You think I’m flirting with you? I am not flirting with you, no woman is ever gonna flirt with you, you’re just gonna grow old and die alone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howard Thanks for the heads up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 leonard Howard, where you going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howard I’m going home to live my creepy, pathetic life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 leonard Wow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 penny Well, someone had to say it. What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 leonard He said maybe we should enter you in the killer robot competition.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howards_mother Howard, the phone is ringing!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howard Here’s a crazy idea, Ma, answer it!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howards_mother Hello? All right, hold on. It’s your friend, Leonard! He wants to know why you’re not at school today!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howard I don’t go to school, Ma. I work at a university.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howards_mother That’s a school! Now pick up the phone!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howard I don’t want to talk to anybody.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howards_mother Should I ask Leonard to bring over your homework?!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howard I don’t have homework. I’m a grown man with a master’s degree in engineering!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howards_mother Excuse me, Mr. Fancy-Pants. Want me to get you a Popsicle?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howard Cherry, please!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howards_mother I ate the cherry. All that’s left is green.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howard You make me want to kill myself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 raj What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 leonard I don’t know, now they’re just yelling about Popsicles. Sounds like Penny really got to him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 raj I’m not surprised. Despite his hard and crusty shell, Howard is a very sensitive man. Do you know he writes poetry? Mostly about men from Nantucket and hermits named Dave, but he does it with real sensitivity.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 kripke Hey, Hofstadter. Word around the pwasma wab is you built a wobot?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 leonard Yes, we did, Kripke.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 sheldon His name is Monte.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 kripke Well, if you have any dewusions about entewing him against my wobot, the Kwipke Kwippler in the Southern California Wobot Fighting League Wound Wobin Invitational, aka the S.C.aw.F.L.aw.aw.I., his name is gonna be Swrap Metal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 leonard Come on, is that really necessary?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 sheldon Leonard, I believe it is. This is trash talk, and trash talk is a traditional component in all sporting events. Kripke, your robot is inferior and it will be defeated by ours because ours exceeds yours in both design and execution. Also, I’m given to understand that your mother is overweight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 raj Oh, snap.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 sheldon Now, of course, if that is the result of a glandular condition and not sloth and gluttony, I withdraw that comment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 raj What difference does it make? Fat is fat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 sheldon There are boundaries.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 kripke Tell you what, forget the S.C.aw.F.L.aw.aw.I., let’s settle this woboto a woboto.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 sheldon What do you mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 kripke There’s no guawantee we’ve gotta go against each other in the Wound Wobin, so let’s thwow down. You know, unless you’re afwaid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 sheldon We accept your challenge. Name a time and place.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 kripke Tomowow, thwee o’clock, the kinetics wab.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 sheldon Make it so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 leonard No, don’t make it so. Barry, we can’t fight you tomorrow, our engineer is incapacitated.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 kripke What’s wrong with him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 raj He’s depressed because he’s pathetic and creepy and he can’t get girls.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 kripke We’re all pathetic and cweepy and can’t get girls, that’s why we fight wobots. If you’re not there, you’ll be exposed to widicule.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 raj I’m curious, what part of America is that accent from?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 penny Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 leonard Hey, you got a minute?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 penny Yeah, come on in. What’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 leonard I need you to apologize to How…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 penny Get out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 leonard Come on. Wolowitz won’t come out of his house and we need him for a robot battle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 penny Well, then have the robot go and get him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 leonard The robot didn’t hurt his feelings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 penny His feelings needed to be hurt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 leonard He’s been in bed for two days.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 penny Yeah, probably with a blow-up doll.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 leonard He’s not with a… does it really matter who or what he’s with? The guy is devastated.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 penny Oh, please, how could I possibly devastate Howard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 leonard Okay, don’t take this as a criticism, but you kind of have that overexposed-to-gamma-rays thing going on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 penny What does that mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 leonard You know, like, most of the time, you’re the easygoing Bruce Banner, but then, when you get angry, you kind of turn into, like, you know, grrrrr!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 penny I turn into a bear?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 leonard Seriously? Gamma rays? Bruce Banner? You didn’t get The Incredible Hulk from that? Never mind, just, please go talk to him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 penny And say what? That I didn’t mean it, because I meant it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 leonard Well, maybe you can go at it from a different angle, like, um, you see a glimmer of goodness in him and you only said what you said because you want to nurture it and make it shine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 penny Oh, pthththth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 leonard Okay, let’s try it this way. Remember the day that we first met and you asked me to go to your boyfriend’s apartment to get your TV back and he was nine feet tall and he took my pants off and you said… what was that? What did you say? Oh, yes, you said you owed me one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 penny Okay, come on, that’s not fair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 leonard I came home with no pants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 penny Fine, I’ll go over there tomorrow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 leonard Thank you. I should probably give you a heads up about his mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 penny What about her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 leonard She’s a delightful woman. You’ll love her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howards_mother Howard, there’s a blonde girl, Patsy, here to see you!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howard Who?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howards_mother Okay, now she’s saying it’s Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howard I don’t want to talk to her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 penny Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howard Ma!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howards_mother She ran past me. Was I supposed to tackle her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 penny So, I just came by to see how you were doing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howard I’m fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 penny Good. Your mom seems nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howard People move away from her on the bus. What do you want?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 penny Okay, look. Howard, I just want to apologize for some things that I have said. About you. I’ve been informed that you have feelings. And apparently, I have hurt them. So, I’m sorry. Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howard Fine, you’re sorry. Good-bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 penny So, you’re okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howard Hey, I’m a big boy. I’m not traumatized by some random comment from some random woman. I mean, get over yourself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 penny Okay. Well, bye. So close 
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 leonard Oh, my God. That’s Kripke’s robot?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 kripke As you can see, the Kwippler is weducing the Chevy Cavawier to wubble.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 raj I can’t watch anymore.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 leonard Sheldon, we have to call it off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 sheldon We don’t have that option, we’ve accepted the challenge. We can’t run away from a fight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 leonard Oh, please, we’ve spent our whole lives running away from fights. Personally, I can squeeze through a hole in a fence half my size.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 sheldon Impressive as that may be, Monte is not us. Monte has no fear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 raj Sheldon, did we all not just watch the same video? Kripke’s robot just had angry sex with a mid-sized automobile.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 sheldon You are overlooking the fact that we now know what we’re up against and we can modify Monte so that he’s prepared.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 leonard You want to prepare him? Install a bladder and a pair of shorts so he can wet himself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 raj Excuse me, but how are we going to make any modifications without Wolowitz? Have you heard from Penny yet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 leonard Not yet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 sheldon Have faith, gentlemen. We don’t need Wolowitz, engineering is merely the slow younger brother of physics. Watch and learn. Do either of you know how to open the toolbox?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howard And then, when I was 14, I met Marcy Grossman. She was so beautiful. She just got her braces off but they left a little of the overbite. It was so hot, like a sexy little chipmunk. I didn’t have the courage to ask her out, but I dedicated a song to her at the ninth grade talent show.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 penny Aw, that sounds sweet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howard Marcy Grossman is sunshine, on a cloudy day, when it’s cold outside, Marcy Grossman is the month of May…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 penny Oh, it’s cute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howard I guess you’d say, what can make me feel this way, Marcy Grossman, Marcy Grossman, Marcy Grossman, Talkin’ ’bout Marcy…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 penny That’s great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howard Grossman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 penny Oh, it’s fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howard And then she came up with that sexy little chipmunk mouth and spit in my hair. Which brings us to tenth grade.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 penny Howard, do you think maybe sometimes you try too hard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howard Look at me. What chance do I have if I don’t try too hard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 penny Well, you’d have a terrific chance. I mean, you’re smart, you’re funny, you have a cool job. You build stuff that goes into outer space.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howard I guess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 penny Look, I’m telling you, I’ve known you for, like, a year and a half and this is the first time I feel like I’m talking to a real person. And you know what? I like him, he’s a nice guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howard You really think so?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 penny Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howard I don’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 penny I do. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 leonard Nice little bot you’ve got here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 kripke I’m aware.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 leonard What’s this do, spin?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 kripke Yep. At 3400 RPM. It can cut through steel like it was wubber.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 leonard Neat. Good work. Sheldon, we’ve got to call this off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 sheldon No, Leonard. For years, merciless thugs like Kripke have made my life a series of painful noogies and humiliating wedgies and the insensitively named Indian burns. That stops now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 raj But, Sheldon, we don’t have a chance. The only improvement you were able to make on the robot was to put fresh batteries in the remote.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 sheldon What you fail to realize is Kripke suffers from a fatal flaw, overconfidence from his robot’s massive size and its overwhelming power.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 raj That’s not overconfidence, that’s observation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 sheldon Trust me, Kripke will fall easy prey to my psychological warfare. Observe. Kripke! I would ask if your robot is prepared to meet its maker, but as you are its maker, clearly the two of you have met.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 kripke What is his pwoblem?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 raj Way to bust out the Jedi mind tricks, dude.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 leonard I just want to make sure that we’re all clear, standard robotic fighting league rules apply.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 kripke Are you cwazy? This is a stweet fight, the stweet has no rules.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 sheldon He’s right, Leonard. The paradigm is to the death.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 kripke I will, however, give you the opportunity to concede my supewiowity now and offer me your wobot as the spoils of war.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 sheldon Never. I’d rather see Monte dead than in your hands.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 kripke That could be easily awanged. Weady, set, go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 sheldon Do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 kripke Alwight then. Weady. Set. Go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 raj Come on, Sheldon, you got this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 sheldon Indeed. We are prepared for anything he can throw at us. That’s new.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 leonard Run, Monte, run!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 raj Go, Monte! Go Monte!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 leonard Go, go, go, go!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 sheldon Don’t hurt us, don’t hurt us,
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 leonard Well, so much for making up for the emotional wounds of childhood.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 sheldon I did this. Monte was killed by my hubris and my pride. No matter what anybody says, this is my fault.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 raj No one’s arguing with you, dude.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howard I got your text. How bad is… Oy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 leonard Forget the robot. What happened to you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 penny He slipped and fell.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howard Yes, I slipped and fell. In the bathroom. Bounced right off the tub.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 penny Yes, now he knows what bathtubs are capable of doing when you don’t treat them with respect.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howard Yeah. They sucker punch you when your eyes are closed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 sheldon So what do you think, Howard? It’s not that bad, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howard Oh, no. A little electrical tape, some solder. Are you insane? I’ve seen space probes that crashed into the desert that were in better shape than this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 sheldon You’re right. Monte’s gone. We’ll bury him in the morning. A simple ceremony. I’ll speak. Leonard, you’ll play your cello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 penny Sheldon, honey, aren’t you getting a little carried away? I mean, it’s just a toy robot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 sheldon Just a toy robot?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 leonard Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 penny I know, I got it. Sheldon, I’m sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode12 howard Well, don’t get the wrong idea. The way I see it, I’m halfway to pity sex.
