TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 raj Mmm, gentlemen, I put it to you, the worst tapioca pudding is better than the best pudding of any other flavour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon First off, that is axiomatically wrong, because the best pudding is chocolate. Secondly, the organic structure of tapioca makes it a jiggling bowl of potential death. It is extracted from the plant…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 howard Hey, I’m thinking of growing a mustache.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard Ah, no kidding! A Fu Man Chu? A handlebar pencil?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon It is extracted from the plant…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 howard I’m not sure yet. You know, George Clooney has one now!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 raj Really? I once saw him shopping at Ralph’s. He was buying tequila.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 howard Oh, you’d think a guy like that would have some kind of booze lackey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard Alright this is cruel, we better let him finish before his head explodes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 howard Alright Sheldon, why is tapioca…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon Tapioca is extracted from the root of the plant Manihot Esculenta. Due to a high concentration of cyanide it is poisonous in its raw form and lethal if prepared improperly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 raj Feel better now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon It is also indigenous to Brazil, as is the Cocoa Bean, from which we get chocolate, the best pudding. And you promised you wouldn’t do that anymore!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 kripke Hey Hofstadter!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard Hey Kripke.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 kripke Heard about your watest pwoton decay expewiment, twenty thousand data wuns and no statistically significant wesults. Vewy impwessive!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 howard What a jerk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 raj Don’t feel bad Leonard, negative results are still results.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 howard Even twenty thousand of ’em.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard Alright, please don’t cheer me up anymore.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 howard C’mon, don’t let him get to you. It’s Kripke.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 raj Yeah, he’s a ginormous knob.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 howard That’s why he eats by himself, instead of sitting here at the cool table.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 raj Fo’ shizzle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon Hey it’s true, Kripke lacks the basic social skills that we take for granted, but he also controls the new open science grid computer that I need to use to run some simulations of structure formation in the early universe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard Good luck getting time on it. The only people he lets use it are his friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon Well then, the solution is simple. I shall befriend him. Kripke!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 kripke Yeah?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon What’d you say of the idea of you and I becoming friends?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 kripke I would say, I have no intewest in becoming your fwiend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon Really? That seems rather short sighted, coming from someone who is generally considered altogether unlikable. Why don’t you take some time to reconsider?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 kripke Yeah, I’ll do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon Well I think we’re off to a terrific start.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard There you go. Now any e-mail from Wolowitz will go right into your spam folder.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 penny Thanks! I mean the e-mail doesn’t bother me as much as the vacation pictures of him in a bathing suit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard Yeah, I got the same one. And that’s not a bathing suit, it’s a tan line.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon Hello. This is Sheldon Cooper. I’m leaving a message for Barry Kripke. Barry, It was pleasant seeing you today in the cafeteria. I saw that you purchased the chef’s salad. Apparently, you did not know that the chef’s salad is kitchen trickery, to utilize scrap meat. Nevertheless, I hope you enjoyed it. I’m following up on our pending friendship, and I look forward to hearing from you regarding its status. Sheldon Cooper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 penny What’s up with Ichabod?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard Oh he’s trying to make a new friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 penny Oh really? Well, good for him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard Well, unless he’s makes one out of wood like Gepetto, I don’t think it’s gonna happen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 penny Well, how did you guys become friends?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard There was a flier on the bulletin board at the university. Roommate wanted. Whistlers need not apply.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 penny And you moved in anyway?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard I assumed he was joking. You’d be surprised how many particle physicists have a whimsical side.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 penny Well, what about Howard and Raj, I mean how did you become friends with them?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard I don’t know, how do carbon atoms form a benzene ring? Proximity and valence electrons.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 penny Well yeah, sure. When you put it that way. But it all worked out, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard I suppose. I do miss whistling though.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 penny Oh come on, really? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon First warning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon Penny Penny Penny.This is for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 penny Hello Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 penny What is this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon It’s a questionnaire I devised. I’m having some difficulty bonding with a colleague at work, so I’m doing a little research to better understand why my current friends like me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 penny Yes. Well, that is a good question. But is this really the best way to figure it out?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon Yeah, I agree, the social sciences are largely hokum. But, short of putting electrodes in your brain and monitoring your response to my companionship, this is the best I can do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 penny Okay, question 1. Rank the following aspects of Sheldon Cooper in order of appeal. Intelligence. Ruthless attention to hygiene. Playfulness. Java applet writing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon I know, I may have started off with a fairly obvious one. You did an aspect of my most appealing trait, playfulness. Why don’t you just go ahead and write that number 1. I’m afraid you’re on your own for the rest. It should take you no more than 3 hours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 penny Wait! How many questions are on this thing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon Only 211. Don’t worry, in deference to you, I’ve kept them on a high school graduate reading level.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 penny Thanks pal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon You got it, buddy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 penny Sheldon honey, did you ever consider making friends by being, I don’t know, pleasant?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon Well that’s certainly a thought-provoking hypothesis. May I suggest it as the topic for your essay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon Your questionnaire, very disappointing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard I answered every question Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon You answered the multiple choice questions in a pattern. A B B A C. A B B A C.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard Aw, you picked up on that huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon How could I not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard Come on! There’s over 200 questions. And look at some of these things. Sheldon is to camaraderie, as the space shuttle is to blank?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard Hold on. I put some real work into that!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon Yes, well it’s better than what Wolowitz did. He drew a raccoon with what appears to be, a distended scrotum.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard It’s kinda cute, until you get to the scrotum.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon What hope do I have for establishing new relationships given that my current friends apparently cannot take a few hours out of their lives to help me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard Sheldon, I’m not going to defend a big-balled raccoon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon I don’t see how you could.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard What I’m trying to say is that, maybe you can’t approach this as a purely intellectual exercise.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon What do you mean!?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard Well, remember when you tried to learn how to swim using the internet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon I did learn how to swim.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard On the floor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon The skills are transferrable. I just have no interest in going in the water.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard Then why learn how to swim?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon The ice caps are melting Leonard. In the future, swimming isn’t going to be optional. But you do bring up an interesting point. I don’t have to break new ground here, I’m sure much of the research already exists.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard No! no, my point is, if you want to learn how to make friends, then just go out to a coffee shop or a museum. Meet people. Talk to them. Take an interest in their lives.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon That’s insane on the face of it. Come on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard Where are we going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon You’re driving me to the mall. I’m going to acquire a book that summarizes the current theories in the field of friendmaking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard Why don’t you just lie down on the floor and swim there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon Coping with the death of a loved one. My condolences.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 woman_in_queue Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon Family or friend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 woman Family.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon Too bad. If it’d been a friend, I’m available to fill the void. It’s just as well, she smelled like moth balls.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard Okay, if you’re gonna start sniffing people, I’m gonna go get a hot pretzel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon Excuse me. Do you have any books about making friends?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 bookstore_employee Um, yeah but they’re all for little kids.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon I assume the skills can be extrapolated and transferred.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 employee Uh, I guess. They’re right over there by the wooden train set.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon Oh! I love trains!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 employee I bet you do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon Oh my! That’s awfully sticky. Alright, let’s see. Bernie Bunny has Two Daddies Now. It’s probably about homosexual rabbits. Jerry the Gerbil and the Bullies on the Bus. Read it, not helpful. Oh! Here we go. Stu the Cockatoo is New at the Zoo. Author Sarah Carpenter lives in Fort Wayne, Indiana, with her husband and best friend Mark, and their cockatoos too. Hardly makes her an expert in making friends, wouldn’t you agree?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 little_girl I don’t like birds, they scare me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon Me too! Most people don’t see it. What are you reading?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 girl Curious George.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon Oh I do like monkeys!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 girl Curious George is a monkey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon Somewhat anthropomorphized but yes. Say, maybe sometime you and I can go see monkeys together. Would you like that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 girl Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard Sheldon, what are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon I’m making friends with this little girl. What’s your name?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 girl Rebecca.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon Hi Rebecca, I’m your new friend, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard No you’re not, let’s go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon We were really hitting it off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard Don’t look up, there’s cameras.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 raj I’m curious. In the “How Well Do You Know Sheldon” section, what do you put for his favourite amino acid?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard_and_howard Lysine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 raj Damn it. I had Lysine and changed it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon Oh good! You’re just in time. I believe I’ve isolated the algorithm for making friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard Sheldon, there is no algorithm for making friends!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 howard Hear him out. If he’s really on to something, we can open a booth at Comic-Con, make a fortune.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon See, my initial approach to Kripke, had the same deficiencies as those that plagued Stu the Cockatoo, when he was new at the zoo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 raj Stu the cockatoo?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard Yes, he’s new at the zoo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon It’s a terrific book. I’ve distilled its essence into a simple flowchart that would guide me through the process.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 howard Have you thought about putting him in a crate while you’re out of the apartment?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon Hello, Kripke. Yes, Sheldon Cooper here. It occurred to me you hadn’t returned any of my calls because I hadn’t offered any concrete suggestions for pursuing our friendship. Perhaps the two of us might share a meal together… I see. Well then perhaps you’d have time for a hot beverage. Popular choices include tea, coffee, cocoa… I see. No, no, no, wait. Don’t hang up yet. What about a recreational activity? I bet we share some common interests. Tell me an interest of yours. Really? On actual horses? Tell me another interest of yours. Oh no, I’m sorry, I have no desire to get in the water until I absolutely have to. Tell me another interest of yours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard Uh-oh, he’s stuck in an infinite loop.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 howard I can fix it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon Mmhmm. Mmhmm. It’s interesting. But isn’t ventriloquism, by definition, a solo activity? Yeah? Tell me another interest of yours. Hmmm. Is there any chance you like monkeys? What is wrong with you? Everybody likes monkeys. Hang on, Kripke. A loop counter? And an escape to the least objectionable activity! Howard, that’s brilliant! I’m surprised you saw that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 howard Gee. Why can’t Sheldon make friends?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon Alright Kripke, that last interest strikes me as the least objectionable and I would like to propose that we do that together. Tomorrow. Yes, I’ll pay. Alright, goodbye. Alright! Time to learn rock climbing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon You know, I am a fan of ventriloquism. Maybe you, me and your dummy could go get a hot beverage. He could talk while you drink.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 kripke Nope, I wanna climb some wocks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon This appears significantly more monolithic than it did on my laptop. No, one expects to see Hominids learning to use bones as weapeons.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 kripke You afwaid of heights, Cooper?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon Hardly. Fear of heights is illogical. Fear of falling, on the other hand, is prudent and evolutionary. What would you say is the minimum altitude I need to achieve to cement our new-found friendship?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 kripke Come on, they have birthday parties here. Wittle kids climb this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon Little kid Hominids, perhaps. Is this your entire job? Your parents must be so proud.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 kripke Let’s go, Cooper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon Coming, Kripke. Okay. Harness seems to be secure. Small amount of incontinence just now, but the website said that’s to be expected. Hey, this isn’t so bad. A bit like vertical swimming.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 kripke Hey, look at you, Cooper. You’re almost halfway to the top.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon I am? I was wrong. It IS a fear of heights.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon Not really. I feel somewhat like an inverse tangent function that’s approaching an asymptote.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 kripke Are you saying you’re stuck?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon What part of an inverse tangent function approaching an asymptote did you not understand?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 kripke Understood all that. I’m not a mowon. Just keep going.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon Yeah, I don’t think I can.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 kripke Well, then. Cwimb back down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon No, that doesn’t seem any more likely.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 kripke So what’s the pwan, Cooper?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon Well, it’s not exactly a plan but I think I’m going to pass out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard I’m sorry. Can we please just do it one more time?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 howard Okay. 1, 2, 1, 2, 3 and… 
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard It’s a little thing but you really do miss it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon Hello, everyone. I brought my new friend, Barry Kripke, home for dinner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 together Oh…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 kripke Hewo to you, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard How was rock climbing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 kripke He passed out. Just hung there like a big sawami.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon D-d-d! That’s where I sit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 kripke Ooh, you have a special spot. What kind of wacko are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 howard How much time you got?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard Want some Chinese food?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 kripke Tewific. Got any dental fwoss?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard In the bathroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 kripke Be right back. I gotta fwoss the Indian food out of my teeth if I’m gonna eat Chinese.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 penny Sheldon, are you okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon Oh yes, I pass out all the time. But, it was worth it. I’ve made substantial progress in bonding with Kripke, which brings me to an awkward moment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard What’s that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon Maintaining five friendships promises to be a Herculean task. So, I’m going to have to let one of you go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 howard Me, me. Let it be me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon Leonard, you are my roommate, my source of transportation and you help me fold my sheets when they come out of the dryer. You are safe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard Can I whistle?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon Don’t be silly. Howard, you do not have a PhD, your cologne is an assault on the senses and you’re not available for video games during the Jewish high holidays.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 howard Guilty as charged. I’m out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon No. You, too, are safe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 howard Oh come on. What do I have to do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 penny Okay. You know what? I see where this is going. I’m not one of you guys. I’m not a scientist. So just…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon Penny, Penny, Penny. Everything you’re saying is true, but please allow me to continue. Raj, you’re out. The good question, while you do provide a certain cultural diversity to an otherwise homogenous group, your responses to the questionnaire were truly disturbing. How could you, for a moment, think that my favourite amino acid is Glutamine?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard He had Lysine but changed it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon Yeah. Shoulda, woulda coulda, Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 kripke I like to fwoss before I eat, so my gum pockets are open for new food.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 penny Eww.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 kripke Hewo. How did I walk past you? I’m Bawy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 penny Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 kripke Yeah, it’s not a vewy hot name. I’m gonna call your Woxanne. Ooh, pot stickers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 howard Suddenly I’m looking pretty good, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon So uh, Kripke, I was wondering if there’s any chance you could get me some time on the open science grid computer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 kripke No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon No? But we’re friends!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 kripke I’m sowy. No, my fwiend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon I’m confused. I was given an understanding that you allow your friends time on the machine?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 kripke No, that’s wong. There’s an official schedule. I have no contwol over it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon Oh. This entire endeavour seems to have been an exercise in futility. Raj, you’re back in. He likes monkeys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 howard You gotta give him credit for sticking with it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard I didn’t think he had it in him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 raj He almost made it to the top this time.
