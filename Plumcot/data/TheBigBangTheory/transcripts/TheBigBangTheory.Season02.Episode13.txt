TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 raj_koothrappali Mmm, gentlemen, I put it to you, the worst tapioca pudding is better than the best pudding of any other flavour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper First off, that is axiomatically wrong, because the best pudding is chocolate. Secondly, the organic structure of tapioca makes it a jiggling bowl of potential death. It is extracted from the plant…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Hey, I’m thinking of growing a mustache.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Ah, no kidding! A Fu Man Chu? A handlebar pencil?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper It is extracted from the plant…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 howard_wolowitz I’m not sure yet. You know, George Clooney has one now!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 raj_koothrappali Really? I once saw him shopping at Ralph’s. He was buying tequila.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Oh, you’d think a guy like that would have some kind of booze lackey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Alright this is cruel, we better let him finish before his head explodes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Alright Sheldon, why is tapioca…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Tapioca is extracted from the root of the plant Manihot Esculenta. Due to a high concentration of cyanide it is poisonous in its raw form and lethal if prepared improperly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 raj_koothrappali Feel better now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper It is also indigenous to Brazil, as is the Cocoa Bean, from which we get chocolate, the best pudding. And you promised you wouldn’t do that anymore!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 barry_kripke Hey Hofstadter!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Hey Kripke.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 barry_kripke Heard about your watest pwoton decay expewiment, twenty thousand data wuns and no statistically significant wesults. Vewy impwessive!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 howard_wolowitz What a jerk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 raj_koothrappali Don’t feel bad Leonard, negative results are still results.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Even twenty thousand of ’em.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Alright, please don’t cheer me up anymore.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 howard_wolowitz C’mon, don’t let him get to you. It’s Kripke.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 raj_koothrappali Yeah, he’s a ginormous knob.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 howard_wolowitz That’s why he eats by himself, instead of sitting here at the cool table.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 raj_koothrappali Fo’ shizzle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Hey it’s true, Kripke lacks the basic social skills that we take for granted, but he also controls the new open science grid computer that I need to use to run some simulations of structure formation in the early universe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Good luck getting time on it. The only people he lets use it are his friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Well then, the solution is simple. I shall befriend him. Kripke!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 barry_kripke Yeah?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper What’d you say of the idea of you and I becoming friends?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 barry_kripke I would say, I have no intewest in becoming your fwiend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Really? That seems rather short sighted, coming from someone who is generally considered altogether unlikable. Why don’t you take some time to reconsider?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 barry_kripke Yeah, I’ll do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Well I think we’re off to a terrific start.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter There you go. Now any e-mail from Wolowitz will go right into your spam folder.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 penny Thanks! I mean the e-mail doesn’t bother me as much as the vacation pictures of him in a bathing suit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I got the same one. And that’s not a bathing suit, it’s a tan line.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Hello. This is Sheldon Cooper. I’m leaving a message for Barry Kripke. Barry, It was pleasant seeing you today in the cafeteria. I saw that you purchased the chef’s salad. Apparently, you did not know that the chef’s salad is kitchen trickery, to utilize scrap meat. Nevertheless, I hope you enjoyed it. I’m following up on our pending friendship, and I look forward to hearing from you regarding its status. Sheldon Cooper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 penny What’s up with Ichabod?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Oh he’s trying to make a new friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 penny Oh really? Well, good for him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Well, unless he’s makes one out of wood like Gepetto, I don’t think it’s gonna happen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 penny Well, how did you guys become friends?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter There was a flier on the bulletin board at the university. Roommate wanted. Whistlers need not apply.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 penny And you moved in anyway?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter I assumed he was joking. You’d be surprised how many particle physicists have a whimsical side.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 penny Well, what about Howard and Raj, I mean how did you become friends with them?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter I don’t know, how do carbon atoms form a benzene ring? Proximity and valence electrons.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 penny Well yeah, sure. When you put it that way. But it all worked out, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter I suppose. I do miss whistling though.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 penny Oh come on, really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper First warning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Penny Penny Penny.This is for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 penny Hello Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 penny What is this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper It’s a questionnaire I devised. I’m having some difficulty bonding with a colleague at work, so I’m doing a little research to better understand why my current friends like me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 penny Yes. Well, that is a good question. But is this really the best way to figure it out?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Yeah, I agree, the social sciences are largely hokum. But, short of putting electrodes in your brain and monitoring your response to my companionship, this is the best I can do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 penny Okay, question 1. Rank the following aspects of Sheldon Cooper in order of appeal. Intelligence. Ruthless attention to hygiene. Playfulness. Java applet writing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper I know, I may have started off with a fairly obvious one. You did an aspect of my most appealing trait, playfulness. Why don’t you just go ahead and write that number 1. I’m afraid you’re on your own for the rest. It should take you no more than 3 hours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 penny Wait! How many questions are on this thing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Only 211. Don’t worry, in deference to you, I’ve kept them on a high school graduate reading level.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 penny Thanks pal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper You got it, buddy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 penny Sheldon honey, did you ever consider making friends by being, I don’t know, pleasant?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Well that’s certainly a thought-provoking hypothesis. May I suggest it as the topic for your essay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Your questionnaire, very disappointing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter I answered every question Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper You answered the multiple choice questions in a pattern. A B B A C. A B B A C.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Aw, you picked up on that huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper How could I not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Come on! There’s over 200 questions. And look at some of these things. Sheldon is to camaraderie, as the space shuttle is to blank?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Hold on. I put some real work into that!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Yes, well it’s better than what Wolowitz did. He drew a raccoon with what appears to be, a distended scrotum.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter It’s kinda cute, until you get to the scrotum.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper What hope do I have for establishing new relationships given that my current friends apparently cannot take a few hours out of their lives to help me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, I’m not going to defend a big-balled raccoon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper I don’t see how you could.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter What I’m trying to say is that, maybe you can’t approach this as a purely intellectual exercise.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper What do you mean!?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Well, remember when you tried to learn how to swim using the internet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper I did learn how to swim.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter On the floor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper The skills are transferrable. I just have no interest in going in the water.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Then why learn how to swim?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper The ice caps are melting Leonard. In the future, swimming isn’t going to be optional. But you do bring up an interesting point. I don’t have to break new ground here, I’m sure much of the research already exists.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter No! no, my point is, if you want to learn how to make friends, then just go out to a coffee shop or a museum. Meet people. Talk to them. Take an interest in their lives.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper That’s insane on the face of it. Come on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Where are we going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper You’re driving me to the mall. I’m going to acquire a book that summarizes the current theories in the field of friendmaking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Why don’t you just lie down on the floor and swim there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Coping with the death of a loved one. My condolences.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 woman_in_queue#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Family or friend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 woman#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 Family.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Too bad. If it’d been a friend, I’m available to fill the void. It’s just as well, she smelled like moth balls.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Okay, if you’re gonna start sniffing people, I’m gonna go get a hot pretzel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Excuse me. Do you have any books about making friends?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 bookstore_employee#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 Um, yeah but they’re all for little kids.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper I assume the skills can be extrapolated and transferred.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 employee#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 Uh, I guess. They’re right over there by the wooden train set.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Oh! I love trains!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 employee#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 I bet you do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Oh my! That’s awfully sticky. Alright, let’s see. Bernie Bunny has Two Daddies Now. It’s probably about homosexual rabbits. Jerry the Gerbil and the Bullies on the Bus. Read it, not helpful. Oh! Here we go. Stu the Cockatoo is New at the Zoo. Author Sarah Carpenter lives in Fort Wayne, Indiana, with her husband and best friend Mark, and their cockatoos too. Hardly makes her an expert in making friends, wouldn’t you agree?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 little_girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 I don’t like birds, they scare me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Me too! Most people don’t see it. What are you reading?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 Curious George.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Oh I do like monkeys!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 Curious George is a monkey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Somewhat anthropomorphized but yes. Say, maybe sometime you and I can go see monkeys together. Would you like that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, what are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper I’m making friends with this little girl. What’s your name?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 Rebecca.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Hi Rebecca, I’m your new friend, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter No you’re not, let’s go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper We were really hitting it off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Don’t look up, there’s cameras.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 raj_koothrappali I’m curious. In the “How Well Do You Know Sheldon” section, what do you put for his favourite amino acid?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 howard_wolowitz@leonard_hofstadter Lysine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 raj_koothrappali Damn it. I had Lysine and changed it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Oh good! You’re just in time. I believe I’ve isolated the algorithm for making friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, there is no algorithm for making friends!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Hear him out. If he’s really on to something, we can open a booth at Comic-Con, make a fortune.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper See, my initial approach to Kripke, had the same deficiencies as those that plagued Stu the Cockatoo, when he was new at the zoo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 raj_koothrappali Stu the cockatoo?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Yes, he’s new at the zoo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper It’s a terrific book. I’ve distilled its essence into a simple flowchart that would guide me through the process.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Have you thought about putting him in a crate while you’re out of the apartment?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Hello, Kripke. Yes, Sheldon Cooper here. It occurred to me you hadn’t returned any of my calls because I hadn’t offered any concrete suggestions for pursuing our friendship. Perhaps the two of us might share a meal together… I see. Well then perhaps you’d have time for a hot beverage. Popular choices include tea, coffee, cocoa… I see. No, no, no, wait. Don’t hang up yet. What about a recreational activity? I bet we share some common interests. Tell me an interest of yours. Really? On actual horses? Tell me another interest of yours. Oh no, I’m sorry, I have no desire to get in the water until I absolutely have to. Tell me another interest of yours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Uh-oh, he’s stuck in an infinite loop.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 howard_wolowitz I can fix it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Mmhmm. Mmhmm. It’s interesting. But isn’t ventriloquism, by definition, a solo activity? Yeah? Tell me another interest of yours. Hmmm. Is there any chance you like monkeys? What is wrong with you? Everybody likes monkeys. Hang on, Kripke. A loop counter? And an escape to the least objectionable activity! Howard, that’s brilliant! I’m surprised you saw that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Gee. Why can’t Sheldon make friends?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Alright Kripke, that last interest strikes me as the least objectionable and I would like to propose that we do that together. Tomorrow. Yes, I’ll pay. Alright, goodbye. Alright! Time to learn rock climbing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper You know, I am a fan of ventriloquism. Maybe you, me and your dummy could go get a hot beverage. He could talk while you drink.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 barry_kripke Nope, I wanna climb some wocks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper This appears significantly more monolithic than it did on my laptop. No, one expects to see Hominids learning to use bones as weapeons.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 barry_kripke You afwaid of heights, Cooper?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Hardly. Fear of heights is illogical. Fear of falling, on the other hand, is prudent and evolutionary. What would you say is the minimum altitude I need to achieve to cement our new-found friendship?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 barry_kripke Come on, they have birthday parties here. Wittle kids climb this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Little kid Hominids, perhaps. Is this your entire job? Your parents must be so proud.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 barry_kripke Let’s go, Cooper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Coming, Kripke. Okay. Harness seems to be secure. Small amount of incontinence just now, but the website said that’s to be expected. Hey, this isn’t so bad. A bit like vertical swimming.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 barry_kripke Hey, look at you, Cooper. You’re almost halfway to the top.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper I am? I was wrong. It IS a fear of heights.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Not really. I feel somewhat like an inverse tangent function that’s approaching an asymptote.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 barry_kripke Are you saying you’re stuck?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper What part of an inverse tangent function approaching an asymptote did you not understand?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 barry_kripke Understood all that. I’m not a mowon. Just keep going.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Yeah, I don’t think I can.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 barry_kripke Well, then. Cwimb back down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper No, that doesn’t seem any more likely.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 barry_kripke So what’s the pwan, Cooper?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Well, it’s not exactly a plan but I think I’m going to pass out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter I’m sorry. Can we please just do it one more time?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Okay. 1, 2, 1, 2, 3 and…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter It’s a little thing but you really do miss it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Hello, everyone. I brought my new friend, Barry Kripke, home for dinner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 together#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 Oh…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 barry_kripke Hewo to you, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter How was rock climbing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 barry_kripke He passed out. Just hung there like a big sawami.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper D-d-d! That’s where I sit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 barry_kripke Ooh, you have a special spot. What kind of wacko are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 howard_wolowitz How much time you got?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Want some Chinese food?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 barry_kripke Tewific. Got any dental fwoss?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter In the bathroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 barry_kripke Be right back. I gotta fwoss the Indian food out of my teeth if I’m gonna eat Chinese.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 penny Sheldon, are you okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Oh yes, I pass out all the time. But, it was worth it. I’ve made substantial progress in bonding with Kripke, which brings me to an awkward moment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter What’s that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Maintaining five friendships promises to be a Herculean task. So, I’m going to have to let one of you go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Me, me. Let it be me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Leonard, you are my roommate, my source of transportation and you help me fold my sheets when they come out of the dryer. You are safe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Can I whistle?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Don’t be silly. Howard, you do not have a PhD, your cologne is an assault on the senses and you’re not available for video games during the Jewish high holidays.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Guilty as charged. I’m out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper No. You, too, are safe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Oh come on. What do I have to do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 penny Okay. You know what? I see where this is going. I’m not one of you guys. I’m not a scientist. So just…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Penny, Penny, Penny. Everything you’re saying is true, but please allow me to continue. Raj, you’re out. The good question, while you do provide a certain cultural diversity to an otherwise homogenous group, your responses to the questionnaire were truly disturbing. How could you, for a moment, think that my favourite amino acid is Glutamine?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter He had Lysine but changed it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Yeah. Shoulda, woulda coulda, Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 barry_kripke I like to fwoss before I eat, so my gum pockets are open for new food.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 penny Eww.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 barry_kripke Hewo. How did I walk past you? I’m Bawy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 penny Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 barry_kripke Yeah, it’s not a vewy hot name. I’m gonna call your Woxanne. Ooh, pot stickers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Suddenly I’m looking pretty good, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper So uh, Kripke, I was wondering if there’s any chance you could get me some time on the open science grid computer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 barry_kripke No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper No? But we’re friends!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 barry_kripke I’m sowy. No, my fwiend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper I’m confused. I was given an understanding that you allow your friends time on the machine?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 barry_kripke No, that’s wong. There’s an official schedule. I have no contwol over it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Oh. This entire endeavour seems to have been an exercise in futility. Raj, you’re back in. He likes monkeys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 howard_wolowitz You gotta give him credit for sticking with it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter I didn’t think he had it in him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode13 raj_koothrappali He almost made it to the top this time.
