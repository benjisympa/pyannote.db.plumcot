TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Hmmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon The problem appears to be unsolvable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 raj Maybe you could run some computer simulations.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 howard There are too many variables. It would take forever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard We’ve got to be missing something. Let’s start again. The movie is playing here at 7:20, here at 7:40, here at 8:10 and here at 8:45.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon Right, these theatres have to be eliminated.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Why? They’re state-of-the-art digital projection, 20-channel surround sound.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon Yes, but they have no Icee machines. Despite my aggressive letter-writing campaign, I might add.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 raj What about the multiplex here? The seats are terrific.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon They have Twizzlers instead of Red Vines. No amount of lumbar support can compensate for that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Well, it’s gonna take at least an hour to eat, and I don’t see a Sheldon-approved restaurant proximate to a Sheldon-approved theatre.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 raj We could eat after the movie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon Unacceptable, the delay would result in tomorrow morning’s bowel movement occurring at work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 raj Hang on, hang on. There’s a 7-Eleven here. We smuggle Slurpies, which are essentially Icees, in under our coats, after having a pleasant meal either here, here or here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 howard Wow. I don’t see how we missed that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon Excuse me, in what universe are Slurpies Icees?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 raj That’s how we missed it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Sheldon, would you be prepared, on a non-precedential basis, to create an emergency ad-hoc Slurpie-Icee equivalency?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon Oh, Leonard, you know I can’t do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 howard Okay, I guess we only have one option.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 raj Yep, I don’t see any way around it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Bye, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 howard See ya.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 raj Later, dude.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon They’re right, it was the only option.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Ooh, ooh, shut the door, shut the door.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Just do it! Get inside and shut the door.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon Well, you didn’t specify.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Is Leonard around?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon He went to the movies without me. It was the only option. I’m sorry, I don’t understand which social situation this is. Could you give me some guidance as to how to proceed?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny The building manager’s showing an apartment downstairs, and I haven’t paid my rent.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon Oh, I see. Penny, I’m not sure I’m comfortable harbouring a fugitive from the 2311 North Los Robles Corporation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny It’s no big deal. I’m just a little behind on my bills because they cut back my hours at the restaurant and my car broke down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon If you recall, I pointed out the “check engine” light to you several months ago.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Well the “check engine” light is fine. It’s still blinking away. It’s the stupid engine that stopped working. It cost me like twelve hundred dollars to fix it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon You know, it occurs to me you could solve all your problems by obtaining more money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Yes, it occurs to me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon Hang on a moment. Here. Take some. Pay me back when you can.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Wow, you got a lot of money in there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon That’s why it’s guarded by snakes. Take some.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Don’t be silly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon I’m never silly. Here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny No, I can’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon Don’t you need money?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Well, yeah, but…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon This is money I’m not using.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny But what if you need it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon My expenses account for 46.9% of my after-tax income. The rest is divvied up between a small savings account, this deceptive container of peanut brittle and the hollowed-out buttocks of a superhero action figure who shall remain nameless for his own protection. Or her own protection. Take some.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Really? I mean, are you sure?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon I see no large upcoming expenditures unless they develop an affordable technology to fuse my skeleton with adamantium like Wolverine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Are they working on that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon I sincerely hope so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Okay. Well, thank you. Oh, God, no, I can’t. Sheldon honey, I don’t want things to be weird between us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon Won’t it also be weird if I have to say hello to you every morning on my way to work and you’re living in a refrigerator box and washing your hair with rain water?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny I’ll pay you back as soon as I can.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon Of course you will. It’s impossible to pay me back sooner than you can. Assuming you subscribe to a linear understanding of time and causality.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny I’m regretting this already.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon You know, I’ve given the matter some thought, and I think I’d be willing to be a house pet to a race of super-intelligent aliens.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Interesting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon Ask me why.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Do I have to?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon Of course. That’s how you move a conversation forward.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon The learning opportunities would be abundant. Additionally, I like having my belly scratched.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Hey, Penny. How was work?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Great. I hope I’m a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory for my whole life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon Was that sarcasm?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon Was that sarcasm?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon Was that sarca..
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Stop it!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon Penny, you appear to have a package here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Oh, thanks. This must be the beret I ordered. A couple of months ago. It was back-ordered.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon Did you know the beret is an example of piece of women’s fashion adapted from male military uniforms? Another fascinating example is the epaulet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard He’s not lying, he does find that fascinating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Okay, whatever. It’s not like I’m running up and down the streets just buying myself berets. I bought one, like, a month ago, and it was back-ordered, look, it finally arrived, all right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Oh, my God, would you just get off my case?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Weird.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon Oh, good, that was an unusual interaction. I wasn’t sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Did you guys have an argument?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Well, you clearly did something to aggravate her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon I’m at a loss. If you like, you can review my daily log of social interactions and see if there’s a blunder I overlooked.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Here you go. Oh, you owe me another two dollars. The price of mu-shu pork went up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 howard It’s getting tougher and tougher to be a bad Jew.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Here you go, Penny. Shrimp with lobster sauce.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Thank you, Leonard. What’s my share?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Don’t worry about it. It’s my treat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny No, really, how much?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard It’s, whatever. Ten, eleven dollars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Well, which is it, ten or eleven?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Fourteen fifty, but it’s no biggie, you’ll get the next one. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 howard He was just wondering if he wore skintight jeans and a tank top if he’d get his shrimp lo mein for free.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny What are you saying? That I’m using my body to get dinner? That I’m some kind of Chinese food prostitute?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 howard Yeah, Raj, what are you saying?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny ‘Cause let me tell you something, buddy, I pay my own way in this world, okay? I don’t rely on anybody! What was that about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 howard He has a nervous bladder when he’s stressed out. Kind of like a puppy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Here, Leonard, ten, eleven, twelve, uh, fourteen dollars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard It was fourteen fifty, but it’s okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon Oh, good. Dinner’s here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Yes, dinner’s here, and I’m having some. I’m having takeout food.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny You’re damn right it’s okay. I’ve been having leftovers at the restaurant for like four days, and I wanted something different. So sue me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon Forgive me, Penny, but that would be the very definition of a frivolous lawsuit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Sheldon, look, I will pay you back as soon as I can. You just have to give me more time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Oh, wait, you lent her money?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny She needed money. You seem under pressure. Did I not lend you a sufficient amount? Because I can give you more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Oh, you know, you would just love that, wouldn’t you? Yeah. You would just love to open up your little snake can and throw some money at the girl who can’t pay her bills.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Where are you going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Going home, where I won’t be interrogated like a criminal. I forgot my fortune cookie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon In case either of you have larceny in your heart, you should know that I’ve moved my money out of the snake can.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard But if you’re ever short, there’s always a couple of fifties in Green Lantern’s ass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard A little mood lighting, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Yeah. When I didn’t pay my bill, the Department of Water and Power thought I would enjoy the ambience.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Yeah, they’re very considerate that way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny I used Sheldon’s money to pay my rent, then I had like fourteen dollars left over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Fourteen dollars, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Put it back in your pocket, or I’ll find some other place to put it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Back in the pocket it goes. Look, you do understand that Sheldon really doesn’t care when he gets the money back. It’s actually one of the few idiosyncrasies that doesn’t make you want to, you know, kill him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Yeah, well, that’s not really my big problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard So you’re a little behind on your bills. Everybody gets behind on their bills.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Yeah, I know, it’s just, this wasn’t the plan, it wasn’t supposed to go this way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Well, what was the plan?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Um, waitress for six months and then become a movie star.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Was there a plan B?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny TV star.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard It’s probably not as bad as you think. Let’s take a look. Maybe we can find some corners to cut. Oh, here’s something, if you don’t have electricity, then you probably don’t need cable. Just a suggestion. 170 dollars for acting classes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Oh, no, I can’t give up my acting classes. I’m a professional actress.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard You’ve had an acting job where you got paid?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny That is not the definition of professional.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Actually, it kind of… let’s keep looking. Whoa, what’s eighteen hundred dollars to the Los Angeles County Superior Court?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Oh, that’s nothing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Nothing? It sounds like you got caught speeding going 4,000 miles an hour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Well, remember Kurt?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Your ex-boyfriend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Yeah. He got arrested for taking a whiz on a cop car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny He was drunk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard I would hope so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Anyway, he had a bunch of outstanding tickets and a bench warrant, so I, you know, I paid his fines.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Did he pay you back?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny No, but he will.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard And that’s based on the inherent credit-worthiness of people who get drunk and urinate on police vehicles?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Leonard, I’m not gonna call up Kurt and ask him for money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Well what are you gonna do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny I don’t know, but I may have to find a cheaper place to live.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Oh, no. Oh, you don’t want to do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Well, moving is a big deal. You have to go to the supermarket and get boxes, and if they’re not clean, then your books smell like melons, and it’s just, like… Why don’t you just get a roommate and stay here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Well, do you know anybody?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Well, I’m sure the guy living with Sheldon wouldn’t mind moving in with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Oh, Leonard, honey, if we started living together, I wouldn’t be able to keep my hands off you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny And you thought my acting lessons were a waste of money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 howard Ugh. This mu-shu pork’s burning a hole through my duodenum.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 howard Hey, do I mock you with the Bhagavad-Gita every time you scarf down a Whopper?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Hey, what’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 raj We’re on a quest through the Valley of Fire to acquire the sacred crown.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 howard You want the Valley of Fire? It’s right here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Hey, you guys want to go on a real live quest?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon Outside? I just made cocoa.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard – Come on. It’ll be fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 howard What is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Do you guys remember Penny’s ex-boyfriend Kurt? Yeah, that’s him. It turns out he owes Penny a lot of money, and I’m gonna go get it from him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 howard Ooh, double sixes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Really? You’re just gonna let me go by myself?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 raj Oh, cool, I got a sword.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard I could use some help.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 raj Here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard You guys are unbelievable, you play a game to simulate adventure, but when there’s real adventure out there in the real world, you just wimp out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon Leonard, do you not recall the last time we visited this gentleman, we returned home without pants?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard I do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon Are you sure? Because your proposal suggests that you don’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard I’m not afraid of him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon All right. Leonard fairly calls the question, who is in favour of abandoning our game and confronting Penny’s steroid-infused ex-boyfriend in a suicidal mission to extract money from him? Say hi to Kurt for us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Excuse me. When Frodo left the Shire to take the one ring to Mordor, didn’t Samwise, Pippin and Merry go with him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon They did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Well?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon They had a terrible time of it, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 raj Plus, no one stole their pants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Fine. Just enjoy your little game. I’ll make this quest on my own.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 howard Leonard, wait. Take a jacket, it’s spritzing a little.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard You guys suck. Come on, please? He’s so big.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Okay, is everyone clear on the plan?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 howard Yes. Koothrappali’s going to wet himself, I’m gonna throw up, Sheldon’s gonna run away, and you’re going to die. Shall we synchronize our watches?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Guys, there are four of us and one of him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon Which means his triumph will be even larger. Minstrels will write songs about him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Okay, how about this? I’ll do the talking, you just stand behind me and try to look formidable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 raj I should’ve peed before we left.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 kurt Yeah?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Hi, Kurt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 kurt Lenny, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard I don’t really go by Lenny, but that’s okay. Um, you remember Sheldon, Howard and Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 kurt No. What do you want?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon You don’t remember me? How could he not remember me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Sheldon, not now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon I remember him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Okay, here it is. Penny’s in kind of a financial jam, and the money that you owe her would go a long way to solving her problems.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 kurt And she sent you to get it from me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard No, no, she’s too proud to ask for the money. I, on the other hand, feel you should honour your debt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 kurt You do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Feel is a kind of a… it’s a strong word. Um, I just think it would be a nice gesture on your part.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 kurt She’ll get it when she gets it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 howard Well, there you go. Problem solved.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 raj A successful quest. Now let’s go find a gas station with a clean bathroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard No, the problem isn’t solved. He just blew us off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon I’ve got it. He didn’t remember me because the last time we met I was in a Halloween costume.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 howard Come on, Leonard, let’s go
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard No. You can leave if you want to. I’m gonna see this through.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 howard Okay. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard I guess, technically, that was my fault. I’m not leaving here without Penny’s money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 kurt What happened to your backup?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard I don’t need backup. I have right on my side. And I’m wearing cargo shorts under my pants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon Congratulations. You may not have succeeded in getting cash, but you did secure a formal acknowledgment of the debt. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 howard Maybe we should have your head notarized.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 raj If anybody cares, I still have to pee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Hey, is Sheldon here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Yeah. Hang on. Sheldon!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Nice hat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard It’s kind of a fashionable look these days.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Maybe if you’re working on a tuna boat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon Hello, Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Sheldon, here is your money. Thank you very much. It helped a lot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon Sarcasm?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon Darn. I can’t seem to get the hang of that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Hey, I know it’s none of my business, but where did the money come from?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Well, I cut back my expenses like you said and picked up a few more hours at the restaurant, but the biggest thing was, out of the blue, Kurt shows up and gives me the money he owes me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Really? Did he say why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Yes, he said he was feeling guilty and wanted to do what was right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard That’s it? Did he give any reason as to why he came to this moral epiphany?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Nope. I just think he’s really changed. We’re having dinner tomorrow night, and I get to wear my new beret. Bye, guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon Well done, Leonard. The true hero doesn’t seek adulation, he fights for right and justice simply because it’s his nature.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Penny’s hooking up with her jerk of an ex-boyfriend and I have indelible ink on my forehead!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon That’s your badge of honour, your warrior’s wound, if you will. I was wrong, minstrels will write songs about you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard Great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon There once was a brave lad named Leonard, with a fi-fi-fiddle-dee-dee. He faced a fearsome giant, while Raj just wanted to pee.
