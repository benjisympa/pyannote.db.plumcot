TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Hmmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper The problem appears to be unsolvable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Maybe you could run some computer simulations.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 howard_wolowitz There are too many variables. It would take forever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter We’ve got to be missing something. Let’s start again. The movie is playing here at 7:20, here at 7:40, here at 8:10 and here at 8:45.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Right, these theatres have to be eliminated.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Why? They’re state-of-the-art digital projection, 20-channel surround sound.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Yes, but they have no Icee machines. Despite my aggressive letter-writing campaign, I might add.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 raj_koothrappali What about the multiplex here? The seats are terrific.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper They have Twizzlers instead of Red Vines. No amount of lumbar support can compensate for that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Well, it’s gonna take at least an hour to eat, and I don’t see a Sheldon-approved restaurant proximate to a Sheldon-approved theatre.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 raj_koothrappali We could eat after the movie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Unacceptable, the delay would result in tomorrow morning’s bowel movement occurring at work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Hang on, hang on. There’s a 7-Eleven here. We smuggle Slurpies, which are essentially Icees, in under our coats, after having a pleasant meal either here, here or here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 howard_wolowitz Wow. I don’t see how we missed that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Excuse me, in what universe are Slurpies Icees?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 raj_koothrappali That’s how we missed it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, would you be prepared, on a non-precedential basis, to create an emergency ad-hoc Slurpie-Icee equivalency?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Oh, Leonard, you know I can’t do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 howard_wolowitz Okay, I guess we only have one option.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Yep, I don’t see any way around it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Bye, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 howard_wolowitz See ya.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Later, dude.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper They’re right, it was the only option.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Ooh, ooh, shut the door, shut the door.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Just do it! Get inside and shut the door.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Well, you didn’t specify.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Is Leonard around?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper He went to the movies without me. It was the only option. I’m sorry, I don’t understand which social situation this is. Could you give me some guidance as to how to proceed?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny The building manager’s showing an apartment downstairs, and I haven’t paid my rent.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Oh, I see. Penny, I’m not sure I’m comfortable harbouring a fugitive from the 2311 North Los Robles Corporation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny It’s no big deal. I’m just a little behind on my bills because they cut back my hours at the restaurant and my car broke down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper If you recall, I pointed out the “check engine” light to you several months ago.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Well the “check engine” light is fine. It’s still blinking away. It’s the stupid engine that stopped working. It cost me like twelve hundred dollars to fix it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper You know, it occurs to me you could solve all your problems by obtaining more money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Yes, it occurs to me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Hang on a moment. Here. Take some. Pay me back when you can.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Wow, you got a lot of money in there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper That’s why it’s guarded by snakes. Take some.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Don’t be silly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper I’m never silly. Here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny No, I can’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Don’t you need money?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Well, yeah, but…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper This is money I’m not using.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny But what if you need it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper My expenses account for 46.9% of my after-tax income. The rest is divvied up between a small savings account, this deceptive container of peanut brittle and the hollowed-out buttocks of a superhero action figure who shall remain nameless for his own protection. Or her own protection. Take some.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Really? I mean, are you sure?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper I see no large upcoming expenditures unless they develop an affordable technology to fuse my skeleton with adamantium like Wolverine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Are they working on that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper I sincerely hope so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Okay. Well, thank you. Oh, God, no, I can’t. Sheldon honey, I don’t want things to be weird between us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Won’t it also be weird if I have to say hello to you every morning on my way to work and you’re living in a refrigerator box and washing your hair with rain water?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny I’ll pay you back as soon as I can.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Of course you will. It’s impossible to pay me back sooner than you can. Assuming you subscribe to a linear understanding of time and causality.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny I’m regretting this already.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper You know, I’ve given the matter some thought, and I think I’d be willing to be a house pet to a race of super-intelligent aliens.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Interesting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Ask me why.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Do I have to?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Of course. That’s how you move a conversation forward.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper The learning opportunities would be abundant. Additionally, I like having my belly scratched.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Hey, Penny. How was work?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Great. I hope I’m a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory for my whole life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Was that sarcasm?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Was that sarcasm?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Was that sarca..
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Stop it!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Penny, you appear to have a package here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Oh, thanks. This must be the beret I ordered. A couple of months ago. It was back-ordered.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Did you know the beret is an example of piece of women’s fashion adapted from male military uniforms? Another fascinating example is the epaulet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter He’s not lying, he does find that fascinating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Okay, whatever. It’s not like I’m running up and down the streets just buying myself berets. I bought one, like, a month ago, and it was back-ordered, look, it finally arrived, all right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Oh, my God, would you just get off my case?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Weird.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Oh, good, that was an unusual interaction. I wasn’t sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Did you guys have an argument?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Well, you clearly did something to aggravate her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper I’m at a loss. If you like, you can review my daily log of social interactions and see if there’s a blunder I overlooked.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Here you go. Oh, you owe me another two dollars. The price of mu-shu pork went up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 howard_wolowitz It’s getting tougher and tougher to be a bad Jew.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Here you go, Penny. Shrimp with lobster sauce.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Thank you, Leonard. What’s my share?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Don’t worry about it. It’s my treat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny No, really, how much?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter It’s, whatever. Ten, eleven dollars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Well, which is it, ten or eleven?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Fourteen fifty, but it’s no biggie, you’ll get the next one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 howard_wolowitz He was just wondering if he wore skintight jeans and a tank top if he’d get his shrimp lo mein for free.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny What are you saying? That I’m using my body to get dinner? That I’m some kind of Chinese food prostitute?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 howard_wolowitz Yeah, Raj, what are you saying?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny ‘Cause let me tell you something, buddy, I pay my own way in this world, okay? I don’t rely on anybody! What was that about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 howard_wolowitz He has a nervous bladder when he’s stressed out. Kind of like a puppy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Here, Leonard, ten, eleven, twelve, uh, fourteen dollars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter It was fourteen fifty, but it’s okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Oh, good. Dinner’s here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Yes, dinner’s here, and I’m having some. I’m having takeout food.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny You’re damn right it’s okay. I’ve been having leftovers at the restaurant for like four days, and I wanted something different. So sue me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Forgive me, Penny, but that would be the very definition of a frivolous lawsuit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Sheldon, look, I will pay you back as soon as I can. You just have to give me more time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Oh, wait, you lent her money?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny She needed money. You seem under pressure. Did I not lend you a sufficient amount? Because I can give you more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Oh, you know, you would just love that, wouldn’t you? Yeah. You would just love to open up your little snake can and throw some money at the girl who can’t pay her bills.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Where are you going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Going home, where I won’t be interrogated like a criminal. I forgot my fortune cookie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper In case either of you have larceny in your heart, you should know that I’ve moved my money out of the snake can.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter But if you’re ever short, there’s always a couple of fifties in Green Lantern’s ass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter A little mood lighting, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Yeah. When I didn’t pay my bill, the Department of Water and Power thought I would enjoy the ambience.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, they’re very considerate that way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny I used Sheldon’s money to pay my rent, then I had like fourteen dollars left over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Fourteen dollars, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Put it back in your pocket, or I’ll find some other place to put it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Back in the pocket it goes. Look, you do understand that Sheldon really doesn’t care when he gets the money back. It’s actually one of the few idiosyncrasies that doesn’t make you want to, you know, kill him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Yeah, well, that’s not really my big problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter So you’re a little behind on your bills. Everybody gets behind on their bills.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Yeah, I know, it’s just, this wasn’t the plan, it wasn’t supposed to go this way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Well, what was the plan?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Um, waitress for six months and then become a movie star.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Was there a plan B?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny TV star.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter It’s probably not as bad as you think. Let’s take a look. Maybe we can find some corners to cut. Oh, here’s something, if you don’t have electricity, then you probably don’t need cable. Just a suggestion. 170 dollars for acting classes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Oh, no, I can’t give up my acting classes. I’m a professional actress.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter You’ve had an acting job where you got paid?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny That is not the definition of professional.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Actually, it kind of… let’s keep looking. Whoa, what’s eighteen hundred dollars to the Los Angeles County Superior Court?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Oh, that’s nothing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Nothing? It sounds like you got caught speeding going 4,000 miles an hour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Well, remember Kurt?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Your ex-boyfriend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Yeah. He got arrested for taking a whiz on a cop car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny He was drunk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter I would hope so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Anyway, he had a bunch of outstanding tickets and a bench warrant, so I, you know, I paid his fines.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Did he pay you back?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny No, but he will.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter And that’s based on the inherent credit-worthiness of people who get drunk and urinate on police vehicles?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Leonard, I’m not gonna call up Kurt and ask him for money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Well what are you gonna do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny I don’t know, but I may have to find a cheaper place to live.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Oh, no. Oh, you don’t want to do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Well, moving is a big deal. You have to go to the supermarket and get boxes, and if they’re not clean, then your books smell like melons, and it’s just, like… Why don’t you just get a roommate and stay here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Well, do you know anybody?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Well, I’m sure the guy living with Sheldon wouldn’t mind moving in with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Oh, Leonard, honey, if we started living together, I wouldn’t be able to keep my hands off you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny And you thought my acting lessons were a waste of money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 howard_wolowitz Ugh. This mu-shu pork’s burning a hole through my duodenum.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 howard_wolowitz Hey, do I mock you with the Bhagavad-Gita every time you scarf down a Whopper?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Hey, what’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 raj_koothrappali We’re on a quest through the Valley of Fire to acquire the sacred crown.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 howard_wolowitz You want the Valley of Fire? It’s right here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Hey, you guys want to go on a real live quest?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Outside? I just made cocoa.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter – Come on. It’ll be fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 howard_wolowitz What is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Do you guys remember Penny’s ex-boyfriend Kurt? Yeah, that’s him. It turns out he owes Penny a lot of money, and I’m gonna go get it from him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 howard_wolowitz Ooh, double sixes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Really? You’re just gonna let me go by myself?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Oh, cool, I got a sword.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter I could use some help.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter You guys are unbelievable, you play a game to simulate adventure, but when there’s real adventure out there in the real world, you just wimp out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Leonard, do you not recall the last time we visited this gentleman, we returned home without pants?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter I do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Are you sure? Because your proposal suggests that you don’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter I’m not afraid of him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper All right. Leonard fairly calls the question, who is in favour of abandoning our game and confronting Penny’s steroid-infused ex-boyfriend in a suicidal mission to extract money from him? Say hi to Kurt for us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Excuse me. When Frodo left the Shire to take the one ring to Mordor, didn’t Samwise, Pippin and Merry go with him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper They did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Well?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper They had a terrible time of it, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Plus, no one stole their pants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Fine. Just enjoy your little game. I’ll make this quest on my own.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 howard_wolowitz Leonard, wait. Take a jacket, it’s spritzing a little.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter You guys suck. Come on, please? He’s so big.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Okay, is everyone clear on the plan?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 howard_wolowitz Yes. Koothrappali’s going to wet himself, I’m gonna throw up, Sheldon’s gonna run away, and you’re going to die. Shall we synchronize our watches?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Guys, there are four of us and one of him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Which means his triumph will be even larger. Minstrels will write songs about him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Okay, how about this? I’ll do the talking, you just stand behind me and try to look formidable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 raj_koothrappali I should’ve peed before we left.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 kurt Yeah?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Hi, Kurt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 kurt Lenny, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter I don’t really go by Lenny, but that’s okay. Um, you remember Sheldon, Howard and Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 kurt No. What do you want?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper You don’t remember me? How could he not remember me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, not now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper I remember him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Okay, here it is. Penny’s in kind of a financial jam, and the money that you owe her would go a long way to solving her problems.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 kurt And she sent you to get it from me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter No, no, she’s too proud to ask for the money. I, on the other hand, feel you should honour your debt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 kurt You do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Feel is a kind of a… it’s a strong word. Um, I just think it would be a nice gesture on your part.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 kurt She’ll get it when she gets it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 howard_wolowitz Well, there you go. Problem solved.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 raj_koothrappali A successful quest. Now let’s go find a gas station with a clean bathroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter No, the problem isn’t solved. He just blew us off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper I’ve got it. He didn’t remember me because the last time we met I was in a Halloween costume.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 howard_wolowitz Come on, Leonard, let’s go
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter No. You can leave if you want to. I’m gonna see this through.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 howard_wolowitz Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter I guess, technically, that was my fault. I’m not leaving here without Penny’s money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 kurt What happened to your backup?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter I don’t need backup. I have right on my side. And I’m wearing cargo shorts under my pants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Congratulations. You may not have succeeded in getting cash, but you did secure a formal acknowledgment of the debt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 howard_wolowitz Maybe we should have your head notarized.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 raj_koothrappali If anybody cares, I still have to pee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Hey, is Sheldon here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Yeah. Hang on. Sheldon!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Nice hat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter It’s kind of a fashionable look these days.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Maybe if you’re working on a tuna boat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Hello, Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Sheldon, here is your money. Thank you very much. It helped a lot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Sarcasm?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Darn. I can’t seem to get the hang of that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Hey, I know it’s none of my business, but where did the money come from?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Well, I cut back my expenses like you said and picked up a few more hours at the restaurant, but the biggest thing was, out of the blue, Kurt shows up and gives me the money he owes me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Really? Did he say why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Yes, he said he was feeling guilty and wanted to do what was right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter That’s it? Did he give any reason as to why he came to this moral epiphany?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 penny Nope. I just think he’s really changed. We’re having dinner tomorrow night, and I get to wear my new beret. Bye, guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Well done, Leonard. The true hero doesn’t seek adulation, he fights for right and justice simply because it’s his nature.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Penny’s hooking up with her jerk of an ex-boyfriend and I have indelible ink on my forehead!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper That’s your badge of honour, your warrior’s wound, if you will. I was wrong, minstrels will write songs about you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode14 sheldon_cooper There once was a brave lad named Leonard, with a fi-fi-fiddle-dee-dee. He faced a fearsome giant, while Raj just wanted to pee.
