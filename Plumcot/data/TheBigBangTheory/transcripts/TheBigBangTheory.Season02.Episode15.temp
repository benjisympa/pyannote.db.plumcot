TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 penny Fellas, please.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 howard Penny, come on, we were just finding our sound.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 penny You found it. It’s the sound of a cat being run over by a lawn mower.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard I’m really very busy. Is there any way that we can put this off until I have more time to prepare? Of course. But, uh, you understand my trepidation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 penny What’s that about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 howard Not a clue.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard Can’t we just postpone it till the spring? Maybe next summer?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 sheldon This should be fairly easy to deduce. He’s holding the phone to his left ear. Ears do not cross hemispheres, so he’s using the analytical rather than the emotional side of the brain, suggesting that he has no personal relationship with the caller.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard No, I didn’t realize it had been so long. Sure, I guess there’s no other choice but to just go ahead and do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 sheldon He’s referring to an activity he has done before. It’s unpleasant and needs to be repeated. This suggests some sort of invasive medical test, like perhaps a colonoscopy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard Aren’t there any other options? There’s not a lot of room, it’s gonna be uncomfortable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 sheldon Yes, yes. Yeah, I’m definitely going with colonoscopy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard Okay, bye. My mother’s coming to visit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 howard How about that, you were right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 penny It’s out of order.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 woman Yes, I can read the sign, I’m just pondering the implications.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 penny I think it implies that the elevator doesn’t work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 woman Again, I can read the sign. But the sign and the tape are covered with a layer of dust, which indicates that the elevator has been non-functional for a significant amount of time. Which suggests either a remarkable passivity among the, I assume, 24 to 36 residents of this building based on the number of mailboxes and given typical urban population density or a shared delusion of functionality.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 penny You must be Leonard’s mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonards_mother Oh, I don’t know if I must be, but yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 penny Uh, I’m Penny. I’m his neighbour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonards_mother Oh, Dr. Beverley Hofstadter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 penny Oh, nice to meet you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley Oh, you’re a hand shaker. Interesting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 penny Uh, why don’t you come with me. I’ll walk you to the apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley Oh, all right. Would you like to exchange pleasantries on the way?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 penny Yeah, sure, I guess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley All right, you start.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 penny Okay. You know, I’ve always been curious. What was Leonard like when he was little?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley Oh, I think you mean young. He’s always been little.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 penny Right, okay. What was he like when he was young?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley You’ll have to be more specific.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 penny Oh, um, okay, like, five or six. Five.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley Oh, well, at that age he was well enmeshed in what Freud would call the phallic stage of psychosexual development. An outmoded theory, of course, but the boy did spend most of his waking hours with a tight grasp on his penis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 penny Yeah, Leonard mentioned you were a psychiatrist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley Well, that is one of my degrees. My primary field is neuroscience.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 penny Oh, well, I’m an actress.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 penny What do you mean why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley Well, there are studies that suggest that many who go into the performing arts suffer from an external locus of identity.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 penny Yeah, I don’t know what that means.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley Well, it means you value yourself only as others value you, which is often the result of unmet childhood emotional needs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 penny Oh, well, I had a wonderful childhood.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley Tell me about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 penny I know my dad wanted a boy. I just, I tried being good at sports, but I hated getting dirty!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley And then, I’m assuming, you entered adolescence.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 penny Uh-huh, he called me Slugger until I got my first training bra, and then he just stopped playing catch with me. I wasn’t Slugger anymore. Your mother’s here!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley If you want to have intercourse with that girl, find out what kind of cologne her father wore.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard Good to see you, Mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard Here’s your tea, Mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley Oolong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley Loose, not bagged?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley Steeped three minutes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley Two-percent milk?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley Warmed separately?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley One teaspoon sugar?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley Raw sugar?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley It’s cold.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard I’ll start again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 sheldon I have the same problem with him. My theory is that his lack of focus stems from an over-developed sex drive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 sheldon That seems a fairly efficient arrangement.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley Yes, we think so. We’ve both done papers on it. Mine from the neuroscientific point of view and his from an anthropological. Mine, of course, was the only one worth reading.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 sheldon Of course. I would very much like to read about your sex life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley Well, it’s all online or you can order it from the Princeton University Press.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard Here’s your tea, Mother. So, what are you guys talking about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 sheldon The frequency with which your parents had intercourse.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard Swell. If you’re lucky, maybe she’ll show you the PowerPoint presentation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley I’m sorry, it’s on my other laptop.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 sheldon Aw…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard So, Mother, what’s new?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley You’ll have to be more specific.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard All right. Uh, what’s new with you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley Oh, well, I’ve been having some fascinating menopausal symptoms recently.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard Maybe something less personal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley Oh. Your Uncle Floyd died.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard Oh, my God. What happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley His heart stopped beating. I have to urinate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 sheldon What a remarkable woman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard Yeah I, I thought you guys might hit it off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 sheldon I envy you your childhood.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard I hate to tell you, but the only warm memories I have of my childhood are of my Uncle Floyd.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 sheldon You’re clearly misremembering. Your mother is brilliant, analytical, insightful, and I’m betting she never hit you with a Bible because you wouldn’t eat your Brussels sprouts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard Sheldon, you don’t give your mother enough credit. She’s warm, she’s loving, she doesn’t glue electrodes to your head to measure your brain waves while potty training.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 sheldon You were lucky. When I was a kid, if I wanted an EEG, I had to attach my own electrodes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 howard So, Dr. Hofstadter, Leonard rarely talks about his incredibly successful brother and sister.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard Please, don’t go there, Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 howard I understand that unlike Leonard, they’re at the top of their respective fields.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard Boy, you suck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley Well, Leonard’s younger brother, Michael, is a tenured law professor at Harvard, and his sister just successfully grew a human pancreas in an adolescent gibbon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 howard So, she’s close to curing diabetes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley Why else would you grow a pancreas in a teenaged gibbon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 howard Wow, you must be very proud.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley Why? They’re not my accomplishments. I have to urinate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard Why are you doing this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 howard You know the rules. You brought your mom to work, you must suffer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 sheldon Leonard, I had no idea your siblings were so much more successful than you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 raj Yeah, you’re like the Jar Jar Binks of the Hofstadter family.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 howard Oh, meesa think yousa lookin’ so so sad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard You know, rather than mock me, my friends might realize that this is difficult and try to help me through it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 raj Nope, I think mocking you is more fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 howard Next time, don’t yousa bring mama to work. Okee-day?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard That was fast.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley Oh, the middle stall was occupied. I’ll have to try again later.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 sheldon It’s totally understandable. In bladder voiding, as in real estate, it’s location, location, location.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley So, where were we?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard Howard lives with his mother and Raj can’t speak to women unless he’s drunk. Go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley That’s fascinating. Selective mutism is quite rare. On the other hand, an adult Jewish male living with his mother is so common it borders on sociological cliché.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 howard It’s just temporary, I pay rent.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard He lives in the same room where his bassinet was.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley You know, both selective mutism and an inability to separate from one’s mother can stem from a pathological fear of women. It might explain why the two of you have created an ersatz homosexual marriage to satisfy your need for intimacy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 howard Say what? That’s basically what I just said.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard You brought your husband to work, you know the rules. Meesa thinking yousa looking pretty sad now too, betcha, betcha.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley Leonard, it’s one o’clock, weren’t you going to show me your laboratory at one o’clock?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard There’s no hurry, Mother, tell them more about their secret love for each other.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley But it’s one o’clock, you were going to show me your laboratory at one o’clock.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 sheldon Her reasoning is unassailable. It is one o’clock.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard Fine. Let’s go. I think you’ll find my work pretty interesting. I’m attempting to replicate the dark matter signal found in sodium iodide crystals by the Italians.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley So, no original research?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley Well, what’s the point of my seeing it? I could just read the paper the Italians wrote.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 howard Just for the record, we’re not in an ersatz homosexual relationship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 raj Well, then why didn’t you say that to her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 howard Why is it always my responsibility?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 raj It’s not always your responsibility. I swear, this is the same thing you did at the comic book store last week.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 howard I can’t believe you’re bringing that up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 raj I didn’t bring it up. You did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 howard We’ll talk about this later.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 raj You always say that, but we never do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 sheldon You went to the comic book store without me.7
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 penny Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard You got alcohol?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 penny Your mom still here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard Yep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 penny Come on in. Wait, wait, she’s not gonna come here looking for you, is she?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard Oh, relax. She took Sheldon to the hospital to get a brain scan.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 penny Oh, my God. What happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard Nothing. Mother likes looking at brains and Sheldon likes getting his brain scanned.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 penny Geez, what a fun couple.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard She’s only been here a day and a half and I’m seriously considering alcoholism as a new career path.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 penny Hey, I talked to her for five minutes yesterday and I’ve been half bombed ever since.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard You can’t let her get into your head.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 penny My head, what about yours?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard It’s too late for me. My head is her summer house.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 penny She was right, you know. The locus of my identity is totally exterior to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard Oh, yeah, there she is. Hi, Mom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 penny I mean, do you know where I was all morning? Auditioning with 50 other blondes for some stupid antidepressant commercial. And for what? So I’ll finally get my daddy’s approval?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard Did you get the part?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 penny No, they said I was too perky.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard Hey, you want to talk about not getting love from a parent. You know what I used to do when I was little to have some sensation of human contact?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 penny Yeah, you grabbed your penis and wouldn’t let go. Your mother told me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard Of course she did. Anyway, that’s not what I was gonna say. When I was ten years old, I built a hugging machine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 penny A hugging machine?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard Yeah. I got a dressmaker’s mannequin, I stuffed it with an electric blanket so it would be warm, and built two radio-controlled arms that would hug me and pat my back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 penny Oh, that is so sad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard You know what the saddest part was?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard My father used to borrow it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley Your scan data will be very elpful to my research. You have a remarkable brain.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 sheldon I know. Although I’ve always hated how my right frontal lobe looks in pictures.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley Common complaint among men. Nothing’s ever big enough, except when they get a tumour. Then you never hear the end of it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 sheldon I’d love to see a scan of your brain sometime.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley Oh, I’ll send you a link, but its physiology is fairly unimpressive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 sheldon Oh, I can’t believe that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley Your unwillingness to accept empirical evidence suggests an attempt at flattery.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 sheldon My apologies. I’ve been living with your son too long. Gotten into some bad habits.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley Understandable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 sheldon Can I make you a cup of tea?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley I doubt it, but if anyone has a chance, it’s probably you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 sheldon I feel very comfortable around you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley I feel very comfortable around you, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 sheldon It’s surprising because I generally don’t feel comfortable around, well, anyone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley Nor I.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 sheldon What are the odds that two individuals as unique as ourselves would be connected by someone as comparatively workaday as your son?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley Is that a rhetorical point or would you like to do the math?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 sheldon I’d like to do the math.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley I’d like that, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 penny Okay, now this time…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard Uh-huh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 penny You’re gonna lick the salt off my neck, do the shot, and then bite the lime.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard I’m sorry, I didn’t hear anything after lick.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 penny Neck, shot, lime. Okay, shot, lime.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard Right. Ah! Where’s the lime? Oh, okay, we’re sharing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 sheldon So, what do you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley I’m very tempted. I’m just not sure it’s appropriate with my son’s roommate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 sheldon Normally, I’d feel the same way. But based on everything I’ve observed about us, I can’t help but speculate we’d be very good together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley True. I’ve had a similar observation. It’s certainly something I could never do with my husband.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 sheldon I was hesitant the first time I tried it, but I experienced an unanticipated and remarkable release of endorphins. It’s quite satisfying.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley I see what you’re doing. You’re appealing to the neuroscientific researcher in me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 sheldon You see right through me, don’t you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley Only when you’re in a CAT scanner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard This is actually gonna happen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 penny Honey, shush, shush, shush, shush, shush.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard You shush, I’m happy, I want to talk about it. You know what my mother would say about this? She would say because you were not loved by your father and I was not loved by my mother, that having sex is our way of making up for the intimacy we didn’t get as children.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 penny Why would you bring that up right now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard I don’t know. Foreplay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 penny So you’re saying you’re not having sex with me, you’re having sex with your mother?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard Ummm, I’m gonna go with “no.”
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 penny That is the sickest thing I’ve ever heard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard Come on, you’re trying to have sex with your father, and I’m okay with that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 penny Get out!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard She said shush. I should have shushed. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard All right, Mother. Um, have a nice flight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley That’s not really in my control, is it? Oh, uh, yes 
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 penny Oh, good morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard Morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 penny Look, I was just coming over to talk to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard You don’t have to. Ever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 penny Gotcha.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 leonard Good-bye, Mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley Good-bye, Leonard. So, Slugger, shall we pick up where we left off last time?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 penny I mean, my mom could’ve just said, “Bob, get over it, she’s a girl, move on.” But she didn’t. Not one word.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley Interesting. Would you be willing to fly to New Jersey and discuss your relationship with your parents during a brain scan?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 penny Would it help?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode15 beverley Well, it would help me.
