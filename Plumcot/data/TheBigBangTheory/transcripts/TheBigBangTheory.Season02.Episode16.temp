TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard That was close.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 raj God, I love the smell of paintballs in the morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard Yeah, still funny, Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard There’s no way we can get to the ridge. The Chemistry Department has us completely cut off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard But what about the creek bed?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon The Pharmacology Department controls that, and they’re all hopped up on experimental steroids.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 raj Well, that’s it then, we’re doomed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon I think the time has come to acknowledge that we are paying the price for some of us failing to attend my Physics Department paintball strategy meeting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard I told you my mom has spider veins, I had to take her to the laser clinic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon And I told you I wanted to see a doctor’s note.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 raj We need a plan. How about Operation Hammer of the Gods?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard I forget. Which one is Hammer of the Gods?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 raj We hide behind the Dumpsters in the parking lot and ambush people when they come to pee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard No go. The Dumpsters are deep in Astronomy Department territory.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard No, that shouldn’t be a problem, Venus is up during the day. They’re probably just all staring at the sky.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon All right, what we need now is a tactical retreat. Did you see the episode of Stargate where they found themselves on a planet with a culture based loosely on Earth’s Athens and Sparta? Not important. Leonard, Raj and I are going to burst out the door and run away, Howard will cover us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard Why don’t I run away and you cover me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon Because you chose your mother’s veins over victory. On three. One, two, three, go!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard I had to take her! It’s almost bathing suit weather!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie Howard, I’m on your team.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard Oh, Leslie, thank God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie Where’s the rest of your squad?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard Ah, they left me here to die. What about yours?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie Dead, all of them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard Sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie Don’t be. It was friendly fire. They just wouldn’t listen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard Well, we’re surrounded, so I guess there’s nothing for us to do but wait to be captured or killed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie Hmm, that’s the worst part, the waiting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard All the while knowing that there’s a paint pellet out there with your name on it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie Yeah, the big wet ball of death. Kind of makes you feel more alive, doesn’t it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard It kind of does.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie I say we make every moment count.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard I agree. How exactly do we do that? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard Howard, why aren’t you covering us? We’re getting slaughtered out here!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard War is hell.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 raj Did you guys see the new budget memo that went out this morning?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard Yeah, more cutbacks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon Unacceptable. It baffles me why they don’t simply let some of you go so that there’s money available for my research.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard You know what baffles me, Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon Based on your academic record, any number of things, I would imagine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie Hey, guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard Hey, Leslie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie Howard, I got the approval for the rapid prototyper you wanted.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard That’s great, Leslie. Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie You scratch my back, I scratch yours. Rawr.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 raj What was all that about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard Oh, uh, no big deal. They gave Leslie control of some unrestricted grant money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard Yeah, okay, but what’s with the back-scratching and the meow!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon I believe the back-scratching metaphor generally describes a quid pro quo situation where one party provides goods or services to the second party in compensation for a similar action.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon The mrow, that sounded to me like an African civet cat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard Are you done?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon No. Despite what the name suggests, the civet cat is not a true cat. Now I’m done.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 raj You know what I’m thinking? I’m thinking Howard wasn’t making a back-scratching metaphor. I’m thinking there was some actual scratching involved.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard What about it, Howard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard Okay, I didn’t want to say anything ’cause I know you and Leslie have a little history.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard I don’t care about that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard Great, ’cause I’ve been dying to say something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard You and Leslie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard In the paintball shed! Twice!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon Is that why you didn’t cover our escape and let us get cut down like animals?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard Oh, yeah, sorry about that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon My good man, dereliction of duty in the face of the enemy is a court-martial offense.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard Court-martial, schmort-martial, Leslie Winkle is the fifth girl I’ve ever had sex with. I mean, for free.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 raj And plus, you got a rapid prototyper. That’s an expensive piece of equipment, dude.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard And the rest of us have had our budgets cut to the bone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard Okay, one way to look at this is that I’m getting new equipment, and you’re not, and that’s unfair. But a better way to look at this is that I’m getting sex and you’re not, and that’s delightful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny The whole thing froze. I don’t know what happened.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard Calm down. We’ll figure it out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny How can I calm down? I’m gonna lose my whole shopping cart. That’s three hours of picking out shoes just shot to hell.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon Hello, Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny Hello, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon You’re in my spot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny Are you planning on sitting here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon No, I’m going to the comic book store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny Then what difference does it make?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon What difference does it make?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard Here we go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon That is my spot. In an ever-changing world, it is a single point of consistency. If my life were expressed as a function on a four-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, that spot at the moment I first sat on it would be zero-zero-zero-zero.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard Don’t sit in his spot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny Fine. Happy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon I’m not unhappy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny Boy, I love him, but he is one serious wackadoodle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard Okay, that should do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny Oh, thank you. You are a lifesaver.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard That’s a lot of shoes you ordered.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny Yeah, you know the sad thing is, it’s really not. Ooh, is this one of those paintball guns?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard Yeah. You ought to come out with us sometime.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny Oh, no, thanks. I’m from Nebraska. When we shoot things, it’s because we want to eat them or make them leave our boyfriends alone. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie Boy, your heart’s racing. I must’ve really gotten you going.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard Well, it’s partly you, partly my transient idiopathic arrhythmia.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie Sexy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard Can I assume that you likewise found the experience…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie Satisfactory?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard That wasn’t quite the word I was looking for, but sure, I’ll do this pass-fail.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie Hey, are you enjoying that prototyper I got you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard Oh, it’s great. Everybody in the Engineering Department is eating their hearts out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie Isn’t it nice when your good fortune makes others miserable?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard You know, most people don’t get that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howards_mother Howard, I’m home!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard Oh, great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howards_mother Book club was cancelled! That thing on Phyllis’s neck opened up again!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard I’m busy, Ma!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howards_mother Too busy to help your mother with her zipper?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard Don’t come in, Ma!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howards_mother Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie He’s got company!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard Oh, there’s the arrhythmia.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howards_mother Is she Jewish?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard Are you Jewish?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard Yes!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howards_mother Okay, then you kids have fun! Use protection!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny You think he’ll notice?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard There’s a chance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny Oh, what are we gonna do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard We? No, no, no, you had your chance to be we for, like, a year and a half now. Right now, you are you, and you are screwed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny Why do we have to tell him I did it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard Well, we’re not gonna tell him I did it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny Okay, okay, how about this? We tell him somebody broke in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard Just to shoot the couch with a paintball gun?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny I’m sorry, I buy it. All those people are on drugs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard We could tell him they wanted the couch to stay away from their boyfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny Okay, fine. Well, what if we just flip it over? There. Looks fine, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard Mm, butt print. There’s no discernible butt print.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny Oh, come on. There, butt print.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard It’s too small and too perfect.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard You’re welcome.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny Shh! Act normal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard Sheldon! How was the comic book store?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon Fine. The new issue of Flash is out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard Great, great. Did you walk the whole way? It’s a little chilly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon Koothrappali picked me up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard Isn’t that terrific? He is such a good friend. You know what the best thing about friends is?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon They don’t talk incessantly for no particular reason.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard No, no, friends forgive the little things.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny You know, I gotta go home and wash my hair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard Don’t you dare, missy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon Hello, fastest man alive. Want to see me read your entire comic book? Want to see it again? Something’s wrong.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard What do you mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon I’m not sure. It doesn’t feel right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard I don’t know what you’re talking about. Oh, that. Penny did that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard Why don’t you just eat in your desk chair?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon Why don’t I just eat in my desk chair?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny Here we go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon That is my desk chair, that is where I work. I don’t eat in my desk chair and I don’t work in my spot. I work in my desk chair and eat in my spot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard Wackadoodle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard You know, there’s kind of an obvious solution here. Get up. There. Problem solved. Nobody cares where you’re going to sit. You’re not crazy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon Excuse me, but the problem is not solved. If your head had been accidentally amputated, and we transplanted a dog’s head in its place, would that be “problem solved”?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard If it were your head, it would be.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny Sheldon, I am really, really sorry, but it’s only for a week. Can’t you be a little bit flexible? Yeah, sorry. I didn’t really think that through.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon You claim it’s going to be a week, but I have no faith in your dry cleaner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon Did you notice the sign on his counter? He’s not a full-time dry cleaner. He also makes keys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard Oh, for God’s sake, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon Focus is important. Was Michael DeBakey a wedding planner in between heart transplants? Did Alexander Fleming moonlight as a hairdresser? “Thanks for discovering penicillin, now how about we try a bouffant?”
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard Ooh, looks like I’m gonna have sex tonight. Hey, baby…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny His right hand is calling him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard No, it’s Leslie Winkle. It’s a long story.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard I’ll pick you up in ten minutes. Gentlemen, adieu.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard I thought we were going to play Halo tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard What am I supposed to do, Leonard? There’s a woman out there anxious to have sex with me. You understand, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny No. Not at all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard Nevertheless, I must depart. By the way, did I tell you? Leslie pulled some strings and got me on the research trip to Geneva to check out the CERN Supercollider.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard That’s not fair. You’re not even a physicist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard Okay, there are two ways of looking at this…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard Get out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie You’re improving.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard Thank you. It helps when I get to practice with a real woman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie Hey, listen. Saturday my sister’s getting married. I.. I want you to come with me. It’s black tie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard Yeah, gee, I’d really rather not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard When I go to weddings, it’s to scam on chunky bridesmaids. I don’t know what I would do with a date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie Oh, all right. I understand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie Hey, I’m really sorry about that Geneva trip.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard What about it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie Oh, didn’t you hear? I had to reduce the number of people going, and you didn’t make the cut.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard When did that happen?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie About 12 seconds ago.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard Well, hold on. Are you saying if I don’t go to the wedding, I can’t go to Geneva?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie Actually, I’m trying not to say it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard Okay, I’m sorry, but that makes me a little uncomfortable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie How so?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard Because it’s like you’re controlling me with new equipment and research trips.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie Well, if I weren’t controlling you with new equipment and research trips, then I’d be uncomfortable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard How so?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie ‘Cause then we’d be in, like, a real relationship with feelings and all that crap.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard So, bottom line, I’m just a bought-and-paid-for sex toy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie No. No, not at all. You’re also arm candy. So? What do you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard Hey, Ma, you got to rent me a tux!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howards_mother Right now? What kind of sex are you having up there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard Why are you crouching there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon This is my spot. Where else am I supposed to crouch?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard I don’t know. Texas?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny Here you go. Fresh from the cleaners, good as new.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard Really? Great. Sheldon, look. Good as new.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon From that key maker, I highly doubt it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny Come on, Sheldon. Just give it a try.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny There, nice and comfy cosy. Zero, zero, zero.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon There’s one more zero. You forgot the time parameter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny Sit on the damn couch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon Nope.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny What do you mean, nope? What’s wrong with it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard Nothing, it’s what’s wrong with him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny It’s exactly the same…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard Penny, Penny, I think I know what to do. Sheldon, I have some bad news.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon More?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard I’m afraid so. You know the cashew chicken I get you Monday nights?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon Yes. From Szechuan Palace.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard Szechuan Palace closed two years ago.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon What? Wh-Where did my cashew chicken come from?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard Golden Dragon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon No. No, this isn’t right. Our food always comes in Szechuan Palace containers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard Yeah, well, before they went out of business, I bought 4,000 containers. I keep them in the trunk of my car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon But. Oh, this changes everything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard I thought that might take his mind off the cushion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon What’s real? What isn’t? How can I know?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny You did make that up, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard Oh, God, I wish I had.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard Yeah, buddy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon I still don’t like this cushion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard Okay, first of all, Penny, thank you for coming.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny Thanks for the shoes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard Penny is an amazing shot. I think we have a real chance to win this week.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard What’s the plan?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard Okay. Now, we all run out. Sheldon and I will cut to the left behind these trees. Raj, Howard and Leslie flank to the right behind the rocks. Then we’ll all have a great view as Penny runs out and kills everyone else in sight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon Right, just one thing before we start.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard What is it, Sheldon? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny What the hell?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon That was for my cushion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard Sheldon, Penny was our only hope.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon I’m sorry, Leonard. But revenge is a dish best served cold.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny Screw that. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon She can’t shoot me. She’s dead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard He’s right. You can’t. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon Well, if we’re going to descend into anarchy 
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard Okay, see you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard Where are you going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie Surrender, then Denny’s.
