TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz That was close.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 raj_koothrappali God, I love the smell of paintballs in the morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Yeah, still funny, Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter There’s no way we can get to the ridge. The Chemistry Department has us completely cut off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz But what about the creek bed?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon_cooper The Pharmacology Department controls that, and they’re all hopped up on experimental steroids.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 raj_koothrappali Well, that’s it then, we’re doomed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon_cooper I think the time has come to acknowledge that we are paying the price for some of us failing to attend my Physics Department paintball strategy meeting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz I told you my mom has spider veins, I had to take her to the laser clinic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon_cooper And I told you I wanted to see a doctor’s note.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 raj_koothrappali We need a plan. How about Operation Hammer of the Gods?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter I forget. Which one is Hammer of the Gods?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 raj_koothrappali We hide behind the Dumpsters in the parking lot and ambush people when they come to pee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz No go. The Dumpsters are deep in Astronomy Department territory.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter No, that shouldn’t be a problem, Venus is up during the day. They’re probably just all staring at the sky.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon_cooper All right, what we need now is a tactical retreat. Did you see the episode of Stargate where they found themselves on a planet with a culture based loosely on Earth’s Athens and Sparta? Not important. Leonard, Raj and I are going to burst out the door and run away, Howard will cover us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Why don’t I run away and you cover me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Because you chose your mother’s veins over victory. On three. One, two, three, go!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz I had to take her! It’s almost bathing suit weather!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie_winkle Howard, I’m on your team.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Oh, Leslie, thank God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie_winkle Where’s the rest of your squad?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Ah, they left me here to die. What about yours?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie_winkle Dead, all of them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie_winkle Don’t be. It was friendly fire. They just wouldn’t listen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Well, we’re surrounded, so I guess there’s nothing for us to do but wait to be captured or killed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie_winkle Hmm, that’s the worst part, the waiting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz All the while knowing that there’s a paint pellet out there with your name on it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie_winkle Yeah, the big wet ball of death. Kind of makes you feel more alive, doesn’t it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz It kind of does.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie_winkle I say we make every moment count.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz I agree. How exactly do we do that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Howard, why aren’t you covering us? We’re getting slaughtered out here!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz War is hell.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 raj_koothrappali Did you guys see the new budget memo that went out this morning?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, more cutbacks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Unacceptable. It baffles me why they don’t simply let some of you go so that there’s money available for my research.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter You know what baffles me, Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Based on your academic record, any number of things, I would imagine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie_winkle Hey, guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Hey, Leslie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie_winkle Howard, I got the approval for the rapid prototyper you wanted.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz That’s great, Leslie. Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie_winkle You scratch my back, I scratch yours. Rawr.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 raj_koothrappali What was all that about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Oh, uh, no big deal. They gave Leslie control of some unrestricted grant money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, okay, but what’s with the back-scratching and the meow!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon_cooper I believe the back-scratching metaphor generally describes a quid pro quo situation where one party provides goods or services to the second party in compensation for a similar action.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon_cooper The mrow, that sounded to me like an African civet cat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Are you done?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon_cooper No. Despite what the name suggests, the civet cat is not a true cat. Now I’m done.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 raj_koothrappali You know what I’m thinking? I’m thinking Howard wasn’t making a back-scratching metaphor. I’m thinking there was some actual scratching involved.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter What about it, Howard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Okay, I didn’t want to say anything ’cause I know you and Leslie have a little history.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter I don’t care about that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Great, ’cause I’ve been dying to say something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter You and Leslie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz In the paintball shed! Twice!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Is that why you didn’t cover our escape and let us get cut down like animals?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Oh, yeah, sorry about that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon_cooper My good man, dereliction of duty in the face of the enemy is a court-martial offense.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Court-martial, schmort-martial, Leslie Winkle is the fifth girl I’ve ever had sex with. I mean, for free.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 raj_koothrappali And plus, you got a rapid prototyper. That’s an expensive piece of equipment, dude.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter And the rest of us have had our budgets cut to the bone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Okay, one way to look at this is that I’m getting new equipment, and you’re not, and that’s unfair. But a better way to look at this is that I’m getting sex and you’re not, and that’s delightful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny The whole thing froze. I don’t know what happened.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Calm down. We’ll figure it out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny How can I calm down? I’m gonna lose my whole shopping cart. That’s three hours of picking out shoes just shot to hell.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Hello, Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny Hello, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon_cooper You’re in my spot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny Are you planning on sitting here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon_cooper No, I’m going to the comic book store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny Then what difference does it make?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon_cooper What difference does it make?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Here we go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon_cooper That is my spot. In an ever-changing world, it is a single point of consistency. If my life were expressed as a function on a four-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, that spot at the moment I first sat on it would be zero-zero-zero-zero.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Don’t sit in his spot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny Fine. Happy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon_cooper I’m not unhappy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny Boy, I love him, but he is one serious wackadoodle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Okay, that should do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny Oh, thank you. You are a lifesaver.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter That’s a lot of shoes you ordered.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny Yeah, you know the sad thing is, it’s really not. Ooh, is this one of those paintball guns?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Yeah. You ought to come out with us sometime.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny Oh, no, thanks. I’m from Nebraska. When we shoot things, it’s because we want to eat them or make them leave our boyfriends alone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie_winkle Boy, your heart’s racing. I must’ve really gotten you going.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Well, it’s partly you, partly my transient idiopathic arrhythmia.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie_winkle Sexy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Can I assume that you likewise found the experience…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie_winkle Satisfactory?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz That wasn’t quite the word I was looking for, but sure, I’ll do this pass-fail.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie_winkle Hey, are you enjoying that prototyper I got you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Oh, it’s great. Everybody in the Engineering Department is eating their hearts out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie_winkle Isn’t it nice when your good fortune makes others miserable?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz You know, most people don’t get that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 debbie_wolowitz Howard, I’m home!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Oh, great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 debbie_wolowitz Book club was cancelled! That thing on Phyllis’s neck opened up again!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz I’m busy, Ma!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 debbie_wolowitz Too busy to help your mother with her zipper?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Don’t come in, Ma!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 debbie_wolowitz Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie_winkle He’s got company!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Oh, there’s the arrhythmia.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 debbie_wolowitz Is she Jewish?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Are you Jewish?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie_winkle No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Yes!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 debbie_wolowitz Okay, then you kids have fun! Use protection!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny You think he’ll notice?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter There’s a chance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny Oh, what are we gonna do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter We? No, no, no, you had your chance to be we for, like, a year and a half now. Right now, you are you, and you are screwed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny Why do we have to tell him I did it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Well, we’re not gonna tell him I did it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny Okay, okay, how about this? We tell him somebody broke in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Just to shoot the couch with a paintball gun?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny I’m sorry, I buy it. All those people are on drugs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter We could tell him they wanted the couch to stay away from their boyfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny Okay, fine. Well, what if we just flip it over? There. Looks fine, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Mm, butt print. There’s no discernible butt print.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny Oh, come on. There, butt print.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter It’s too small and too perfect.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter You’re welcome.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny Shh! Act normal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon! How was the comic book store?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Fine. The new issue of Flash is out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Great, great. Did you walk the whole way? It’s a little chilly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Koothrappali picked me up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Isn’t that terrific? He is such a good friend. You know what the best thing about friends is?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon_cooper They don’t talk incessantly for no particular reason.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter No, no, friends forgive the little things.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny You know, I gotta go home and wash my hair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Don’t you dare, missy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Hello, fastest man alive. Want to see me read your entire comic book? Want to see it again? Something’s wrong.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter What do you mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon_cooper I’m not sure. It doesn’t feel right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter I don’t know what you’re talking about. Oh, that. Penny did that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Why don’t you just eat in your desk chair?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Why don’t I just eat in my desk chair?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny Here we go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon_cooper That is my desk chair, that is where I work. I don’t eat in my desk chair and I don’t work in my spot. I work in my desk chair and eat in my spot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Wackadoodle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz You know, there’s kind of an obvious solution here. Get up. There. Problem solved. Nobody cares where you’re going to sit. You’re not crazy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Excuse me, but the problem is not solved. If your head had been accidentally amputated, and we transplanted a dog’s head in its place, would that be “problem solved”?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter If it were your head, it would be.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny Sheldon, I am really, really sorry, but it’s only for a week. Can’t you be a little bit flexible? Yeah, sorry. I didn’t really think that through.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon_cooper You claim it’s going to be a week, but I have no faith in your dry cleaner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Did you notice the sign on his counter? He’s not a full-time dry cleaner. He also makes keys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Oh, for God’s sake, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Focus is important. Was Michael DeBakey a wedding planner in between heart transplants? Did Alexander Fleming moonlight as a hairdresser? “Thanks for discovering penicillin, now how about we try a bouffant?”
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Ooh, looks like I’m gonna have sex tonight. Hey, baby…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny His right hand is calling him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter No, it’s Leslie Winkle. It’s a long story.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz I’ll pick you up in ten minutes. Gentlemen, adieu.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter I thought we were going to play Halo tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz What am I supposed to do, Leonard? There’s a woman out there anxious to have sex with me. You understand, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny No. Not at all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Nevertheless, I must depart. By the way, did I tell you? Leslie pulled some strings and got me on the research trip to Geneva to check out the CERN Supercollider.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter That’s not fair. You’re not even a physicist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Okay, there are two ways of looking at this…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Get out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie_winkle You’re improving.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Thank you. It helps when I get to practice with a real woman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie_winkle Hey, listen. Saturday my sister’s getting married. I.. I want you to come with me. It’s black tie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Yeah, gee, I’d really rather not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie_winkle Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz When I go to weddings, it’s to scam on chunky bridesmaids. I don’t know what I would do with a date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie_winkle Oh, all right. I understand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie_winkle Hey, I’m really sorry about that Geneva trip.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz What about it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie_winkle Oh, didn’t you hear? I had to reduce the number of people going, and you didn’t make the cut.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz When did that happen?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie_winkle About 12 seconds ago.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Well, hold on. Are you saying if I don’t go to the wedding, I can’t go to Geneva?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie_winkle Actually, I’m trying not to say it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Okay, I’m sorry, but that makes me a little uncomfortable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie_winkle How so?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Because it’s like you’re controlling me with new equipment and research trips.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie_winkle Well, if I weren’t controlling you with new equipment and research trips, then I’d be uncomfortable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz How so?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie_winkle ‘Cause then we’d be in, like, a real relationship with feelings and all that crap.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz So, bottom line, I’m just a bought-and-paid-for sex toy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie_winkle No. No, not at all. You’re also arm candy. So? What do you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Hey, Ma, you got to rent me a tux!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 debbie_wolowitz Right now? What kind of sex are you having up there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Why are you crouching there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon_cooper This is my spot. Where else am I supposed to crouch?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter I don’t know. Texas?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny Here you go. Fresh from the cleaners, good as new.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Really? Great. Sheldon, look. Good as new.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon_cooper From that key maker, I highly doubt it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny Come on, Sheldon. Just give it a try.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon_cooper All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny There, nice and comfy cosy. Zero, zero, zero.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon_cooper There’s one more zero. You forgot the time parameter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny Sit on the damn couch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Nope.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny What do you mean, nope? What’s wrong with it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Nothing, it’s what’s wrong with him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny It’s exactly the same…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Penny, Penny, I think I know what to do. Sheldon, I have some bad news.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon_cooper More?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter I’m afraid so. You know the cashew chicken I get you Monday nights?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Yes. From Szechuan Palace.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Szechuan Palace closed two years ago.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon_cooper What? Wh-Where did my cashew chicken come from?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Golden Dragon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon_cooper No. No, this isn’t right. Our food always comes in Szechuan Palace containers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, well, before they went out of business, I bought 4,000 containers. I keep them in the trunk of my car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon_cooper But. Oh, this changes everything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter I thought that might take his mind off the cushion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon_cooper What’s real? What isn’t? How can I know?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny You did make that up, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Oh, God, I wish I had.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, buddy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon_cooper I still don’t like this cushion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Okay, first of all, Penny, thank you for coming.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny Thanks for the shoes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Penny is an amazing shot. I think we have a real chance to win this week.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz What’s the plan?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Okay. Now, we all run out. Sheldon and I will cut to the left behind these trees. Raj, Howard and Leslie flank to the right behind the rocks. Then we’ll all have a great view as Penny runs out and kills everyone else in sight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Right, just one thing before we start.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter What is it, Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny What the hell?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon_cooper That was for my cushion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, Penny was our only hope.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon_cooper I’m sorry, Leonard. But revenge is a dish best served cold.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 penny Screw that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon_cooper She can’t shoot me. She’s dead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter He’s right. You can’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Well, if we’re going to descend into anarchy
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Okay, see you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Where are you going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode16 leslie_winkle Surrender, then Denny’s.
