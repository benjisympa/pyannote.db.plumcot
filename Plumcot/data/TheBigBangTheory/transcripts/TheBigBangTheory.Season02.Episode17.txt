TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Okay, Raj, hand me the number six torque screwdriver.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Stop. We can’t do this, it’s not right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Sheldon, you have two choices. Either you let him put a bigger hard drive in the TiVo, or you delete stuff before we go out of town.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper But once you open the box, you’ve voided the warranty. The warranty is a sacred covenant we’ve entered into with the manufacturer. He offers to stand by his equipment, and we in return agree not to violate the integrity of the internal hardware. This little orange sticker is all that stands between us and anarchy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Okay, then we won’t touch the hard drive. We’ll just erase the first season of Battlestar.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper There. We’re outlaws.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 penny Here you go, Leonard. Is this going to be big enough?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter It’s perfect.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 howard_wolowitz For taking daffodils to your unicorn.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter It’s just for my notebooks. Thanks, Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 penny Oh, I love San Francisco. I wish I was going with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper I understand your envy. This is a can’t-miss symposium. There are going to be discussions on bioorganic cellular computer devices, the advancements in multi-threaded task completion, plus a roundtable on the nonequilibrium Green’s function approach to the photoionization process in atoms.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 penny When I go, I usually just get hammered and ride the cable cars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter This conference is kind of a big thing. The keynote address is being delivered by George Smoot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 penny Oh, my God, the George Smoot?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter You’ve heard of him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 penny Of course I haven’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper George Smoot is a Nobel Prize-winning physicist, one of the great minds of our time. His work in black body form and anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation cemented our understanding of the origin of the universe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 penny It’s kind of a funny name, though, Smoot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper It’s like talking to a chimp.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 penny Okay, now that I’ve been completely insulted, have a good flight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I wish.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper We’re not flying, we’re taking the train.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 penny Oh, cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Yeah, cool. Seven times as long as flying, and costs almost twice as much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 penny Well, then why are you doing it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Well, we had a vote. Three of us voted for airplane, Sheldon voted for train, so we’re taking the train.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Hey, we’re all going over to the Apple store to make fun of the guys at the Genius Bar. You want to come?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Oh, I always enjoy that, but I’m a little busy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper I’m simplifying the task of packing for our trip. See, by attaching RFID tags to my clothing, it will enable my laptop to read and identify the items with this wand. I will then cross-reference them against destination, anticipated activity spectrum, weather conditions, duration of trip, et cetera.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Well, that does sound much simpler. How long is this going to take?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Assuming I can keep up this pace, three hours, 11 minutes, and plus however long it takes to conclude this fairly pointless conversation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Wow. Teasing the guys at the Apple store seems a little redundant now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper I don’t follow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter I wouldn’t expect you to. I’ll see you later.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Socks, one pair, cotton, argyle, blue. Socks, one pair, cotton, argyle, blue.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper What on earth are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Whatever it is, I’m guessing we’re doing it wrong.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Gentlemen, this is the Coast Starlight, one of the great American trains operating on one of the classic American routes. On this side, you’ll see panoramic ocean vistas inaccessible to any other form of transportation, while on your side, you’ll be treated to 350 miles of CostCos, Jiffy Lubes, and cinderblock homes with above-ground pools.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Come on, Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 raj_koothrappali What’s wrong with Jiffy Lubes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper That’s over the wheelbase. Are you completely unfamiliar with the suspension characteristics of a pre-1980 Pullman-built Superliner Deluxe passenger coach?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, we’ve been on this train 90 seconds, and you’ve already said a thousand words. Just tell us where to sit and shut up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Here. I’m hoping once you reap the endorphic rewards of the steady clickety-clack of steel wheels on polished rails, your sour disposition will abate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, maybe. Meanwhile back in the 21st century, people are raising their tray tables and putting their seat-backs in an upright position ’cause it’s time to land in San Francisco.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 raj_koothrappali It’s not so bad, really. At least these trains have modern plumbing. In India, you squat over a hole in the train and expose your naked buttocks to the chilly air of Rajasthan.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper He is referring, of course, to third class on Indian Railways’ magnificent Ranakpur Express and its twelve hundred kilometer journey from Maharashtra to the Bikaner Junction.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Oh, look, now he’s boring on an international scale.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Holy crap! Look!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Is that who I think it is?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 howard_wolowitz It can’t be. What would Summer Glau be doing riding the train?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Maybe John Connor’s aboard and she’s protecting him from an evil Terminator.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Unlikely. That’s a television show, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Of course, if SkyNet actually did exist in the future, a perfect way to infiltrate and destroy mankind would be to send Terminators back posing as actors who have played Terminators in popular films and television series, lulling us into a false sense of security, i.e., that’s Summer Glau from The Sarah Connor Chronicles. No, Summer, don’t kill me! I’m pro-robot! Ahh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter At least he’s off the train crap.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Whee!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Sheldon, I owe you an apology. Taking the train was a stroke of brilliance! I’ve actually got a shot at a Terminator.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Oh, please.When it comes to Terminators, you’ve got a better shot of scoring with Arnold Schwarzenegger.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 howard_wolowitz You’re overlooking something. I have 11 hours with her in a confined space. Unless she’s willing to jump off a moving train, tuck and roll down the side of a hill, she will eventually succumb to the acquired taste that is Howard Wolowitz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter My money’s on tuck and roll.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper I’m confused. I thought you were involved in some sort of socially intimate pairing with Leslie Winkle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Sheldon, let me explain to you how this works.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 howard_wolowitz That’s Summer Glau.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 howard_wolowitz That’s it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Hang on a sec. Why do you get first crack at her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Um, well, let’s see, couple reasons. One, I saw her first.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 raj_koothrappali No, you didn’t. I did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Fair enough. But then let me move on to number two, unlike you, I can actually talk to women when I’m sober.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 raj_koothrappali You fail to take into account that even mute, I am foreign and exotic, while you, on the other hand, are frail and pasty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Well, you know the old saying, pasty and frail never fail.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Excuse me, but what about me? Why don’t I get a shot?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Fine, go ahead. Take a shot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter You know, I’ve already got a gorgeous blonde back home at I can’t score with. I think I’ll let you two take this one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Sheldon, is there a place on this train to get alcohol?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Interesting that you ask. The Coast Starlight recently added the refurbished Pacific Parlour Car. Built in 1956 and originally known as the Santa Fe Lounge Car, the lower level is a theatre…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Yeah-yeah, which way?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper and the upper level is a bar that offers wine tastings if you’re going as far as Portland.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter So aren’t you going to go talk to her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 howard_wolowitz I will, I’m just working on my opening line.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter She’s probably heard every possible line, Howard. Why don’t you just try hello?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 howard_wolowitz No, no, no, that always creeps girls out. I need to come up with something that’s funny, smart and delicately suggests that my sexual endowment is disproportionate to my physical stature.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter You’re going to need more than 11 hours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Oh, no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter What’s the matter?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper I forgot my flash drive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter So?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper So we have to go back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Okay, Sheldon, I’m going to say why and your answer cannot be because I forgot my flash drive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper You don’t understand. My flash drive has my paper on astrophysical probes of M-theory effects in the early universe that I was going to give to George Smoot at the conference.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Why do you have to give your paper to George Smoot?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper It’s brilliant. He needs to read it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter So you’ll send him an e-mail when we get back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Then I won’t get to see his face light up as he reads it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Right. Of course.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Oh, this is an unmitigated disaster.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Well, there’s nothing you can do about it, so relax, sit back, enjoy the clickety-clack of the steel wheels on the polished rails.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper You forgot your flash drive, You forgot your flash drive
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Only ten hours, 55 minutes to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 howard_wolowitz It’s hot in here. Must be Summer. So, where you gals headed?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Okay, I’ve found the perfect solution. We get off the train at the next stop in Oxnard. We then take the 1:13 train back to Union Station. We take a cab back to the apartment, get my flash drive, and then race to San Luis Obispo, where, assuming the lights are with us and minimal traffic, we’ll meet the train.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter I’ve got a better idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Are you going to be sarcastic?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Boy, you take all the fun out of it for me.But look, Penny’s home. Why don’t we just call her, have her go in the apartment, get your flash drive and e-mail you the paper?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper But the flash drive is in a locked drawer in my desk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter So?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper The key is hidden in my room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter So?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Penny would have to go into my room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter So?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper People don’t go in my room!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter I see. Well, it seems once again, you’re caught between a rock and a crazy place.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Oh, I hate when that happens.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 howard_wolowitz It’s hot in here. It must be Summer. It’s hot in here. Must be Summer. It’s hot in here. Must be Summer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 raj_koothrappali It’s hot in here. Must be Summer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 summer_glau That’s cute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Really? I just made it up. Have you seen Slumdog Millionaire?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 summer_glau Oh, yeah, I loved it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 raj_koothrappali It’s loosely based on my life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 penny Yeah, we’re putting the play on for one night in this little 99-seat theatre. Can you come? Oh, great. Do you know 98 other people that might want to come? Oh, hang on. Hello?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Listen carefully. I’m about to give you a set of instructions, which you must follow to the letter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 penny Just a sec. The theatre is above a bowling alley, so it’s a little noisy, but it might be the only chance I’ll ever get to play Anne Frank. And the director is brilliant. He uses the bowling sounds as, like, Nazi artillery. Okay, great, I’ll see you then. Hello?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Okay, step four. Do you see that small plastic case on my dresser?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 penny Your dresser? Who is this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper It’s Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 penny Oh, hey, Sheldon! How is San Francisco?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper I’m not in San Francisco. I’m on a train. Were you even listening to me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 penny Uh, no, I was talking to my friend, but what’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper What’s up? I’ll tell you what’s up. I’m in a crisis situation, and I need you to marshal your powers of concentration, limited as they may be…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Give me the phone. Hi, Penny. It’s Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 penny Hey, Leonard. What’s going on with Dr. Wackadoodle?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter He’s calling to ask you a favour. You might be confused because he didn’t use the words, Penny, Sheldon, please or favour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Okay. Enough chitchat. Okay, step one, locate your emergency key to our apartment. Step two, enter our apartment. Step three, enter my bedroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 penny Oh, hang on, Sheldon, getting another call.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper No! Leonard, let me tell you something. Personal robots cannot get here soon enough.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 raj_koothrappali And that bright little star peeking her head out early today, that’s Venus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 summer_glau That is so cool. You really know a lot about space.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Come on. When you were on TV in Firefly, you were actually in space.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 summer_glau You’re not one of those guys who really believe that, are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 raj_koothrappali You mean one of the hopeless geeks? No. Those are crazy people. Howard, be a dear and get me another one of these. Now, him, he’s one of those geeks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper All right, now, before you enter my bedroom unescorted, I need you to understand that this onetime grant of access does not create a permanent easement. Easement. It’s a legal right
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Do you believe him? Normally around women, he has the personality of a boiled potato. Put one beer in him, and he’s M. Night Charmalarmalon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Is that what he’s drinking? It’s not even real beer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 howard_wolowitz What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Look at it. Non-alcoholic beer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 howard_wolowitz What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter I don’t know. Some sort of placebo effect, I guess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Placebo, you say. Interesting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Yes, I’m still here. Where am I going? I’m on a train. Now, what you’ll be looking for is a small wooden box located between a Hoberman’s sphere and a sample of quartz flecked with pyrite. Hoberman’s Sphere. It’s a collapsible icosidodecahedron. No, the thing with the time on it is my alarm clock.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Actually, in India, the names of constellations are different. Where you have the Big Dipper, we have the Big Curry Pot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 summer_glau You’re making that up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 raj_koothrappali You got me. Now what are you going to do with me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Yes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Look.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 raj_koothrappali What am I looking at?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 howard_wolowitz You tell me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Non-alcoholic bee-ee-eeuh
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Hi, I’m the small package good things come in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 penny Okay, I got a box, but there’s no key in here. Just letters.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper That’s the wrong box. Put it back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 penny Oh, Sheldon, are these letters from your grandmother?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Don’t read those letters!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 penny Oh, look, she calls you Moon Pie. That is so cute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Put down the letters!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Hey, Penny. It’s Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 penny Hey, Leonard. How’s the train ride?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Delightful. Listen, I don’t know what you’re doing right now, but there are little bubbles forming on the corners of Sheldon’s mouth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 penny Okay, yeah, I kind of crossed a line. Put him back on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper I’m back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 penny What up, Moon Pie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Nobody calls me Moon Pie but Meemaw!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Hey, Penny. Leonard again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 howard_wolowitz So anyway, in the dream, you and I were ice skating, just the two of us. And then, I picked you up by your ankles and twirled you round and round until your legs tore off. I tried to stick them back on, but before I could, you turned into a giant loaf of pumpernickel bread. What do you think that means?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 summer_glau I really don’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 howard_wolowitz I’ll give you a little clue. My favourite sandwich? Salami on pumpernickel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 summer_glau Is that so?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 howard_wolowitz And did you know the word “pumpernickel” comes from the German words pumper and nickel, which loosely translates to fart goblin?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 summer_glau No. I didn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 penny Okay, I found the box. Now what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper You’re holding a Japanese puzzle box, which takes ten precise moves to open. First, locate the panel with the diamond pattern and slide the centre portion one millimetre to the left. Then, on the opposite end of the box, slide the entire panel down two millimetres. You’ll hear a slight click.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 penny Hang on. Sheldon, do you have any emotional attachment to this box?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper No, it’s a novelty I ordered off the Internet. Now, did you hear the click?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 penny Not yet. There it is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Okay, here’s another one. If you married the famous rock guitarist Johnny Winter, you’d be Summer Winter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 summer_glau Uh-huh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Okay, I’m going to just go for broke here and say I like you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 summer_glau Yeah?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 howard_wolowitz So here’s my question, do you realistically see any conversational path that would take me from where we are right now to a place where I could ask you out and you’d say yes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 summer_glau No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Fair enough. I’ll leave you in peace.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 summer_glau Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 howard_wolowitz But before I go, would you mind if I just take one picture of us together for my Facebook page?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 summer_glau Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Okay. Great. Now, can I take one where it looks like we’re making out?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Okay, now you’re going to insert the flash drive into the USB port. She calls me Moon Pie because I’m nummy-nummy and she could just eat me up, now, please put the flash drive in the USB port. The one that looks like a little duck’s mouth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Hey, how’d it go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Terminator broke my phone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Excuse me. Okay, I’ll be honest with you. I’ve just spent the last two hours imagining various scenarios in my head, trying to come up with some clever line to say to you. But then I finally realized you’re a human being; I’m a human being. I could just say to you…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 summer_glau I’m sorry. This is me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Hi, my name’s Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper So, I’m thinking, you won the Nobel Prize what, three years ago? So you must deal with a whole lot of what has Smoot done lately? My thought is we continue my research as a team, you know, Cooper-Smoot, alphabetical, and when we win the Nobel Prize, you’ll be back on top.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 dr_george_smoot With all due respect, Dr. Cooper, are you on crack?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Fine! Smoot-Cooper. Wow, what a diva.
