TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 raj_koothrappali Knight to queen’s bishop-five.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 howard_wolowitz Oh, very nice. What’s Leonard going to do? Does he give up the pawn or does he give up the position?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 raj_koothrappali Let’s find out. Leonard, ready?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Ready.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 raj_koothrappali Go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Damn it. I slipped.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 howard_wolowitz Too bad. You know the rules of Secret Agent Laser Obstacle Chess. Uh, Leonard died again, Sheldon. You’re up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Despite my deep love of chess, lasers and aerosol disinfectant, I must forfeit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper – Because it’s almost eleven o’clock.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter So?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper So, Penny has a don’t knock on my door before eleven o’clock or I punch you in the throat rule.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 all@ Ah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 howard_wolowitz Hey, you know what’d be a great idea? We get some girls over here and play Laser Obstacle Strip Chess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Believe me, Howard, any girl who would be willing to play that, you don’t want to see naked.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 howard_wolowitz You underestimate me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Penny, Penny, Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny Hey, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper It’s eleven am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny I know. You’re safe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper This package came while you were at work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny Oh, great, my rhinestones. Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Excuse me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper You have to sign this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny What is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper When I signed for the package, I was deputized by the United Parcel Service and entrusted with its final delivery. I now need you to acknowledge receipt of the package so that I’m fully indemnified and no longer liable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny Sheldon, it’s just a box of rhinestones.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Well, the contents are irrelevant. A legal bailment has been created. Does that mean nothing to you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny It means nothing to anybody. Come here, let me show you what I’m doing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Bailment describes a relationship in common law where a physical possession of personal property, or chattels, is transferred from one person, the bailor, to another person, the bailee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Look, look, look! I started a business.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Obviously, not a cleaning business.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny No, I’m making flower barrettes. See? I call them Penny Blossoms. I made one for myself, then all the girls at work wanted one. Then I showed some to this lady who runs a shop in Old Town. She sells cards and homemade jewellery. She said she wanted to sell them. I said okay, and in one week, I made a $156.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Good for you. Sign here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny Sheldon, don’t you get it? If this takes off, I won’t have to be a waitress anymore.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper But then who will bring me my cheeseburger on Tuesday nights?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny Another waitress.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper What’s her name?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny I don’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper And you’re going to let her handle my food?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny Nancy. Her name is Nancy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper I think you’re just making that up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny Sheldon, I’m sorry about your hamburger, okay? I just don’t want to be a waitress for the rest of my life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Cheeseburger. I get a cheeseburger.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny Fine, cheeseburger.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Maybe I’d be better off with Nancy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny So, what do you think? I mean, this could be a business, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper How many of these can you make a day?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny About twenty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper And how much profit do you make per Penny Blossom?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny I don’t know, like, 50 cents. I’m not sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper No, Of course you’re not. All right, ten dollars a day times five days a week times 52 weeks a year is two thousand six hundred dollars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny That’s all?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Before taxes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny Well, I don’t have to pay taxes on this stuff.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper I believe the Internal Revenue Service would strongly disagree. But, if you took advantage of modern marketing techniques, and you optimized your manufacturing process, you might be able to make this a viable business.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny And you know about that stuff?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Penny, I’m a physicist. I have a working knowledge of the entire universe and everything it contains.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny Who’s Radiohead?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper I have a working knowledge of the important things in the universe. Good luck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny Sheldon, hold on. Could you maybe show me how to make more money with this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Of course I could.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny Sheldon, wait! Will you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Just to be clear here, you’re asking for my assistance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper And you understand that will involve me telling you what to do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny I understand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper And you’re not allowed to be sarcastic or snide to me while I’m doing so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Good. Let’s begin with the premise that everything you’ve done up to this point is wrong.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny Oh, imagine that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Sarcasm. Good-bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny No, sorry. Wait! Please come back!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny There. Done.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper All right. 12 minutes and 17 seconds.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny Pretty good, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper That’s 4.9 Penny Blossoms per hour. Based on your cost of materials and your wholesale selling price, you’ll effectively be paying yourself… $5.19 a day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny A day?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper There are children in a sneaker factory in Indonesia who outearn you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny That just can’t be right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper You’re questioning my math?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny No, sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Want me to show my work?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny Oh, God, no, no. Just please tell me what to do about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper All right, are you familiar with the development that resulted from Honoré Blanc’s 1778 use of interchangeable parts? The assembly line, of course.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny Okay, you know what, if I’m not allowed to be snide, you’re not allowed to be condescending.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper That wasn’t a part of our original agreement, and I do not agree to it now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny All right, fine. How are we supposed to set up machines and conveyor belts in my apartment?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper You’re thinking of the moving assembly line, an understandable but not excusable mistake. No. The moving assembly line, that was introduced by Henry Ford in 1908. That innovation is what made possible our modern consumer culture by enabling a low-unit cost for manufactured goods. I guess that isn’t one of the topics discussed on your Radiohead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Let’s go. We’re going to miss the coming attractions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 raj_koothrappali What’s the matter?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 howard_wolowitz I think I bruised a testicle capturing that last pawn.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Hello?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny@sheldon_cooper Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter W-W-Wait, what’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper I assume you’re referring to the sea shanty. It’s a rhythmic work song designed to increase productivity.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny Yeah, it’s crazy, but it totally works. Look, we made this Penny Blossom in under three minutes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Terrific, but that kind of raises more questions than it answers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Penny’s making hair accessories. I’m helping her optimize her manufacturing process. All right, break’s over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 howard_wolowitz Hold on. What are you using as a bonding agent?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Hot glue.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 howard_wolowitz You’re kidding. Any of the cyanoacrylates would do a better job.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper It won’t work, the flower’s too porous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter What if we infused the bottom layer with silicone-RTV to provide a better mounting surface?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Intriguing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 howard_wolowitz Good question, what are you marketing and distribution channels?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny Well, there are the waitresses at my work, and this cute, little shop in Old Town.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Hush, hush, hush, hush, hush, virtually non-existent. I’m thinking that we set her up with a hosted turnkey e-commerce system to start.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 howard_wolowitz Why not eliminate the middle man? We could install a small server farm with a static IP in her bedroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter She’d need some kind of industrial cooling system.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Of course, but before we set up a marketing and distribution infrastructure, we should finish optimizing the manufacturing process. To start with, she has a terrible problem with moisture-induced glitter clump.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny Yeah, it’s a bitch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 howard_wolowitz Uh, I’ve seen this before.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Where?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 howard_wolowitz It’s a common stripper problem. They dance, they sweat, they clump.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny Ew.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Are you thinking about adding a desiccant like calcium sulphate?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 howard_wolowitz Actually, I’m thinking about this one stripper named Vega. But sure, calcium sulphate could work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Let’s think out of the box for a moment. How about a molecular sieve?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 howard_wolowitz@leonard_hofstadter Oh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny I’ve got a spaghetti strainer in the kitchen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Wow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Hey, we could liberate some micro-porous charcoal from the chem lab.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Oh, great. Raj, why don’t you and Howard go get the charcoal? Leonard, why don’t you start working on some preliminary Web site designs. I’ll make some space in our apartment so we can move the manufacturing process.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny Well, what’s wrong with my apartment?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper It’s not my apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny Wait, wait, what am I going to do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Uh, hey, it’s your business. Do whatever you want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny Oh, okay, cool. I’m going to take a nap.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter I’m still tweaking things a little bit, but this will give you the general idea of the Web site. So, what do you guys think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 howard_wolowitz Uh, pretty much any way I say that is going to hurt his feelings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Okay, what’s wrong with it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper – What’s wrong with it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Not you. I wasn’t asking you. Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny Uh, well, it’s a little juvenile. I mean, it kind of looks like the MySpace page of a 13-year-old girl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter No, it doesn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 howard_wolowitz Please. Dateline could use it to attract predators.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Penny, this is your enterprise, so it’s ultimately your decision, but based on the quality of his work, I’d strongly recommend that we let Leonard go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter You want to fire me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper What I want is irrelevant. This is Penny’s decision. Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Excuse me, but if I did such a bad job then why do we already have orders?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny We do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Uh-huh. Look. Mrs. Fiona Fondell from Huntsville, Alabama has ordered two.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny No kidding. Two?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Uh-huh. Look at the comments.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny Thank you, Penny Blossoms. These will be perfect to cover my bald spot. Aww, that is so sweet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Camouflaging bald spots. That’s primarily a male concern. Perhaps we could expand our market.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny How are flower barrettes going to appeal to men?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 howard_wolowitz We add Bluetooth!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Brilliant. Men love Bluetooth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny Wait a minute, wait a minute, you want to make a hair barrette with Bluetooth?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Penny, everything is better with Bluetooth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Holy crap. Someone just ordered a thousand Penny Blossoms.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny Get out! Who needs a thousand sparkly flower barrettes with rhinestones?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter The Fifth Annual East Rutherford, New Jersey, Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Alliance Luau.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Oh, another market to expand into, balding gay men.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 howard_wolowitz And I’ll bet lesbians love Bluetooth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper We should get to work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny Wait, wait, wait, why does it say one-day rush? Since when do we offer a one-day rush?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Amazon offers one-day rush.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny Yeah, but they don’t have to glue the books together. How the hell are we going to make a thousand Penny Blossoms in one day?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Don’t yell at me. I’m not manufacturing. I’m just Web design.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny Okay, well, I’m gonna have to call them and cancel the order.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Excuse me, but was this not your goal? Financial independence through entrepreneurial brilliance and innovation? My brilliance and innovation, of course, but still.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny I just don’t see how see can pull this off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Okay, that, right there, that equivocation and self-doubt, that is not the American spirit. Did Davy Crockett quit at the Alamo? Did Jim Bowie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 howard_wolowitz They didn’t quit. They were massacred by, like, a gazillion angry Mexicans.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Alright, let me put it this way. Your gross receipts on this one order will be over $3,000 for one night’s work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny You guys get started.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny Going online to buy shoes!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 raj_koothrappali You know, if I wanted to spend my Saturday nights doing this, I could have stayed in India.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 howard_wolowitz Oh, stop with the fake third world crap. Your father’s a gynaecologist, and you had a house full of servants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 raj_koothrappali We only had four servants. And two of them were children.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter How are we doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 raj_koothrappali We have 128 assorted Penny Blossoms ready to ship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 howard_wolowitz Oh, God, we’re never gonna finish in time. Who made Sheldon the boss anyway?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper I believe I’m hearing some negativity on the factory floor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny So?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Penny, the labour force is a living organism that must be carefully nurtured. Any counterproductive grumbling must be skilfully headed off by management. Observe. Hey! Less talk, more work!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny Nicely done.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Thank you. You hear any union talk, you let me know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Someone’s in the kitchen with Dinah…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 howard_wolowitz Someone’s in the kitchen I know-ow-ow-ow
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny Someone’s in the kitchen with Dinah… Sheldon? Sheldon!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper ‘Cause I sold my soul to the company store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny Honey, do you want some coffee?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper No, I don’t drink coffee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny Come on, but if you don’t stay awake we’ll never finish in time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper I’m sorry, coffee’s out of the question. When I moved to California, I promised my mother that I wouldn’t start doing drugs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny Leonard, help.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, we still have 380 of these things to make.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper I have complete faith that you will make them. Good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, no. But, Sheldon, without your insight and leadership this entire enterprise will surely fail.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper You’re right, of course.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny Here, this will help.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Very well, but if this leads to opiates or hallucinogenics, you’re going to have to answer to my mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Look at Planck’s Constant. People say it’s arbitrary. It could not be less arbitrary. If it varied even slightly, life as we know it would not exist. Bam! Now, now, let’s reconsider the entire argument, but with entropy reversed and effect preceding cause, so you are thinking of a universe that’s not expanding from the centre, no, it is retreating from a, from a possibility space. Bam! This is a space where we are all essentially Alice through the looking glass, standing in front the Red Queen, and we’re being offered a cracker to quench our thirst. Bam! Of course, in another universe, let’s call it universe prime, there’s another Sheldon, let’s call him Sheldon prime…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny We should have let him go to bed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Bam.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter I can’t believe we actually did it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 howard_wolowitz 1,000 friggin’ Penny Blossoms.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny I just want you guys to know I am really grateful for your help, and for every dollar I make, I’m going to give you 20 cents.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 howard_wolowitz That’s your entire profit margin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny Oh. Then never mind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter I’ll print out the shipping label. Uh-oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter We got an e-mail from the East Rutherford, New Jersey, Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Alliance. They want another thousand Penny Blossoms.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter One-day rush. I really need to take that off the Web site.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny Okay, well. Guess we’d better get started.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 howard_wolowitz You can’t be serious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny Come on. What about the living organism of the workforce and the American spirit and Jiminy Crockett at the Alamo?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Davy Crockett. Jiminy Crockett was a cricket.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny Yes, yes, I know that, okay? I’m tired, I’ve had like 18 cups of coffee. The point is, if we all just pull together, we can do this. Who’s with me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 howard_wolowitz Penny, although you may find it hard to believe, we do have lives.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Sorry. My apologies to the gay community of East Rutherford, New Jersey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Zoom, zoom, zoom! Where’s the coffee?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 penny We’re all out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 sheldon_cooper No problem. I’ll be back before this banana hits the ground. Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom! Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 raj_koothrappali Yes!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode18 howard_wolowitz Sorry, guys, but Secret Agent Laser Obstacle Lunch is just stupid.
