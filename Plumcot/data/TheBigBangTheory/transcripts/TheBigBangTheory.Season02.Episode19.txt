TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Okay, it’s done. Look, guys, for the future, I don’t mind killing the big spiders, but you have to at least try with the little ones.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Penny, please, we’re facing a far more serious problem than stray arachnids.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, it’s not that bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Not bad? It’s horrible. I mean, you hear stories about this sort of thing, but you never think it’ll happen to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter So they steamed your dumplings, get over it. New topic, please.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 howard_wolowitz All right, Penny, let me take this opportunity to point out that you are looking particularly ravishing today.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Not with a thousand condoms, Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 howard_wolowitz So, there is a number.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Okay, new topic, please. Hey, did you hear the people upstairs in 5A are moving out?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Shh-shh-shh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny The people upstairs are moving out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter No!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper The horror!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Why would you just say something like that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper No, no, no, no, no, no, no…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny How else was I supposed to say it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Slowly, like putting a new fish in a tank. You don’t just drop it in, you let the bag sit in the water a while.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper The horror!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Sheldon, I’m sure it’s going to be fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper No, it’s not going to be fine, change is never fine. They say it is, but it’s not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Okay, honey, did you even know the people that are moving out?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper I never met them. That’s what made them perfect, there were no awkward hellos in the halls, there was no clickety-clacking of high heel shoes on hardwood floors, they may as well have been a family of cats just jumping around from drape to drape without that annoying ammonia urine smell.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Well, I’m sure the new people will be just as quiet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper You can’t know that. How can you possibly know that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny You’re right, I can’t. You know what? Anyone could rent that apartment now, an opera singer, the cast of stomp, yeah, a tap-dancing pirate with a wooden leg.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Why are you making it worse?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny I tried making it better, he wouldn’t go for it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 howard_wolowitz You’re right, that’s a great idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 howard_wolowitz I’ll take the apartment upstairs. I can finally get away from my mother, and we can all spend some more time together, if you catch my drift.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny The horror!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Hold on. You honestly expect me to believe that social protocol dictates we break our backs helping Wolowitz move, and then he only need buy us a pizza?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter I’m sorry, that really is how it works.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper You’re tricking me. You tell me the truth, what do we get?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Raj, help me out here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 raj_koothrappali You get to choose between a mountain bike or a PS3.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Enough with the guilt, ma, we’ll still see each other. I’ll come over every night and have dinner with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 debbie_wolowitz The hell you will! What am I running here, a fancy restaurant? Does this look like Olive Garden?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Okay, I get it, you’re angry. You don’t want to see your little bird leave the nest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 debbie_wolowitz Little bird? You’re almost 30, fly, for god’s sake!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Fine, I’ll stay! You happy, crazy lady? I sure as hell hope so, because you’re ruining my life!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Hey, Penny, it’s Leonard. Good news, you can take your head out of the oven.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper I guess I won’t be needing this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Oh, no, the new ones, they’re here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Stay calm, we don’t know anything about them yet. What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper I’m checking for musical instruments. Does that sound like castanets to you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter The box says kitchen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper So? Do cocaine smugglers write cocaine on the box?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 blonde_girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 Hello?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 blonde_girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 blonde_girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 I’m Alicia. I’m moving in upstairs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter That is so great. Oh, I’m Leonard, I live downstairs. Upstairs from here, but under you. Not under you per se, but under your apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 alicia That’s nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, it is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper If that concludes your faltering attempt to mate, hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 alicia Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Hello. On a scale of one to ten how light of foot would you describe yourself with one being not cat-like at all and ten being freakishly feline?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 alicia Freakishly feline?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Is that your answer or do you not understand the question? We’ll come back to that one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Hang on. Are you now or have you ever been a salsa, Irish folk or break-dancer?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 alicia No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter You’re making her uncomfortable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Oh, I’m sorry. Well, if it helps you feel any better you’re doing very well so far. Next question, are you fertile?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 alicia What?!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper I’m trying to determine whether crying infants above my head are a possibility.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 alicia I have no immediate plans.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper If that changes, let me know. And finally, area rugs, pro or con?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 alicia Pro?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Alicia?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 alicia Yes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Welcome to the building.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to help.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Oh, hey, guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Hey, Penny. this is Alicia, our new neighbour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 alicia Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter I’m helping.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny I can see.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Alicia’s non-musical, childless and pro-rug. She’s still on probation, of course, but I like her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 alicia Cool t-shirt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Oh, yeah, I don’t usually dress like this. I’m going jogging.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper You don’t jog.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny I can start.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper True, but the more likely explanation for your attire is that you’re out of clean clothes again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Thank you, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper You’re welcome, Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 alicia Please, you look cute. I’m dressed like a slob today, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter I think you look fantastic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 alicia This one’s a player, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Oh, yeah, be careful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 alicia Thanks for the warning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 alicia I’ll see you around.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny See ya. I’m dressed like a slob today, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Oh, mimicry. I enjoy mimicry. I’ve been working on Admiral Ackbar from Return of the Jedi. “It’s a trap.” You have to imagine me with a giant squid head. “It’s a trap. It’s a trap. It’s a trap.”
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Come.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Congratulations, I see you did your laundry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Well, sort of.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper How does one sort of…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny I bought new clothes, okay? Is Leonard around?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper He’s upstairs at Alicia’s.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Oh. all right, that’s cool, no biggie. He said he’d help me set up my printer, but I guess I can wait. What exactly is he doing up there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper In what I can only perceive as a tactical move to destroy me, he is with Wolowitz and Koothrappali setting up her stereo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Oh, they’re all up there, huh? Hmm, typical.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper It’s axiomatically atypical. Up until recently, they did not know Alicia, and had no encounters with her in a previous location. They never went upstairs to visit the former tenants, so your characterization of their behaviour as typical Is demonstrably fallacious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Okay, now I see the giant squid head.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Oh, great! now, I have to start all over again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Yeah, I thought about renting this apartment, but I’m really more of a downtown loft kind of guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 alicia Cool. so are you in a loft now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Oh, actually I’m, uh, living with a woman in Altadena. Purely platonic, she’s also my maid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 alicia Sounds like a sweet deal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 howard_wolowitz I won’t lie, it’s pretty dope.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Hello?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 alicia Oh, hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Hey, I just wanted to bring you a little housewarming gift.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 alicia That is so sweet. Come on in, let’s open it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 alicia Nice dress.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Oh, this? I’m dressed like a slob today.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 alicia The guys have been helping me set up my sound system. I’ve never had such good-looking technical support.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Oh, pish-posh. I don’t know, it means shucks. Shucks means shucks. Let one go once in a while.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Hey, uh, penny, you want to hear something awesome?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Alicia is an actress, just like you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny That is so awesome.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 alicia Well, trying to be, but it’s so hard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Yeah, I know, tell me about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 alicia I’ve been out here three months, and all I’ve gotten is a couple of national commercials and this recurring thing on a soap.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny That’s why I work at the Cheesecake Factory, I’m holding out for the right part.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Alicia, what do you want as your default setting for DVDs, 5.1 Dolby or DTS?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 alicia Whatever you think is best, cutie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Well, DTS has more low end, so… okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Uh, hey, guys, guys, you will really appreciate this, I read the best science joke on the internet. Alicia, you won’t get it, but it’s right up their alley. Anyway, so, this physicist goes into an ice cream parlour every week and orders an ice cream sundae for himself, and then offers one to the empty stool sitting next to him. This goes on for a while until the owner finally asks him what he’s doing. The man says, “well, I’m a physicist, and quantum mechanics teaches us that it is possible for the matter above this stool to spontaneously turn into a beautiful woman who might accept my offer and fall in love with me.” The owner then says, “well, lots of single, beautiful women come in here every day, why don’t you buy an ice cream for one of them, and they might fall in love with you?” And the physicist says, “yeah, but what are the odds of that happening?”
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter It’s a little insulting, don’t you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny How would I know? I’m not even sure I get it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 alicia Hey, Leonard? If you’re done with the DVD player, can you set up my printer?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Uh, yeah, I’d love to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Uh, hey, maybe when you’re done with her printer, you could set up mine. You know, like you promised a week ago.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I’ll get to it, don’t nag me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 raj_koothrappali Hello there
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Who is it? Oh hello, Penny, it’s open, come in. Sarcasm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Well, they’re all still up there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper You think I can’t hear them? Listen to that. Stomp, stomp, stomp. That’s Wolowitz in his stacked heels that fool no one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny I don’t even know why I care. I don’t care. All right, I cared enough to memorize that stupid joke, but that’s all I care.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper You know, Penny, there’s something that occurs in beehives you might find interesting. Occasionally, a new queen will arrive while the old queen is still in power. When this happens, the old queen must either locate to a new hive or engage in a battle to the death until only one queen remains.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny What are you saying, that I’m threatened by Alicia? That I’m like the old queen of the hive and it’s just time for me to go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper I’m just talking about bees. They’re on the discovery channel. What are you talking about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Bees. Aaah! I just got that physicist joke.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Gee, Penny, thanks for buying us dinner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Yeah, what’s the occasion?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny No, no occasion, just felt like getting some Chinese chow for my peeps.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced, not shredded?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Even though the menu description specifies shredded?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Brown rice, not white?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper You stop at the Korean grocery and get the good hot mustard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Did you pick up the low-sodium soy sauce from the market?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Yes
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Good. See how it’s done, Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny So, what do we got going on tonight, huh? Playing Halo watching Battlestar, drop some mentos in diet coke?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter You want to watch Battlestar?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny What can I say? I got my geek on, boys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 howard_wolowitz No, no, PMS is different.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 alicia Oh, thank God you’re home. I need help.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter What’s wrong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 alicia I just got a callback to audition for CSI to play a hooker who gets killed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Oh, I’d watch that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 alicia But my car is in the shop, and I have to be at Universal in forty-five minutes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Okay, well, I’ll take you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 alicia Oh, you’re a lifesaver.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 howard_wolowitz I’ll run lines with you in the car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 alicia Great. And afterward, I’ll take you all out for Chinese.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Oh, actually, that’s okay. we already have…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Yum. Starving.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny …chinese food right here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper They’re gone, Penny. They can’t hear you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny I cannot believe they’re letting her just use them like that. I mean, anything she wants, they go panting after her like trained dogs. You know that just last week, she had Howard drive all the way to her uncle’s house in Orange County to pick up her TV?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper You once had Leonard and me get your television from your ex-boyfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Apples and oranges here, Sheldon. I’m telling you, that girl is a user, iceskating through the life on her looks, taking advantage of innocent weak-willed men, getting auditions for stupid network shows. It creams my corn.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper May I interject something here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Please.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper You got the wrong mustard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 alicia Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 alicia Guess what? I got the part on CSI.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Oh boy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 alicia Something wrong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Uh, no. No, no, no, you know, congratulations, I think you’ll make a great hooker.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 alicia Thank you. Hey, I got to ask you something, how much do physicists make?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Um, I don’t know, I don’t think a lot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 alicia Yeah, that’s what I figured. Well, got to run, the guys promised to set up my satellite dish and paint my bedroom. Yay!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Um, hey, hey, can I talk to you about that for a second?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 alicia About what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Well, you know, it’s just that Leonard and Howard and Raj, they aren’t like other guys. They’re special.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 alicia Okay, they’re special, and?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Oh, let’s see, how can I explain this, um, they don’t know how to use their shields.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 alicia Shields?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Yeah, you know, like in Star Trek, when you’re in battle and you raise the shields? Where the hell did that come from? Anyways, um, you know how guys like this are, so, please don’t take advantage of them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 alicia Who says I’m taking advantage of them?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Come on, they’re doing everything for you, because you’re leading them on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 alicia So I let them do stuff for me. They’re happy. I get stuff. Who cares? And how’s it any different from what you do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Excuse me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 alicia I’ve seen you around them. Are you pretending like you don’t do the exact same thing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Okay, lady, you are way out of line.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 alicia Oh, I’m out of line?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Yeah, you’re out of line.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 alicia Well, what are you going to do about it, bitch?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 raj_koothrappali I like green lantern, I’m just saying it’s pretty lame that He can be defeated by the colour yellow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Only the modern green lantern is vulnerable to yellow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Golden age green lantern was vulnerable to wood.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 raj_koothrappali Great, so I can take them both out with a number-two pencil?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Oh, my God! Girl fight!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 howard_wolowitz I know you. you’re stupid enough to break it up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 howard_wolowitz May I say you look very comely tonight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 howard_wolowitz You’re right, this filly’s been broken.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper You set it on DTS, didn’t you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter I had to, she called me cutie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 howard_wolowitz According to Alicia’s facebook page, she’s hooking up with one of the producers on CSI.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 penny Well, dead whore on TV, live one in real life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Oh, great now she’s jumping up and down on the bed.
