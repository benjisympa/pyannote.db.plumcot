TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Hu-u-u-uh…. Hu-u-u-uh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Problem?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper This is Thai food.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Here we go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper We don’t have Thai food on Thursday. We have pizza on Thursday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Yes, but we all agreed that the third Thursday of every month would be Anything Can Happen Thursday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Well apparently the news didn’t reach my digestive system, which, when startled, has its own version of Anything Can Happen Thursday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Come on, the whole idea behind Anything Can Happen Thursday is to get out of this rut we’ve been in lately.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Rut? I think you mean consistency. And if we’re going to abandon that, then why even call it Thursday? Let’s call it Quonko Day and divide it into 29 hours of 17 minutes apiece, and celebrate it by sacrificing a goat to the mighty god Ra.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 raj_koothrappali I could go for some goat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, we agreed we’d do something different tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper All right. Let’s go to the comic book store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 raj_koothrappali We went to the comic book store last night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Last night was Wednesday. Wednesday is comic book night. Tonight, we’ll be going on Thursday, because it’s Anything Can Happen Thursday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Way to think outside but pressed right up against the box, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 raj_koothrappali So what are we going to do tonight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 howard_wolowitz If I may proffer a suggestion, in bars all across this great nation of ours, Thursday night is Ladies’ Night. Which means, as the evening progresses, we will get better looking courtesy of 99 cent margaritas and two-for-one Jell-O shots.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Come on, Howard, the odds of us picking up girls in a bar are practically zero.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Really? Are you familiar with the Drake Equation?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper The one that estimates the odds of making contact with extraterrestrials by calculating the product of an increasingly restrictive series of fractional values such as those stars with planets, and those planets likely to develop life? N equals R times FP times NE times FL times FI times FC times L?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Yeah, that one. You can modify it to calculate our chances of having sex by changing the formula to use the number of single women in Los Angeles, the number of those who might find us attractive, and what I call the Wolowitz Coefficient.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 raj_koothrappali The Wolowitz Coefficient?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Neediness times dress size squared. Crunching the numbers, I come up with a conservative 5,812 potential sex partners within a 40-mile radius.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter You’re joking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 howard_wolowitz I’m a horny engineer, Leonard. I never joke about math or sex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 raj_koothrappali Well, what are we waiting for? Let’s bounce, bitches.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter You’re right. It’s Anything Can Happen Thursday, let’s hit the clubs and meet hot women!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 raj_koothrappali Here we go. Lock up your daughters! We’re going to hit it and quit it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Or we could finish eating and go to the comic book store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 raj_koothrappali Also a good plan.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Alright, but next Anything Can Happen Thursday, we’re definitely going to a bar.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Oh, absolutely.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 raj_koothrappali You heard that, Ladies’ Night ladies? We’re eventually coming for you!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Fascinating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 penny Oh hey, guys, where’re you headed?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper To the comic book store. You’re probably thinking, the comic book store? On a Thursday? Why, I’ve fallen down the rabbit hole and into a land of madness. What you have failed to take into account, Penny, is that this is Anything Can Happen Thursday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 penny You got me. While you’re there, could pick me up a few comics for my nephew’s birthday?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper I think you mean comic books. Comics are feeble attempts at humour featuring talking babies and anthropomorphized pets found traditionally in the optimistically named funny pages.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 penny Leonard, could you pick me up a few comics for my nephew’s birthday?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Sure. What does he like?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 penny I don’t know, he’s 13. Just pick out anything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Just pick out anything? Maybe at the same time we can pick out a new suit for him without knowing his size, or pick out his career for him without knowing his aptitude, or pick out a new breakfast cereal without knowing his fibre requirements or his feelings about little marshmallows.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 penny Spider-Man. Get him Spider-Man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Amazing Spider-Man, Ultimate Spider-Man, Spectacular Spider-Man, The Marvelous Adventures of Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2099?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 penny Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter You know this can go on all night, why don’t you just come with us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 penny Ugh, that’s what I was trying to avoid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Oh, I forgot Sensational Spider-Man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 penny Oh, what a cute, little store. Everybody’s staring at me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Don’t worry, they’re more scared of you than you are of them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 penny Unlikely. Here, what about this one for my nephew?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper A superb choice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 penny Oh, great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Yeah, provided he has already read Infinite Crisis and 52, and is familiar with the re-establishment of the DC multiverse.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 penny What’s a multiverse?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Get her out of here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Come on, I’ll help you pick something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 raj_koothrappali That’s right. She’s with us. Guys like that are so pathetic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Tell me about it. Look, a new Batman belt buckle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 store_clerk#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 Oh, hey, Leonard. Can I help you find something?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Oh, hey, Stuart. This is Penny. She’s looking for some comic books.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 stuart_bloom Oh, really. Blink twice if you’re here against your will.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter I think we’re fine, Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 stuart_bloom Let me know if you need anything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 penny Thanks. He seems like a nice guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter You mean for someone who’s into comic books?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 penny No, no, no, I just meant for… yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Penny, just because people appreciate comic books doesn’t make them weirdos. Stuart’s a terrific artist. He went to the Rhode Island School of Design.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 penny What about the guy over there in the superhero T-shirt tucked into his sweatpants?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Ah, yeah, that’s Captain Sweatpants. He doesn’t really help the point I’m trying to make.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Let it go, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Why should I let it go? I saw it first.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Yes, but I saw it from the front.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper A far less impressive feat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Oh, come on! I need this for my Batman collection.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper I need it for my Robin collection.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Why would I gamble? It’s mine. Let go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 howard_wolowitz You let go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper No, you!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Problem?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Yes, he won’t let go of my comic book.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 howard_wolowitz It’s my comic book!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Leonard, we need a ruling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Uh, cut it in half?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 penny Excuse me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 stuart_bloom Hello again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 penny Hi. What would you recommend as a present for a 13-year-old boy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 stuart_bloom A 13-year-old girl. But if you’re dead set on a comic book, try this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 penny Oh, Hellblazer. What’s this about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 stuart_bloom A morally ambiguous confidence man who smokes, has lung cancer and is tormented by the spirits of the undead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 penny Well, if that doesn’t make me the favourite aunt, I don’t know what will. Is this me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 stuart_bloom Depends. Do you like it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 penny It’s really good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 stuart_bloom Yes, that’s you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 penny That’s so sweet, but what if I didn’t like it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 stuart_bloom It’d still be you, but I’d feel like an idiot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter I don’t believe it. Stuart’s putting the moves on Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 howard_wolowitz I have got to learn how to draw. Hey!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Once again, defeated by your own prurient interests.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 raj_koothrappali Guys, have you seen Stuart all up in Penny’s business over there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Nobody’s up in anybody’s business, let’s just buy our stuff and go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 penny Okay, you’ve got my number, now, give me the picture.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 stuart_bloom You drive a hard bargain, but here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 penny All right. So, um, just give me a call.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper So, Leonard, how are you enjoying Anything Can Happen Thursday?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Look at that, that’s a dent. Thank you, Howard Ham-Fisted Wolowitz. Did you just shut the TV off in the middle of the classic Deep Space Nine/Star Trek The Original Series Trouble With Tribbles crossover episode?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Apparently so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Are you ill?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper All right. Then is it fair to say that you’re experiencing some sort of emotional turmoil over the events involving Penny earlier this evening?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter When did you pick up on that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper A moment ago, when you turned off the TV in the middle of }during the classic Deep Space Nine/Star Trek The Original Series Trouble With Tribbles crossover episode. Would you like some advice?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Sure, why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Then, this is the perfect time to launch a blog with an interactive comments section.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Gee, thanks a lot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Would you rather I offer my personal insight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter I don’t need any insights. I just want to know why Penny’s more interested in Stuart than me. We’re practically the same guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Oh, I disagree. Stuart is taller, artistic, self-employed and, most significantly, he gets 45 percent off comic books.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter You’re right, I really should be asking strangers on the Internet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper My original point.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Chinese food, vintage video games. After the nightmare of Anything Can Happen Thursday, this is Friday night the way it was meant to be.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Who’s up for Sheldon-Free Saturday?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 penny Oh, hey guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Hey, Penny… and Stuart, hey Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 stuart_bloom Hey, guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 howard_wolowitz So what are you kids up to?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 penny Uh, Stuart has a piece in an art show that’s opening tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter And you guys are going together, great…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 stuart_bloom It is great. Really great. Freaking awesome. What are you guys doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 penny It’s Friday night, that means Chinese food and vintage video games, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Vintage doesn’t even begin to describe what we have planned. Tonight, we are playing the classic 1980 interactive text adventure, Zork. It’s the buggy beta version.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 penny Wow, Zork. Well, you guys have fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 stuart_bloom Yeah, see you guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 howard_wolowitz See you, Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Hey, Howard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Take me to a bar with women.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Okay! Let me just go inside and slip off my underwear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Well, if I get lucky, I don’t want to be caught in my Aquaman briefs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Do you…? Let’s go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 raj_koothrappali May I have a grasshopper with a little umbrella, please?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 howard_wolowitz No, he may not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 raj_koothrappali Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 howard_wolowitz I’m not sitting here with a guy drinking a grasshopper with a little umbrella.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 raj_koothrappali Fine. I’ll have a chocolate martini.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Wrong again!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 raj_koothrappali Come on, you know I can’t talk to women unless I’m lit up like the Hindu festival of Diwali.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Look, there are plenty of bars in Los Angeles where you can order grasshoppers and chocolate martinis, but you wouldn’t have to because there are no women in them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 raj_koothrappali Gotcha. I’ll have a Brandy Alexander.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 howard_wolowitz All right, the Three Musketeers just became the Dynamic Duo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Should we talk to some of these women?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 howard_wolowitz It’s way too early in the night for that. See, first we let the lawyers and the jocks thin the herd, and then we go after the weak and the old and the lame.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter That’s your system?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 howard_wolowitz That’s my system. Oh, and if you spot a chick with a Seeing Eye dog, she’s mine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 penny Oh come on. I think it’s nice that Captain Sweatpants showed up to your art opening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 stuart_bloom Yeah, it would have been nicer if he hadn’t touched all the cheese.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 penny Um, you know, it’s kind of early. Do you want to maybe come in for some coffee or something?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 stuart_bloom Oh, gee, it’s a little late for coffee, isn’t it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 penny Oh, you think coffee, means coffee, that is so sweet. Come on, I think I have decaf.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Oh, good, Stuart, I thought I heard your voice. Do you have a moment?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 stuart_bloom Uh, yeah, I guess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 penny Sheldon, we’re a little busy here, so…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 stuart_bloom We’re having coffee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Isn’t it a little late for coffee?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 stuart_bloom It’s okay. She thinks she has decaf.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 penny I’ll just go look for it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 stuart_bloom What’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Well, I’ve spent the last three hours in an online debate in the DC Comics Batman chatroom, and I need your help.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 stuart_bloom Oh yeah. Those guys can be very stubborn. What’s the topic?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper I am asserting, in the event that Batman’s death proves permanent, that original Robin, Dick Grayson, is the logical successor to the Bat Cowl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 stuart_bloom Ooh, Sheldon, I’m afraid you couldn’t be more wrong.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper More wrong? Wrong is an absolute state and not subject to gradation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 stuart_bloom Of course it is. It’s a little wrong to say a tomato is a vegetable, it’s very wrong to say it’s a suspension bridge. But returning to the original issue, Dick Grayson became Nightwing, a superhero in his own right. Batman 2 has to be the second Robin, Jason Todd.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Has to be? Has to be? I hope you’re being deliberately provocative.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 penny I found the decaf!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 stuart_bloom Oh, great!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Yeah, herbal tea for me, please.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 raj_koothrappali Barkeep! Alexander me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter How about those two?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Nah, they’re eating peanuts, and my allergies, one kiss would put me in Cedar-Sinai for a week.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter What about the ones in the corner?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Possible, very possible. Do you want the one in the whiplash collar or the one who keeps blinking?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter I think Blinky’s cute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 howard_wolowitz You got it, sir.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Wait, so we just go over there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 howard_wolowitz No, we have a little prep work to do. Put this in your mouth. We walk past them, you stumble a bit. I say, sorry, my friend’s had a little too much, and then I start to pull it out of your mouth and say, a little too much fun. Get it? I mean, they’re laughing, we’re laughing, and then we get them up to about a .15 blood alcohol level, and tell them we’re millionaires.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter What else you got?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Depends. Are you willing to sit on my lap and pretend to be a ventriloquist dummy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 howard_wolowitz I can’t sit on your lap, you don’t know the routine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 stuart_bloom I’m sorry, but you’re obviously stuck in a pre-Zero Hour DC universe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Of course I am. Removing Joe Chill as the killer of Batman’s parents effectively deprived him of his raison d’être.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 stuart_bloom Okay, you can throw all the French around you want, it doesn’t make you right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Au contraire.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 stuart_bloom Plus, you’re forgetting that the Infinite Crisis storyline restored Joe Chill to the Batman mythology.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper I am forgetting nothing and I resent your tone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 stuart_bloom Okay, look, Sheldon, it’s late and I’ve got to get some sleep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper So, I win.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 stuart_bloom No, I’m tired.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper So, I win.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 stuart_bloom Fine. You win.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Darn tootin’, I win.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 stuart_bloom Penny, I really had a terrific time. Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 sheldon_cooper No, no, no, no, don’t wake her. She’ll maul you like a rabid wolverine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 stuart_bloom You know, I don’t think that was decaf.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Wait, is this your card or isn’t it? Trust me, this was their card.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter I thought you were good at this. You’re always talking about how you go to bars and meet women.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 howard_wolowitz I do, all the time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Well, what happened? We’ve been sitting here all night and the longest conversation you’ve had with a woman was when your mom called.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Wow, you’re just going to make me come out and say it, aren’t you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Say what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 howard_wolowitz You’re weighing me down. I’m a falcon who hunts better solo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Fine. I’ll sit here. You take flight and hunt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Don’t be ridiculous, you can’t just tell a falcon when to hunt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Actually, you can. There’s a whole sport built around it. Falconry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Shut up. Let’s just get Koothrappali and go. Lucky bastard. It’s got to be that stupid accent of his. Hello. I am Sanjay Wolowitz from Bombay. Okay, I’m stumped.
