TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon Smell that? That’s the smell of new comic books. Oh, yes!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard They’re on me today, boys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 raj You’re paying? Have you been selling your sperm again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard No, I’m celebrating. As we speak, the space shuttle is docking at the International Space Station where it will deploy the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Waste Disposal System.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 raj Oh, get over yourself, it’s a high-tech toilet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard Just think. Thanks to your hard work, an international crew of astronauts will boldly go
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard Is that supposed to be funny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon I believe it is. The combination of the Star Trek reference and the play on words involving the double-meaning of the verb to go suggests that Leonard is humorously mocking your efforts in space plumbing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard Okay, make your little jokes, but of the four of us, I’m the only one making any real-world contribution to science and technology.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 raj He’s right. This is an important achievement, for two reasons. Number one, and, of course, number two.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon Oh, clever! Playing on the use of cardinal numbers as euphemisms for bodily functions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart Here, Sheldon, I pulled the new Hellboy for you. It’s mind-blowing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon Excuse me, spoiler alert.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart I didn’t spoil anything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon You told me it’s mind-blowing, so, my mind is going into it pre-blown. And once a mind is pre-blown, it cannot be re-blown.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart I’m sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon Said the Grinch to Christmas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart Uh, hey, Leonard, can I talk to you about something?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard Oh, sure, what’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart Remember I went out with your friend Penny a couple weeks ago?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard Yeah, vaguely.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 raj Sure you remember. You went to the bar and made a fool of yourself trying to pick up strange women.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard What about it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart Well, uh, the thing is, the date didn’t go that well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard Oh, too bad. I guess the thing to do now is just pick yourself up, dust yourself off, forget it and move on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart I can’t do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard Why the hell not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart ‘Cause we’re going out again tomorrow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon Excuse me, Stuart. Have you read the new Flash?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon Well, I have and it will knock your socks off! Good luck getting them back on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart Uh, anyway, I figured this is probably my last shot with Penny and I don’t want to screw it up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard Nobody wants that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart So, here’s my question. It’s the second date, you think she’ll be expecting things to get physical?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard Uh, oh, gee, my initial reaction is no. You know, let me think about it and get back to you, okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart Okay, so, you’ll give me a call?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard Yeah, or you call me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart Great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard Or nobody calls anyone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 raj Interesting. Penny’s current suitor asking advice from her former suitor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard You know, thanks for closed-captioning my pain, Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard Hey, wanna make sure he gets nowhere with Penny without jeopardizing your friendship with either of them?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard I’m listening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard Just tell him to do everything you’ve done with her for the last two years.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 penny Hey, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard Oh, hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 penny How’s it going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard Good, good. You?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 penny Fine. Oh, hey, can I ask you something?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 penny You know your friend Stuart?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 penny Well, he asked me out again and I said yes, and then I started thinking maybe I should talk to you first.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard About what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 penny Well, does it bother you, me going out with one of your friends? ‘Cause you know, you and me…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard No, no that’s the past. I’m really more of a right now kind of guy. You know, living in the moment. Although I do have to live a little in the future, ’cause, well, that’s my job. Of course, my fondness for classic science fiction does draw my attention backwards, but those stories often take place in the future. In conclusion, no, it doesn’t bother me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 penny Okay, well, that’s really cool of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard Yeah, well I wouldn’t say cool, I’d just say, that’s Leonard!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 penny Well, In that case, do you mind giving me some advice?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard About Stuart? Love to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 penny He’s very shy, how do I make him feel more comfortable around me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard Well, uh, first of all, don’t underestimate the value of discomfort.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 penny Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard Well, yeah, Stuart thrives under pressure, that’s why he works in a comic book store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard Oh. It’s Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon You’re not going to answer it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard He wants to talk about Penny. I don’t want to talk about Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon You’re making an assumption. Perhaps the comic book store is on fire, and he needs your assistance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard Why would he call me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon We don’t know. And if you don’t answer the phone, we can’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard I’m not answering the phone, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon Answer the phone, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard No! There, it went to voice mail.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon Aren’t you going to check your messages?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon You have to check your messages, the leaving of a message is one half of a social contract which is completed by the checking of the message. If that contract breaks down then all social contracts break down and we descend into anarchy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard It must be hell inside your head.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon At times.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard Guys, we have a code red.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon Do you mean code red the hospital emergency alert, code red the computer worm, or code red the cherry flavoured soft drink from the makers of Mountain Dew?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard Look, I was going over the schematics on my zero-G toilet, and I made a teeny tiny mistake on the specifications for the diverter valve.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard How teeny tiny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard It’s gonna fail after about ten flushes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon But the mission is for six months.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard Yeah, see, that’s the code red. It’s kind of like a jack-in-the-box, no one knows exactly when, but at some point something way worse than a puppet is gonna pop out of that box.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon Have you notified NASA?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard No. Are you crazy?What am I gonna say? I screwed up your toilet and pretty soon there’s gonna be crap floating all over your nice shiny space station?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard Well, what are you gonna do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard I’m gonna figure out how to fix it, then I’ll tell them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard So, what do you need us for?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 raj He can’t figure out how to fix it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard Hey, you said you were gonna be supportive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 raj I’m trying, but you have to admit this is pretty damn funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon I agree. It’s the juxtaposition of the high-tech nature of space exploration against the banality of a malfunctioning toilet that provides the comic fodder here. Check your messages.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard All right, this is an exact duplicate of the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Human Waste Disposal System as deployed on the International Space Station.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 raj Don’t you mean the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Human Waste Distribution System?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard Good one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 raj Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard Yeah, ha, it’s hilarious. Now, here’s an approximation of the spare parts available on the Space Station. We gotta find a way, using nothing but this, to reinforce this so the waste material avoids the spinning turbine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 raj You mean so it doesn’t hit the fan?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon Yeah, I have to say, I thought the toilet humour would get less funny with repetition. Apparently, there is no law of diminishing comedic returns with space poop. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart Hey Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard Hey Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart You busy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard Um…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard Classified, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard Yeah, it’s a regular Manhattan Project. What’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart Well, tonight’s my date with Penny and since we haven’t been able to connect by phone…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard Yeah, I’m sorry, it’s been broken.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart Or e-mail.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard Yeah, that too. Everything’s broken.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart Anyway, I was just wondering if you had any last-minute advice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard All right, well, off the top of my head, I think the most important thing with Penny is to go really slow. I mean, glacial.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard You know, guys come onto her all the time, so, you need to, like, set yourself apart. You know, be a little shy, don’t make too much eye contact. And, you know, treat her with, like, cool detachment and, and, and, you know, fear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart Fear?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard Yeah, like, you’re afraid that if you touch her, she’ll break.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart Well, that plays right into my wheelhouse.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard Good, good. Well, you kids have fun tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart Thanks, Leonard. What is that thing anyway?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard You don’t know what this is?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard Good. Get out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 raj Be afraid of Penny, nice, very crafty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard It wasn’t bad advice. It just wasn’t particularly helpful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon For what it’s worth, my mother says that when we deceive for personal gain, we make Jesus cry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon All right, what if we use this two-inch PVC to reinforce the centre cross-support?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard No good. I mean, it might work for the Japanese and the Americans, but have you seen the size of the Russians they got up there? This thing has to hold up against a hearty potato-based diet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard I feel terrible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard Maybe if you were helping, you’d feel better about yourself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard I deliberately tried to sabotage Stuart’s date with Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 raj Of course you feel terrible. You completely screwed up your karma, dude.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon You don’t really believe in that superstition, do you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 raj It’s not superstition. It’s practically Newtonian. For every action, there’s an equal and opposite reaction. Leonard pretends to be a friend and acts like a two-faced bitch, therefore, he is reborn as a banana slug. It’s actually a very elegant system, you know, what goes around comes around.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard Speaking of what goes around comes around…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 raj Okay, look. Instead of trying to reinforce this structure here, what if we just ran another line, bypass it entirely?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon It won’t work. The diameter of the tubing is insufficient.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 raj What if we reposition the collection tank?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon It won’t work. No way to mount it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard Okay, here’s an idea. What if I change my name and go live with my cousin and her husband Avi in Israel?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon That could work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard Morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 penny Morning. What’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard Nothing. We just pulled an all-nighter trying to fix a zero-gravity… pasta maker. I’m gonna make a coffee run. Do you want any?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 penny Oh, no, thanks. I have coffee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard Great. So how’d it go with Stuart last night?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 penny I really don’t want to talk about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard Yeah. Right. Sure. The thing is, before you guys went out, I spoke to him and…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 penny I said I don’t want to talk about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard Okay… I just… I kind of…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 penny Look, Leonard, what goes on between me and Stuart is none of your business. So just leave it alone, okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 raj If you really want to clean up your karma, go get my freakin’ latte.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard Hang on, I think I’ve got this. Help me see if we can wedge this little piece of PVC behind the support rod.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon You’re overestimating the tensile strength of the substructure you’re building.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard Sheldon, I know what I’m doing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon If you knew what you were doing, there wouldn’t be a space toilet where my coffee table should be.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 raj Howard, wait. Why don’t you use this instead of the PVC to keep the transverse filter assembly in place?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard Because this is not a spare part from the space station. This is the thing from the pizza box that keeps the lid from touching the cheese.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 raj That what that’s for? In India, the lid just touches the cheese. Of course, we also have rampant poverty and periodic outbreaks of cholera, so a little cardboard in our cheese is no biggie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard Where are you going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard Comic book store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon Oh, an excellent idea! I could certainly use a break.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 raj Me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard Hold on, you can go to the comic book store when man can once again safely poop in space.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon Why does Leonard get to go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard ‘Cause he’s upset over his situation with Penny and if I have to hear about it again, I’m going to kick him in his ovaries.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard Thanks for understanding, Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard I got your back, sister. All right, I think we’ve got a prototype ready to test. Hand me that Tupperware.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 raj Wow, that’s heavy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard Damn right it’s heavy, it’s my mother’s meat loaf, it’s been testing toilets for generations.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon I must say, Howard, I think a detailed letter to MIT describing your current circumstances might entitle you to a refund on your master’s degree.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard Okay, simulated zero-gravity human waste disposal test with meat loaf analog in three, two, one. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon Fascinating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 raj What do you think the problem is?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard Not enough bread crumbs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard Hey, Stuart, I need to talk to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart Sure, what’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard I think I gave you bad advice about Penny, and I want to apologize.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart No, your advice was great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard It was?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart Yeah, going slow really worked.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard You’re kidding. Never worked for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart Yeah, last night at dinner, I did what you told me, I went really slow, I kept my distance, and two bottles of wine later, we were making out in my car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard Wine? I didn’t say to give her wine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart It doesn’t matter, that’s where it all went to hell.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard During the kissing? What did you do, sneeze in her mouth? I did that to a girl once.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart No, everything was good and really hot, and I said “Oh, Penny,” and right where she was supposed to say, “Oh, Stuart,” she said… your name.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart That is your name, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard Yeah, no, yeah, wow, I’m sorry. That must’ve been the last thing you wanted to hear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart Well, it beats you know I’m a dude, right? Yeah, it was pretty bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard No doubt, no doubt. Okay, well, I’m sorry it didn’t work out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart Not your fault.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard Yeah, how about that? See you soon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart Yeah, sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard Yes, sir, I understand classified. We’ll keep it all classified, no one has to know but you and me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 penny What’s classified?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard Howard’s space toilet. I’ll tell you later.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard Well, they’ve deployed our solution. Let’s just all hope it works.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon I don’t see why I have to worry. My career’s not hanging in the balance. That was a joke. It’s funny, because it’s true.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 penny Leonard, could you pass the soy sauce, please?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard I’m sorry, were you talking to me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 penny Yeah, I said Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard Yes, you did, didn’t you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 penny What the hell is that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard Meatloaf.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard What was it doing on the ceiling?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard That’s classified.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 voice Houston, International Space Station. We have a little situation up here. We’d like to make an unscheduled space walk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 houston ISS, Houston. Which crew members would be involved in this E.V.A.?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 iss_voice Houston, we’d all like to step outside for a few minutes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 houston ISS, I’m afraid we can’t authorize that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 iss_voice Uh, Houston, this is more of an FYI call. We are basically out the door.
