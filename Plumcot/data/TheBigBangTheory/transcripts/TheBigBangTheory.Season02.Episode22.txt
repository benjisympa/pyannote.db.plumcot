TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Smell that? That’s the smell of new comic books. Oh, yes!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard_wolowitz They’re on me today, boys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 raj_koothrappali You’re paying? Have you been selling your sperm again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard_wolowitz No, I’m celebrating. As we speak, the space shuttle is docking at the International Space Station where it will deploy the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Waste Disposal System.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 raj_koothrappali Oh, get over yourself, it’s a high-tech toilet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Just think. Thanks to your hard work, an international crew of astronauts will boldly go
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard_wolowitz Is that supposed to be funny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon_cooper I believe it is. The combination of the Star Trek reference and the play on words involving the double-meaning of the verb to go suggests that Leonard is humorously mocking your efforts in space plumbing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard_wolowitz Okay, make your little jokes, but of the four of us, I’m the only one making any real-world contribution to science and technology.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 raj_koothrappali He’s right. This is an important achievement, for two reasons. Number one, and, of course, number two.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Oh, clever! Playing on the use of cardinal numbers as euphemisms for bodily functions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart_bloom Here, Sheldon, I pulled the new Hellboy for you. It’s mind-blowing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Excuse me, spoiler alert.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart_bloom I didn’t spoil anything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon_cooper You told me it’s mind-blowing, so, my mind is going into it pre-blown. And once a mind is pre-blown, it cannot be re-blown.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart_bloom I’m sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Said the Grinch to Christmas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart_bloom Uh, hey, Leonard, can I talk to you about something?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Oh, sure, what’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart_bloom Remember I went out with your friend Penny a couple weeks ago?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, vaguely.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 raj_koothrappali Sure you remember. You went to the bar and made a fool of yourself trying to pick up strange women.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter What about it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart_bloom Well, uh, the thing is, the date didn’t go that well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Oh, too bad. I guess the thing to do now is just pick yourself up, dust yourself off, forget it and move on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart_bloom I can’t do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Why the hell not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart_bloom ‘Cause we’re going out again tomorrow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Excuse me, Stuart. Have you read the new Flash?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart_bloom No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Well, I have and it will knock your socks off! Good luck getting them back on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart_bloom Uh, anyway, I figured this is probably my last shot with Penny and I don’t want to screw it up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Nobody wants that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart_bloom So, here’s my question. It’s the second date, you think she’ll be expecting things to get physical?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Uh, oh, gee, my initial reaction is no. You know, let me think about it and get back to you, okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart_bloom Okay, so, you’ll give me a call?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, or you call me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart_bloom Great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Or nobody calls anyone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 raj_koothrappali Interesting. Penny’s current suitor asking advice from her former suitor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter You know, thanks for closed-captioning my pain, Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard_wolowitz Hey, wanna make sure he gets nowhere with Penny without jeopardizing your friendship with either of them?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter I’m listening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard_wolowitz Just tell him to do everything you’ve done with her for the last two years.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 penny Hey, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Oh, hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 penny How’s it going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Good, good. You?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 penny Fine. Oh, hey, can I ask you something?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 penny You know your friend Stuart?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 penny Well, he asked me out again and I said yes, and then I started thinking maybe I should talk to you first.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter About what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 penny Well, does it bother you, me going out with one of your friends? ‘Cause you know, you and me…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter No, no that’s the past. I’m really more of a right now kind of guy. You know, living in the moment. Although I do have to live a little in the future, ’cause, well, that’s my job. Of course, my fondness for classic science fiction does draw my attention backwards, but those stories often take place in the future. In conclusion, no, it doesn’t bother me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 penny Okay, well, that’s really cool of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, well I wouldn’t say cool, I’d just say, that’s Leonard!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 penny Well, In that case, do you mind giving me some advice?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter About Stuart? Love to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 penny He’s very shy, how do I make him feel more comfortable around me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Well, uh, first of all, don’t underestimate the value of discomfort.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 penny Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Well, yeah, Stuart thrives under pressure, that’s why he works in a comic book store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Oh. It’s Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon_cooper You’re not going to answer it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter He wants to talk about Penny. I don’t want to talk about Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon_cooper You’re making an assumption. Perhaps the comic book store is on fire, and he needs your assistance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Why would he call me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon_cooper We don’t know. And if you don’t answer the phone, we can’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter I’m not answering the phone, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Answer the phone, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter No! There, it went to voice mail.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Aren’t you going to check your messages?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon_cooper You have to check your messages, the leaving of a message is one half of a social contract which is completed by the checking of the message. If that contract breaks down then all social contracts break down and we descend into anarchy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter It must be hell inside your head.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon_cooper At times.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard_wolowitz Guys, we have a code red.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Do you mean code red the hospital emergency alert, code red the computer worm, or code red the cherry flavoured soft drink from the makers of Mountain Dew?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard_wolowitz Look, I was going over the schematics on my zero-G toilet, and I made a teeny tiny mistake on the specifications for the diverter valve.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter How teeny tiny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard_wolowitz It’s gonna fail after about ten flushes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon_cooper But the mission is for six months.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard_wolowitz Yeah, see, that’s the code red. It’s kind of like a jack-in-the-box, no one knows exactly when, but at some point something way worse than a puppet is gonna pop out of that box.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Have you notified NASA?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard_wolowitz No. Are you crazy?What am I gonna say? I screwed up your toilet and pretty soon there’s gonna be crap floating all over your nice shiny space station?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Well, what are you gonna do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard_wolowitz I’m gonna figure out how to fix it, then I’ll tell them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter So, what do you need us for?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 raj_koothrappali He can’t figure out how to fix it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard_wolowitz Hey, you said you were gonna be supportive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 raj_koothrappali I’m trying, but you have to admit this is pretty damn funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon_cooper I agree. It’s the juxtaposition of the high-tech nature of space exploration against the banality of a malfunctioning toilet that provides the comic fodder here. Check your messages.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard_wolowitz All right, this is an exact duplicate of the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Human Waste Disposal System as deployed on the International Space Station.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 raj_koothrappali Don’t you mean the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Human Waste Distribution System?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Good one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 raj_koothrappali Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard_wolowitz Yeah, ha, it’s hilarious. Now, here’s an approximation of the spare parts available on the Space Station. We gotta find a way, using nothing but this, to reinforce this so the waste material avoids the spinning turbine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 raj_koothrappali You mean so it doesn’t hit the fan?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Yeah, I have to say, I thought the toilet humour would get less funny with repetition. Apparently, there is no law of diminishing comedic returns with space poop.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart_bloom Hey Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Hey Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart_bloom You busy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Um…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard_wolowitz Classified, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, it’s a regular Manhattan Project. What’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart_bloom Well, tonight’s my date with Penny and since we haven’t been able to connect by phone…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I’m sorry, it’s been broken.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart_bloom Or e-mail.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, that too. Everything’s broken.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart_bloom Anyway, I was just wondering if you had any last-minute advice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter All right, well, off the top of my head, I think the most important thing with Penny is to go really slow. I mean, glacial.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart_bloom Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter You know, guys come onto her all the time, so, you need to, like, set yourself apart. You know, be a little shy, don’t make too much eye contact. And, you know, treat her with, like, cool detachment and, and, and, you know, fear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart_bloom Fear?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, like, you’re afraid that if you touch her, she’ll break.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart_bloom Well, that plays right into my wheelhouse.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Good, good. Well, you kids have fun tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart_bloom Thanks, Leonard. What is that thing anyway?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard_wolowitz You don’t know what this is?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart_bloom No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard_wolowitz Good. Get out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 raj_koothrappali Be afraid of Penny, nice, very crafty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter It wasn’t bad advice. It just wasn’t particularly helpful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon_cooper For what it’s worth, my mother says that when we deceive for personal gain, we make Jesus cry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon_cooper All right, what if we use this two-inch PVC to reinforce the centre cross-support?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard_wolowitz No good. I mean, it might work for the Japanese and the Americans, but have you seen the size of the Russians they got up there? This thing has to hold up against a hearty potato-based diet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter I feel terrible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard_wolowitz Maybe if you were helping, you’d feel better about yourself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter I deliberately tried to sabotage Stuart’s date with Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 raj_koothrappali Of course you feel terrible. You completely screwed up your karma, dude.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon_cooper You don’t really believe in that superstition, do you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 raj_koothrappali It’s not superstition. It’s practically Newtonian. For every action, there’s an equal and opposite reaction. Leonard pretends to be a friend and acts like a two-faced bitch, therefore, he is reborn as a banana slug. It’s actually a very elegant system, you know, what goes around comes around.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard_wolowitz Speaking of what goes around comes around…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 raj_koothrappali Okay, look. Instead of trying to reinforce this structure here, what if we just ran another line, bypass it entirely?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon_cooper It won’t work. The diameter of the tubing is insufficient.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 raj_koothrappali What if we reposition the collection tank?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon_cooper It won’t work. No way to mount it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard_wolowitz Okay, here’s an idea. What if I change my name and go live with my cousin and her husband Avi in Israel?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon_cooper That could work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 penny Morning. What’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Nothing. We just pulled an all-nighter trying to fix a zero-gravity… pasta maker. I’m gonna make a coffee run. Do you want any?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 penny Oh, no, thanks. I have coffee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Great. So how’d it go with Stuart last night?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 penny I really don’t want to talk about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Yeah. Right. Sure. The thing is, before you guys went out, I spoke to him and…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 penny I said I don’t want to talk about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Okay… I just… I kind of…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 penny Look, Leonard, what goes on between me and Stuart is none of your business. So just leave it alone, okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 raj_koothrappali If you really want to clean up your karma, go get my freakin’ latte.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard_wolowitz Hang on, I think I’ve got this. Help me see if we can wedge this little piece of PVC behind the support rod.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon_cooper You’re overestimating the tensile strength of the substructure you’re building.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard_wolowitz Sheldon, I know what I’m doing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon_cooper If you knew what you were doing, there wouldn’t be a space toilet where my coffee table should be.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 raj_koothrappali Howard, wait. Why don’t you use this instead of the PVC to keep the transverse filter assembly in place?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard_wolowitz Because this is not a spare part from the space station. This is the thing from the pizza box that keeps the lid from touching the cheese.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 raj_koothrappali That what that’s for? In India, the lid just touches the cheese. Of course, we also have rampant poverty and periodic outbreaks of cholera, so a little cardboard in our cheese is no biggie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard_wolowitz Where are you going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Comic book store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Oh, an excellent idea! I could certainly use a break.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 raj_koothrappali Me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard_wolowitz Hold on, you can go to the comic book store when man can once again safely poop in space.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Why does Leonard get to go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter ‘Cause he’s upset over his situation with Penny and if I have to hear about it again, I’m going to kick him in his ovaries.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Thanks for understanding, Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard_wolowitz I got your back, sister. All right, I think we’ve got a prototype ready to test. Hand me that Tupperware.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 raj_koothrappali Wow, that’s heavy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard_wolowitz Damn right it’s heavy, it’s my mother’s meat loaf, it’s been testing toilets for generations.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon_cooper I must say, Howard, I think a detailed letter to MIT describing your current circumstances might entitle you to a refund on your master’s degree.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard_wolowitz Okay, simulated zero-gravity human waste disposal test with meat loaf analog in three, two, one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Fascinating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 raj_koothrappali What do you think the problem is?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard_wolowitz Not enough bread crumbs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Hey, Stuart, I need to talk to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart_bloom Sure, what’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter I think I gave you bad advice about Penny, and I want to apologize.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart_bloom No, your advice was great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter It was?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart_bloom Yeah, going slow really worked.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter You’re kidding. Never worked for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart_bloom Yeah, last night at dinner, I did what you told me, I went really slow, I kept my distance, and two bottles of wine later, we were making out in my car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Wine? I didn’t say to give her wine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart_bloom It doesn’t matter, that’s where it all went to hell.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter During the kissing? What did you do, sneeze in her mouth? I did that to a girl once.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart_bloom No, everything was good and really hot, and I said “Oh, Penny,” and right where she was supposed to say, “Oh, Stuart,” she said… your name.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart_bloom That is your name, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, no, yeah, wow, I’m sorry. That must’ve been the last thing you wanted to hear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart_bloom Well, it beats you know I’m a dude, right? Yeah, it was pretty bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter No doubt, no doubt. Okay, well, I’m sorry it didn’t work out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart_bloom Not your fault.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, how about that? See you soon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 stuart_bloom Yeah, sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard_wolowitz Yes, sir, I understand classified. We’ll keep it all classified, no one has to know but you and me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 penny What’s classified?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Howard’s space toilet. I’ll tell you later.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard_wolowitz Well, they’ve deployed our solution. Let’s just all hope it works.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 sheldon_cooper I don’t see why I have to worry. My career’s not hanging in the balance. That was a joke. It’s funny, because it’s true.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 penny Leonard, could you pass the soy sauce, please?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter I’m sorry, were you talking to me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 penny Yeah, I said Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Yes, you did, didn’t you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 penny What the hell is that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard_wolowitz Meatloaf.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter What was it doing on the ceiling?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 howard_wolowitz That’s classified.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 Houston, International Space Station. We have a little situation up here. We’d like to make an unscheduled space walk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 ground_controller ISS, Houston. Which crew members would be involved in this E.V.A.?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 iss_voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 Houston, we’d all like to step outside for a few minutes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 ground_controller ISS, I’m afraid we can’t authorize that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 iss_voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode22 Uh, Houston, this is more of an FYI call. We are basically out the door.
