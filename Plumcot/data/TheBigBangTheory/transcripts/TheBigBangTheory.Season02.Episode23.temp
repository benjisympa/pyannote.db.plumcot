TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Oh, boy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon I can’t comment without violating our agreement that I don’t criticize your work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Then what was oh, boy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Great restraint on my part.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard There’s nothing wrong with the science here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Perhaps you mean a different thing than I do when you say science.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Okay, how’s that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon You actually had it right in the first place. Once again, you’ve fallen for one of my classic pranks. Bazinga! Well, now here’s a peculiar e-mail. The president of the university wants me to meet him at his office tomorrow morning at 8 a.m.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon It doesn’t say. It must be an emergency. Everyone at the university knows I eat breakfast at eight and move my bowels at 8:20.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Yes, how did we live before Twitter? I guess you’ll find out what it is in the morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon That’s 14 hours away. For the next 840 minutes, I’m effectively one of Heisenberg’s particles, I know where I am or I know how fast I’m going, but I can’t know both. Yet how am I supposed to carry on with this huge annoying thing hovering over my head?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Yeah, I know the feeling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Leonard. Leonard. Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Sheldon, it’s two o’clock in the morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Why is everybody keep telling me what time it is?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Everybody?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon You, the president of the university, his wife, their sullen teenage daughter. That entire family is fascinated by what time it is and whether people know it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard You went to President Seibert’s house in the middle of the night?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon He didn’t respond to my e-mail, his phone number is unlisted. Tell me what my other option was.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard You could have waited until morning. I know, look who I’m talking to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Do you remember the grant proposal I submitted to the National Science Foundation to detect slow-moving monopoles at the magnetic North Pole?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Hardly a day goes by when I don’t think about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Aw, how nice. Well, a space opened up at the last minute on the NSF expedition to the Arctic Circle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Wait a minute. He offered to send you to the North Pole?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Yes. In fact, he was quite enthusiastic. He said, “Frankly, if I could send you tonight, I would.”
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Okay, well, do you want to go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Of course not. I’m a theoretical physicist, a career I chose in no small part because it’s indoors, but if I’m able to detect slow-moving magnetic monopoles there, I will be the scientist to confirm string theory. People will write books about me. Third-graders will create macaroni-art dioramas depicting scenes from my life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Sure, maybe a tableau of me trying to pummel you to death.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Sarcasm?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Maybe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon I’m on the horns of a dilemma. Can you imagine me, Sheldon Cooper, at the North Pole?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Easy peasy, I’m doing it right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon I’m not good with cold, Leonard. How often have we had to leave a movie theatre because I got a headache from drinking the Icee too fast? I can’t go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Well, then don’t go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon How can you say that? The scientific opportunity of a lifetime presents itself and my best friend says don’t go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard All right, then go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Listen to you. How can I possibly go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Sheldon, what are the words I can say right now to end this conversation and let me go back to sleep?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Odd, President Seibert posed the exact same question.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard How was it resolved?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon It wasn’t. His wife set their dogs on me and rendered the question moot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 howard Just imagine. If he says yes, we’ll have an entire summer without Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 raj We could play outside.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 howard We could sit on the left side of the couch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard I could use the bathroom at 8:20.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 raj Our dreams are very small, aren’t they?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Good news, gentlemen, I have tentatively accepted…
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 all Yeah! Woo-hoo!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon …the invitation to join the Arctic Expedition.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard It’s not gonna be the same without you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 howard Godspeed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Thank you, but your sentiments may be premature.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 raj Ooh, I don’t like where this is going.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon I would like to propose that the three of you accompany me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 howard To the North Pole?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 raj Is this just so we won’t touch your stuff while you’re away?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon I’ll admit that was a concern. But the fact is, I’ll need a support team. And the three of you are my first choice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 howard Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Well, there are others who might be more qualified, but the thought of interviewing them gave me a stomach ache. Now, I know I’m proposing an enormous undertaking, so why don’t you take a few moments to discuss it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 howard We’re not really gonna go to the North Pole with him, are we?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon I’m still within earshot! You may want to wait for my door to close.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 howard We’re not really gonna go to the North Pole with him, are we?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Hang on. Let’s talk about it. This is a National Science Foundation expedition. I don’t know how we can turn it down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 howard Easy. Instead of saying, no, we don’t want to go on an NSF expedition, say, no, we don’t want to spend “three months stuck in a cabin in the Arctic Circle with an anal nutbag.”
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 raj But if we were part of the team that confirmed string theory, we could drink for free in any bar in any college town with a university that has a strong science program.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Howard, this is big science. You could be the engineer who builds the equipment that puts us on the cover of magazines.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 howard I could also be the engineer who builds the crossbow that kills Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 raj You still might get on a magazine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 howard So you guys are seriously considering this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 howard And you think you can put up with Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 raj Well, I’m a Hindu. My religion teaches that if we suffer in this life we are rewarded in the next. Three months at the North Pole with Sheldon and I’m reborn as a well-hung billionaire with wings!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Well, gentlemen, have you reached a decision?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard I’m in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 raj Me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 howard Oh, damn it. Peer pressure. Fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Excellent. And just an FYI, as I am the expedition’s team leader, protocol dictates that be phrased fine, sir. But don’t worry, there will be a briefing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 penny Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 penny Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 penny Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 penny Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 penny Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 penny Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 penny What do you want?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon I need access to the Cheesecake Factory’s walk-in freezer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 penny Now, honey, I already told you, the hamburger meat is fresh and stored at a safe temperature.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon No. This is to train for a three-month expedition to the magnetic North Pole.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon I don’t know how that sentence could possibly confuse you, but to elaborate, I’m going to the Arctic Circle with Leonard, Wolowitz and Koothrappali.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 penny You’re all going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 penny For three months?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 penny Excuse me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Is that a yes or a no on the freezer? The woman has the attention span of a gnat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 penny Hey, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 penny Sheldon says you’re going to the North Pole.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Yeah. Pretty cool, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 penny Yeah. I’m just a little surprised you didn’t tell me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Oh, well, it all happened kind of fast, and we had to get physicals and buy thermal underwear and study up on, you know, snow and stuff. Sorry, I was gonna tell you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 penny Oh, hey, no, you don’t have to apologize. There’s no reason you have to tell me. I was just, you know, surprised.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Yes, yes, you were busy, you were surprised, all very fascinating. Now where do we stand on the freezer?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 penny Is he serious?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Actually, it would help.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 penny All right, I’ll see what I can do. So, three months at the North Pole. Wow, that is awesome.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon I’m sorry, but at what point do you put this see what you can do plan into action?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 penny Just a warning, Sheldon, the freezer locks from the outside.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Did she seem upset to you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon No. Did she seem upset to you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Oh, good, I got it right. Are you upset?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard A little bit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Two for two. I’m on fire.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard I mean, I know she’s not my girlfriend or anything, but wouldn’t you think she’d feel a little bad that I’m going to be gone for the whole summer?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon That feels like a bonus question. I’m going to stop here while I’m ahead, but I’ve had a great time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Alright, now the purpose of this drill is to acclimate us to the use of tools in extreme temperatures such as we will face in the Arctic Circle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 raj Where are your tools?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Right here. All right, team, open up your practice kits. As the university did not permit me to bring the actual equipment we’ll be using to the Cheesecake Factory, because apparently I’m “ridiculous,” I’ve provided substitutes which will exercise your fine motor skills. Leonard, you will be doing a series of complex mathematical problems on a vintage Casio model 1175 calculator watch I received when I won the Earth Science medal in 3rd grade. Treat it with respect. Raj, you will be painting sideburns and a Van Dyke on a six-inch figurine of Legolas the elf. Now, remember, a Van Dyke is a goatee without a moustache. Wolowitz, you will be completing a series of delicate surgical procedures on the classic children’s game, Operation. To begin with, you will remove funny bone for two hundred dollars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 howard For this I went to MIT.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon And begin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 raj I think I swallowed some paint!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard I can’t press any of the buttons with my gloves. Oh, son of a bitch!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Adversity is to be expected. Continue.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 howard Oh, boy, am I gonna get sued.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Okay, I can’t do this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 raj Me either.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Gentlemen, use your imagination. Innovate. Did Han Solo let Luke Skywalker freeze to death on the ice planet of Hoth? No. He cut open a tauntaun and used its internal body heat to warm him up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 howard You heard the man. Hold him down and I’ll cut him open.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Hang on, I know I don’t possess the tools of leadership, but I don’t understand why we can’t assemble the equipment inside the hut and then take it outside.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon I hadn’t thought of that. I guess we’re done here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Here, drink slash eat this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard What is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon It’s hot chocolate with a stick of butter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 howard Okay, why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Because in the frigid temperatures in the Arctic, we need to consume at least 5,000 calories a day just to maintain our body weight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Sheldon, you know I can’t eat butter. I’m lactose intolerant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Way ahead of you, that’s an “I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter” stick.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 raj But mummy, all the other guys are going to the North Pole.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 mrs_koothrappali I don’t care what the other guys are doing. If the other guys jumped in the Bay of Bengal and tried to swim to Sri Lanka, would you follow them?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 raj If you were standing behind me nagging, I might.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 dr_koothrappali Don’t talk back to your mother. This trip is much too dangerous, Rajesh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 raj No, it’s not. Howard, tell them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 howard Doctor and Mrs. Koothrappali, namaste. I understand your concern, but if it’ll make you feel any better, my mother is fine with me going, and this is a woman who kept a safety rail on my bed until I was 17.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 mrs_koothrappali So, she has no problem with her son being eaten by a walrus?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon That’s very unlikely, Mrs. Koothrappali. If Raj dies, it’ll be from frostbite, gangrene, acute sunburn or being ripped to shreds by a fifteen hundred pound polar bear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 howard Ma, I’m putting you on speakerphone with Raj’s parents. Can you tell them that you’re okay with me going to the Arctic?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 howards_mother Arctic? I thought you said Arkansas!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 howard I didn’t say that. You never listen to me!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 howards_mother He doesn’t tell me anything! He lives a secret life because he’s ashamed!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 penny Hey, Leonard, can I talk to you for a sec?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Sure, but let’s go out here where there’s a little less yelling and guilt. What’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 penny Well, I got you a little going away present.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Oh, a blanket.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 penny Oh, no, no, no, not just a blanket. See, it has sleeves. Yeah!  So, you can, you know, be all snoodled up while you do your science stuff.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Oh, wow, cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 penny Oh, I’m gonna miss you. See you later.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 mrs_koothrappali I told you no. Why don’t you believe me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 howards_mother ‘Cause it doesn’t make sense to me! How can it be that in the entire country of India, there isn’t one Outback Steakhouse?!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Sheldon, Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon I want a cookie, Meemaw.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Sheldon, it’s me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon But Meemaw just made cookies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Listen, I don’t know if I can go on the expedition.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard I don’t think I can go to the North Pole.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Okay, Leonard, I know you’re concerned about disappointing me but I want you to take comfort from the knowledge that my expectations of you are very low.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Yeah, that’s very comforting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Comforting is a part of leadership. It’s not a part I care for, but such is my burden.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Terrific, it’s just that I don’t think Penny wants me to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Assuming that’s a valid reason not to go, which it isn’t, how do you know this? Did she say it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Not exactly. But she said she was gonna miss me and she gave me this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon What is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard It’s a blanket with sleeves.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Oh, that’s clever. Let me see if I understand this correctly. Her missing you is an emotional state you find desirable?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Yes, obviously.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon All right. Well, given that missing you is predicated on you leaving, logic dictates you must leave.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Yes, okay, but I’m gonna be gone for three months. What if she doesn’t miss me that long and she meets someone else?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon She does have a short attention span.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard So, I can’t go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Leonard, you may be right. It appears that Penny secretly wants you in her life in a very intimate and carnal fashion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard You really think so?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Of course not. Even in my sleep-deprived state, I’ve managed to pull off another one of my classic pranks. Bazinga!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 penny Oh, Leonard, what time is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard It’s 7 a.m. I’m sorry it’s early, but we’re leaving soon, and I needed to talk to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 penny Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard What did you mean when you said you’re going to miss me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 penny Um, I don’t know. You’ll be gone and I’ll notice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Okay, well, um, what about this? What does this mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 penny Wine, credit card and late night television are a bad combination.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard All right, fine. What about that really long hug? What did that mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 penny That wasn’t a long hug.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard It was at least five Mississippis. A standard hug is two Mississippis tops.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 penny Leonard, I don’t know what to tell you. It was just a hug.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Glad we cleared that up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 penny Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard I guess I’ll see you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 penny Okay, have a safe trip.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Thank you. Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 penny Okay, bye. Means I wish you weren’t going.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Damn it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 howard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard We’re out of ice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon All right, men, we begin initial assembly and deployment of the testing equipment starting tomorrow at 0700 hours, but until then, you are all off duty. I suggest you keep the shenanigans to a minimum as medical help is 18 hours away by dogsled.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 raj What are you working on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 howard Crossbow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Hey, guys, can I just say something? How about we take a moment to think about where we are right now? This is literally the top of the world. Only a handful of people in all of human history will ever see what we are going to see.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 raj He’s right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 howard Yeah, wow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon It is remarkable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 raj So, who’s up for a movie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 howard Good idea, what do you think? Ice Station Zebra or John Carpenter’s The Thing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 raj I say double feature.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Dinner’s ready!
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon What are we having?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Reconstituted Thai food.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Did you bring the dehydrated low-sodium soy sauce?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Check.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Freeze-dried spicy mustard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Check.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Flash-frozen brown rice, not white?
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 leonard Uh, oh, sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Not to worry. I hid it. Bazinga! You’re in my spot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 howard There’s no time for a crossbow. Find me an icicle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season02.Episode23 sheldon Three months. This is gonna be great!
