TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard Oh, thank God we’re home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 howard I can’t believe we spent three months in that frozen hell.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 raj It was like a snowy nightmare from which there was no awakening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon I don’t know what Arctic expedition you guys were on, but I thought it was a hoot and a half.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon Oh, hi mom. No, I told you I’d call you when I got home, I’m not home yet. Alright, I’m home. The Arctic expedition was a remarkable success, I’m all but certain there’s a Nobel Prize in my future. Actually, I shouldn’t say that. I’m entirely certain. No, mother, I could not feel your church group praying for my safety. The fact that I’m home safe is not proof that it worked, that logic is Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc. No, I’m not sassing you in Eskimo talk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard I’m going to go let Penny know we’re back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon Mother, I have to go. Yeah, love you. Bye. Hello, old friend. Daddy’s home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 penny Leonard, you’re back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard Yeah, I just stopped by to say… Yeah, so, hi!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 penny Hi! 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 howard Dammit, I should have gone over and told her we were back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 raj Yeah, it was first come, first served.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon I just want you both to know, when I publish my findings, I won’t forget your contributions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 howard Great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 raj Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon Of course, I can’t mention you in my Nobel acceptance speech, but when I get round to writing my memoirs you can expect a very effusive footnote, and perhaps a signed copy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 raj We have to tell him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon Tell me what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 howard Damn his Vulcan hearing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon You fellows are planning a party for me, aren’t you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 howard Okay, Sheldon, sit down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon If there’s going to be a theme, I should let you know that I don’t care for luau, toga or under the sea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 howard Yeah, we’ll keep that in mind, look, we need to talk to you about something that happened at the North Pole.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon If this is about the night the heat went out, there’s nothing to be embarrassed about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 raj It’s not about that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 howard And we agreed to never speak of it again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon So we slept together naked. It was only to keep our core body temperatures from plummeting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 howard He’s speaking about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 raj For me, it was a bonding moment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 howard Sheldon, you remember the first few weeks we were looking for magnetic monopoles and not finding anything and you were acting like an obnoxious, giant dictator?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 raj I thought we were going to be gentle with him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 howard That’s why I added the tator. And then when we found our first positive data, you were so happy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon Oh, yes. In the world of emoticons, I was colon, capital D.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 howard Well, in actuality, what your equipment detected wasn’t so much evidence of paradigm-shifting monopoles as it was… static from the electric can opener we were turning on and off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 raj He just went colon, capital O.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon You tampered with my experiment?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 howard We had to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 raj It was the only way to keep you from being such a huge Dickensian. You see that? I added the ensian.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon Did Leonard know about this? Leonard’s my best friend in the world. Surely Leonard didn’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 howard Actually, it was his idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon Of course it was. The whole plan reeks of Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 penny I missed you so much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard I missed you, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 penny I couldn’t even think of anyone else while you were gone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard Me, neither. Except for one night when the heat went out. Long story, it’s… don’t ask.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon Leonard. Leonard. Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard Do not make a sound.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon Whispering do not make a sound is a sound.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard Damn his Vulcan hearing. Not a good time, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon Penny. Penny. Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 penny Oh, this is ridiculous. What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon Hello, Penny. I realize you’re currently at the mercy of your primitive biological urges, but as you have an entire lifetime of poor decisions ahead of you, may I interrupt this one?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 penny It’s great to see you too. Come on in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon Wolowitz has informed me of your grand deception. Do you have anything to say for yourself?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard Yes, I feel terrible about it. I will never forgive myself, I don’t expect you to either, and I would really appreciate it if you would leave me with Penny for a session of self-criticism and repentance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 penny Okay, can someone please tell me what’s going on here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon What’s going on is I was led to believe I was making groundbreaking strides in science, when in fact, I was being fed false data at the hands of Wolowitz, Koothrappali and your furry little boy toy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 penny Is that true?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard It was the only way to make him happy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 penny Why did you have to make him happy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard Because when he wasn’t happy, we wanted to kill him. There was even a plan. We were going to throw his Kindle outside, and when he went to get it, lock the door and let him freeze to death.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon That seems like a bit of an overreaction.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard No, the overreaction was the plan to tie your limbs to four different sled dog teams and yell mush. Look, we kept the original data. You can still publish the actual results.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon Yes, but the actual results are unsuccessful and I’ve already sent an e-mail to everyone at the university explaining that I have confirmed string theory and forever changed man’s understanding of the universe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard Aw, see, yeah, you probably shouldn’t have done that. So write another e-mail, set the record straight, it’s no big deal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon You’re right, Leonard, it’s not a big deal. All you did was lie to me destroy my dream and humiliate me in front of the whole university. That, FYI, was sarcasm. I, in fact, believe it is a big deal
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 penny Oh, the poor thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard Yeah, I feel terrible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 penny Wait, wait. Aren’t you going to go talk to him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard What? Uh, he’ll be fine, the guy’s a trouper, come here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 penny No, you’re right, you shouldn’t talk to him. I will.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard Man, I cannot catch a break.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 penny Hey. Do you want to talk?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon About what? Being betrayed by my friends? Spending three months at the North Pole for nothing? And I didn’t even get to go to Comic-Con!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 penny Oh, hon… Uh… Soft kitty, warm kitty…
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon That’s for when I’m sick. Sad is not sick.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 penny Oh. Sorry. I don’t know your sad song.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon I don’t have a sad song. I’m not a child.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 penny Well, you know, I do understand what you’re going through.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon Really? Did you just have the Nobel Prize in waitressing stolen from you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 penny Well, no, but when I was a senior in high school, one of my friends heard I was going to be named head cheerleader. Oh, I was so excited. My mom even made me a celebration pie. Then they named stupid Valerie Mossbacher head cheerleader. Big ol’ slutbag.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon Are you saying that you think a celebration pie is even remotely comparable to a Nobel Prize?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 penny Well, they’re pretty tasty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon And on a different, but not unrelated topic, based on your current efforts to buoy my spirits, do you truly believe that you were ever fit to be a cheer leader?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 penny Look, Sheldon, I just don’t think that the guys and Leonard really meant to hurt you. You know? They just told an unfortunate lie to deal with a difficult situation. Okay, you know what it’s like? Remember that scene in the new Star Trek movie when Kirk has to take over the ship, so he tells Spock all that stuff he knew wasn’t true, like saying Spock didn’t care his mom died?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon I missed Comic-Con and the new Star Trek movie!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 raj I like the new look.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 howard Thanks. I call it the Clooney.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 raj I call it the Mario and Luigi, but whatever. Hey, how’s Sheldon doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard Well, he came out of his room this morning wearing his Darth Vader helmet and tried to choke me to death with the Force, so I’d say, a little better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 howard If I may abruptly change the subject, did you and Penny finally… you know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard Howard…
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 howard Personally, I don’t care, but my genitals wanted me to ask.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard Well, tell your genitals what I do with Penny is none of their business.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 howard He says they didn’t do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard Sheldon, over here. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 howard What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 raj I feel bad for the guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard Sheldon, why are you sitting by yourself?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon Because I am without friends. Like the proverbial cheese, I stand alone. Even while seated.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard Come on. We said we were sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon It’s going to take more than I’m sorry and a store-bought apology pie from Penny to make up for what you’ve done to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 kripke Hey, Cooper. Wead your wetwaction e-mail. Way to destroy your weputation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon You see? People have been pointing and laughing at me all morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 kripke That’s not twue. People have been pointing and waughing at you your whole wife.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon All right, I’ve had enough. Attention, everyone. I’ m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. As many of you in the physics department might know, my career trajectory has taken a minor detour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 kripke Off a cwiff.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon My credibility may have been damaged…
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 kripke Compwetely wecked.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon But I would like to remind you that in science, there’s no such thing as failure. There once was a man who referred to his prediction of a cosmological constant as the single biggest blunder of his career. That man’s name was, surprise, surprise, Albert Einstein.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 kripke Yeah, but wesearch into Dark Energy pwoved that Einstein’s cosmowogical constant was actually wight all along, so you’re still, surpwise, surpwise, a woser.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon Oh, you think you’re so clever. Well, let me just tell you, while I do not currently have a scathing retort, you check your e-mail periodically for a doozy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard So much for our friendship with Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 raj Well, we’ll always have the night the heat went out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 penny Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard Hey. Listen, since we got, you know, interrupted last night, I didn’t have a chance to give you this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 penny Oh, Leonard, you shouldn’t have. Oh, boy! What is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard It’s a snowflake. From the North Pole.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 penny Are you serious?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard Uh-huh. It’ll last forever. I preserved it in a one percent solution of polyvinyl acetal resin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 penny Oh, my God. That’s the most romantic thing anyone’s ever said to me that I didn’t understand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard It’s actually a pretty simple process. You see, cyanoacrylate are monomers which polymerize on… 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 howard Red alert, Leonard. Sheldon ran away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard Man, I can not catch a break.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 penny So, how do you know he ran away?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 howard Well, he’s not answering his phone, he handed in his resignation at the university and he sent me a text that said, I’m running away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard Okay, well, thanks for letting me know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 penny Well, Leonard, aren’t you going to do something?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard Of course I’m going to do something. Uh, Howard, you check the comic book store. Raj, go to the Thai restaurant. I’ll stay here with Penny in her apartment. Oh, damn it. It’s Sheldon’s mother. A break cannot be caught. Hi, Mrs. Cooper. He is? Sheldon went home to Texas. Yeah, no, I know he resigned. Yes, I guess it kind of is our fault. No, no, no, you, you’re right, someone needs to come talk to him. Don’t worry, I’ll take care of it. Yeah. All right. New plan. Howard, you and Raj go to Texas. I’ll stay here with Penny in her apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 penny Well, you’re not gonna go with them?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard Well, you know, I gave you the snowflake and we were kissing and… Oh, come on, I don’t want to go to Texas!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 howard Oh, right, and I do? My people already crossed a desert once, we’re done.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard Trust me, you’ll be fine. See ya.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 penny Well, wait a second, Leonard, come on, how can you not go? He’s your best friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard Yeah, but I already saw him naked. Just come here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 penny No. I promise I will be here when you get back. Just go help Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 penny Yeah. We waited a few months. We can wait a few more days.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard Maybe you can.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 penny Go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 raj Boy, you cannot catch a break, can you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 mrs_cooper Here you go, Shelly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon Thanks, Mom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 mrs_cooper Hold your horses, young man. Here in Texas, we pray before we eat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon Aw, Mom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 mrs_cooper This is not California, land of the heathen. Gimme. By His hand we are all…
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon Fed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 mrs_cooper Give us, Lord, our daily…
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon Bread.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 mrs_cooper Please know that we are truly…
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon Grateful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 mrs_cooper For every cup and every…
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon Plateful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 mrs_cooper Amen. Now, that wasn’t so hard, was it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon My objection was based on considerations other than difficulty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 mrs_cooper Whatever. Jesus still loves you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon Thank you for carving a smiley face in my grilled cheese sandwich.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 mrs_cooper Oh, I know how to take care of my baby. His eyes came out a little thin, but you can just pretend he’s Chinese. So, do you want to talk about what happened with you and your little friends?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon They’re not my friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 mrs_cooper All right. If you recall, when you were little, we sat right here at this very spot and we talked about some of the problems you had getting along with the neighbour kids.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon That was different. They were threatened by my intelligence and too stupid to know that’s why they hated me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 mrs_cooper Oh baby, they knew very well why they hated you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard I can’t believe you bought a red cowboy hat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 howard Hello? I’m wearing a red turtleneck. Plus, it was the only boys’ large they had.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 raj I’m sorry, this does not look like Texas. Where’s the tumbleweeds? Where’s the saloons?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard Saloons?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 raj Yeah, like in the movies I saw growing up in India. You know, uh, Four for Texas, Yellow Rose of Texas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 howard This neighbourhood is more Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 raj I was really hoping to see a cattle drive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard What can I tell you? They probably have steaks on sale at that big-ass Costco over there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard Will you please take that stupid hat off?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 howard No, I want to blend in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 raj To what? Toy Story?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 mrs_cooper Hi, boys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 howard Howdy, ma’am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 mrs_cooper Howdy to you, too. You got here quick.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard – We took the red-eye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 mrs_cooper Well, come on in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 howard Thank you kindly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 mrs_cooper Can I… Can I get you something to drink?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard Uh, no, thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 howard If y’all don’t mind, I got a hankerin’ for a Lone Star beer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 mrs_cooper There’s no alcohol in this household. Stop talking like that and lose the hat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 howard Sorry. I’ll take a diet Yoo-Hoo if you have it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 mrs_cooper You’ll take a Cola.* What about you? Radge, isn’t it? Oh, you still having trouble talking to the ladies? Because, you know, at our church we have a woman who’s an amazing healer. Mostly she does, uh, crutch and wheelchair people, but I bet she’d be willing to take a shot at whatever Third World demon is running around inside of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard Uh, if you don’t mind, Mrs. Cooper, there’s a 3:05 nonstop back to Los Angeles, and you have no idea how much I want to be on it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 mrs_cooper A girl?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard Uh, yes, ma’am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 mrs_cooper Oh, good. I’ve been praying for you. Oh, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon What are they doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard We came to apologize.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 howard Again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard And bring you home. So, why don’t you pack up your stuff and we’ll head back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard No, this is my home now. Thanks to you, my career is over and I will spend the rest of my life here in Texas trying to teach evolution to creationists.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 mrs_cooper You watch your mouth, Shelly. Everyone’s entitled to their opinion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon Evolution isn’t an opinion, it’s fact.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 mrs_cooper And that is your opinion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 sheldon I forgive you. Let’s go home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 mrs_cooper Don’t tell me prayer doesn’t work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard How about that? I finally caught a break.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 penny Uh-huh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard You know how they say when friends have sex it can get weird?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 penny Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard Why does it have to get weird?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 penny I don’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard I mean, we were friends, and now we’re more than friends. We’re whatever this is. But why label it, right? I mean, it is what it is and…
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 penny Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard Yeah?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 penny It’s weird.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode01 leonard Totally.
