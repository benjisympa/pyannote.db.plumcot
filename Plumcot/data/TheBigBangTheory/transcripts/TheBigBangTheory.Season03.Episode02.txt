TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Sheldon, you’re wrong. Wolverine was not born with bone claws.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Howard, you know me to be a very smart man. Don’t you think if I were wrong, I’d know it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Okay, first of all…
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Give it up, dude, you’re arguing with a crazy person.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I’m not crazy. My mother had me tested.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Hey, guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 howard_wolowitz What are you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter What do you mean? It’s new comic book night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Yeah, but since you and Penny finally hooked up, we thought you two would be having bouncy naked yum-yum night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter There’s more to life than sex, Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Okay, who had Leonard flames out with Penny in less than 24 hours”?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Nothing flamed out. We don’t have to have sex every night, you know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 howard_wolowitz You don’t have to, but it’s highly recommended.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Yeah, take advantage of that window of opportunity before it slams shut on your little dinky.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter It’s not a matter of opportunity. We’re getting to know each other. There’s a learning curve.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 howard_wolowitz What’s there to learn? You get naked, do nasty things to each other, then somebody makes scrambled eggs and salami. Easy peasy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Perhaps what Leonard is obliquely referring to is the occurrence of some sort of sexual dysfunction.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Okay, who had Leonard gets a floppy disk?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Oh, a clever, albeit obsolete, euphemism for insufficient blood flow to the male sex organ.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Nothing like that happened, all right? The sex was just fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Just fine? Oh, dude, the fourth Harry Potter movie was just fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter I’m not saying it was bad, I’m just saying it… wasn’t great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Okay, when you say “it wasn’t great, do you mean for both of you? Because we can totally see it not being great for her. Am I right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Oh, yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter To tell you the truth, I think we were both a little, I don’t know…
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Disappointed? Let down?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Ashamed? Horrified? Repulsed?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter All I know is, it wasn’t the way I dreamed it would be.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Sex is never the way I dream it’s gonna be.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 raj_koothrappali That’s because in your dreams you’re a horse from the waist down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, dinner’s here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Tandoori Palace?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter No, we went somewhere new.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper You’re good-naturedly ribbing me, aren’t you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter No, look, Mumbai Palace.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Why? Why would we change? We had a perfectly good palace. Tandoori Palace is our palace.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Trust me, this will be just fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 howard_wolowitz You are the authority on just fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter What’s that supposed to mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Yeah, exactly. Not bad, but not great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 penny What are they talking about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter I don’t know
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I know. As I’m sure you’re aware…
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper If that’s Morse code, that’s terrible. As I was saying, you and Leonard had a disappointing sexual encounter. Earlier this evening, Leonard characterized it as just fine. So what you’re seeing here is a continuation of the mocking that followed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 penny Okay, yeah, well, I’m just gonna go eat my dinner elsewhere. Maybe an airplane headed for a mountainside.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Penny, wait. Aagh! What is wrong with you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I sense I may have crossed some sort of line.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Yeah, you…
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Uh, no, no, no, don’t tell him, let’s see if he can figure it out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 penny Ugh, I am so embarrassed!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Please don’t be mad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 penny What did you tell them?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Nothing bad, just that last night was fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 penny Fine? You said it was fine?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, it’s a perfectly good word. You put it in front of wine or dining, and you’ve really got something. Okay, well, let me ask you this, how was last night for you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 penny It was… okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 penny Yeah, it’s a perfectly good word. I mean, you put it in front of dokay and you really got something. All right, look, let’s not overreact, you know? For a lot of couples, it takes time to get to know each other’s rhythms. Learn what the other person wants and likes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter So, you’ve been through this before?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Okay-dokay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 penny You know, I think this is one of those things where talking about it is not going to make it better. Want a glass of wine?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter So much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 penny Okay. See, we should’ve done this last night, you know, have a little wine, take the edge off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Actually, ethyl alcohol inhibits electrical conduction in the nerve cells and stimulates reuptake receptors of inhibitory neurotransmitters like gamma-aminobutyric acid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 penny Don’t talk, just drink.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 howard_wolowitz No, you’re misunderstanding. A shiksa goddess isn’t an actual goddess and we don’t pray to them, we prey on them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Whatever, dude. The point is, Leonard’s got one and you don’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Is this it? It was inappropriate to discuss Leonard and Penny’s sex life in front of Leonard and Penny. Oh, good! Now I can eat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 raj_koothrappali What’s that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Sounds like a cricket.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Hang on. Based on the number of chirps per minute and the ambient temperature in this room, it is a snowy tree cricket.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Oh, give me a frickin’ break. How could you possibly know that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper In 1890, Emile Dolbear determined that there was a fixed relationship between the number of chirps per minute of the snowy tree cricket and the ambient temperature. A precise relationship that is not present with ordinary field crickets.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 raj_koothrappali How do you know what the exact temperature of the room is?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Under the terms of my roommate agreement with Leonard, I’ve had unilateral control of the thermostat ever since the sweaty night of ’06.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Okay, you were right about Wolverine and bone claws, but you’re wrong about the cricket.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Howard, don’t embarrass yourself, the science chirps for itself. Humorous word play.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 howard_wolowitz No, no, not this time. I know insects, my friend, I spent many childhood years capturing them with nets, putting them in glass jars, sticking pins through them, mounting them on corrugated cardboard with Dymo labels underneath, identifying the genus and species. In Latin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Oh, dude, you are never getting a shiksa goddess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper That is a snowy tree cricket. Oecanthus fultoni. I was done with Latin by fifth grade.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Okay, okay, tell you what. I am willing to bet anything that’s an ordinary field cricket.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I can’t take your money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 howard_wolowitz What’s the matter, you chicken?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I’ve always found that an inappropriate slur. Chickens are not, by nature, at all timid. In fact, when I was young, my neighbour’s chicken got loose and chased me up the big elm tree in front of our house.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Chickens can’t climb trees
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Thank God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Okay, I believe a chicken made you his bitch. But the cricket thing, I don’t buy. Bet me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Fair enough. What stake do you propose?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 howard_wolowitz I will put up my Fantastic Four number 48, first appearance of Silver Surfer against your Flash 123, the classic Flash of two worlds issue.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper All right, you have a wager.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Great. Now how are you going to settle it, hmm? There is no way to determine the species of the cricket without examining it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 raj_koothrappali I wonder what the non-pathetic people are doing tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter More wine?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 penny Hit me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I don’t see anything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Shh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Hallway.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper One at a time. What was that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 raj_koothrappali My stomach. Indian food doesn’t agree with me. Ironic, isn’t it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Shh! Elevator shaft.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Help me open it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Are you crazy? We can’t go down an empty elevator shaft.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Fine, if you don’t want to proceed, then you forfeit the bet, and I’ll take possession of your Fantastic Four.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Let’s open her up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Are you bothered that I can so easily manipulate you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Don’t push me, Sheldon. I may be small, but I took kung fu when I was 13, and I remember a good deal of it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Oh, really? Well, I grew up with an older brother and a very contentious twin sister and I believe I could easily best you in any physical confrontation, be it noogies, swirlies or the classic why are you hitting yourself?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Ooh, big talk from a man who was once treed by a chicken.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter What are we drinking now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 penny Peppermint schnapps.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Why would you buy peppermint schnapps?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 penny Because I like peppermint, and it’s fun to say schnapps. Hey, Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 penny Schnapps.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Schnapps. You’re right, that is fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Be careful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper If I were not being careful, your telling me to be careful would not make me careful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Stairwell.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Uh-oh, flashlight went out. I need some batteries. Fellas? Hello? It’s really dark down here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 penny Oh, sweetie. You really can’t hold your liquor, can you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter I’m okay. Just a little mouthwash, and then I’m gonna rock your world. Are you okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Ugh, Toby, what did you do in a past life to be so disgusting now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper His name isn’t Toby. Toby is an absurd name for a cricket.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 raj_koothrappali What would you name him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper An appropriate cricket name. For example, Jiminy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 howard_wolowitz All right, Sheldon, here we go, Kleingast’s Field Guide to North American Insects. Hey, Toby. Right here, see it? The common field cricket, aka Gryllus assimilis, which is Latin for suck it, you lose.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Hang on. Voilà, the snowy tree cricket, aka Oecanthus fultoni, which is Latin for I’ll suck nothing. Of course I’m joking because the Latin for that is nihil exsorbibo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 howard_wolowitz That is not Toby, this is Toby. Raj, what do you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Oh, I really don’t care anymore
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter God, I had the most horrible night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 raj_koothrappali What happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Obviously another carnal fiasco with the shiksi goddess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Shiksa. Shik-sa.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Forgive me. Yiddish was not spoken in east Texas. And if it was, it wasn’t spoken for long.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Yeah, fine, whatever. The point is, you’re wrong again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper We haven’t established that I’m wrong once.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 howard_wolowitz All right. Tell you what, let’s go down to the Entomology Department and let Professor
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper He’s a snowy tree cricket, and his name is Jiminy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter I bet I could throw a rock in this room and come up with three better friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Holy crap. It’s like Silence of the Lambs down here. Don’t do that!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 howard_wolowitz You’re such a girl. They’re just bugs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Yeah, well, I don’t like bugs, okay? They freak me out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Interesting. You’re afraid of insects and women. Ladybugs must render you catatonic. It was a joke. I made it to lessen your discomfort. You’re welcome
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 professor_crawley Don’t knock. Just walk in. Why be polite to the world’s leading expert on the dung beetle?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Excuse me, are you Professor Crawley?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 professor_crawley Who wants to know?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I’m Dr. Cooper from the Physics Department.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 professor_crawley Couldn’t wait, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I’m sorry?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 professor_crawley I haven’t even packed yet, and you’re already measuring my lab for one of your godless laser machines.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 howard_wolowitz No, you don’t understand. We just want to ask you a question.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 professor_crawley Let me ask you one first. What’s a world renowned entomologist with a doctorate and 20 years of experience to do with his life when the university cuts off the funding for his lab, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Ask rhetorical questions that make people uncomfortable?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 professor_crawley What’s your deal? Are they planning to outsource my job to Bangalore?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 raj_koothrappali I’m from New Delhi. Maybe you should find another entomologist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper No, no. We’re here, let’s settle this. Professor, can you identify our cricket?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 professor_crawley Of course I can. I can identify every insect and arachnid on the planet. Not that that’s going to keep me from having to move in with my daughter in Oxnard. And we’re not talking Oxnard at the beach. No! We’re talking Oxnard in the onion fields.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Well, could you look at Toby?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 professor_crawley Toby? What a stupid name for a cricket.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Told you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 professor_crawley It’s a field cricket.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Yes!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper No, no, wait. Dr. Crawley, are you sure?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 professor_crawley Young man, I’ve been studying insects since I was eight years old. You know what they used to call me in school? Creepy Crawley.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Cruel as that may be, that is not in itself a credential.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 professor_crawley Let me show you something. See that? That’s a Crawley’s dung beetle. I discovered it after spending six months slogging through a Bornean rain forest, while my wife was back home shacking up with a two-bit ornithologist who lives on a sailboat and likes to wear boot-cut jeans! So, when I tell you that that’s a common field cricket, you can take that to the damn bank! Cause God knows I can’t. That tramp took me for everything!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Well, apparently, I was wrong. Congratulations.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Enjoy Oxnard. I’m sure your daughter’s looking forward to having you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 penny Oh, hey, Sheldon. What you got there? A new comic book?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Old comic book. I just retrieved it from my safe deposit box.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 penny What do you have a safe deposit box for?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Old comic books. I lost this to Wolowitz in an ill-considered cricket wager.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 penny What, do they have Wii cricket now? That can’t be very popular.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Penny, I’d rather not talk about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 penny Well, if it makes you feel any better, I’m not feeling so hot either.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Why would that make me feel better?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 penny I don’t know, empathy? Anyway, I’m just saying that you’re feeling upset about something with Howard, and I’m upset about something with Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Yes, yes, the disappointing sex. That’s an inexact parallel. You and Leonard can always return to being friends, whereas I can never return to a state in which Wolowitz has not bested me like Mrs. Riley’s chicken.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 penny What’s Mrs. Riley’s chicken?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper A chicken that was owned by Mrs. Riley.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 penny Okay, forget the chicken.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Well, I wish I could.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 penny No, no. You may be right about me and Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Of course I’m right What are the odds I’d be wrong twice in one week?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 penny No, I mean, we can always go back to being friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I just said that. This conversation has started to circle. Meeting adjourned.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Hey. What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Oh, you’d like to catch up on the events of the day. All right. Well, there was a half-hour wait at the bank to get into my safe deposit box, I was forced to talk to Penny about your sexual problems, and, oh, yes, in a moment filled with biblical resonance, pride wenteth before my fall, causing my Flash 123 to goeth to Wolowitz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Wait a minute. You talked to Penny about our sex life?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Leonard, it astonishes me how you continually fixate on the trivial. I lost a bet to Wolowitz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Right, right. You’re saying you talked to Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Interesting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Hardly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Excuse me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Have I crossed some sort of line again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Little bit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Hmm. Oh, who cares?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 penny Oh, hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Hey. Uh, what did Sheldon say to you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 penny Not a lot. Just that we always have the option of going back to being friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Is that what you want?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 penny I don’t know. I mean, you have to admit things seemed simpler when we were just friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter I guess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 penny It would take the pressure off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter It would, wouldn’t it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 penny So, we’ll just be friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Good, good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 penny Come here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Okay-dokay
