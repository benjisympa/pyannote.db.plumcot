TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon This movie baffles me every time we watch it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 leonard What do you mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon Well, the instructions are very clear, don’t feed the gremlins after midnight, don’t get the gremlins wet. How hard is that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 penny Hi, guys. Hi, honey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 leonard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 howard Ooh, we’re honey now, are we?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon Yes. Since their relationship became carnal, Penny has upgraded his designated term of endearment, thus distinguishing him from those she calls sweetie, usually in an attempt to soften a thinly-veiled insult.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 penny You’re boring people sweetie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon Although, sometimes, she omits the veil entirely.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 penny So, what are you guys doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 howard Celebrating Columbus Day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 leonard We’re watching Goonies, Gremlins and Young Sherlock Holmes. They were all written by Chris Columbus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 penny Okay. What do you watch on Thanksgiving?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon The parade.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 penny Oh, you know, that reminds me, I usually go back to Nebraska for thanksgiving, but this year they’re calling it off on account of my brother’s trial.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 leonard What’s he on trial for?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 penny Oh, just a big misunderstanding. You know, you’d actually like my brother, he’s kind of a chemist. Anyway, I was thinking I’d have thanksgiving here, and you are all invited.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 leonard Oh. I’ll be there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon Will you be serving cranberry jelly or cranberry sauce?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 penny I guess I could serve both.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon You guess? You don’t seem to have much of a handle on this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 howard Yeah, I really wish I could, Penny, but every year my mother has all the relatives over and cooks up her famous tur-briska-fil.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 penny Tur-briska-fil?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 howard Turkey stuffed with a brisket stuffed with gefilte fish. It’s not as good as it sounds.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 penny Raj, what about you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 howard Oh, he usually comes to my house. Right, pal? All right, this year, you don’t have to eat the tur-briska-fil. I don’t even chew it. I swallow it like pills.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 leonard So, what’s going on with Raj?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 howard Well, the good news is, he has no problem with my mother’s tur-brka-fil.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 penny Hard to believe, but go on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 howard The bad news is, he says he’s getting deported.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 leonard What do you mean, he’s getting deported?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon I believe it means that the U.S. Government is going to expel him from the country. He could then either return to his native India, emigrate to another country that’s willing to accept him, or wander the high seas as a stateless pirate. Personally, I’d choose pirate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 howard Penny, would you mind stepping outside so we can speak to him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 penny Ugh, fine. But the man really needs to work on his girl issues.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon Another reason to consider a life of piracy. Even today, I understand that’s an all-male profession.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 howard Okay, she’s gone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj Sorry. I lost my cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 leonard So, what’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj Okay, here’s the deal, six months ago, my research testing the predicted composition of trans-Neptunian objects ran into a dead end.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 howard So?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj So, my visa’s only good as long as I’m employed at the university, and when they find out I’ve got squat, they’re going to cut me off. By the way, when I say squat, I mean diddly-squat. I wish I had squat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 leonard So, wait, what have you been doing for the past six months?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj You know, checking e-mail, updating my facebook status, messing up wikipedia entries. Hey, did you know Netflix lets you stream movies on your computer now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon And you’ve continued to take the university’s money under false pretences? Highly unethical for an astrophysicist. Although practically mandatory for a pirate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj I don’t want to go back to India. It’s hot and loud, and there’s so many people. You have no idea, they’re everywhere.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 howard Okay, guys, think, how do we keep Raj in the country?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 penny Why doesn’t he just get another job?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 howard What are you asking me for? I don’t know if you can talk now or not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj Oh, beef, I’m going to miss you so much. Do you know, at the Mumbai McDonald’s, you can’t get a Big Mac? All you can get is a Chicken Maharaja Mac. And the special sauce, curry, which, in India,
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 leonard Don’t worry, you’ll find another job.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj Yeah let me start practicing for it. Do you want fries with that Maharaja Mac?”
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon Hi, Leonard. Hello, Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj Hello Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon Forgive me, as you know, I’m no adept at reading facial cues, but I’m going to take a stab here, you’re either sad or nauseated.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj I’m sad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon I was going to say sad. I don’t know why I hedged.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj What are you eating?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon Elbow macaroni with ground hamburger and tomato sauce.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj Oh, beefaroni. I think I’ll miss you most of all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 leonard I’ve always been a little confused about this. Why don’t Hindus eat beef?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj We believe cows are gods.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon Not technically. In Hinduism, cattle are thought to be like God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj Do not tell me about my own culture, Sheldon! In the mood I’m in, I’ll take you out, I swear to cow!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon I’m sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj Me, too. I’m just, I’m a little on edge.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon Understandable. Your entire life seems to be crumbling around you, and your future appears bleak at best.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon And you’re wrong about Hinduism and cows.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 howard Hey, Raj, guess what. Professor Laughlin is looking for someone to join the stellar evolution research team.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj You, you’re kidding. That’s fantastic!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 howard Come on, what are you waiting for? Call him and set up an interview.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj I’m on it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon That’s happy, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 leonard Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon Nailed it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 prof_laughlin Dr. Koothrappali, come on in. I was surprised to hear you were interested In joining our little team. Giving up on those trans-Neptunian objects, are we?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj No, no, it’s a very promising area. In a perfect world I’d spend several more years on it. But I just couldn’t pass up the opportunity to work with you on your tremendously exciting and not yet conclusively disproved hypothesis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 prof_laughlin Splendid. Uh, please sit down. Can I offer you a sherry?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj It’s a little early, isn’t it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 prof_laughlin Not on Proxima Centauri.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj That’s very good. Jolly amusing, but if you don’t mind, I’ll hold off until sunset on titan.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 prof_laughlin Oh, well done. I have a feeling you’re going to fit in just fine, Dr. Koothrappali.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj Thank you, sir. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 woman I’m sorry. Am I late?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 prof_laughlin No, no, no. Right on time. Dr. Koothrappali, may I present Dr. Millstone from MIT. She’ll be heading up our data analysis team.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 dr_millstone It’s nice to meet you, Dr. Koothrappali. I read your paper on Kuiper belt object size distribution. I really enjoyed it. How did you correct for the selection bias? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj Well, I ran a simulation that allowed me to correct for the observational efficiency.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 dr_millstone That’s just fascinating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj Thank you. Would you like to hear more about it in my hot tub? So, when do I start?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 howard What do you mean you didn’t get the job? How could you not get it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj You know, he’s British, I’m Indian, ever since Gandhi they haven’t liked us very much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 leonard Wait, are you saying that he discriminated against you? Because we should file a complaint.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj That’s okay. A complaint has been filed. So, that’s it. That was my last hope. I’m going to be deported, sent home in disgrace, exposed to the sardonic barbs of my cousin Sanjay. Or, as you may know him, Dave from AT&T customer service.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 howard I’m really going to miss you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj Will you come visit me in India?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 howard Gee, that’s, like, a 17-hour flight. How about I meet you halfway?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj Halfway is 600 miles off the coast of Japan.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 howard Tell you what, we’ll skype.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon Gentlemen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 leonard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon Raj, did you get the job with Professor Laughlin?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon I assumed as much. But never fear. Like the subordinate male protagonist in countless action movies who disappears half way through the second reel, I have returned to save the day. Odd, usually, he’s met by cheers. Anyway, I was thinking about exploring the string theory implications of gamma rays from dark matter annihilations, and it occurred to me that I could benefit…
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 leonard Excuse me, Sheldon, how many reels before the subordinate male protagonist gets to his point?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon I’m sorry, if you didn’t cheer at my entrance, it’s too late to buy into the premise. Anyway, I got some extra money from the head of the department, and raj can come work for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj You want me to work with you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon For me. You’re going to have to listen more carefully when you’re on the job.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj Okay, uh, please don’t take this the wrong way, but I’d rather swim buck-naked across the Ganges with a paper cut on my nipple and die a slow, agonizing death from a viral infection than work with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon For me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj Sheldon, are you busy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon Of course I’m busy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj Shall I wait?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon Yes, please. How may I help you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj I’ve reconsidered your offer to let me work with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon For me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj Yes, for you. I do, however, have a few conditions. First, at all times, I am to be treated as a colleague and an equal. Second, my contributions shall be noted in all published material. And third, you are never allowed to lecture me on Hinduism or my Indian culture.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon I’m impressed, Raj. Those are very cogent and reasonable conditions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon I reject them all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj Then you leave me no choice. I accept the job.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon I’m sorry, I believe you’ve misunderstood. I’m not giving you the job. I’m simply affording you the opportunity to apply for it. Have a seat, we’ll get started with the interview.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj Wha… You’re kidding!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon Please.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon So, that’s what you wear to an interview?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj Come on, dude, we’ve been friends for years.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon Oh, pulling strings, are we?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj Sheldon, for God’s sakes, don’t make me beg.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon Bazinga! You’ve fallen victim to another one of my classic practical jokes. I’m your boss now. You may want to laugh at that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 penny Ah, it’s nice having the place to ourselves, isn’t it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 leonard Uh-huh. Now that Raj is working for Sheldon, I don’t have to chauffeur him around anymore. Plus, yeah, with them working late so much, we get some privacy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 penny Mm-hmm. Hey, want to get a little crazy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 leonard What are you thinking?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 penny Let’s slide over to Sheldon’s spot a make out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 leonard You are a dirty girl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 penny Oh, God, how did he know?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 howard Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 leonard Hi, Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 howard Am I interrupting?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 leonard Little bit, yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 howard Guess I should have called.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 penny Yeah, maybe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 howard Tonight’s the night I usually go line dancing with Raj at the palomino.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 leonard Uh-huh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 howard But he’s working with Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 penny Yes, we know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 howard Want me to leave?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 leonard You know, whatever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 howard Okay, I guess I can hang for a little while. So what are we watching? Sex and the city.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 penny Hey, I happen to love this movie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 howard Fine, let’s watch it. Maybe all our periods will synchronize.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon All right, we’re going to be designing an experiment to look for the annihilation spectrum resulting from dark matter collisions in space.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj Ooh, dark matter. We better bring a flashlight. I was making a joke.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon I’m the boss. I make the jokes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj Sorry, go ahead and make your joke.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon This is not the time for joking. We’re doing serious research, which requires complete and utter focus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj All right, let’s buckle down and work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj I need an aspirin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon Top desk drawer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon Alright?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon Good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 leonard That was fun. Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 penny Leonard, honey, you don’t have to say thank you every time we have sex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 leonard Oh. Okay. Tomorrow you’re going to get a card in the mail. Just throw it away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 howard Top o’ the mornin’o ya!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 leonard What are you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 howard Well, usually, on Sundays, I go with Raj to scam on hippie chicks at the farmers market, but he’s still working with Sheldon, so I thought I’d come over here and make you guys scrambled eggs and salami. It’s the perfect meal for apres l’amour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 penny Oh, kill me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 howard By the way, I couldn’t help overhearing your big finish. Bravo, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 penny See, if you had killed me when I said kill me, I wouldn’t have had to hear that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 howard What do you guys think? Want to take in a matinee, maybe go rollerblading, catch a step class?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 penny Do something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 leonard Yeah, okay. Um, Howard, we need to talk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 howard Sure. ‘sup, homes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 leonard Uh, please understand that it’s not that we don’t want you around, but Penny and I occasionally need some alone time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 howard Oh. I get it, I’m the third wheel. Sorry, I should have seen that. I’ll get out of your way. Uh, you’re gonna want to eat those eggs while they’re still hot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 leonard Thank you. There’s lox and cream cheese in the fridge, the bagels are in the oven, I was warming them up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 penny That’s great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 howard Ill just hang out with my mom. That’s always fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 leonard Good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 penny Are we terrible people?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 leonard I don’t know. What do you want me to do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 penny Get him, bring him back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 leonard Are you sure?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 penny Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 leonard Okay. Howard come back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 howard Oh, you guys had me scared for a minute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj No, no, no, no! That rate is much too low for what we’d expect from this collision. Do you understand that we’re talking about dark matter colliding in outer space?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon Of course I understand. And who are you to tell me about outer space?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj I’m the astrophysicist. Astro means space.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon Astro means star.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj Okay, well, let me just tell you, if we were having this argument in my native language, I’d be kicking your butt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon English is your native language.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj Okay, you got me there, but you’re wrong about this!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon There is a fine line between wrong and visionary. Unfortunately you have to be a visionary to see it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj My god, you think that every thought that comes out of your head is pure gold. Well, let me tell you something. Some of those thoughts are pure caca.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon Caca?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj It means doo-doo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon All right! First of all, Dr. Koothrappali, when I first proposed that you work with me…
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj Aha! So I am working with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon In this context, with me means for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj Ah, well, in this context… 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon Oh! If I’m wrong, prove it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj Okay. Here’s where we derive the mass of the dark matter particle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon No, no, no, you’ve misstated the atomic weight of the target.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj Let me finish.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon You’re defacing my work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj I’m not defacing it, I’m fixing it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon Give me the eraser.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon I said give it to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj Come and get it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon Fine. Oh, lord. Dr. Koothrappali, as your superior, I forbid you from writing on my board!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj You are not my superior.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon I am in every way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj Oh, yeah? Can you do this? Nice working with you. I’m sorry, for you. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon Raj. Raj. Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj I’m busy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon Doing what? All right, you’ve made your point.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj What do you want, Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon I looked over the board and it turns out you were right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj So you were wrong.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon I didn’t say that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj That’s the only logical inference.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon Nevertheless, I didn’t say it. Anyway, I would like you to come back and work for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj For you or with you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon In this context for me could mean with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj All right, but I have some conditions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon I reject them all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj I’ll take the job. See you Monday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon Wait, you have to drive me home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj How did you get here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon I walked.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj So walk home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 sheldon I can’t. There’s a big dog outside. On the way home, we can start thinking about methods of optimizing the detector for 500 GEV particles.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode04 raj All right.
