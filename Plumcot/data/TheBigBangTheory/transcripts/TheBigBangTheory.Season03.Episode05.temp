TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 howard All right, Raj has played his phantom warlord card, and I am going to back him up with my strangling vines. Choke on that, sucka.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 leonard Okay, well, then I’ll just cut your vines with my ruby sword. That’s right, I did it. I cut ’em.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 penny Um, I have a question.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 leonard Warlord beats troll, troll beats elf, elf beats water sprite, and basically everything beats enchanted bunny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 howard Unless you have the carrot power.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 penny Okay, I’ve got another question. When does this get fun?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 howard Are we going to talk or are we going to play Mystic Warlords of Ka-ah?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 leonard Just play a potion card.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 penny Which one?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 sheldon It doesn’t matter. You can’t possibly win.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 leonard Sheldon, don’t ruin the game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 penny How could he ruin the game?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 sheldon Given the cards that have already been played, Penny can only be holding necromancer potions, which are only effective against wraiths and day-walkers, and there are no more of either left to be drawn. The cards remaining in the undrawn stack are four fire weapons, a troll, two ogres and the jewel of Osiris.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 leonard See? Ruined.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 penny Sheldon, that is incredible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 sheldon From your vantage point, it certainly must seem so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 leonard Sheldon has kind of a photographic memory.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 sheldon Photographic is a misnomer. I have an eidetic memory, as I’ve told you many times. Most recently last year during lunch on the afternoon of may seventh. You had turkey and complained it was dry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 howard Well, I guess game’s over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 penny Really? Oh, great. I mean, aw. Okay, I gotta go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 leonard Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 penny Because the last me I didn’t go, I ended up playing Mystic Warlords of Ka.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 howard Not Ka. Ka-ah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 penny Ba-eye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 leonard See ya. Still can’t believe she’s going out with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 raj Nobody can.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 howard That reminds me, I have a bone to pick with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 howard You and I made a pact that if either of us ever got a hot girlfriend, that person would have his girlfriend hook the other guy up with one of her girlfriends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 leonard Yeah, I don’t remember that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 sheldon June 30th, 2004. Opening day of Spider-man 2 at the AMC Pasadena. They only had red icees, no blue.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 leonard Oh, yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 howard So you’ve been with Penny for like a month and a half now. Where’s my shorty, Morty?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 leonard Howard, you can’t hold me to that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 howard Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 leonard Because when I made that agreement, I didn’t think I’d ever have a hot girlfriend. And I was positive you never would.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 raj Hey, how come I wasn’t part of this deal?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 sheldon You had left the refreshment stand in order to indulge in your customary preemptive pre-show urination.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 raj Oh, so that’s how it works? I have a teeny bladder and now I don’t get a hot girlfriend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 howard Yeah, Raj, that’s how it works.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 raj Damn.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 leonard Oh, damn it. Can I have a napkin?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 sheldon I’m sorry, no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 leonard But you have a whole bunch of ’em.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 sheldon Yes, I’ve moved to a four-napkin system. Lap, hands, face and personal emergencies. If you like, starting tomorrow, I’ll add a guest napkin, but I’m afraid there’s nothing I can do for you today. Good luck. That’s the face napkin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 howard So, have you talked to Penny yet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 leonard No, I haven’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 howard Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 leonard Because I’ve been busy, because I haven’t figured out a way to bring it up, and mostly, and I can’t stress how key this is, because I don’t want to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 howard Leonard, a pact is a pact. You have to get Penny to fix me up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 leonard It’s not that simple. What am I supposed to say? Penny, do you have any friends you’d like to never hear from again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 howard Come on, I’m smart, I have good job and I have only three percent body fat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 raj It’s true. I’ve seen him at the beach, he’s like a human chicken wing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 howard Leonard, come on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 leonard Fine. I’ll ask if she has a friend for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 howard A hot friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 leonard Right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 howard And tall. I want our kids to be able to ride space mountain before they’re 20.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 leonard I’ll see what I can do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 raj Hey, Sheldon, guess what I heard today?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 sheldon I’d imagine you heard any number of things today. When you arrived at work you undoubtedly heard, hello, Raj, how are you, Raj? Given that you’re wearing a new sweater-vest, you may have heard new sweater-vest? And possibly, though far less likely, nice sweater-vest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 raj Why don’t I just tell you what I heard today.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 sheldon That would probably save us some time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 raj Saturday night at the comic book store, they’re having a Mystic Warlords of Ka-ah tournament. First prize is five hundred dollars. If we team up, we’d be unstoppable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 sheldon I’m sorry, Raj, but I have no interest in playing a game in which I find no challenge.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 raj What about the money?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 sheldon I have money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 raj But this is other money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 sheldon How does it different from the money I have?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 raj Half of it will be mine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 sheldon Do you need it to buy a less disturbing sweater-vest?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 raj Leonard, help.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 leonard Are you kidding? I couldn’t even talk him into giving me one of his freakin’ napkins.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 penny Wow, you really are a genius.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 leonard Not really. I googled how to do that. So, listen, have you ever made a pact with someone?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 penny You mean, like a pinky swear?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 leonard Okay, fine, like a pinky swear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 penny Well, in the first grade, my friend Rosie and I made a pact to marry Bert and Ernie. You know, from Sesame Street?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 leonard Yeah, I’m familiar with Bert and Ernie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 penny Then we found out we both wanted Ernie. We didn’t speak again until middle school.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 leonard Over puppets?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 penny The heart wants what the heart wants, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 leonard Okay. Speaking of what the heart wants, um, a long time ago, I made a pact with Wolowitz that kind of involves you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 penny Okay, I don’t know where you’re going with this, but tread carefully because it may be the last conversation we ever have.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 leonard No, no, nothing like that. The deal was that if either of us ever got a girlfriend, we’d have her fix the other one up with one of her friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 penny And you thought a good time to bring this up be right after sex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 leonard Well, I sure as hell wasn’t going to bring it up before sex, and during, I was trying to remember what I read on google, so…
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 penny I’m not hooking Wolowitz up with one of my friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 leonard Come on, it doesn’t have to be a good friend. And you know that deep down inside, Howard’s a really nice guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 penny The problem isn’t what’s on the inside. It’s the creepy candy coating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 leonard Will you at least think about it? Just as a favour to me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 penny Oh, great thing about Ernie, was he never asked me for anything. He just gave.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 sheldon Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Betty and Veronica? Ugh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 stuart Hey, Sheldon, the new Green Lantern figurine’s coming in tomorrow. Want me to set one aside for you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 sheldon Thank you. You just robbed me of the opportunity to stumble upon the figurine and make the oh-so-satisfying journey from discovery to desire to possession.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 stuart All right, I won’t set one aside for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 sheldon But I must have it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 stuart Okay, I’ll set one aside for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 sheldon Thank you. You know, I can buy all these things online. I come here for the personal service.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 raj Hey, Stuart, is the Wil Wheaton signed up for the mystic warlords tournament THE Wil Wheaton from Star Trek?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 stuart Yeah, he lives around here. Big gamer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 sheldon Excuse me. Are you saying that Wil Wheaton aka Ensign Wesley Crusher on Star Trek:
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 stuart Oh, I’m sorry, did I rob you of the opportunity to stumble onto that for yourself?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 sheldon You don’t understand. Growing up, I idolized Wil Wheaton? Wesley Crusher had an eidetic memory just like me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 raj Oh, what a coincidence. Maybe you can discuss that with him while you’re playing in the tournament. Sign here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 sheldon I was such a fan that in 1995, I travelled ten hours by bus to a sci-fi convention in Jackson, Mississippi, wearing my Star Fleet Academy cadet uniform in order to meet Wil Wheaton and get him to autograph my mint in-package Wesley Crusher action figure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 raj Ooh, it’ll be like a reunion then. Sign here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 sheldon My arduous journey, however, was for naught. Although advertised to appear, he did not show up. It was at that moment, I vowed eternal hatred for Wil Wheaton.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 raj Okay, great, you can tell him you hate him. Sign here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 sheldon It might also interest you to know that Wil Wheaton currently ranks sixth on my all-time enemies list, right between director Joel Schumacher, who nearly destroyed the Batman movie franchise, and Billy Sparks, who lived down the street from me and put dog poop on the handles of my bicycle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 raj Okay, I get it, he’s a bad guy. Sign here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 sheldon In the words of Khan Noonien Singh in the immortal wrath of Khan, he tasks me, he tasks me and I shall have him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 raj No doubt, sign here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 sheldon From hell’s heart, I stab at thee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 stuart All right, Raj, looks like you’re teamed up with die, Wil Wheaton, die.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 howard So, tell me more about the future mother of my children.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 penny She’s adorable, Howard. I think you’ll like her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 howard Great. So what did you tell her about me? Did you mention the body fat?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 penny No, I thought that would be a nice surprise for her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 howard Good, good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 penny I just told her you’re an aerospace engineer, you speak five languages…
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 howard Six if you count Klingon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 leonard Girls don’t count Klingon, Howard. Right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 penny Right. Oh, and I told her you have an unhealthy attachment to your mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 howard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 penny I’m kidding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 leonard Another delightful surprise for her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 raj Sheldon, it’s your play. Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 sheldon My enchanted troll bludgeons your screaming harpy with a cursed mace. Game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 raj Sorry, boys. Say hi to your mother when she picks you up. Or I could just tell her later tonight! We pwned them, dude! Up top!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 sheldon Look at him. Wil Wheaton, my old friend, I have chased you round the moons of Nibia and round the Antares maelstrom and round perdition’s flames!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 raj You know you keep quoting Wrath of Khan, but he was in next generation. It’s a totally different set of characters.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 sheldon Silence! How much longer must I wait for my revenge?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 raj Well, if Wil Wheaton and Stuart win their match and we beat lonely Larry and Captain Sweatpants in the next round, we’ll face off for the championship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 sheldon So, my path to satisfaction is blocked by lonely Larry and Captain Sweatpants. Very well. They must be destroyed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 raj Dude, you have to stop talking like that. It’s really lame.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 sheldon Silence!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 howard So, Penny tells me you’re working as a waitress to put yourself through grad school. That’s pretty great, what are you studying?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 bernadette Microbiology.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 howard Oh, cool. So you could study me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 bernadette I don’t understand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 howard Microbiology is the study of tiny living things.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 bernadette I know, I’m studying it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 howard And I said you could study me ’cause I’m a tiny living thing. It’s a joke.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 bernadette Are you sure?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 howard Do you like science-fiction?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 bernadette No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 howard Role-playing games?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 bernadette Like in the bedroom or like Dungeons and Dragons?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 howard Either.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 bernadette No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 leonard Gonna be a long night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 penny Yeah, well, it’s your fault.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 leonard I had to ask. You didn’t have to say yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 howard You like magic?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 bernadette Not really.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 howard Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 leonard Long, long night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 sheldon I play my endless serpent. Raj will play ecstatic frenzy, which means Larry will have to play chaos overlord, then Captain Sweatpants, molten river. I play nightshade dryad, game, set and match. Now fetch me Wil Wheaton! bortaS bIr jablu’DI’ reH QaQqu’ nay’
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 wil_wheaton Did that guy just say revenge is a dish best served cold in Klingon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 stuart I believe so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 wil_wheaton What is wrong with him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 stuart Everyone has a different theory.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 howard How about computers? Do you like computers?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 bernadette I use them. I don’t like them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 howard Okay… Puppies? Where do you stand on puppies?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 bernadette A puppy once bit my face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 howard Of course it did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 leonard How about that? Einstein was wrong.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 leonard Approaching the speed of light doesn’t slow down time. Approaching them does.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 howard Excuse me. Oh, damn. It’s my mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 bernadette Are you going to answer it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 howard I’m torn. She might be dying, and, you know, I wouldn’t want to miss that. On the other hand, if I let it go to voicemail, I could play it over and over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 bernadette I know how you feel. My mother makes me crazy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 howard Not as crazy as my mother makes me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 bernadette Oh, yeah? Does your mother call you every day at work to see if you’ve had a healthy lunch?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 howard My mother calls me at work to see if I had a healthy bowel movement.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 bernadette Okay, well, does she lay out your clothes for you in the morning like you’re nine years old?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 howard You live with your mother?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 bernadette No. That’s the sad part.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 howard Ooh, rough. Okay, check this out. My mother made me wear rubber gloves to kindergarten so I wouldn’t pick up a disease from the other children.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 bernadette That’s nothing. I couldn’t ride a bicycle ’cause my mother was afraid I’d hit a bump and lose my virginity.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 howard Oh, wow. You didn’t, did you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 bernadette Not on a bicycle. In a Camry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 howard Corolla!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 bernadette Oh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 howard More wine?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 bernadette I’d love some.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 howard Listen, you have to come to shabbat dinner at my house sometime.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 bernadette Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 howard A catholic girl like you wearing a big cross like that might just give my mother the big brain aneurysm I’ve been hoping for.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 bernadette Okay, but only if you come to Sunday dinner at my house wearing a yarmulke.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 howard It’s a date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 penny Am I a matchmaker or what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 raj Lava serpent.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 stuart Nest of snakes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 wil_wheaton Underworld guardian.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 sheldon Underworld guardian. We skirmish to the death.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 wil_wheaton Invisibility spell.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 sheldon Luminescence spell.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 wil_wheaton Water nymph.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 sheldon Fire demon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 wil_wheaton Two-headed tiger.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 sheldon Three-headed lion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 wil_wheaton Sulphur.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 sheldon Brimstone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 raj Problem, Wil Wheaton?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 wil_wheaton Hang on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 sheldon You’re holding two moderate spell cards, a small rock and a potion of Zancor, which will be about as much help as an air conditioner on the ice planet Hoth. Your only move is to play the potion, lose the skirmish, and two moves later, the game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 wil_wheaton I think he’s got me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 sheldon The year was 1995, the place, Jackson, Mississippi. Having spent ten hours on a bus, during which I had to twice violate my personal rule against relieving myself on board a moving vehicle, I finally arrived at the fourth annual Dixie-Trek convention only to find that my idol Wil Wheaton decided he had better things to do than to show up and sign my action figure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 wil_wheaton What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 sheldon You betrayed me, Wil Wheaton. Now I have my revenge.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 wil_wheaton You went to the ’95 Dixie-Trek? Oh, dude, my grandmother had just died, and I had to go to her funeral.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 sheldon Your mee-maw died? That’s terrible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 wil_wheaton Yeah, it was. But I’m really sorry that I disappointed you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 sheldon No, no, I understand. Anything happened to my mee-maw, I’d be one inconsolable moon pie. I should clarify that statement by explaining that she calls me moon pie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 wil_wheaton It’s special relationship, isn’t it, between a boy and his grandmother?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 sheldon Oh, yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 raj Okay, great, everybody loves their grandmas! Now, come on, Sheldon, finish him off!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 wil_wheaton It’s okay, Sheldon. I let you down. I deserve it. Potion of Zancor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 raj What are you waiting for? Kill Wil Wheaton! From hell’s heart, stab at him!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 sheldon I can’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 raj Sure you can. Do it! Do it!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 sheldon No. I came here to defeat Wil Wheaton, the man who destroyed my dreams. But I can’t defeat Wil Wheaton, the man who loved his mee-maw. Enchanted bunny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 raj No! Not enchanted bunny!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 wil_wheaton I call my mee-maw nana. And she’s going be very happy to hear that my small rock kills your enchanted bunny. Game over, moon pie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 sheldon I… I… I don’t understand. Your grandmother’s alive?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 wil_wheaton Oh, you catch on quick. Come on, Stewie, let’s get our prize money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 stuart That was fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode05 sheldon Wheaton! Wheaton! Wheaton!
