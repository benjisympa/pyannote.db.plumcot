TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Kites, ho!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 howard_wolowitz Kites ho!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 raj_koothrappali Kites ho!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 all_three#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 Kites, ho!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Excuse me. You’re misusing the word ho. It’s an interjection used to call attention to a destination, not an object, as in, uh, Land, ho! Or, uh, Westward, ho!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 the_three_guys#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 Kites, ho!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 penny Hey, guys. What you doing? Going out to discover electricity?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter If you’re referring to the work of Benjamin Franklin, he did not discover electricity, he merely used a kite to determine that lightning consists of electricity. He also invented the Franklin stove, bifocals and the flexible urinary catheter. Kites, ho.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter We’re heading out for some kite fighting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 penny Kite fighting?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Oh, yeah. It’s an extremely competitive, cutthroat sport.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Well, actually, the risk of throat cutting is very low. On the other hand, severe string burn is a real and ever-Present danger.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter You want to come watch?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 penny Oh, gee, sounds amazing, but, um, I’ve got some friends coming over. Not a big thing, we’re just gonna watch the Nebraska game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Oh. Football, sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 howard_wolowitz Good guess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 penny I would’ve invited you, but I know you’re not a football fan.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter No, no, I’m not, so, great. You’ve got plans doing something you like, I’ve got plans doing something I like, so it’s good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 penny Well, maybe we’ll hang out later, you know, after everybody’s gone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 penny See ya.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Well, this sucks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 sheldon_cooper I’m sorry, I got bored and drifted off. Where exactly in the interaction did the sucking lie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 raj_koothrappali Leonard just realized that Penny’s been hiding him from her friends because he’s a tiny, little man who flies kites.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Oh, that certainly would suck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Wolowitz is trying to outflank us. Let out some string, add altitude and I’ll go under and cut his line.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Why wouldn’t Penny want her friends to meet me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Focus, Leonard, focus! The heat of battle is upon us, the dogs of war are unleashed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Maybe Koothrappali’s right, maybe I embarrass her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 sheldon_cooper You’re embarrassing me right now, a grown man worrying about such nonsense when in the middle of flying kites.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Sorry won’t bring their kites down. Ow! String burn! String burn!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 raj_koothrappali Oh, they think we’re flanking, they’re playing right into our hands. On the count of three, we execute the flying scissor. One, two…
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 howard_wolowitz Whoa! Did you see that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 raj_koothrappali See what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 howard_wolowitz That chick, she smiled at me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 raj_koothrappali No, she didn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 howard_wolowitz Yes, she did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 raj_koothrappali Come on, scissors, scissors!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 howard_wolowitz Hold my line.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 raj_koothrappali Wait, what are you doing? I can’t scissors by myself! Howard! Come back!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Victory!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 raj_koothrappali Son of a bitch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 raj_koothrappali You’re a sucky friend, you know that? A sucky, sucky friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 howard_wolowitz What was I supposed to do? She gave me that come-hither look.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 raj_koothrappali If she gave you any look at l. It was a you suck look.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 howard_wolowitz I would’ve caught up to her if I hadn’t pulled a hammy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 raj_koothrappali Oh, please, you weigh 80 pounds. You don’t have a hammy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter So, Penny doesn’t want me around her friends, I embarrass her. What else could it be?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Well, her actions could be out of concern for your feelings. Perhaps she’s excluded you from these gatherings because she’s scouting for a new mate and doesn’t want to do it in front of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Oh, how kind of her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Agreed. Most primates don’t show that sort of discretion. A female bonobo will copulate with a new male in front of the old one without so much as a how do you do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 raj_koothrappali You always do this, you know? You ditch me for a woman you don’t have a shot with.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 howard_wolowitz I totally had a shot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 raj_koothrappali With a woman you were chasing through a park? That’s not a shot, that’s a felony. What’s worse, it cost me my prized Patang fighting kite. Sheldon, I don’t suppose there’s any chance you could give me my kite back?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 sheldon_cooper I’m sorry, Raj, but the rules of aerial warfare dictate at the fallen kite go to the victor. And without rules, the competition has no meaning. And without meaning, the following would be an empty gesture. I have your kite. I have your kite.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 penny Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter How was your football party?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 penny It was pretty good. We won.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Oh, that’s excellent. It’s a weird figure of speech, isn’t it, we won when you weren’t
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 penny I’m glad to hear it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Oh, hey, on a related subject, are you embarrassed to have me around your friends?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 penny Oh, my god, no. Why would you ask that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Well, you know, I just noticed I haven’t really met any of them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 penny Sure you have.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Well, yeah, no, I met the huge ex-boyfriend and the smaller yet still larger than me ex-boyfriend. Were they here today?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 penny Of course not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Of course not. Why would they be? Why would I ask? Why am I rambling? Why don’t you stop me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 penny Leonard, look, if you want to meet my friends, that would be great. I just, you know, I didn’t want you to be bored.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter I wouldn’t be bored. Why would I be bored?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 penny Well, ’cause they’re not genius scientists.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Penny, I like all sorts of people. In fact, some of my best friends aren’t geniuses.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 penny Like who?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Okay, some of my Facebook friends aren’t geniuses. My point is, if we’re going to be a couple, I should be friends with your friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 penny Okay, great. Well, then why don’t you come over next Saturday and watch the game with us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Another football game?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 penny They have them every week.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Did not know that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 penny You wanted to meet my friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Sure, sure, just I don’t know much about football.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 penny Oh, that’s okay, a lot of the guys’ girlfriends don’t know football. They just kind of drink and talk in the kitchen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Okay, a complete pass. First down, New England. I think I’m starting to get this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 raj_koothrappali Really? The only thing I’ve learned in the last two hours is that American men love drinking beer, pee too often and have trouble getting erections.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Focus on the game, not the commercials, Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 raj_koothrappali I’m just saying, maybe if you people cut back on the beer, you could get out of the bathroom and satisfy your women without pharmaceutical help.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 howard_wolowitz Raj, what are you doing here? You were supposed to help me pimp out my Vespa.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 raj_koothrappali I’m sorry, are you under the impression that we’re still friends?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 howard_wolowitz Oh come on, you’re not still grinding on the kite thing, are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 raj_koothrappali It’s not just the kite thing. Every time we go some place, you think you can just dump me whenever someone prettier comes along, even though you don’t have a shot with them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 howard_wolowitz But I had a shot with that jogger.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 raj_koothrappali Fine. Paint green flames on your little scooter with her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 howard_wolowitz It’s not a little scooter. It’s the second biggest Vespa they make! Are you watching football?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter There’s no fooling you. Now, what is this sacks statistic they put up there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 howard_wolowitz All I know about Saks is, my mother shops there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Sacks, sacks…
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 sheldon_cooper It’s football nomenclature for when a quarterback is tackled behind the line of scrimmage.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Huh… Scrimmage…
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 sheldon_cooper The line of scrimmage is the imaginary transverse line separating the offence from the defence.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 howard_wolowitz Sheldon knows football?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Apparently.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 howard_wolowitz I mean, Quidditch, sure. But football?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, how do you know this stuff?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 sheldon_cooper I grew up in Texas. Football is ubiquitous in Texas. Pro football, college football, high school football, peewee football, in fact, every form of football except the original, European football, which most Texans believe to be a Commie plot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Unbelievable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 sheldon_cooper If you’re interested, I also know all about frying meat that isn’t chicken as if it were chicken.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter So you could teach me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Football or chicken-fried meats?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Football. I’m going to Penny’s on Saturday to watch a game with her friends and I don’t want to look like an idiot. I want to blend in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 sheldon_cooper If you want to blend in with Penny’s friends, I’d think looking like an idiot would be the perfect camouflage.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Come on, Sheldon, please teach me about football. It’ll be fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 sheldon_cooper That’s exactly what my father said. Come to the games, watch the games, week in and week out from the time I was five until I went off to college. Longest seven years of my life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Please, I’m asking you as a friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Are you making this a tier one friendship request?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter I really appreciate this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Yeah, yeah. All right, Poindexter, sit down, shut up and listen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter I’m sorry?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 sheldon_cooper That’s how my father always began our football conversations. And if you’d like, after the game, I’ll take you outside and teach you how to shoot close enough to a racoon that it craps itself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter When are you going to stop making Cylon toast?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 sheldon_cooper When I have enough to destroy all the human toast on the battlestar known as Galactica. Is that what you’re wearing to watch football at Penny’s?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter What’s wrong with a football jersey?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Nothing. That, however, appears to be a football cocktail dress.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter I’s the smallest size they had, except the one for dogs. I can’t believe they had one for dogs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Oh, yes. Canine football fans are a common sight in Texas. Cats, however, refuse to wear sporting apparel. My sister found that out the hard way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Anyway, wish me luck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Leonard, wait. Am I correct in assuming that your attempt to be accepted by Penny’s peers is based on your desire to ensure your continuing mating privileges with her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Well, I wouldn’t put it exactly that way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 sheldon_cooper How would you put it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, okay, like you said.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Huh. Seems like an awful lot of trouble to go through for intercourse. Don’t you have access to women who will do it for money? By the way, another accepted usage for the term ho.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Good-Bye, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Hold on I believe that social convention dictate you not arrive empty-Handed. Would you like to bring some Cylon toast?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, no, I’m trying to fit in, not get laughed at.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 sheldon_cooper What’s funny about Cylon toast?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 raj_koothrappali It’s open.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 howard_wolowitz Hey, pal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 raj_koothrappali What do you want?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 howard_wolowitz I brought you a little gift. New kite.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 raj_koothrappali The kite you made me lose was an authentic Patang, an Indian fighting kite that my brother sent to me from New Delhi. It took me a day to put together and two days to paint. This is Hello Kitty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 howard_wolowitz Yeah, but it comes with a little coin purse. Does a Patang?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 raj_koothrappali Wow, you just don’t get it, do you? Buying me something pretty isn’t going to make our problem just go away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 howard_wolowitz Look, I admit I haven’t always been the best friend I could be.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 raj_koothrappali You’ve been a sucky friend, a sucky, sucky friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 howard_wolowitz Stipulated.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 raj_koothrappali And you do it all the time. Last week in the mall at Radio Shack, we were looking for a phone with giant numbers for your mother, and I suddenly realize you’re not even there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 howard_wolowitz I know, I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 raj_koothrappali And where were you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 howard_wolowitz Getting shot down by the girl at Hot Dog on a Stick. But in my defence, she was gorgeous, and working that squeezer to make the lemonade, going up and down and up and down. It was like a free pole dance right in the middle of the food court.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 raj_koothrappali You’re impossible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 howard_wolowitz Hey, at least I can talk to women without being drunk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 raj_koothrappali Excuse me, I have selective mutism, a recognized medical disorder. You’re just a douche.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 howard_wolowitz No. You know what? Maybe that’s what this whole thing’s about. You’re not mad at me, you’re mad at yourself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 raj_koothrappali No, I’m mad at you. I hate myself, but I’m mad at you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 howard_wolowitz Fine. You’re mad at me. I get it. Now, how about we go spend the day together? Just the two of us. We’ll go anywhere you want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 raj_koothrappali I don’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 howard_wolowitz Come on. Let me take you someplace nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 raj_koothrappali I… I do enjoy the La Brea Tar Pits.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 howard_wolowitz Really, now? With the traffic and the parking, it’s… okay, fine. The Tar Pits. Let’s go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 raj_koothrappali Oh, why can’t I stay mad at you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Go! Go! Go! Go-Go-Go-Go! Yes! Are you people watching this? Is this amazing or what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 penny Sweetie, that’s a highlight from the ’98 championship game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Oh. Did not know that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 penny How much beer have you had?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter None, why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 penny Oh. I was just kind of hoping you were drunk. Now we’re back live.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Okay, yeah. I can see the difference.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 guy_in_baseball_hat#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 Oh, where’s the flag, that’s intentional grounding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 second_guy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 Totally.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter That completely was a forward pass, which they threw intentionally incomplete to avoid loss of yardage or to conserve time. I can’t believe they’re not being penalized with the loss of a down and by having to move the line of scrimmage back to the spot of the foul.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 penny Here, have some pizza, sweetie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Penny, you know I’m lactose intolerant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 penny I know. I just need you stop talking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Penny. Penny. Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 penny Sheldon, come in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Thank you. I’d like to make a sandwich, but I’m out of bread.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 penny There’s some in the fridge.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 sheldon_cooper You shouldn’t keep your bread in the refrigerator. Staleness is caused by crystallization of the starch molecules, which occurs faster at cool temperatures.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 penny On Earth, we say thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 sheldon_cooper So Leonard, how goes the mimesis?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Mimesis?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 sheldon_cooper You know. Mimesis. An action in which the mimic takes on the properties of a specific object or organism. Mimesis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter What the hell are you talking about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 sheldon_cooper I’m attempting to communicate with you without my meaning becoming apparent to those around you. Let me try again. Have the indigenous fauna accepted you as one of their own? Nudge, nudge, wink, wink.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Oh, I guess so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Good. Oh, FYI. After I eat my sandwich, I’m taking Koothrappali’s Patang kite out for a test run. Would you like to get your delta-wing raptor and join me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter I don’t want to fly kites, Sheldon. We’re watching football here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 sheldon_cooper I can see that. I was providing you with an alternative. A courtesy I was never offered in similar circumstances.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Oh, look at that. The Oklahoma coach has thrown down a red flag indicating he’s challenging the ruling on the field. I hope he’s right, ’cause if he’s not, it’ll cost him one of his three time-Outs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 penny You know, Leonard, honey, I wouldn’t mind if you wanted to go fly kites with Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter No, I’ll watch the end of the game. Besides, there’s only three minutes left.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 penny Until half time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter This is just half? We’ve been here for hours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 penny And you’re gonna be here for a couple more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Oh, you’re kidding me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Nice meeting all of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 penny So, yeah, anyway, that’s my boyfriend. He is really smart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 raj_koothrappali I really like my saber-toothed cat. Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 howard_wolowitz My pleasure. Maybe after lunch, we can go to Marie Callender’s and have some pie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 raj_koothrappali I’d like that. This is turning out to be a perfect Saturday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 howard_wolowitz Good. I’m glad. Oh, man. Did you see the way she smiled at me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 raj_koothrappali Fine. Go ahead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 howard_wolowitz No. This is our day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 raj_koothrappali If you want to chase after her, chase after her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 howard_wolowitz Ah, who am I kidding? I wouldn’t have a shot with a girl like that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 raj_koothrappali Don’t put yourself down. You’re a very attractive man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 howard_wolowitz You think so?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 raj_koothrappali Yeah. Absolutely. It wouldn’t kill you to take a Pilates class with me now and then, but you have a certain wiry appeal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 howard_wolowitz Yeah, well, it doesn’t matter ‘cause she wasn’t really smiling at me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 raj_koothrappali Actually, in this case, I think she was.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 howard_wolowitz Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 raj_koothrappali Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 howard_wolowitz Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode06 raj_koothrappali What a douche.
