TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny Wow, Sheldon, I cannot believe you made up your own game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Oh, Research Lab is more than a game. It’s like the slogan says, the physics is theoretical, but the fun is real.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter We must not be playing it right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny All right, five. One, two, three, four, five. Oh, wow, look at that, my Department of Defence research grant is renewed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Oh! Great roll! Now you can demolish your Soviet-style cyclotron and build the large Hadron Collider.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny Yay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper You’re a natural at this, Penny. And as the first beta testers, you two’ll have quite the edge when we play with Wolowitz and Koothrappali on Sunday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Oh, gee, Sheldon, I don’t think we can play on Sunday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Because of the reasons that Penny will now tell you. Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny Actually, I have to pick up my friend Justin from the airport.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter There you go, she has to pick up her friend Justin at the airport, aAnd I can’t play ’cause I’m going with her, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny Um, yeah, if you want. I mean, there may not be room. He’s got a lot of stuff, like guitars and amplifiers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Wait. What are you talking about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny My friend, Justin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Pay attention, Leonard. That’s why she can’t play on Sunday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Who is this Justin?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Your turn, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny I told you about him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter No, you didn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Roll the dice, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny Yeah, my friend from Omaha, plays the guitar. Anyway, he’s coming to L.A. looking for some session work, so I told him he could just crash on my couch for a few weeks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Come on, Leonard, if you roll a six, Penny dies horribly in a nuclear meltdown. See what I mean when I say the fun is real?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Hang on. Some guy is going to be sleeping on your couch?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny He’s not some guy. He’s my friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter So by friend, do you mean friend friend, gay friend, or ex boyfriend who you’re now platonic with but still might have a thing for you friend”?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny Well, he’s definitely not gay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Oh, a definitely not gay musician sleeping on my girlfriend’s couch. Yippee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny Okay, we went out a little bit, a long time ago, but we were never like going out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Okay, not to be pedantic, but the last I checked went out was in fact the past tense of going out, which I think we all know is a popular euphemism for saw each other naked.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper I’ll just roll for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny Do you have a problem with Justin staying with me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter What was your first clue?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Uh-oh! Industrial accident.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny You know what? Don’t talk to me like I’m an idiot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter I’m not talking to you like you’re an idiot! I’m saying the whole idea is idiotic!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper You accidentally stare at a helium-argon laser. Lose one turn and a retina.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny How is that not talking to me like I’m an idiot? It’s my friend, it’s my couch, and it’s my freakin’ life!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper It’s also your roll.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter You know what? It is your life. If you want to have some stupid guitarist stay on your couch, then fine. Why don’t you just rent some bunk beds and invite The Black Eyed Peas?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny Hey, if I want to invite the entire line up of Lollapalooza to sleep in my apartment, I will, and it’s none of your business!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Are you listening to yourself? Do you know how childish you sound right now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny Oh, now I’m a child? Well, at least I’m not an idiot anymore!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter The two aren’t mutually exclusive!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny Oh, you are such a… What the hell is he doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter He’s drowning us out. He doesn’t like fighting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny Sheldon, just stop, look, the fight is over. Oh, and FYI, you never even heard of The Black Eyed Peas until you met me!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter I heard of ’em. Didn’t know they were a band. Sheldon, she’s gone. You can turn off the blender.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Has your relationship reached its inevitable ugly end?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter No, we just had a little spat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Look on the bright side. As the result of Penny’s forfeit, you have become the world’s first winner of Research Lab. Would you like a commemorative snow cone?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter I don’t get how she can just announce that an old boyfriend is going to be sleeping on her couch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Hey, I thought of a game we can play in the car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter I don’t want to play a game, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper It’s called Scientists. Now, I will name three scientists, then you will put them in order of the size of their contribution to their respective fields. To make this game even more compelling, you must consider only the contribution of the man to the field, not the validity of the field itself. For example, Abu Musa Jabir ibn Hayn made a greater contribution to the discredited field of alchemy than Halbert Vanderplatt made to neurobiology. Okay, ready to have some fun?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter An old boyfriend who’s definitely not gay. That’s what a guy likes to hear, definitely.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper All right, I’ll start with an easy one, um, Isaac Newton, Madame Curie and Niels Bohr.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter And then I say one little thing and I end up being the bad guy!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Hint, Madame Curie had her husband to help her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter What am I supposed to say? Sure, Penny, I’m cool with your old boyfriend sleeping in your apartment. Well, Leonard, it doesn’t matter if you’re cool or not because I’m Penny and I’m pretty and I can do whatever the hell I want! Oh, I get it! You think you’re doing me a favour just by being in a relationship with me! No, no, Leonard! I’m doing you a favour just by being in the same room as you!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Leonard! Stop the car!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper I can’t listen to the two of you fight anymore.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Come on, come on, we’re late.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Calm down, we’ll make the movie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper I believe my alarm is appropriate, given the situation. The movie starts in 17 minutes, which means we’ll need to make all the lights on Colorado Boulevard, plus skip the concession stand, and preshow urination.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Oh, dude, I wish you had said something before I pounded that last Red Bull.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Go, go, Power Rangers, go!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Hey. We’re, uh, going to the movies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper No, we’re not. We’re standing in the hallway, suffering through an awkward encounter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Hang on. They’re showing a new digital print of Time Bandits, you wouldn’t want to come, would you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny Not really, no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper All right, invitation pointlessly offered, invitation declined as expected, everyone’s civil, nobody’s fighting. Have a nice evening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Just give us a minute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Oh, take all the time you need.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter So, are we going to talk about last night?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny Are you ready to apologize?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny E-e-e-e-eh! Wrong answer, but thank you for playing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Oh, come on. This is stupid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny Oh, there it is again! You think I’m stupid!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter No, there’s a difference between being stupid and acting stupid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny Oh, yeah? well, there’s a difference between being a jerk and being an ass!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter No, there isn’t! They’re synonyms!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Well, that was rather unpleasant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Yeah, I don’t think I need my preshow urination anymore.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Leonard, when that woman moved in three years ago I told you not to talk to her, and now look, we’re going to be late for the movies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Hey! Look! Amazing Spider-Man 183.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Got it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Remember this one? Spider-Man loses a big fight and then his girlfriend breaks up with him. Want me to get it for you? It’ll help take your mind off things.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 stuart_bloom Hey, guys. What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Oh, we need to kill a couple hours till the next showing of Time Bandits.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 stuart_bloom Oh, well, no problem. I was thinking of closing early and going home, but let’s face it, that’s just a slightly smaller lonely room filled with comic books.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Thanks, Stuart. Let me ask you something. Do you think it’s okay for Penny to have an ex-boyfriend sleep on her couch?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 howard_wolowitz No, I mean, she’s obviously way out of line.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Thank you!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 howard_wolowitz But if she dumps you, she’ll have a new boyfriend by tomorrow morning and you’ll have a new girlfriend when you figure out how to build one. So the only question is, how long until you fold?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter I am not going to fold.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Well, excuse me, I don’t think Penny’s out of line at all. You don’t own her. It’s like my girl, Beyonce says, if you like it, you shoulda put a ring on it.”
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Come on. At the very least, when she found out Leonard was upset about it, she should’ve backed off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 raj_koothrappali You mean like when a guy’s upset because his friend agreed to take a cooking class with him and then doesn’t show up because he’s doing a juice fast with his mother?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 howard_wolowitz I didn’t know you were upset about that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Really! Did you miss all the subtle indicators, like me saying, Howard, I am upset.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Okay, sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Maybe it means something different in this country. Back in India, it means you’re upset with a guy named Howard!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 howard_wolowitz I said I’m sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Sorry doesn’t make up for the fact that I had to make chicken and rice with this vegan guy. Do you know what vegan chicken and rice is? Rice!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Yeah, well, you think I was having fun, sitting around all night listening to my mother say “Have you ever peed so much in your life?”
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Oh, my God, you are such a mama’s boy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Hey, don’t bring my mother into this!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 raj_koothrappali You brought your mother into this!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Stop it, both of you. All this fighting, I might as well be back with my parents! Damn it, George, I told you if you didn’t quit drinkin’ I’d leave you! Well, I guess that makes you a liar, ’cause I’m drunk as hell and you’re still here! Stop yelling! You’re making Sheldon cry! I’ll tell you what’s making Sheldon cry! That I let you name him Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Boy, what got him so upset?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Oh, sure, you can tell when Sheldon’s upset.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny Oh, thank you very much. Come back soon. With the other half of my tip. Hey, Sheldon, what are you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper This is a restaurant. It’s lunchtime. I would think, as a waitress, you’d be familiar with the paradigm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny Is Leonard coming?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper No, I believe Leonard is waiting for you to come crawling back to him and apologize.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny Well, that’s not gonna happen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper I assumed that would be your attitude. Hence, my true purpose in coming here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny Which is?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper I want you to crawl back to him and apologize.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny I’m busy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Excuse me, miss. I’d like to order lunch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny Fine. What do you want?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper I have a few questions. First, I notice that you offer soup and a half-sandwich?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Where exactly does the half-sandwich come from? Are you giving me half of someone else’s sandwich, or do I have to wait for someone else in the restaurant to order the other half?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny No, no, Sheldon, they just make a half-sandwich.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper You can’t make a half-sandwich. If it’s not half of a whole sandwich, it’s just a small sandwich.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny Okay, fine, it’s soup and a small sandwich. Is that what you want?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Of course not. I’ll have my usual.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny Great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Aren’t you going to ask me if I want a beverage?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny Don’t you usually get lemonade?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny Do you want lemonade?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny Anything else?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Yes, I want you to apologize to Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny I am not going to apologize. I’ve done nothing wrong. He is completely overreacting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Irrelevant. The disruption in your relationship is making my life intolerable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny Well, I’m sorry, Sheldon, but this really isn’t about you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper I don’t follow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny Yeah, yeah, I’ll be right there. Look, Sheldon, I have to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper All right, let’s assume, ad argumentum, that in this case, Leonard is wrong.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny Leonard is wrong.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Considering the number of transgressions you’ve committed that he’s overlooked, don’t you think that, just this once, you could return the favour?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny I’m coming. Goodbye, Sheldon. What do you mean, transgressions I’ve committed?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Were you under the impression that Leonard has no complaints about you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny Like what? Yeah, yeah, I see you, you’re making a little cheque sign in the air, I got it, just hold your horses. What does Leonard complain about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Your driving, the plethora of stuffed animals on your bed that stare at him during your amorous activities, your constant tardiness, your singing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny My singing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper That’s actually from my list, but Leonard would be a fool if he didn’t agree with it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny Okay, if Leonard has so many problems with me, why hasn’t he just said so?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Because, according to him, you’re oversensitive and have a temper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny Oh, really? Well, then, do me a favour and tell Leonard that he can drop dead!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper And she wonders why she’s constantly undertipped.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Oh, good, you’re home. I need you to do me a favour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Go apologize to Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Right now would be good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny Leonard!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Although, a few minutes ago would have been better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny I hear you don’t like my stuffed animals, my driving or my punctuality.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter What? Who would tell you something like that? Why would you tell her something like that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny It doesn’t matter why he told me. It’s true, isn’t it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Okay, yeah, it’s true, but I can live with that stuff. What I can’t live with is you casually informing me that some guy’s going to be staying in your apartment without even asking me first!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny That isn’t even your problem, the problem is you don’t trust me!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Oh, come on. Sheldon, have you ever once heard me say that I don’t trust Penny? Sheldon? Where did he go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny Oh, your yelling must have freaked him out again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Where are you going? You just walk away in the middle of an argument?!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny No, I’m going to go find your damn roommate before he hurts himself trying to cross the street or something!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Why didn’t you say so?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny Oh, now I need your permission for that, too?!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Well, I can’t read your mind, Penny!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny Really? Why not? You’re so smart, and I’m so dumb!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Raj. Raj. Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Stop knocking! It’s open! Please tell my parents that our dark matter research is at a critical juncture, and I can’t come home for my cousin Sanjay’s wedding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 mrs_koothrappali Sheldon, ask our son what we’re supposed to say to Mr. and Mrs. Choudhry, whose daughter, Lakshmi is flying in from London, for the sole purpose of meeting him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 raj_koothrappali I didn’t ask you to set me up with Lakshmi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 mrs_koothrappali You should be thanking us!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 dr_vm_koothrappali Yes, Lakshmi just got her stomach stapled. You have an opportunity to get in good with her before she loses weight, and her self-esteem goes up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 raj_koothrappali I don’t care! And why don’t you think I can find a woman for myself?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 mrs_koothrappali Because you’re 27, and the closest thing we have to a daughter-in-law is that Jewish boy Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Oh, that is completely below the belt. Sheldon, tell my parents that Howard and I are just friends. Sheldon? Howard and I are just friends! Fine. I’ll come home for Sanjay’s wedding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny Sheldon!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter What are you doing? He’s not a lost dog.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny Hey, why don’t you just let me find him while you sit there hitting your imaginary brake?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter The brake might be imaginary, but that stop sign you just ran wasn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny What stop sign?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Eyes on the road. Eyes on the road!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 debbie_wolowitz Howard, answer the door! I’m busy!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 howard_wolowitz I’m busy too, you answer it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 debbie_wolowitz I can’t! I’m on the toilet!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 howard_wolowitz For God’s sake, I don’t need to hear that! Can’t you just say, I’m busy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 debbie_wolowitz I said I’m busy, but that wasn’t good enough for you!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 howard_wolowitz You know what? I hope it’s one of those home invasion deals, and they shoot me in the head.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 debbie_wolowitz Well, if it’s a home invader, don’t tell them I’m on the toilet!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 howard_wolowitz There’s no one there. You’re hearing things, you crazy old lady!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Hey, Stuart, have you seen Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 stuart_bloom Yeah, he’s, uh, over in the graphic novel section. Built himself a little nest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 stuart_bloom Uh, Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny Yeah?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 stuart_bloom Is everything okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny What do you mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 stuart_bloom Uh, Sheldon told me you and Leonard were having a fight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny Oh, yeah, kind of. It’s, it’s no big thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 stuart_bloom Oh, good, good. I love you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter I’m not leaving until you talk to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny All right, what’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter It’s a little hard to explain. He does this thing where he pretends he’s in an alternate dimension that occupies the same physical space we’re in, but he can’t perceive us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Don’t flatter yourself. I’m just ignoring you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny Come on, Sheldon, let’s go home. Look, we’re done fighting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper I’ve heard that before, but then, the next thing you know I’m hiding in my bedroom, blaring a Richard Feinman lecture while my mom is shouting that Jesus would forgive her if she put ground glass in my dad’s meatloaf, and my dad’s on the roof skeet-shooting her Franklin Mint collectible plates.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny Okay, there’s going to no more shouting and no skeet-shooting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Really? Where’s your friend Justin going to sleep?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, where’s he gonna sleep?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 penny Oh, my God, would you let this go?!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 stuart_bloom I’d let it go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Why should I let it go? Why don’t you just tell the guy to find another place to sleep? Oh, for God’s sakes. So, you have childhood issues, we all have childhood issues, at some point, you just need to grow up and get past them.
