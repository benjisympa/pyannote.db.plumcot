TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 howard How much time do we have?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 leonard Uh, t-minus five hours, 37 minutes to onset of meteor shower.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 raj Okay, our position is 34.48 degrees north, 118.31 west. That means the azimuth should be 168.22 degrees relative to magnetic north with an elevation of 49.93.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 howard Anything yet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 leonard Uh, we have a signal, but there’s no frame lock.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 howard Hang on, how about now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 raj We did it. We have the west coast feed of HBO.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 howard Ooh, Real Sex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 raj Big deal. Every time I watch that show it’s old women putting condoms on cucumbers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 howard Alright, let’s see what’s on the east coast feed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 leonard Oh, hey. Dune.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 raj Not a great movie, but look at that beautiful desert.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 leonard Too bad Sheldon couldn’t come with us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 raj Yes, it’s not the same without him. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 howard Oh, this sucks, I’m switching back to Real Sex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon Sheldon’s log, stardate 63345.3. While my colleagues are off observing the Leonid meteor shower, I have remained behind to complete my paper on the decays of highly excited massive string states. Although my research is going well I do miss the warmth of human companionship. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon And good evening to you, Siam Palace. This is Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I’m going to be dining alone this evening, so I’ll be reducing my usual order. I’d like to start with one quarter of the assorted appetizers plate and, uh, one half of the golden treasure for two. Oh, for heaven’s sake, in the mid-18th century, King Rama IV of Siam divided a huge empire amongst the colonial powers of Europe in order to preserve his throne. Surely, you, his cultural descendant, can handle pad thai and dumplings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny Sheldon help!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon I need to go, but you keep in mind that my sharply worded comments on yelp.com recently took down a local muffin store. Penny. Penny. Penny..
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny Come in! Hurry!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny I’m back here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon Penny. Penny. Penny..
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny Oh, for god’s sakes, I’m in the bathroom!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon Shall I come back at a better time?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny Get in here! Hurry! Don’t you dare knock.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny I slipped in the shower, and I think I dislocated my shoulder.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon Not surprising. You have no safety mat or adhesive stickers to allow for purchase on a surface with a low coefficient of static friction.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon Tubs are slippery.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny I know. I slipped.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon I have a series of whimsical duck stickers on the bottom of my tub.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny Yeah, okay, whatever. Will you just turn the water off and help me up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon They’re holding umbrellas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon The ducks in my tub.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny Uh-huh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon They’re whimsical because ducks have neither the need for, nor the ability to use umbrellas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny Oh, my god. I got to go to the emergency room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon Well, assuming you’re correct that your right humerus is no longer seated in the glenoid socket, I would certainly think so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny Okay, can you drive me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon I don’t drive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny Well, I can’t drive!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon Well, it seems we’ve reached an impasse.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny Ow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon But I could call you a cab or an ambulance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny No, no, no, I can’t wait that long, you got to help me, please.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon All right. Let it never be said that Sheldon Lee Cooper ignored the pleas of a damsel in distress.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny No one’s saying that. Let’s go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon Well, it does seem rather ironic that for want of 99-cent adhesive ducks, we both might die in a fiery car crash.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 leonard I wish Penny didn’t have to work, she loves camping.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 raj Yeah, that would have been great. You and Penny having sex in the tent while I sit out here and watch Howard hump a cactus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 howard Okay, the best I can tell, there are eight other campsites nearby. Mostly science nerds like us, but just over yon ridge are two not unattractive middle school teachers who reek of desperation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 raj Wow. Wonderful. How old are they?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 howard Oh I don’t know, 50, 55.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 raj Oh, menopause, nature’s birth control.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 leonard Come on, you guys can’t be that hard up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 howard I am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 raj Yeah, me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 howard Look, they gave me homemade cookies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 leonard Of course, they did. That’s what grandmothers do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 raj So, what are we waiting for?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 howard Relax, I said we’d stop by a little later after they have their nap.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 raj Good idea. They’ll be refreshed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 howard Cookie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 raj Yeah, thank you. Mmmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 leonard Mmmm, not bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 raj Yeah, very tasty. Well, so tell me more about these teachers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 howard Not much to tell. They had a VW Microbus and were wearing tie-dyed Grateful Dead shirts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 raj Huh. Mmm. Good cookies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon I see no organizational system in here whatsoever. Which panties do you wear on Mondays?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny I don’t need panties, I just need shorts and a shirt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon My mother always told me one should wear clean underpants in case one is in an accident.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny One was already in an accident.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon That doesn’t mean one won’t be in another, especially if I’m driving.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny Clothes, Sheldon. I need clothes!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon Okay, here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny Seriously? Those shorts with that top?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny No… No… Oh, that’s cute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon We should have you checked for a concussion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny Okay, now, you got to help me put these on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny But don’t look.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon Don’t look?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny I don’t want you to see me naked.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon Oh. Well, that’s understandable. You may be interested to know that a prohibition against looking is well established in heroic mythology. Uh, Lot and his wife, Perseus and Medusa, Orpheus and Eurydice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny Yeah, great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon They always look. It never ends well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny Ok, now you gotta help me get my arm into the sleeve.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon Ok.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny Is that my arm?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon It doesn’t feel like an arm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny Then, maybe you should let it go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon All righty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 leonard Stars are pretty, aren’t they?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 howard Up above the world so high, like little diamonds in the sky.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 raj That’s beautiful, dude. You should… You should write that down before someone steals it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 howard So, when do the meteors get here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 raj The meteors don’t get here, the earth is moving into their path.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 leonard I can feel it. I can feel the earth moving. It’s moving too fast. Raj, slow it down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 raj Okay, how’s that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 leonard Better. Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 howard Stars are pretty, aren’t they?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 leonard What’s so funny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 raj It’s your American accent. Everything you say sounds stupid. Stars are pretty, aren’t they?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon For the record, I should let you know this is my first time driving an actual motor vehicle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny You have your learner’s permit, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon Yes, and I have logged a considerable number of hours on a simulator.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny Good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon Didn’t work out well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny All right, can we please go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon One moment. According to my driver’s ed book, a side mirror is properly adjusted when a portion of the is driver’s door handle is visible in the lower right corner. There’s the handle. Oh, no, too far, bringing it back. Optimized. Now, where is the switch to adjust the passenger side mirror?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny It’s right there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon Where is the passenger side mirror?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny In a parking lot in Hollywood. Now, can we please go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon Yes. As soon as I adjust my seat. Whee! Oh, dear. I’m going to have to start again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 raj If I could speak the language of rabbits, they would be amazed, and I would be their king.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 leonard I hate my name. It has nerd in it. Len nerd.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 howard I lost my virginity to my cousin Jeanie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 raj I would be kind to my rabbit subjects. At first.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 leonard You know what’s a cool name? Angelo. That has angel and jell-o in it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 howard It was my Uncle Murray’s funeral. We were all back at my Aunt Barbara’s house. Our eyes locked over the pickled herring. We never meant for it to happen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 raj One day, I hold a great ball for the President of France, but the rabbits, they hate me and don’t come. I am embarrassed, so I eat all the lettuce in the world and make them watch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 leonard People could call me Angie. Yo, Angie, how’s it goin’?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 howard To this day, I can’t look at pickled herring without being aroused and ashamed. Oh, cousin Jeanie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny Could you please drive a little faster?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon Oh, I think we’re going sufficiently fast. What’s that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny Nothing. The engine does that sometimes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon That can’t be nothing, the check engine light is on. We need to find a service station.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny No. The light has been on since I bought the car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon All the more reason to consult with a mechanic before it explodes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny It’s not going to explode, just keep driving. Warp speed ahead, Mr. Spock.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon Mr. Spock did not pilot the Enterprise. He was the science officer, and I guarantee you that if he ever saw the Enterprise’s check engine light blinking, he would pull the ship over immediately.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny Oh, god, I’m gonna lose the arm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon Oh, oh, red light, release accelerator and slowly apply the brake. Nailed it. While we have a moment, may I ask you a question?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon Why do you have the Chinese character for soup tattooed on your right buttock?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny It’s not soup, it’s courage.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon No, it isn’t. But I suppose it does take courage to demonstrate that kind of commitment to soup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny How did you see it? You said you wouldn’t look.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon Sorry. As I told you, the hero always peeks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 howard Anything?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 leonard No. That was the last pudding cup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 howard No! What about Slim Jims?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 leonard That’s what he used to eat his pudding, remember?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 raj Right! That was so good! Sweety and meaty at the same time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 howard Wait. Wait, wait. So you’re saying we’re out of food?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 leonard The only thing in here are blue ice packs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 raj I know they’re poison, but they look like big, yummy otter pops.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 leonard Oh, god, I am so hungry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 howard Me too. Check and see if we have any more pudding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 leonard Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon All right, there’s no need to bark at me. According to the inexplicably irritable nurse behind the desk, you’ll be seen after the man who claims to be having a heart attack, but appears to be well enough to play Doodle Jump on his iPhone. We have to fill these out. Describe illness or injury.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny I dislocated my shoulder.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon All right. And how did the accident occur?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny You ready know that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon Cause of accident, lack of adhesive ducks. Okay, medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon Kidney disease?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon Migraines?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny Getting one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon Are you currently pregnant?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon Are you sure? You look a bit puffy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny Change migraine to yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon When was your last menstrual period?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny Oh, next question.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon I’ll put, in progress. Okay, moving to psychiatric disorders, list all major behavioural diagnoses, e.g. depression, anxiety, etcetera.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny Oh, my god, what the hell does this have to do with my stupid shoulder?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon Episodes of sub psychotic rage.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny Ass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon Possible Tourette’s. All right, moles, lesions or other skin conditions. Soup tattoo on right buttock.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny Hey, Sheldon, Sheldon, look, I am scared and in a lot of pain. Could you please just take a break from being you for just a minute and try being, I don’t know, comforting?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon I’m sorry. There, there. Everything’s going to be fine. Sheldon’s here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny Thanks. That’s much better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 raj Oh, I’m so hungry!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 leonard Will you shut up? We’re all hungry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 howard Okay, our objective is the boy scout campsite to the east. Easy target. Big doughy scout master, couple of cubs, most webelos.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 leonard What kind of score are we looking at?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 howard Hot dogs, buns, s’mores, I mean, it’s a freaking 7-11.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 leonard All right, everyone grab flashlights.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 howard Oh, my god, could it be? Yes! My mother put an I love you brisket in my backpack.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 leonard Quick, get forks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 howard You don’t need forks. It’s so tender, it falls apart in your hands.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 raj He’s right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 leonard I feel like we’re forgetting something important.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 raj Me, too. But what? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 howard Maybe a tupperware bowl of roasted potatoes and carrots?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 leonard_and_raj_together Yes! Yes!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon Now remember, you were given powerful pain medication and a muscle relaxer, so, uh, don’t operate heavy machinery. Try not to choke on your own drool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny Wait. You have to help me get into bed. Sheldon has to get me into bed. Bet you never thought I’d say that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon Yes. The charm of your drug addled candour knows no bounds.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny You know, people think you’re this weird robot man who’s so annoying all the time, and you totally are, but then it’s like that movie Wall-E at the end. You’re so full of love, and you can save a plant and get fat people out of the floaty chairs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon That’s a fairly laboured metaphor, but I appreciate the sentiment behind it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny Sing “Soft Kitty” to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon “Soft Kitty” is for when you’re sick. You’re not sick.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny Injured and drugged is a kind of sick.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 sheldon Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur…
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 penny Wait, wait. Let’s sing it as a round. I’ll start. Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur… See that’s where you come in. I’ll start over. Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur… I’ve got all night, Sheldon. Soft kitty, warm kitty… little ball of fur, happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 raj …And the next morning when he woke up, he rolled over and realized… duh-duh-duh! …she was his cousin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 howard That’s still not funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 raj That’s still not funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 howard And she was my second cousin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 raj And she was my second cousin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 howard You’re a real douche.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode08 raj Who cares? You slept with your cousin.
