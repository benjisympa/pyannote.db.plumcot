TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howard So two years later, there’s a knock on the door, guy opens it, and there on his porch is the snail, who says, “What the heck was all that about?”
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 bernadette I don’t really get it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howard Well, see, it took two years for the snail to… not important.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 bernadette Can I ask you a question?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howard Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 bernadette Where do you think this is going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howard To be honest, I was hoping at least second base.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 bernadette You’re so funny. You’re like a stand-up comedian.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howard A Jewish stand-up comedian, that’d be new.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 bernadette Actually, I think a lot of them are Jewish.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howard No, I was just… never mind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 bernadette Look, Howard, this is our third date and we both know what that means.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howard We do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 bernadette Sex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howard You’re kidding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 bernadette But I need to know whether you’re looking for a relationship or a one-night stand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howard Okay, just to be clear, there’s only one correct answer, right? It’s not like chicken or fish on an airplane?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 bernadette Maybe you need to think about it a little.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howard You know, it’s not unheard of for a one-night stand to turn into a relationship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 bernadette Call me when you figure it out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howard Three dates means sex? Who knew?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howard Greetings, homies, homette.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 penny Why are you back from your date so early?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howard In romance, as in show business, always leave them wanting more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 penny What exactly does that mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 leonard He struck out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howard Hey, did either of you guys know that three dates with the same woman is the threshold for sex?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 raj Actually, I’ve never had three dates with the same woman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 leonard With Penny and me, it took two years. Now that I think about it, that was three dates.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howard Okay, well, before you and Penny hooked up, did she ask for any kind of commitment?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 leonard No, she was pretty clear about wanting to keep her options open.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 sheldon I have something to announce, but out of respect for convention, I will wait for you to finish your current conversation. What are you talking about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 leonard The cultural paradigm in which people have sex after three dates.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 sheldon I see. Now, are we talking date, the social interaction, or date, the dried fruit?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 leonard Never mind, what’s your announcement?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 sheldon Oh, good, my turn. Well, this is very exciting and I wanted you to be among the first to know…
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 kripke Hey, Cooper, I hear you’re going to be on the wadio with Ira Fwatow from Science Fwiday next week.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 sheldon Thank you, Kripke, for depriving me of the opportunity to share my news with my friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 kripke My pweasure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 sheldon My thank you was not sincere.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 kripke But my pweasure is. Let me ask you a question, at what point did National Public Wadio have to start scwaping the bottom of the bawwel for its guests? Eh, don’t answer, it’s wetowical.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 sheldon Why are you such a stupid head? That is also rhetorical. I’m sorry you had to hear that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 leonard Are you really going to be on NPR?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 sheldon Yes, they’re interviewing me by phone from my office, regarding the recent so-called discovery of magnetic monopoles in spin-ices. It’s pledge week and they’re trying to goose the ratings with a little controversy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 leonard Very cool, congratulations.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 sheldon Thank you. My mother is very excited. She’s convening her Bible study group to listen in, and then pray for my soul.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 sheldon All right. These are the talking points for my NPR interview tomorrow. I need to make sure that they’re simple enough for the less educated in the audience to understand. Howard, look this over and tell me what’s unclear to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howard Excuse me, I have a master’s degree in engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It required the completion of 144 units of grad work and an original thesis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 sheldon Yes. Look this over and tell me what’s unclear to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 leonard You know, when Sheldon gives you homework, you don’t have to do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 raj In fact, it’s better if you don’t, otherwise it makes the rest of us look bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 penny Hi, guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 leonard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 sheldon Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 penny Yo, Raj, talk to me. I’m sorry, just screwing with you. Hey, Howard, why haven’t you called Bernadette?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howard Did she say something?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 penny Yeah, she said she hasn’t heard from you in a week. I thought you liked her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howard I do, yeah, but she wants a commitment and I’m not sure she’s my type.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 penny She agreed to go out with you for free. What more do you need?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howard Look, Bernadette is really nice. I just always thought when I finally settle down into a relationship, it would be with someone, you know, different.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 penny Different how?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howard Well, you know, more like Megan Fox from Transformers, or Katee Sackhoff from Battlestar Galactica.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 penny Are you high?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 leonard You’d have a better shot with the three-breasted Martian hooker from Total Recall.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howard Okay, now you’re just being unrealistic. Anyway, that movie was like 20 years ago, imagine how saggy those things would be.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 penny Howard, you’re going to throw away a great girl like Bernadette because you’re holding out for some ridiculous fantasy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howard Hey, just because you settled doesn’t mean I have to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 leonard Excuse me, I’m sitting here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 penny Hey, I did not settle for Leonard. I mean, obviously, he isn’t the kind of guy I usually go out with, you know, physically.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 leonard Again, I’m right here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 penny My point is, I do not judge a book by its cover. I am interested in the person underneath.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 leonard I am here, right? You see me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howard Hey, I’m interested in what’s inside people, too, but why is it wrong to want those insides wrapped up in, say, the delicious caramel that is Halle Berry? Yes, you’re delicious caramel, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 penny All right, you know what, I will tell you why it’s wrong…
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 sheldon Excuse me, may I interject?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 sheldon Biologically speaking, Howard is perfectly justified in seeking out the optimum mate for the propagation of his genetic line.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howard Thank you, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 sheldon Now, whether that propagation is in the interest of humanity is, of course, an entirely different question.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 radio This is Ira Flatow and you’re listening to NPR’s Science Friday. Joining us today by phone from his office in Pasadena, California is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 kripke Oh, this is going to be a wiot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 radio Thanks for being with us today, Dr. Cooper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 sheldon My pleasure, Ira.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 ira Now, let’s talk about magnetic monopoles. Can you explain to our audience just what a monopole is?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 sheldon Of course. First, consider an ordinary magnet which has, as even the most uneducated in your audience must know, two poles, a north and south pole. If you cut that in half, you have two smaller magnets, each with its own north and south pole.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 ira Uh, Dr. Cooper, I think there might be something wrong with our connection.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 sheldon No, I hear you fine. As I was saying, an ordinary magnet has two poles. The primary characteristic of a monopole is that it has only one pole, hence, monopole.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 sheldon A requirement for string theory, or M-theory, if you will, is the existence of such monopoles. I, myself, led an expedition to the Arctic Circle in search of said particles. Kripke, I found the nozzle! I’m going to kill you!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howard So nice you could join me this evening. You’re looking lovely as always.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 katee_sackhoff Thanks, Howard. Always nice to be part of your masturbatory fantasies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howard Come on, Katee, don’t make it sound so cheap.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 katee I’m sorry, fiddling with yourself in the bathtub is a real class act.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howard Thank you. So, shall we get started?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 katee Sure. But can I ask you a question first?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howard You want to play Cylon and colonist?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 katee No. I want to know why you’re playing make-believe with me when you could be out with a real woman tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howard You mean, Bernadette?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 katee No, I mean Princess Leia. Of course I mean Bernadette. She’s a wonderful girl and she really likes you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howard I know, but she’s not you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 katee I’m not me. The real me is in Beverly Hills going out with a tall, handsome, rich guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howard Really? Tall?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 katee Six-four.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howard Ouch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 katee The point is, you’ve got a wonderful girl in your life, and you’re ignoring her in order to spend your nights in the bathtub with a mental image and a wash cloth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howards_mother Howard! What are you doing in there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howard I’m taking a bath!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howards_mother I hope that’s all you’re doing! We share that tub!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howard Don’t remind me! Oh, man. All soaped up and no place to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 leonard How ya doin’, buddy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 sheldon I was humiliated on national radio. How do you think I’m doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 leonard Come on, it wasn’t that bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 sheldon What do you want?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 raj We represent the Lollipop Guild, and we want you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 leonard Okay, so Kripke played a joke on you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 sheldon It wasn’t funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 raj I thought it was funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 leonard Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 raj You laughed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 sheldon Did you laugh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 leonard I fell on the floor. All right, he got you, you can get him back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 sheldon I refuse to sink to his level.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 raj You can’t sink. With all that helium in you, you’re lucky you don’t float away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 leonard Are you really admitting defeat?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 sheldon I never admit defeat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 leonard Good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 sheldon However, on an unrelated topic, I am never getting out of this bed again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 leonard What if you could make Kripke look even sillier than he made you look?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 raj I don’t think that’s possible, dude.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 leonard You’re not helping.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 raj I didn’t come to help, I came to mock.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 leonard Sheldon, what you need to do is figure out a way to exact vengeance on Kripke, like, uh, like, how the Joker got back at Batman for putting him in the Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 raj That’s true. He didn’t just stay there and talk about his feelings with the other psychotic villains. He, he broke out and poisoned Gotham’s water supply.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 sheldon Well, I suppose I could poison Kripke.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 leonard No, no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 sheldon It’s a simple matter. There are several toxic chemicals that’d be untraceable in an autopsy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 leonard Okay, uh, that’s the spirit, but, um, let’s dial it back to a non-lethal form of vengeance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 sheldon Oh! How about we put awhoopee cushion on his office chair? He’ll sit down, it’ll sound like he’s flatulent, even though he’s not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 leonard Let’s keep thinking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 penny Oh, gee, you’re too late. Scarlett Johansson and Wonder Woman were just in here trolling around for neurotic, little weasels.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howard Yeah, I came to talk to Bernadette. She’s working today, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 penny Yes, but I don’t think she wants to see you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howard Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 penny Come on, Howard. You hurt her feelings by not calling her all week. Plus, I’ve kind of been talkin’ some smack about ya.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 bernadette Hello, Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howard Wait, Bernadette, I need to talk to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 bernadette I can’t now, I’m working.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howard This will only take a second. You asked me to think about where our relationship was going, and I did. Bernadette? Will you marry me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 bernadette Is this more comedy that I don’t understand?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howard No. I’m serious. I’m never going to find another girl like you who likes me and is, you know, real.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 bernadette So, this isn’t a joke?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 bernadette Then you’re insane.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howard I prefer to think of myself as quirky.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 bernadette Howard, we’ve only been on three dates. We haven’t even had sex yet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howard Fair enough. When’s your break?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 bernadette Wow. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howard Don’t you just hate when this happens?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 penny Wow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 sheldon All right, how’s this for revenge? A solution of hydrogen peroxide, and one of saturated potassium iodide.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 raj What’s this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 sheldon Mountain Dew. Ah, refreshing. Now, we’re going to combine these chemicals with ordinary dish soap, creating a little exothermic release of oxygen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 raj Foamy vengeance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 sheldon Yes, exactly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 leonard This is brilliant, Sheldon. How are we going to deploy it in Kripke’s office?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 sheldon Already taken care of. Observe. This is a live shot of Kripke’s lab via a mini webcam I was able to install, thanks to a dollar bill discreetly placed in the night janitor’s shirt pocket. At the same time, I also secured large quantities of these chemicals above the tiles in the drop ceiling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 raj Oh, Sheldon, you remind me of a young Lex Luthor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 sheldon You flatter me, sir.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 leonard Let me guess, motion sensors?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 sheldon The reaction will be triggered when Kripke reaches the center of the room. Mwah, ha, ha.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 leonard I gotta say, I am really impressed. This is truly the Sheldon Cooper way to get even. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 sheldon It may be low-tech, but I still maintain the whoopee cushion has comic validity.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 raj Here comes Kripke!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 leonard Who is that with him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 raj I believe that’s the president of the university.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 leonard And the board of directors. Abort! Abort!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 sheldon There is no abort.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 raj Well, how could you not put in an abort?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 sheldon I made a boo-boo, all right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 kripke I think the board will weally appweciate how well we’re using that NSA gwant, Pwesident Seibert. Wight here we have a micwo-contwolled pwasma… 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 raj Wow. Looks like the Ganges on laundry day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 leonard At least they don’t know it was you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 sheldon Hello, Kripke. This classic prank comes to you from the malevolent mind of Sheldon Cooper. If you’d like to see the look on your stupid face, this video is being instantly uploaded to YouTube. Oh, and a hat tip to Leonard Hofstadter and Raj Koothrappali for their support and encouragement in this enterprise.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 raj Well, I’m going back to India. What’s your plan?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 penny Hey, here’s your tip from table seven.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 bernadette Oh, thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 penny Mm-hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howard Testing. Check. Check two.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 bernadette Oh, now what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 penny You want me to throw him out?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 bernadette No, that’s okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 penny Are you sure? He’s small. I bet I can get a nice, tight spiral on him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howard I want to dedicate this number to a great gal who I’ve done wrong. Bernadette, I am so sorry for trying to propose to you, Bernadette, you found it creepy but that’s just the kind of thing I do. I know now it was too soon to talk of love. It was just a crazy idea that came to me in my tub. But, Bernadette, give me one more chance, sweet Bernadette, I’ll get the hang of this thing they call romance, sweet Bernadette, I dream to once again kiss your lips, sweet Bernadette. Sincerely yours, Howard Wolowitz, Bernadette…
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 penny Oh, I am so sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 bernadette Are you kidding? That’s the most romantic thing anyone’s ever done for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode09 howard …Bernadette! Thank you, Cheesecake Factory!
