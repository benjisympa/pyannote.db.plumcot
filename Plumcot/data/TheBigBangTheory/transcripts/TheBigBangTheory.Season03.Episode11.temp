TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny Oh, I always tear up when the Grinch’s heart grows three sizes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 sheldon Tears seem appropriate. Enlargement of the heart muscle, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, is a serious disease which could lead to congestive heart failure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny You really didn’t like it, Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 sheldon No, on the contrary. I found the Grinch to be a relatable, engaging character, and I was really with him right up to the point that he succumbed to social convention and returned the presents and saved Christmas. What a buzz kill that was.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard When we watch Frosty the Snowman, he roots for the sun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 sheldon Excuse me, but the sun is essential for all life on Earth. Frosty is merely a bit of frozen supernatural ephemera in a stolen hat. A crime, by the way, for which he is never brought to account.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny I just love decorating the Christmas tree. It makes me feel like a little girl again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard We didn’t have a tree when I was growing up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny Really? Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard Mmm, in my family, holidays weren’t so much celebrated as studied for their anthropological and psychological implications on human society.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny Oh, sounds festive. Did you at least give presents?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard Mmm, in a way. We presented papers, and then broke off into focus groups and critiqued each other.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny Sheldon, what about you? Did you have a Christmas tree?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 sheldon Oh, yes. We had a tree, we had a manger, we had an inflatable Santa Claus with plastic reindeer on the front lawn. And to make things even more jolly, there were so many blinking lights on the house they induced neighbourhood-wide seizures.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny So I take it you don’t want to help us trim the tree.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 sheldon I do not. But if you insist on decorating a spider-infested fire hazard in my home I would request that you add this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny What is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 sheldon You’re kidding, right? It’s a bust of Sir Isaac Newton.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny Oh, sure, sure, yeah. Very Christmassy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 sheldon Wait, excuse me, but it’s much more Christmassy than anything you’ve put on the tree.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard Here we go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 sheldon December 25, 1642, Julian calendar, Sir Isaac Newton is born. Jesus, on the other hand, was actually born in the summer. His birthday was moved to coincide with a traditional pagan holiday that celebrated the winter solstice with lit fires and slaughtered goats. Which, frankly, sounds like more fun than 12 hours of church with my mother followed by a fruitcake.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard Merry Newton-mas, everyone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 sheldon I sense that’s not sincere, although I have no idea why.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny No, it’s fine. Look, Sir Isaac can go right next to this little candy cane.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 sheldon No. Isaac goes at the top of the tree.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard No, he doesn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 sheldon I understand. You dispute Newton’s claim that he invented calculus and you want to put Gottfried Leibniz on the top.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard Yeah, you got me. I’m a Leibniz man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 sheldon Well, perhaps when your mother gets here, she’ll talk some sense into you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny What? Your… your mother’s coming? When?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard Tomorrow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny When were you going to tell me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard Um, tomorrow?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny Why were you keeping this a secret?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard Well, I just, I thought…
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 sheldon If I can interject here, obviously Leonard is concerned that his mother won’t approve of you as his mate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny Why wouldn’t she approve of me? I’m adorable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard You are, it’s just…
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 sheldon If I can interject again. Leonard comes from a remarkably high-achieving family, who have all chosen high-achieving partners. He probably feels that it’s doubtful that his mother will be overly impressed with his dating a woman whose most significant achievement is memorizing the Cheesecake Factory menu.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny Hey, it’s a big menu. There’s two pages just for desserts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard I know. And those specials, they change every day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny Okay, you know what? It’s lame when I say it, it’s just ridiculous when you pile on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard Okay, sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny So what did she say when you told her we were going out?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard Um…
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny You didn’t tell her we were going out, did you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard Um…
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard Um…
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 sheldon Leonard, I’m no expert on meditation, but if you’re trying to calm yourself down, I believe the word is Om.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley It was so nice of you to come all the way down to the airport to pick me up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 sheldon No trouble at all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard I drove, Mother. I’m driving now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley Yes, dear. Mommy’s proud. I’ve been meaning to thank you for your notes on my paper disproving quantum brain dynamic theory.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 sheldon My pleasure. For a non-physicist, you have a remarkable grasp of how electric dipoles in the brain’s water molecules could not possibly form a Bose condensate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard Wait, wait, wait. When did you send my mom notes on a paper?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 sheldon August 16th. Right after her carpal tunnel surgery.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley Oh, did I thank you for the flowers?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 sheldon You did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley I don’t really like flowers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 sheldon Neither do I, but it’s the social convention.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley It is, isn’t it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard Wait, wait, wait. You had surgery?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley Yes, and Sheldon sent me flowers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard No, I heard that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley Then what was all that wait, wait, wait about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard I just don’t understand why he knows more about your life than I do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley Well, I would assume it’s because Sheldon and I stay in touch due to mutual interest and respect, while you avoid me, due to unresolved childhood issues.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 sheldon It’s what we think caused your narcissistic personality disorder. We discussed it at length during our last video chat. Although how we got onto the subject of you is baffling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley Yes, but we are on the subject, so I’m obliged to ask, Leonard, how are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard Fine, Mom. How are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley Mmm, menopausal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard Now I’m less fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley Have you heard your brother has gotten engaged?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard No. Sheldon, why didn’t you tell me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 sheldon My bad. I did send a gift from both of us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley She’s a remarkable girl. The youngest appeals court judge in New Jersey and a two-time Olympic bronze medallist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard You must be very happy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley Why? I’m not marrying her. So, how about you? Are you seeing anyone interesting?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 sheldon Well, I’m not sure about interesting, but…
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard Not the time, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 sheldon Very well. Shall we switch topics to Isaac Newton v. Gottfried Leibniz?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley It’s all right, Sheldon. I will just pretend that Leonard’s not withholding information. Although, I will point out, Leonard, that I am a trained psychiatrist and you are exhibiting the same secretive behavioural tics that accompanied your learning to masturbate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 sheldon Isn’t she brilliant, Leonard? How I envy you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley So, Howard, have you and Rajesh finally summoned the courage to express your latent homosexual feelings toward one another?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 howard What? No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 howard Because we don’t have latent homosexual feelings toward one another.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley I see.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 howard No, really. I have a girlfriend now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley And where is she this evening?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 howard She had to go out of town. Her grandmother died.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley I see. Her grandmother died.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 howard Honest to God. Leonard, tell her I have a girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard I don’t know what you’re talking about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 howard What do you mean you don’t know what I’m talking about? Tell her I have a girlfriend!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard All right. He “has” a “girlfriend.”
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 howard Her name is Bernadette, she’s working as a waitress, but she’s going to school to be a microbiologist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley Howard, keep in mind that the more passionately you stick to this construct, the more you’re hurting your partner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 howard Do you really think your lips in my ear is helping?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny Hi. Sorry I’m late.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard Oh, glad you’re here, uh, sit down, I’ll get you a plate. Mom, you remember Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley Oh, yes, the waitress slash actress with the unresolved father issues. Has he finally come to terms with his little slugger growing breasts?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny Well, he sent me a football and a catcher’s mitt for Christmas, so I’m going to say no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 howard If it helps, we’re all good with your breasts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley Classic overcompensation. Oh, speaking of fathers, Leonard, that reminds me, I’m divorcing yours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley Yes. He was cheating on me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard No!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley Yes, with some waitress from the university cafeteria. Can you believe it? A waitress? Oh, no offense, dear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny No, it sounded like a compliment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard When did this happen?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley Mmm, well, let’s see. Sheldon, when did I leave Leonard’s father?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 sheldon September 22nd.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley Oh, yes, that’s right. The weekend after Leonard’s dog died.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard Mitzy’s dead?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 sheldon She was old and blind, Leonard. What choice did we have?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard I don’t believe this. Why am I the last to know?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley Excuse me, Leonard, I am the one who’s getting a divorce, Mitzy is the one who is dead. Why are you the one making a fuss?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard You’re right. I’m-I’m-I’m-I’m sorry, I’m way out of line!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley So, Penny, what’s new in your life?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny Nothing. Not a damn thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley Thank you for driving me back to my hotel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny Oh, it’s not a problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley I was going to ask Leonard to do it, but he seemed a bit emotionally unstable and you don’t want someone like that operating heavy machinery.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny No, you do not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley Your check engine light is on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny Yeah, I gotta put a sticker over that. So, uh, you must be devastated about your divorce.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley Oh, not at all. But I am a bit distressed to be in a vehicle that’s not subjected to regular maintenance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny Come on, I mean, you’re not upset that your marriage is over?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley Well, initially I felt something akin to grief and perhaps anger, but that’s the natural reaction of the limbic system to being betrayed by a loathsome son of a bitch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny Sure, sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley Thankfully, my shock was somewhat mitigated by the fact that I haven’t had intercourse with him in eight years.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny Eight years?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley Oh, that’s nothing. I’ve been responsible for my own orgasms since 1982.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny Yikes. What’s so funny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley That’s exactly what I say during orgasms. Yikes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny You know what? I could use a drink. Do you want to stop for a drink?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley Oh, I don’t drink.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny I do, I’ll teach you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 sheldon Leonard? Leonard? Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard What is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 sheldon I made tea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard I don’t want tea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 sheldon I didn’t make tea for you. This is my tea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard Then why are you telling me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 sheldon It’s a conversation starter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard That’s a lousy conversation starter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 sheldon Oh, is it? We’re conversing. Checkmate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard What do you want, Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 sheldon What I want is to be departing the Starship Enterprise in a one-man shuttle craft headed to the planetoid I rule known as Sheldon Alpha Five.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard I want that too. Why are you here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 sheldon To comfort you, of course. No, that’s not going to work at all, I’ll comfort you from over here. Leonard, what you’re experiencing is a classic Jungian crisis in which the aging individual mourns the loss of the never-to-be realized ideal family unit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard Thank you, that’s very comforting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 sheldon That’s not the comforting part.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard It’s not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 sheldon No, no. The comforting part is that the Germans have a term for what you’re feeling. Weltschmerz. It means the depression that arises from comparing the world as it is to a hypothetical, idealized world.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard You’re right, I do feel better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 sheldon Well, the Germans have always been a comforting people. Just remember, Leonard, where your biological family has failed you, you always have me, your surrogate family.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard You’re my surrogate family?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 sheldon If it’s any consolation, I’m not happy about it either. Good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny Okay, now this time try drinking it all at once.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley Yikes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny I’ve been responsible for my own buzz since 2003. Another round for me and my homegirl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley I feel a spreading warmth through my extremities.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny As long as you don’t feel it running down your pants, you’re fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley Oh, that is fascinating. I’m noticing an immediate lowering of my inhibitions. For example, I’m seriously considering asking that busboy to ravish me in the alleyway while I eat cheesecake. What do you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny Well, we are known for our cheesecake. Hit us again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley Yes. If a little is good, more must be better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny Hey, Bev, guess what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny I’m sleeping with your son.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley Really? Which one?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny The one from whom I live across the hall from.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley Well, that’s convenient. How did his penis turn out?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny Oh, Beverly, I can’t talk to my boyfriend’s mother about his penis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley Oh, fair enough. What can you tell me, if anything, about that busboy’s penis?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny Actually, I’ve only had the cheesecake. One more time. You know, Leonard did not want to tell you we were dating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley Really? Well, that means he’s either embarrassed about the relationship or he doesn’t care enough about his mother to tell her he’s in one. Either way, one of us should be insulted.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny Well, let’s go find out who.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley You go get a taxi. I’m gonna slip my business card into that busboy’s back pocket, cupping his firm, right buttock as I do so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley Sonny boy!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny Get out here! Your mommy wants to talk to you!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard What the hell is going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny You’re in trouble.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley Why didn’t you tell me you were tapping my homegirl? Did I say that right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny Yeah, not bad, not bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard Are you guys drunk?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley Well, I hope so. Otherwise, why would we have stopped at Del Taco? Now, how could you not tell me you were in a relationship with this lovely, charming young woman?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny Oh, thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley You’re welcome. Is it because she’s uneducated, trapped in a menial service position?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny What the hell happened to lovely and charming?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard How come you didn’t tell me that you and Father were getting a divorce? How come you didn’t tell me you had surgery? How come you didn’t tell me my dog died?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What I hear you saying is that you want a more intimate mother-son relationship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard I do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley There. It’s late. Now, go to bed. I’m getting a warm feeling spreading through my heart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny That’s the Del Taco.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 sheldon Why is Leonard softly banging his head against his bedroom door?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley Speaking of warm feelings, come here. No, I’d rather have the busboy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley Thank you for taking me to the airport.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 sheldon You’re very welcome.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard Once again, I’m driving. I’m right here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley Please, I am very hungover and in no mood to satisfy your need for approval. Sheldon, I do hope you’ll forgive me for my inappropriate behaviour last night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 sheldon I don’t blame you. You were intoxicated.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 sheldon I blame Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny I blame Penny, too. Bad Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard Wait a minute, what are you talking about? What inappropriate behaviour?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley I think it’s best that you not know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 sheldon Agreed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny Agreed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard What the hell, agreed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley And I want you to take very good care of this young woman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny Oh, thank you, Beverly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley You’re welcome. She doesn’t have much in the way of career prospects, don’t make her responsible for her own orgasms as well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard Mother, remember when I was complaining that you don’t communicate with me enough?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 beverley Yes, dear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 leonard I’m over it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode11 penny Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la la-la.
