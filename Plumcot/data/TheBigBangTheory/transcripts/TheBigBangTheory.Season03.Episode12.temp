TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 leonard Look at us. Getting ready for a double date with actual women who publicly acknowledge they’re our girlfriends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 howard Yes, actual women are the best.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon I don’t understand. What other kind of women are there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 leonard Howard, artificial women are your department. You want to take this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 howard No, it would just freak him out. Listen, before we leave, I should warn you, I’m a passionate man and I tend towards public displays of affection.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 leonard What are you trying to tell me, Howard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 howard There might be some making out in the car or the restaurant, and I don’t want Bernadette to feel uncomfortable, so it would help if you and Penny made out, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 leonard Don’t worry. We’re planning to have sex right on the salad bar.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 raj Namaste, white people. Good news! I rented us the four-hour edition of Watchmen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 leonard Got it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 howard Seen it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon Detailed analysis posted online.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 raj Well, then what are we going to do tonight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 leonard Uh, sorry, Raj. Howard and I are going out to dinner with Penny and Bernadette.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 howard Yeah, no more carefree bachelor nights for me and Leonard. These broncos have been saddled.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 leonard How did we get actual women?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 raj Great. They get girlfriends, and they just abandon us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon It is great, isn’t it? We have a wonderful evening ahead of us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 raj We do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon Oh, yes. I just discovered I don’t have enough room on my hard drive for a Linux partition, so you and I are going to perform a full backup, reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 raj I don’t want to do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon All right. Well, I’m going to perform full backup, reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 raj What about me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon Well, I understand there are several types of artificial women. Maybe you should look into that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 raj Dude, there’s so many cool things we could be doing tonight. Look. At the Glendale Galleria, put on your best zoot suit, it’s a salute to Swing music in the center court near Macy’s. 5pm to 9pm, huh, huh? A salute to zoot. Sounds like a hoot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon I’m sorry, Raj, I have no desire to salute any article of clothing tonight. Much less one that’s linked to race riots in the 1940s.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 raj Race riots?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon The zoot suit riots.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 raj Oh. I always thought that was some sort of after-Christmas sale. Well, then why don’t we just go to the galleria and walk around?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon I don’t need anything at the Galleria. Do you need anything at the Galleria?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 raj No. We would just walk around and see what’s what.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon That’s a semantically null sentence.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 raj Okay, well, how about this? From the university Web site, 7pm to 10pm, Norton Hall Multipurpose Room, mixer for grad students and faculty of the science and humanities departments. Whether you split atoms or infinitives, this is the place to be.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon Well, that’s certainly amusing, but I have no interest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 raj Come on, Sheldon, the world is filled with people doing things outside. Let’s go outside. Outside is good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon If outside is so good, why has mankind spent thousands of years trying to perfect inside?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 raj I don’t know, it’s a marketing scheme. Please, Sheldon, I’m a young, virile visitor from a foreign land and I need to strut my stuff.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon Let me offer you a compromise. Sometimes when I feel stifled and want a change of scenery, I use my imagination.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 raj Oh, boy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon One of my favourite places to visit is the two-dimensional world described in Edwin Abbott’s mathematical fantasy, Flatland.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 raj I don’t want to go to Flatland.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon You’re only saying that because you haven’t been there. I am now a hexagon in two-dimensional space and can only perceive the edges of other objects.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 raj Oy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon Is that you, Raj? I don’t recognize your edge.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 raj Sheldon, I’m begging you. I want to go to this mixer, and I don’t want to go alone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon Well, you’re in luck, there’s a mixer here in Flatland. Oh, look, there’s a sexually attractive line segment, you should chat her up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 raj What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon Tell her you’re a circle, Flatland gals are all hot for circles.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 leonard I hope you’re hungry, Bernadette, we’re going to a terrific restaurant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 bernadette Oh, yeah, I’m starved. When you spend all day in a bio-lab, watching flesh-eating bacteria skeletonize small rodents it really works up an appetite.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 howard Flesh-eating bacteria. And yet, I still want to kiss this woman, what does that tell you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 penny That you’d be willing to die a horrible death on the off-chance you’d get to second base?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 bernadette Oh, we’re way past second base. Right, Howard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 howard Well, we kind of disagree about what the bases are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 bernadette How’s your work going, Penny? Any acting jobs?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 penny Well, the last big thing I did was this production of Diary of Anne Frank above a bowling alley. But I think things might be turning around pretty soon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 leonard Great. How come?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 penny Well, promise you won’t make fun of me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 leonard Of course, I would never make fun of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 penny Okay. Well, I went to this psychic who told me that if I cut my hair, I’m going to get a national commercial.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 leonard Seriously? You’re getting career advice from a psychic?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 howard Good job not making fun of her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 penny She’s not one of those phonies, okay. She wrote a book and has her own Web site.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 leonard Oh, gee, why didn’t you say so? They don’t let just anyone have a Web site.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 penny Why are you being such a jerk?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 leonard You’re surprised? Your psychic didn’t tell you I was going to be a jerk?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 penny Ha-ha, bite me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 leonard Come on, Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 howard Why don’t you kids go ahead and chat? We’re gonna make out back here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 bernadette I’m sliding into third.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 raj Thanks for coming with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon Thanks for giving me your limited edition Green Lantern lantern.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 raj Did you really have to bring it in with you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon What if evil strikes and my power ring runs low?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 raj Come on, let’s get a drink.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon I don’t drink.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 raj Yeah, well I do. And when my wingman is carrying a Green Lantern lantern, I drink a lot. I’ll have a screwdriver, please. Don’t be chintzy with the screw.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon I would like a root beer float.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 raj Sheldon, they don’t have ice cream.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon They don’t? Well, apparently, these people and I differ greatly on the definition of party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 raj He’ll have a Shirley Temple.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon And don’t be chintzy with the Shirley.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 raj Okay, let’s check out the females.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon All right. There’s a female.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 raj That’s Professor Wilkinson’s wife, she’s like 80 years old.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon But she’s female. Isn’t that the game?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 raj No. I’m looking for a hookup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon Oh, yes. So, the point of this exercise is for you to find someone to copulate with?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 raj Not so loud, but ideally, yes. Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon Thank you. And what is my function as wingman?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 raj You help me run my game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon Okay. What is your game?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon When I lie through my teeth to a woman, you nod and agree.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 girl Hey, that’s pretty cool. What is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon It’s a limited edition Green Lantern lantern. My friend is looking for someone to copulate with.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 girl You’re very funny. I’m Abby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon I’m Sheldon. How do you do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 raj How do you do? Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali. Call me Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 abby Hi, Raj. Where are you from?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 raj The mysterious subcontinent of India.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 abby Ooh, India.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 raj You know India?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 abby I saw Slumdog Millionaire.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 raj Well, I’m a slumdog astrophysicist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon I thought your father was a gynaecologist. I’m sorry. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 abby Martha, come here. Meet Raj and Sheldon. This is my friend, Martha.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 martha Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 raj Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 martha Is that the limited edition Green Lantern lantern?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon In brightest day, in darkest night, no evil shall escape my sight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 martha Oh, that is so awesome.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon Thank you. Have you chosen one to copulate with?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 bernadette So, what should we talk about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 howard Well, we could always learn more about why people who believe in psychics are idiots. Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 penny Oh, we don’t need to talk about that anymore. Leonard covered it pretty well in the car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 leonard I’m sorry, but facts are facts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 penny Right, and if you can’t understand it, it’s not a fact.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 leonard No, if it’s not a fact, it’s not a fact.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 penny Oh, got it. Thank you for educating me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 leonard You’re welcome. How’s your fish?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 penny Amazing. Would you like to try some?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 leonard Yeah, sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 penny Well, the fact is, you can’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 leonard Come on, Howard, Bernadette, you’re both scientists. Help me out here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 howard What do you think? Want to jump right into the middle of another couple’s argument?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 bernadette No, thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 howard Sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 leonard Maybe we should just stop talking about this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 penny Maybe some of us should stop talking altogether.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 waiter How is everything tonight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 bernadette Really uncomfortable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 leonard You know, the best thing about being in a committed, monogamous, mutually supportive relationship is that even if you have different ideas, you can have a spirited debate, yet still care for, even make love with… Want your fish? I knew you were going to do that. Doesn’t make me psychic! Attaboy, Leonard, make it worse. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 leonard What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon We scored. I’m the wingman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 howard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 leonard Laser.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 howard Had a great night last night. I don’t like to kiss and tell, but somebody made it to eighth base.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 leonard What the hell is eighth base?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 howard Seventh base with shirt off. Well, my shirt. How’d things go with Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 leonard Oh, couldn’t be better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 howard Are we taking our relationship frustrations out on innocent Cylons?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 leonard It’s not just Cylons. Superman’s next.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 howard All right, I was going to try to squeeze in a little more mocking before lunch, but I can come back later when you don’t have a high-powered weapon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 leonard How can I go out with a woman who believes in psychics?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 howard Hey, I once dated a girl who believed she was abducted by aliens.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 leonard And that didn’t bother you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 howard Au contraire. It meant she was gullible and open to a little probing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 leonard What am I supposed to do, pretend I believe something I don’t whenever I’m with Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 howard Hey, I’m sure Penny fakes all kinds of things when she’s with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 leonard Do me a favour, lean over, put your head right here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 howard Let me show you another way to look at this. Here we have the universe of all women. These are the ones you want to sleep with. These are the women who believe exactly what you believe. These are the women who would be willing to sleep with you. And right there in the
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 leonard What’s your point? In order to keep having a sexual relationship with Penny, I have to give up everything I believe in, my intellectual integrity, the very nature of who I am? I can’t do that, Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 howard I respect that. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 leonard What is that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 howard Your new girlfriend. Have fun tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon The dog… koira. The roof… katto. Grapes… ryp leet. One minute.Sis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 raj What was that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon It means come in. It’s taking forever to load the new operating system on my computer. I disinfected the kitchen and the bathroom, and now I thought I’d learn Finnish.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 raj जो भी तुम्हारे नाव मंगाई. That’s Hindi for whatever floats your boat. Uh, listen, I got a text from that girl Abby, and she and her friend Martha want to hang out with us again. What do you say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon I don’t say anything. I merely offer you a facial expression that suggests you’ve gone insane.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 raj I don’t get it. You had a great time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon Yes, exactly, I had a great time. That’s done, I’ve moved on to other things. For example, after I learn Finnish, I’m not going to learn Finnish again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 raj Please, Sheldon, I’m a lost Indian boy far from home, and I want a girlfriend and I want her to be Abby, and she’ll only come over if she can bring Martha.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon Raj, I highly doubt there is any argument you can make, threat you might levy, rhetorical strategy, plea, invocation, supplication, or… vetoomus that you can employ that would convince me to reconsider.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 raj My Incredible Hulk hands signed by Stan Lee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon Oh, my. I’ve admired these for years.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 raj So does that mean we can go with the girls again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon Hulk agree to second date with puny humans!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 raj You can’t wear the hands on the date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon Hulk sad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 leonard Hey. Cleaning out the old dryer lint, huh? Not only is it courteous, it’s safety smart. Every year, 15,000 fires are caused by accidental dryer lint ignition. Now you’re supposed to say, wow, what an interesting fact. Come here, you crazy, nerdy guy. I could never be mad at you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 penny Wow, that’s all you got after you were the most obnoxious person on a double date that included Howard Wolowitz?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 leonard No, I’m sorry. I really am. It’s not right to mock what a person believes in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 penny Thank you. Would you be willing to go to my psychic and see what it’s all about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 leonard Would you be willing to read a book that concisely explains how all psychics are frauds?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 penny I would not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 leonard Okay, let’s go see your psychic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 penny Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 leonard Well, yeah, one of us has to keep an open mind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 penny You saying I don’t have an open mind?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 leonard No, not at all. Let me help you with this stuff.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 penny You know, I believe in ghosts, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 leonard Great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 penny And astrology.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 leonard I know, and pyramid power and healing crystals.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 penny Oh, no, no, no, crystals don’t work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 leonard Really, that’s the line? Psychics are real, but crystals are voodoo?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 penny Oh, voodoo’s real. You don’t want to mess with voodoo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 martha Flatland is more than just a mathematical essay. It is also a treatise on Victorian social mores.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon You know, I had never considered that. Wow, that’s going to completely change my visits there. Well, it’s late.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 martha Uh-huh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon Time for bed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 martha Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon Good night, puny human! .
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 martha Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon Yes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 martha Listen, they’re kind of getting busy in the living room, and I was wondering if I could hang out in here for a while.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode12 sheldon Well, I suppose. Come in. I’ll sleep in Leonard’s room. Good night.
