TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 howard Boy, seems like forever since the four of us have been out to eat, you know? Just the guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 raj Oh, God! Yes, we get it. You have a girlfriend now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 howard A little jealous, are we?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 raj No, I’m not jealous. All right, I’d kill a hobo if it’ll get me laid. Now, can we order?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon Oh, dear Lord, they re-did the menu.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 leonard So what? It’s the same food.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon Oh, is it? Look at this. General Tso’s Chicken is no longer listed under specialties. It’s now under chicken.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 raj So?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon Yes, General Tso.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 raj Not Tso the chicken, so the question. So?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon So, why is it no longer a specialty? Did the chef lose confidence in the dish or himself? And look over here, shrimp in mobster sauce. What is mobster sauce?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 leonard It’s obviously a typo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon Perhaps. Perhaps this restaurant’s now a front for organized crime. For all we know, the mobster sauce contains actual chunks of deceased mobsters.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 raj No, no, no, no, I think it just means it’s the kind of sauce that mobsters like.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 howard It doesn’t mean any of that! It’s a typo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 leonard You know what? Let’s just get a pizza.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon Good idea. We’ll go to Corleone’s.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 howard Sure, no mobsters there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon You know, the more I think about it, the mobster sauce couldn’t possibly contain chunks of mobster.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 leonard And why is that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon It was listed under seafood.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 leonard What if they were mobsters who slept with the fishes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon Leonard, are we having a serious conversation or not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 leonard What the…?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon The TV is gone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 leonard So are our laptops.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon Oh God, oh God, oh, God! It’s all right. They didn’t take my comic books.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon They took our TV, two laptops, four external hard-drives, our PS2, our PS3, our X-Box, our X-Box 360, our classic Nintendo, our Super Nintendo, our Nintendo 64 and our Wii.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 leonard We like games.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 policeman Assorted video games.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon When does the CSI team get here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 policeman What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon In anticipation of their arrival, I’ve bagged some evidence. One of the thieves had the audacity to quench his thirst while ransacking our home. You should be able to pull some good prints off this. And now, here are my prints so you can rule me out as a suspect.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 leonard What about me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon I’m sorry, Leonard. It’s too early to discount the possibility of this being an inside job.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 leonard Would I be completely out of line to ask you to shoot him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 policeman I’d be happy to put him under a 72-hour psychiatric hold.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon I’m not crazy. My mother had me tested.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 policeman We’re done here. Call this number, and we’ll fax you a copy of the report so you can submit it to your insurance company.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon I’m sorry, that’s the end of your inquiry?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 policeman Do you have any more information that might be relevant?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon Oh, my goodness. Where do I begin? For instance, my laptop contained four out of the five gedanken experiments necessary for a cogent restatement of the quantum measurement problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 leonard How is that going to help them?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon Well, they could monitor scientific publications and see if anyone posts such a cogent restatement in the next couple of months. If so, the authors are most likely in possession of my stolen laptop.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 policeman Good night, fellas. Come on, Bochco.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 leonard What are we supposed to do now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon The only thing we can do. Watch TV on our phones until the criminals return and bludgeon us to death in our sleep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 leonard Does that mean you’ve ruled me out as a suspect?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon Oh, how I wish I could.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon I do not have to urinate. I am the master of my own bladder. Drat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 penny I can’t believe it. If I hadn’t been working the dinner shift, I would’ve run
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 leonard Hey, there’s no reason for you to be scared.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 penny I’m not scared. I would’ve gone all Nebraska on their asses.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon Leonard and Penny. Leonard and Penny. Leonard and Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 leonard Hand me the bat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon We just had a major crime in the building, and you open the door without asking who it is?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 penny It won’t happen again, what’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon Nothing. Just wanted to see if you were both okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 leonard We’re fine, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon All right, then. Good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 penny Good night. That was weird, even for him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 leonard Mm-hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon Leonard and Penny. Leonard and Penny. Leonard and Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 penny Who is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon Sheldon. Sheldon Cooper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 penny Yes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon May I come in?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 penny Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon I see you’re drinking wine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 leonard Yes, we are. And we’re about to go to bed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon Uh-huh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 penny Sheldon, do you want to sleep here tonight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon Oh, as small as Leonard is, I don’t think the two of you’d be comfortable on the couch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 leonard What do you want?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon It’s not what I want, it’s what evolution wants. Human beings are primates. Primates have evolved to live in groups, both for protection and support.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 leonard But you don’t like other people.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon I do tonight. It’s scary over there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 leonard It’s getting scary here, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 penny Um… three little kittens? Three little pigs? God, I don’t know. Star Wars?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 leonard Did we win? Can we go to bed?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon Good Lord, I could not have made this easier. Hydrogen atom, H, plus pigs minus pea, Higgs. Bow, General Zod trapped in the Phantom Zone. Bow-zone. Pear. Tickle. Pear-tickle. Higgs Boson Particle. How could you not get that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 leonard He’s right, Penny. It’s all there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 penny Look, Sheldon, sweetie, I know you’re feeling insecure, but we’ve really got to go to sleep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon All right. I’ll take the first watch and wake you at 0400.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 leonard Great. Good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 penny Wait, wait, what’s 0400?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 leonard 4am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 penny That’s, like, in 45 minutes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 leonard Just keep walking. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 woman_on_tv It’s quiet out there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 man_on_tv Maybe a little too quiet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 woman_on_tv Where are you going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 man_on_tv Just gonna take a look around outside.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon Bad idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 woman_on_tv No, Jim, don’t open the door!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon Listen to her, Jim.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 man_on_tv Don’t worry, there’s no one out here. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon Leonard and Penny! Leonard and Penny! Leonard and Penny!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 leonard Who is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 howard All right, we’ve got a titanium dead bolt and a reinforced jamb controlled by a state-of-the-art electronic access system.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon What if they cut the power?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 raj There’s a 200-watt uninterruptible backup power supply.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon What if someone steals my keys?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 raj There are independent voice and fingerprint scanners.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon What if someone kidnaps me, forces me to record my voice, and then cuts off my thumb?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 leonard I’ll send them a basket of muffins.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 howard Now, inside, we’ve got motion detectors, infrared sensors, and cameras connected to a server running state-of-the-art facial recognition software.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 leonard Where did you get all this stuff?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 howard I got a buddy over at the Department of Defence.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 leonard He just gave it to you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 howard I’m sure he would have if I had asked. Ironically, their security isn’t all that good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 penny Raj, your car is blocking me… What the hell?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 leonard Sorry, let me help you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon Wonderful security system if we’re attacked by a school of tuna.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 howard Don’t worry, the net’s going to be electrified. Picture her on the floor, spasming uncontrollably.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon Better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon Sheldon’s journal. Security system in place. However, sleep continues to elude me. I’ve seen the underbelly of Pasadena, this so-called City of Roses, and it haunts me. Ah, the injustice, I lie here awake, tormented, while out there evil lurks, probably playing Donkey Kong on my classic Nintendo. Oh, dear. I am the master of my own bladder. Leonard and Penny. Leonard and Penny. Leonard and Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 penny Oh, my…
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 leonard God, Sheldon. What the hell are you doing out there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon I heard a noise.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 leonard It was us. We knocked over a lamp.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon Why would you knock over a lamp?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 leonard We were going to have…
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 penny He doesn’t need to know what we were doing, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon Oh! No, she’s right, I don’t need to know what you were doing. Carry on. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 leonard What are you doing? Use the door.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon Good thinking. Perhaps I’ll check the perimeter and make some warm milk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 leonard Great, you do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon Would you like me to bring you some warm milk?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 leonard I’m lactose intolerant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon And you don’t wish to alarm me with any more loud noises, very thoughtful. Warm milk, Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 penny No, thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon Fine. Good night to you, sir. Miss.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 leonard Sorry about that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 penny Ugh, what can you do? Here. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 leonard Looks like Wolowitz got the net electrified.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 penny Sheldon, are you okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon I’m fine. Although I’m no longer the master of my own bladder.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon My new computer came with Windows 7. Windows 7 is much more user-friendly than Windows Vista. I don’t like that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 leonard Don’t you think looking for a new city to live in is a bit of an overreaction?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon Our apartment was broken into, our security system tried to kill me, and as a result, I’m leaving Pasadena forever. Tell me how that’s overreacting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 penny Come on, Sheldon, you can’t move. Don’t you need to stay in one place so the mother ship can find you when it returns?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon Oh, if that were only true. Unfortunately, as I’m earthbound for the foreseeable future, I need to find a location that’s more hospitable than the mean streets of Pasadena. Like Enid, Oklahoma. Low crime rate and high-speed Internet connectivity, but no model train shops. Sorry, Enid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 penny Is he quitting his job at the university?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 leonard Oh, no, he’s going to telecommute. Everybody’s really excited about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon All right. Boone, North Carolina. Every summer since 1952, Boone has hosted an outdoor amphitheater portrayal of the life and times of its namesake, Dan’l Boone. Sounds like something that would attract the wrong crowd. Penny, you’re from Nebraska, correct?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 penny Born and raised. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon It will take me a few days to get settled. After I do, I will e-mail you detailed PDFs containing diagrams and instructions that will guide you through packing and shipping the rest of my possessions to Bozeman, Montana. In the meantime, please forward my mail.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 leonard Any place specific or just the Bozeman, Montana Loony Bin?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon I sense you’re making a joke, but Bozeman does have a comedy club called The Loony Bin, so do not forward my mail there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 howard Oh, come on. So you were the victim of a crime. That’s part of life. When my great-grandfather first came to this country, he put all his hopes and dreams into this little butcher shop he ran on the Lower East Side of New York. You know what happened? Every customer who walked into that butcher shop and asked for a pound of liver, got ripped off. But, those people moved on, and so should you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon I am moving on. I’m going to be a Bozite.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 leonard They call themselves Bozites?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon They should. It’s one of the first things I plan to bring up upon arrival.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 penny Sheldon, I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I’m going to miss you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon Please, Penny, as you know, I’m not comfortable with prolonged good-byes and maudlin displays of emotion, so I prepared a short video.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon_on_laptop_screen Greetings. As you know, I’m not comfortable with prolonged good-byes and maudlin displays of emotion, so I prepared this short video. The four of you are three of my closest friends and one treasured acquaintance. Though I cannot state categorically that my life will be diminished by not having you in it, I am comfortable if you choose to believe that. Since you intend to remain in this lawless metropolitan area, statistics suggest that you will succumb to tragic and gruesome ends before we meet again. Live long and prosper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 penny Sheldon, that’s so… 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon You might want to lock the door behind me. This isn’t Bozeman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 howard How the hell do I know who’s the friend and who’s the acquaintance?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon That is a bracing cold, an invigorating cold. Lord, is it cold!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 man Help you with your bags, sir?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon Thank you, fellow Bozite. And may I say, you are the living embodiment of all the promises made by our lovely town’s Chamber of Commerce. Wait! Wait! Excuse me! One ticket to Pasadena, California, please.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 howard Hey, look who’s back!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode13 sheldon Interesting. The acquaintance is the first to greet me.
