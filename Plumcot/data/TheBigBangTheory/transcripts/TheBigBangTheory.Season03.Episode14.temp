TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 penny Whatcha doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon I’m attempting to view my work as a fleeting peripheral image so as to engage the superior colliculus of my brain.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 penny Interesting. I usually just have coffee. You’ve been up all night?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon Is it morning?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 penny Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon Then I’ve been up all night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 penny And you’re stuck?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon Why else would a person try to engage their superior colliculus?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 penny Oh, sorry, sweetie, I can’t help you till I’ve had my coffee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard Penny, I told you if you don’t put him in his crate at night he just runs around the apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 penny What is he doing now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard Mmm, he’s either isolating the terms of his formula and examining them individually, or looking for the alligator that swallowed his hand after Peter Pan cut it off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon Captain Hook’s hand was eaten by a crocodile, not an alligator. If you’re going to mock me, at least get your facts straight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard Aye, aye, Captain.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon I can’t see it! It just won’t coalesce.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard Maybe you need a fresh start.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon You’re right. It’s a great idea, Leonard. Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon Electrons move through graphene, act as if they have no mass…
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 howard How long has he been stuck?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard Intellectually about 30 hours. Emotionally about 29 years.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon Unit cell contains two carbon atoms. Interior angle of a hexagon is 120 degrees.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 howard Have you tried rebooting him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard No, I think it’s a firmware problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 raj Hey, it’s Disco Night at the Moonlight Roller Rink in Glendale tonight. Who’s up for getting down?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 howard Oh, that’s perfect. Bernadette’s been hocking me to take her roller skating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard I think Penny likes to skate. The four of us could double.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 howard What could be better? We’re in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 raj Great. It’s not like I brought it up because I wanted to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 howard You can come with us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 raj No, it’s okay. I don’t have to go. I’m happy just to guide you and your ladies to suitable entertainment choices. I’m a walking brown Yelp.com.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon Structure, constant structure. One atom…
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 howard Boy, he’s really gone, isn’t he?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard Yeah, this morning he used a stick of butter as deodorant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 howard I thought I smelled popcorn.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon Pattern is the same as fermions, travels on the pathways, hexagonal, it’s always hexagonal…
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard I haven’t seen him this stuck since he tried to figure out the third Matrix movie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 raj Hey, those are my lima beans!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon Not lima beans, carbon atoms.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 raj But if I don’t eat my lima beans, I can’t have my cookie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard Here, you want my peas?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon Peas! Perfect, they can be electrons.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 howard Want my corn?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon Don’t be ridiculous. What would I do with corn?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard So roller skating, should we all grab a bite to eat first?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 howard Good. P.F. Chang’s? My mom has coupons.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard Great. Your mom’s not coming, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 howard Not this time, I promise.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 raj Okay, just to be clear, roller skating was my idea, and I’m very unhappy that you turned it into a double date, and I hope you both fall on your asses and break your coccyxes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon The plural of coccyx is coccyges.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 raj Screw you. Give me back my lima beans.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 bernadette Oh, my God, have you ever been so embarrassed?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 penny Not recently.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 bernadette I don’t know which was lamer, their roller-skating or their disco dancing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 penny For me, the worst part was when people saw us leave with them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard You had some nice moves out there, Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 howard Thanks. You, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard Yeah. Did you notice all the people looking at us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 howard Not really. I was in my boogie zone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 bernadette When Howard tried to do the splits…
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 penny Shh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard Sorry. I’m moving a little slow. I think I bruised my coccyx.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 penny Oh, poor baby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard Don’t tell Koothrappali. After you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 penny Oh, what a gentleman. Hey, Sheldon. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard Oh, my God! Are you… 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon Good Lord! You’re ruining everything!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 penny Oh, damn.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard Are you okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 penny Do I look okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard Don’t bark at me. I fell, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 penny Oh, you’ve been falling all night. You’re used to it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 howard Sheldon, what the hell are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon The same thing I’ve been doing for three days. Trying to figure out why electrons behave as if they have no mass when travelling through a graphene sheet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 bernadette With marbles?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon Well, I needed something bigger than peas, now, didn’t I?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 bernadette Sheldon, when was the last time you got any sleep?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon I don’t know, two, three days. Not important. I don’t need sleep, I need answers. I need to determine where in this swamp of unbalanced formulas squatteth the toad of truth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 penny Toad of truth? Is that a physics thing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard No, that’s a crazy thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 bernadette Okay, Sheldon. What happens to our neuroreceptors when we don’t get enough REM sleep?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon They lose their sensitivity to serotonin and norepinephrine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 bernadette Which leads to…?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon Impaired cognitive function.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 bernadette Right, so march in there, brush your teeth and go to bed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon But I don’t want to go to bed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 bernadette I’m going to count to three. One…
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon Oh, all right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard That was amazing how you handled him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 bernadette I know how to deal with stubborn children. My mother used to run an illegal day care centre in our basement.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 penny Leonard, you’re… you’re giggling in your sleep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard It’s not me, it’s my new ringtone. The Joker from Batman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 penny Well, it creeps me out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard Me, too, but I paid three bucks for it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 penny Just answer the phone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard Hello. Yeah, I’m Leonard Hofstadter. Yeah, yeah, he’s my roommate. Oh, God, is he okay? Yeah, alright, alright, I’ll be right there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 penny What happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard Sheldon’s escaped and is terrorizing the village.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 penny Okay. Have fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard Hi. I’m Dr. Hofstadter. Where is he?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 security_guard Ball pit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard Thanks for not calling the cops.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 security_guard Oh, hey, it’s no big deal. My sister’s got a kid who’s special.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard Yeah, well, he’s extra special. Hey, Shelly. What you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon Size ratio was all wrong. Couldn’t visualize it. Needed bigger carbon atoms.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard Sure, sure. How did you get into this place?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon Back door has a five-pin tumbler system, single-circuit alarm. Child’s play. You can start sorting protons and neutrons while I build carbon atoms.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard No, I don’t think so. We need to go home now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon But I’m still working.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard If you don’t come out of there, I’m going to have to drag you out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon You can try, but you’ll never catch me. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard For God’s sakes. Sheldon, come here!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon Bazinga. Bazinga. Bazinga. Bazinga. Bazinga.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon Leonard and Penny. Leonard and Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard What! What, what, what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon Leonard and Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon I have good news.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard And you had to barge in here and wake us up in the middle of the night?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon Your cell phone was off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard Because we didn’t want to be disturbed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon And that didn’t work out, did it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 penny Sheldon, what do you want?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon I came to tell you I’ve got the answer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard Really? You figured out the graphene problem?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon No, no, I’m still hopelessly stuck on that, but I figured out how to figure it out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 penny Hey, you know what, Leonard, I know I said I could handle your roommate, but I was wrong. We’re going to have to break up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard What are you talking about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 penny Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon Einstein.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard Yeah, I’m going to need a little more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon Albert Einstein.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard Keep going.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon When Albert Einstein came up with special relativity, he was working at the patent office.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard So, you’re going to go work at the patent office?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon Don’t be absurd. That’s in Washington. You know I could never live in a city whose streets are laid out in a wheel-and-spoke pattern. No. I’m going to find a similarly menial job where my basal ganglia are occupied with a routine task, freeing my prefrontal cortex to work quietly in the background on my problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard Sounds like a great plan.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon Of course it is. Even talking to you is sufficiently menial that I can feel the proverbial juices starting to flow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard Okay, well, thanks for sharing with us. Good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon You’re welcome. Good night to you, too. Oh, by the way, I was watching you sleep for a moment, and I noticed that your snoring seems to be worse when you’re on your back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 penny Leonard doesn’t snore.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon No, I wasn’t talking to Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard Told you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 employment_office_assistant So, Mr. Cooper, you’re looking for a job.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon A menial job. Like yours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 assistant Why, thank you for noticing. I’m Menial Employee of the Month. Do you have a particular field in mind?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon I do. For thousands of years, the lowest classes of the human race have spent their lives labouring to erect monuments under the lash of their betters, until finally they dropped down and became one with the dust through which they trudged. Do you have anything like that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 assistant No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon Shouldn’t you check your database?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 assistant No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon You didn’t really type.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 assistant I didn’t really have to. So, how about construction?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon Oh, that would be good! Sawing, hammering, eating out of a lunch pail as my working-class fellows and I sit perched precariously on a girder high above the metropolis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 assistant No, no. This is putting up sheetrock at a housing project in Rosemead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon I could do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 assistant Good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon One question.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 assistant Yes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon What’s sheetrock?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 assistant Moving on. How about doing deliveries for a florist?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon That seems acceptable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 assistant Do you have your own car?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon I don’t drive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 assistant Of course you don’t. Mr. Cooper, let me just ask you a question. What was your last job?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon Senior theoretical particle physicist at CalTech, focusing on M theory, or, in layman’s terms, string theory.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 assistant I see. Just give me a second. Security!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 penny Okay, I’ll get those drinks started for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon Behind you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 penny Sheldon, what the hell are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon I’m trying to get these tables cleared. We’re slammed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 penny No, wait, wait, no, wait. Wh.. what are you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon A reasonable question. I asked myself, what is the most mind-numbing, pedestrian job conceivable, and three answers came to mind, uh, toll booth attendant, an Apple Store genius, and what Penny does. Now, since I don’t like touching other people’s coins, and I refuse to contribute to the devaluation of the word genius, here I am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 penny You just, you just walked in and they hired you, just like that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon Oh, heavens, no. Since I don’t need to be paid, I didn’t need to be hired. I simply came in, picked up a tray, and started working for the man. Let me get that plate out of your way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 penny Sheldon, this is ridiculous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon Is it? Just a moment ago I had a minor epiphany regarding the polymer degradation phenomenon while scraping congealed nachos off a plate. Bernadette, table 10 wants their check.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 bernadette Thanks, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 penny Sheldon, wait, this isn’t even what I do. I’m a waitress, not a busboy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon You’re right. That is more menial. Hello, I’m Sheldon. I’ll be your server today. I don’t recommend the salmon. I saw it in the kitchen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon All right, one bacon cheeseburger, breaking two Jewish dietary restrictions simultaneously, kudos. Beer-battered fish and chips. Now, here’s your tartar sauce. I also brought you salsa. It’s a little unconventional, but I think you’ll like it. It’s zingy. And for you, Factory Burrito Grande, no cheese, no sour cream, no ugly consequences from your lactose intolerance. Bon appétit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard Hang on. Black beans, not pinto beans?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard Double guacamole?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon Of course.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard No cilantro?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon Nope.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard Lettuce shredded, not chopped?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon Yep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard You understand why I’m doing this to you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon I do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard That’ll be all. That was fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 raj How long can he keep this up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard I heard about this professor at MIT who melted down, bought a van, and spent the rest of his life as a mobile dog groomer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 raj He never went back to the university?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard Only to shampoo Professor Chambourg’s shih tzu.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 raj Sheesh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 howard I bet if we all chipped in, we could buy Sheldon a van.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 raj But he’s afraid of dogs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard Yeah, that’s the only thing wrong with that plan.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 penny Hey, guys, sorry you had to wait, but we are swamped. What’s this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard Sheldon took our order.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 penny Sheldon doesn’t work here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard Well, honey, not to complain, but we were starting to think you didn’t either.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon Is that really necessary? Good Lord. The interference pattern in the fracture. The motion of the wave through the molecular structure. I’ve been looking at it all wrong. I can’t consider the electrons as particles. They move through the graphene as a wave. It’s a wave! The moment to applaud would be now. Troglodytes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 penny Sheldon, where are you going? Aren’t you going to clean this up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 sheldon I’m sorry. I don’t work here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 howard Happy now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 raj I’m on a cloud. Swing me. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode14 leonard Sheldon, come here.
