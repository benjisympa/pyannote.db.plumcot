TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 howard Yeah, I miss you, too, sweetie. Listen, I got to go, but I’ll see you tonight? Okay. Bye-bye. Yeah, bye-bye. No, you hang up first. Hello?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 raj Dude, I’m glad you finally got a girlfriend, but do you have to do all that lovey-dovey stuff in front of those of us who don’t?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon Actually, he might have to. There’s an economic concept known as a positional good in which an object is only valued by the possessor because it’s not possessed by others. The term was coined in 1976 by economist Fred Hirsch to replace the more colloquial, but less precise neener-neener.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 howard That’s not true. My happiness is not dependent on my best friend being miserable and alone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 raj Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 howard Although, I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t a little bit of a perk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard Who’s miserable and alone?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 raj Me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard Oh. I used to be like that. Then I got a girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon In pre-1976 terms, neener-neener.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard Hey, what are you and Bernadette doing for your first Valentine’s Day?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 howard Yeah, I am pulling out all the stops. There’s a $39.95 lover’s special at P.F. Chang’s. Egg rolls, dumplings, bottomless wok, and you get your picture taken on the big marble horse out front.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon Given that Saint Valentine was a third century Roman priest who was stoned and beheaded, wouldn’t a more appropriate celebration of the evening be taking one’s steady gal to witness a brutal murder?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 howard I understand your point, but given a choice, Jews always go with Chinese food.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 raj Well, if anyone’s interested, I’ll be spending this Valentine’s Day the same way I spend every Valentine’s Day. Buying a rotisserie chicken from the supermarket, taking it home, standing over the sink and eating it out of the package with my bare hands like an animal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 raj Fine, tell us you’re going to have sex with Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard That’s not what I was going to tell you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 raj It’s okay. I don’t mind hearing about your sex life. It’s his that bugs me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard Guess who the university is sending to Switzerland to attend a conference and see the CERN supercollider on February 14?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon Professor Norton, although, God knows why. He hasn’t published anything of note since he won that Nobel Prize.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard Actually, Professor Norton can’t make it. He threw his back out rock climbing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 howard I heard he threw his back out climbing on his new girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 raj The big-boobed weather girl on Channel 2?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 howard That’s the one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard In any case, they’re asking me to fill in for him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon In Switzerland or with the big-boobed weather girl?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard Switzerland. And I get to bring a guest!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 howard Oh, man!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 raj No way, dude!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon This is incredible! I’m so happy, I’m not even going to question their judgment in picking you. I’m just going to run home and start packing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 raj Why wouldn’t you take Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard I am taking Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 raj Oh. Well, then I anticipate an awkward situation when you get home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard Sheldon, you got a minute?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon Of course, my good friend. Come in. Help me out, which ski hat says après supercollider?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard Sheldon, I’m not taking you to Switzerland.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon Well, of course you are. Who else would you take?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon What? That’s absurd. Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard Yes, but it’ll be Valentine’s Day. We can go sightseeing and skiing and make love in front of a roaring fire in the shadow of the snowcapped Alps.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon But Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard I’m sorry, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon Sorry? I’ve been dreaming about going to the Large Hadron Collider since I was nine years old.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard Yeah, well, I’ve been dreaming about spending Valentine’s Day with a girl since I was six.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon Shame on you! That’s no dream for a scientist!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Okay, what’s the big surprise?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard Just a minute. This tray contains clues as to what you and I are going to be doing on Valentine’s Day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Oh. Wow. Okay. Let’s see. We’ve got, uh, milk chocolate, Swiss cheese, fondue. My lactose-intolerant boyfriend is going to eat all this, then I’m going to climb on his back and rocket to the moon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard No. But it does involve air travel. Okay, um, let me slice this Swiss cheese with my Swiss army knife, and then you can wash it down with a cup of Swiss Miss instant cocoa.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Okay, I’m starting to think Swiss is key here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard Uh-huh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny We’re going to Disneyland and ride the Matterhorn?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard How does that involve air travel?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny We’re going to Disney World and ride the Matterhorn?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Okay, sweetie, this started out fun, but I’m over it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard We’re going to Switzerland to see the CERN supercollider! And ski. We’ll also go skiing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny We’re going skiing in Switzerland?!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard Well, you’ll ski, I’ll fall, but, yeah, we will be in Switzerland for Valentine’s Day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Oh, my God, Leonard! That’s incredible!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon Not so fast. You might want to hold off on lighting your rabeliechtli, Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny My Rabe-what-ly?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon Rabeliechtli. It means turnip light and refers to a traditional lantern hand-carved from a root vegetable and used to celebrate certain Swiss festivals. Which you will not be celebrating because, A, these festivals occur in the fall, and B, you will not be going to Switzerland.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard Sheldon, we’ve been through this. I’m taking Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon Afraid not. Do you recognize this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard Not the roommate agreement.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon Indeed, the roommate agreement. I call your attention to the Friendship Rider in Appendix C, Future Commitments. Number 37, in the event one friend is ever invited to visit the Large Hadron Collider, now under construction in Switzerland, he shall invite the other friend to accompany him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard Oh, for God’s sakes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny You actually put that in an agreement?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard Yeah. We also put in what happens if one of us wins a MacArthur Grant, or if one of us gets superpowers, or if one of us is bitten by a zombie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon He can’t kill me, even if I turn.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Is there anything in there about if one of you gets a girlfriend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon No, that seemed a little farfetched.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard Sheldon, do you really expect to enforce this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon I’ve lived up to all my commitments under the agreement. At least once a day I ask how you are, even though I simply don’t care. I no longer stage spontaneous biohazard drills after 10 pm And I abandoned my goal to master Tuvan throat singing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Okay, I know I shouldn’t ask, but what is…?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon I’d be much further along if I’d been allowed to practice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard Look, Sheldon, I know it’s in the agreement, and if you turn into a zombie, I promise I will not kill you. In fact, I’ll even let you eat my brains. But I am taking Penny to Switzerland.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon Is that your final decision?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard It is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon Very well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny It’s not over, is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard What do you think? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard Got a bit of traffic this morning, huh? Think it’s gonna rain? Instead of underpants, I covered my crotch with potato salad this morning. Thoughts? Okay, I know what’ll cheer you up, let’s play one of your driving games.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon All right. This game is called Traitors. I will name three historical figures, you put them in order of the heinousness of their betrayal. Benedict Arnold, Judas, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard You really think I belong with Benedict Arnold and Judas?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon You’re right. Judas had the decency to hang himself after what he did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard Come on, Sheldon. Can’t you at least try to understand how much this means to me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon Round two, Leonard Hofstadter, Darth Vader, Rupert Murdoch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard Rupert Murdoch?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon He owns Fox, and they cancelled Firefly. Hint, he and Darth Vader are tied for number 2.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 howard I’m sorry I couldn’t hang with you last night. I had a date with Bernadette.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 raj I know. I saw the Tweet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 howard So, what did you end up doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 raj Not much. Nuked a burrito. Prayed to the Hindu god Urvashi that your bowels would loosen and your penis would droop like a willow tree.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard You seen Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 raj No. Is he still mad about the supercollider?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard Yeah. He thinks I betrayed him. I mean, come on, what would you guys do if you were me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 howard I’d take Sheldon to Switzerland.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard Seriously?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 howard Absolutely. And I’d leave him there. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 raj What the hell is that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard Uh, let’s see. Yup, 30 pieces of silverware.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon Morning, old chum.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon I’ve made you breakfast. Juice, coffee, and pancakes in the shape of some of your favorite fictional characters. See, here’s Frodo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard You made Frodo pancakes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon Yeah, I used coconut shavings to do the hair on his feet. If you need to void your bladder before eating, I can keep them warm with this beret that I thoroughly laundered and pressed into service as a pancake cosy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard Why are you doing this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon It’s by way of an apology for my recent behaviour. I’ve had some time to reflect and I’ve come to realize that friendship is not an aggregation of written agreements. It’s a result of two people respecting and caring for each other. Butterscotch scone?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard Thanks. It’s good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon What you’re tasting is respect and affection. And about a pound of Crisco. After you’ve finished breakfast, I thought we could spend the day watching the final season of Babylon 5 with director commentary.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard You hate Babylon 5.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon I do. It fails as drama, science fiction, and it’s hopelessly derivative. But you like it, and you’re my friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard Okay, great. Still not taking you to Switzerland.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon Drat. No Frodo for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon Alright, let’s dispense with the friendly banter, I believe you know why I’m here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Well, I always figured it was to study us, discover our weaknesses, and report back to your alien overlords.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon Yes, amusing. Extraordinary intelligence might well appear extraterrestrial to you, but let me be more specific. I believe you know why I’m here in the laundry room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Better acoustics for your throat singing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon It’s actually not bad. But my true purpose in being here will be revealed in this brief PowerPoint presentation. Lights. Why Sheldon Cooper, PhD, should go to Switzerland to see the CERN supercollider. A PowerPoint presentation by Sheldon Cooper, PhD.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Oh, for God’s sakes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon Here we have a highly gifted researcher in the field of particle physics whose work has brought him to the precipice of forever changing mankind’s understanding of the universe. AKA me. And here we have a waitress brushing her teeth with her finger. AKA you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny I’m sorry. Is this supposed to be buttering me up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon Please hold all questions to the end of the presentation. This is the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland, the product of decades of planning and construction. It is a Mecca for physicists the world over. This is Bath and Body Works on Colorado Boulevard. They sell scented soaps and lotions, some of which contain glitter. Now, let’s see if we can match the individual to the appropriate destination.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Okay, show’s over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon No, it’s not. I’ve got five more slides.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Sheldon, this is Leonard’s decision. He invited me to Switzerland, and I intend to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon Very well. Enjoy yourself. You’re going to be in the presence of something that I’ve dreamed of seeing for decades. I just hope you’ll be able to appreciate the magnitude of where you are and what it represents.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny I’ll talk to Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon You will?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Yes. If it means that much to you, you should go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon Oh, Penny, thank you!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny You’re welcome.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon Since I rarely hug, I’m relying on your expertise regarding duration.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny I think we’re there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon Oh, good. Bye-bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 raj You know what? Even though I don’t have a girlfriend, I can still have a good time on Valentine’s Day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 howard Trust me, you can’t. I’ve tried.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 raj No, no, no, I’m going to have a me day. First I’m going to go to one of those spas in Koreatown, take a steam and get a massage. Then I’m going to stop at a pet store and get licked by puppies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard Sheldon, I need to talk to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon All right, my friend. Would you like some cholermus?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard Some what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon Cholermus. It’s a traditional Swiss breakfast dish. I’m preparing my gastrointestinal system for the exotic cuisine of Switzerland.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard You’re not going to Switzerland!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon Oh, but I am. Didn’t Penny tell you the good news?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard She told me that you went behind my back to guilt her into letting you go instead of her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon Yes, that good news.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard Well, forget it. I was the one who was invited, I get to decide who goes with me, and it’s Penny, not you!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon Howard, could you lower the lights? I have a short PowerPoint presentation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard I don’t need to see your presentation. This discussion is over!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon That’s a somewhat ambiguous response. Am I going or not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard Sheldon, at this point, I would go by myself before I would take you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard Yeah, really.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon Well then, you leave me no alternative. From this moment forward, we can be roommates, but we will no longer be friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard I’m sorry you feel that way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon I don’t think you’re fully aware of the ramifications here, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard Why don’t you enlighten me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon With the friendship clause of our roommate agreement nullified you are no longer entitled to accompany me to go swimming at Bill Gates’ house should I be invited.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 howard Ooh, that’s gotta sting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard Just think, this time tomorrow we’ll be in Geneva, Switzerland for our first Valentine’s Day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny I know! I went shopping today and bought special undies for the occasion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard Thermal? ‘Cause it’s gonna be cold.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Think it through, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard Oh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Oh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard Gesundheit. Or as they say in Switzerland, gesundheit. You getting a cold?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny No, no, it’s probably just allergies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard Do you want an allergy pill? ‘Cause I have ’em all. Prescription, nonprescription, foreign, domestic, experimental.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Do any of them work?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard Not really, I’m just an enthusiast.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard Penny? You okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Did that sound okay to you? Do not come in here!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny I’m having a tea party. What do you think’s going on? I think I might have the flu. Or the plague.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard Well, our plane leaves at 9 a.m. Do you think you’ll feel better by then?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Yep. ‘Cause I’m gonna be dead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard Hey, Sheldon? Listen, Penny is pretty sick and she’s not going to be able to go to Switzerland. So if you’re still interested, you’re welcome to come. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon Great. I’ll start packing. In a minute. Oh, look, it’s the cholermus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Here’s your soup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon Chicken?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon With the little stars?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon Heated to 180 degrees?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Why don’t I pour it in your lap, and you can tell me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon You don’t have to be mean. I’m sick.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Yeah, well, I’m sick, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon Not my problem. I just don’t understand how this happened to me. I’m scrupulous about my hygiene. I regularly disinfect my hands, and I avoid contact with other people on general principle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny I don’t know what to tell you, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon It’s you! I touched you!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Happy Valentine’s Day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 raj Oh, my goodness, look at this room! Champagne! Roses! Oh, and little chocolates! This is going to be the best Valentine’s Day ever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard Yeah, I forgot about all this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 raj But I never will.
