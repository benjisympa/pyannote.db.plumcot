TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Yeah, I miss you, too, sweetie. Listen, I got to go, but I’ll see you tonight? Okay. Bye-bye. Yeah, bye-bye. No, you hang up first. Hello?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Dude, I’m glad you finally got a girlfriend, but do you have to do all that lovey-dovey stuff in front of those of us who don’t?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Actually, he might have to. There’s an economic concept known as a positional good in which an object is only valued by the possessor because it’s not possessed by others. The term was coined in 1976 by economist Fred Hirsch to replace the more colloquial, but less precise neener-neener.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 howard_wolowitz That’s not true. My happiness is not dependent on my best friend being miserable and alone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Although, I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t a little bit of a perk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Who’s miserable and alone?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Oh. I used to be like that. Then I got a girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper In pre-1976 terms, neener-neener.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Hey, what are you and Bernadette doing for your first Valentine’s Day?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Yeah, I am pulling out all the stops. There’s a $39.95 lover’s special at P.F. Chang’s. Egg rolls, dumplings, bottomless wok, and you get your picture taken on the big marble horse out front.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Given that Saint Valentine was a third century Roman priest who was stoned and beheaded, wouldn’t a more appropriate celebration of the evening be taking one’s steady gal to witness a brutal murder?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 howard_wolowitz I understand your point, but given a choice, Jews always go with Chinese food.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Well, if anyone’s interested, I’ll be spending this Valentine’s Day the same way I spend every Valentine’s Day. Buying a rotisserie chicken from the supermarket, taking it home, standing over the sink and eating it out of the package with my bare hands like an animal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Fine, tell us you’re going to have sex with Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter That’s not what I was going to tell you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 raj_koothrappali It’s okay. I don’t mind hearing about your sex life. It’s his that bugs me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Guess who the university is sending to Switzerland to attend a conference and see the CERN supercollider on February 14?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Professor Norton, although, God knows why. He hasn’t published anything of note since he won that Nobel Prize.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Actually, Professor Norton can’t make it. He threw his back out rock climbing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 howard_wolowitz I heard he threw his back out climbing on his new girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 raj_koothrappali The big-boobed weather girl on Channel 2?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 howard_wolowitz That’s the one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter In any case, they’re asking me to fill in for him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper In Switzerland or with the big-boobed weather girl?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Switzerland. And I get to bring a guest!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Oh, man!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 raj_koothrappali No way, dude!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper This is incredible! I’m so happy, I’m not even going to question their judgment in picking you. I’m just going to run home and start packing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Why wouldn’t you take Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter I am taking Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Oh. Well, then I anticipate an awkward situation when you get home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, you got a minute?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Of course, my good friend. Come in. Help me out, which ski hat says après supercollider?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, I’m not taking you to Switzerland.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Well, of course you are. Who else would you take?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper What? That’s absurd. Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Yes, but it’ll be Valentine’s Day. We can go sightseeing and skiing and make love in front of a roaring fire in the shadow of the snowcapped Alps.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper But Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter I’m sorry, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Sorry? I’ve been dreaming about going to the Large Hadron Collider since I was nine years old.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, well, I’ve been dreaming about spending Valentine’s Day with a girl since I was six.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Shame on you! That’s no dream for a scientist!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Okay, what’s the big surprise?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Just a minute. This tray contains clues as to what you and I are going to be doing on Valentine’s Day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Oh. Wow. Okay. Let’s see. We’ve got, uh, milk chocolate, Swiss cheese, fondue. My lactose-intolerant boyfriend is going to eat all this, then I’m going to climb on his back and rocket to the moon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter No. But it does involve air travel. Okay, um, let me slice this Swiss cheese with my Swiss army knife, and then you can wash it down with a cup of Swiss Miss instant cocoa.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Okay, I’m starting to think Swiss is key here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Uh-huh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny We’re going to Disneyland and ride the Matterhorn?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter How does that involve air travel?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny We’re going to Disney World and ride the Matterhorn?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Okay, sweetie, this started out fun, but I’m over it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter We’re going to Switzerland to see the CERN supercollider! And ski. We’ll also go skiing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny We’re going skiing in Switzerland?!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Well, you’ll ski, I’ll fall, but, yeah, we will be in Switzerland for Valentine’s Day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Oh, my God, Leonard! That’s incredible!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Not so fast. You might want to hold off on lighting your rabeliechtli, Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny My Rabe-what-ly?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Rabeliechtli. It means turnip light and refers to a traditional lantern hand-carved from a root vegetable and used to celebrate certain Swiss festivals. Which you will not be celebrating because, A, these festivals occur in the fall, and B, you will not be going to Switzerland.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, we’ve been through this. I’m taking Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Afraid not. Do you recognize this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Not the roommate agreement.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Indeed, the roommate agreement. I call your attention to the Friendship Rider in Appendix C, Future Commitments. Number 37, in the event one friend is ever invited to visit the Large Hadron Collider, now under construction in Switzerland, he shall invite the other friend to accompany him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Oh, for God’s sakes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny You actually put that in an agreement?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Yeah. We also put in what happens if one of us wins a MacArthur Grant, or if one of us gets superpowers, or if one of us is bitten by a zombie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper He can’t kill me, even if I turn.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Is there anything in there about if one of you gets a girlfriend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper No, that seemed a little farfetched.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, do you really expect to enforce this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper I’ve lived up to all my commitments under the agreement. At least once a day I ask how you are, even though I simply don’t care. I no longer stage spontaneous biohazard drills after 10 pm And I abandoned my goal to master Tuvan throat singing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Okay, I know I shouldn’t ask, but what is…?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper I’d be much further along if I’d been allowed to practice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Look, Sheldon, I know it’s in the agreement, and if you turn into a zombie, I promise I will not kill you. In fact, I’ll even let you eat my brains. But I am taking Penny to Switzerland.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Is that your final decision?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter It is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Very well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny It’s not over, is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter What do you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Got a bit of traffic this morning, huh? Think it’s gonna rain? Instead of underpants, I covered my crotch with potato salad this morning. Thoughts? Okay, I know what’ll cheer you up, let’s play one of your driving games.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper All right. This game is called Traitors. I will name three historical figures, you put them in order of the heinousness of their betrayal. Benedict Arnold, Judas, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter You really think I belong with Benedict Arnold and Judas?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper You’re right. Judas had the decency to hang himself after what he did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Come on, Sheldon. Can’t you at least try to understand how much this means to me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Round two, Leonard Hofstadter, Darth Vader, Rupert Murdoch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Rupert Murdoch?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper He owns Fox, and they cancelled Firefly. Hint, he and Darth Vader are tied for number 2.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 howard_wolowitz I’m sorry I couldn’t hang with you last night. I had a date with Bernadette.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 raj_koothrappali I know. I saw the Tweet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 howard_wolowitz So, what did you end up doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Not much. Nuked a burrito. Prayed to the Hindu god Urvashi that your bowels would loosen and your penis would droop like a willow tree.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter You seen Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 raj_koothrappali No. Is he still mad about the supercollider?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Yeah. He thinks I betrayed him. I mean, come on, what would you guys do if you were me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 howard_wolowitz I’d take Sheldon to Switzerland.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Seriously?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Absolutely. And I’d leave him there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 raj_koothrappali What the hell is that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Uh, let’s see. Yup, 30 pieces of silverware.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Morning, old chum.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper I’ve made you breakfast. Juice, coffee, and pancakes in the shape of some of your favorite fictional characters. See, here’s Frodo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter You made Frodo pancakes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Yeah, I used coconut shavings to do the hair on his feet. If you need to void your bladder before eating, I can keep them warm with this beret that I thoroughly laundered and pressed into service as a pancake cosy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Why are you doing this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper It’s by way of an apology for my recent behaviour. I’ve had some time to reflect and I’ve come to realize that friendship is not an aggregation of written agreements. It’s a result of two people respecting and caring for each other. Butterscotch scone?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Thanks. It’s good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper What you’re tasting is respect and affection. And about a pound of Crisco. After you’ve finished breakfast, I thought we could spend the day watching the final season of Babylon 5 with director commentary.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter You hate Babylon 5.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper I do. It fails as drama, science fiction, and it’s hopelessly derivative. But you like it, and you’re my friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Okay, great. Still not taking you to Switzerland.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Drat. No Frodo for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Alright, let’s dispense with the friendly banter, I believe you know why I’m here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Well, I always figured it was to study us, discover our weaknesses, and report back to your alien overlords.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Yes, amusing. Extraordinary intelligence might well appear extraterrestrial to you, but let me be more specific. I believe you know why I’m here in the laundry room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Better acoustics for your throat singing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper It’s actually not bad. But my true purpose in being here will be revealed in this brief PowerPoint presentation. Lights. Why Sheldon Cooper, PhD, should go to Switzerland to see the CERN supercollider. A PowerPoint presentation by Sheldon Cooper, PhD.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Oh, for God’s sakes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Here we have a highly gifted researcher in the field of particle physics whose work has brought him to the precipice of forever changing mankind’s understanding of the universe. AKA me. And here we have a waitress brushing her teeth with her finger. AKA you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny I’m sorry. Is this supposed to be buttering me up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Please hold all questions to the end of the presentation. This is the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland, the product of decades of planning and construction. It is a Mecca for physicists the world over. This is Bath and Body Works on Colorado Boulevard. They sell scented soaps and lotions, some of which contain glitter. Now, let’s see if we can match the individual to the appropriate destination.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Okay, show’s over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper No, it’s not. I’ve got five more slides.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Sheldon, this is Leonard’s decision. He invited me to Switzerland, and I intend to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Very well. Enjoy yourself. You’re going to be in the presence of something that I’ve dreamed of seeing for decades. I just hope you’ll be able to appreciate the magnitude of where you are and what it represents.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny I’ll talk to Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper You will?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Yes. If it means that much to you, you should go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Oh, Penny, thank you!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny You’re welcome.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Since I rarely hug, I’m relying on your expertise regarding duration.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny I think we’re there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Oh, good. Bye-bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 raj_koothrappali You know what? Even though I don’t have a girlfriend, I can still have a good time on Valentine’s Day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Trust me, you can’t. I’ve tried.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 raj_koothrappali No, no, no, I’m going to have a me day. First I’m going to go to one of those spas in Koreatown, take a steam and get a massage. Then I’m going to stop at a pet store and get licked by puppies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, I need to talk to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper All right, my friend. Would you like some cholermus?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Some what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Cholermus. It’s a traditional Swiss breakfast dish. I’m preparing my gastrointestinal system for the exotic cuisine of Switzerland.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter You’re not going to Switzerland!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Oh, but I am. Didn’t Penny tell you the good news?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter She told me that you went behind my back to guilt her into letting you go instead of her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Yes, that good news.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Well, forget it. I was the one who was invited, I get to decide who goes with me, and it’s Penny, not you!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Howard, could you lower the lights? I have a short PowerPoint presentation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter I don’t need to see your presentation. This discussion is over!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper That’s a somewhat ambiguous response. Am I going or not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, at this point, I would go by myself before I would take you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, really.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Well then, you leave me no alternative. From this moment forward, we can be roommates, but we will no longer be friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter I’m sorry you feel that way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper I don’t think you’re fully aware of the ramifications here, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Why don’t you enlighten me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper With the friendship clause of our roommate agreement nullified you are no longer entitled to accompany me to go swimming at Bill Gates’ house should I be invited.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Ooh, that’s gotta sting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Just think, this time tomorrow we’ll be in Geneva, Switzerland for our first Valentine’s Day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny I know! I went shopping today and bought special undies for the occasion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Thermal? ‘Cause it’s gonna be cold.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Think it through, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Oh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Oh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Gesundheit. Or as they say in Switzerland, gesundheit. You getting a cold?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny No, no, it’s probably just allergies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Do you want an allergy pill? ‘Cause I have ’em all. Prescription, nonprescription, foreign, domestic, experimental.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Do any of them work?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Not really, I’m just an enthusiast.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Penny? You okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Did that sound okay to you? Do not come in here!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny I’m having a tea party. What do you think’s going on? I think I might have the flu. Or the plague.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Well, our plane leaves at 9 a.m. Do you think you’ll feel better by then?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Yep. ‘Cause I’m gonna be dead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Hey, Sheldon? Listen, Penny is pretty sick and she’s not going to be able to go to Switzerland. So if you’re still interested, you’re welcome to come.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Great. I’ll start packing. In a minute. Oh, look, it’s the cholermus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Here’s your soup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Chicken?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper With the little stars?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Heated to 180 degrees?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Why don’t I pour it in your lap, and you can tell me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper You don’t have to be mean. I’m sick.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Yeah, well, I’m sick, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Not my problem. I just don’t understand how this happened to me. I’m scrupulous about my hygiene. I regularly disinfect my hands, and I avoid contact with other people on general principle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny I don’t know what to tell you, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 sheldon_cooper It’s you! I touched you!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 penny Happy Valentine’s Day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Oh, my goodness, look at this room! Champagne! Roses! Oh, and little chocolates! This is going to be the best Valentine’s Day ever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I forgot about all this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode15 raj_koothrappali But I never will.
