TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 leonard Will you please turn your shirt off?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 raj What? I’m giving myself dramatic entrance music. People will know I’m awesome and to be feared.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 howard Yeah, right, there’s nothing more awesome and frightening than a man who’s got music blasting from between his nipples.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 leonard Hey, Stuart, what’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 stuart Well, you might want to mark your Google calendars. Stan Lee is coming to do a signing on Thursday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon Did he finally write a sequel to his autobiography? I’m sure ages 79 through 87 were just action-packed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 stuart No, just a regular comic signing. My uncle is his dermatologist and Stan’s doing him a favour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon Oh, I don’t want to know that! How can I possibly discuss with Stan Lee the scientific foundations for interstellar flight on a silver surfboard when part of my brain will be scanning his face for signs of contagious skin disease?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 leonard Stan Lee does not have a contagious skin disease.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon Well, look who thinks he’s Stuart’s uncle now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 raj Can’t believe it. We’re going to meet Stan Lee! 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 howard I’m sad to say I taught him those moves.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 leonard I can’t decide whether I want Stan Lee to autograph my Journey into Mystery 83, first appearance of Thor or my Fantastic Four number five, first appearance of Dr. Doom. Alex, I’m going to go with what is… you’re a dumbass? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon I’ve decided I’m going to have Mr. Lee sign my copy of this month’s Batman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 howard That’s crazy. Stan Lee had nothing to do with Batman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon Yes, which is why no one else will ask him to sign one, and I will be the possessor of a unique, albeit confusing, artifact, which will set me apart from the hoi polloi of comic book fandom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 raj That’s a great idea, I’m going to get him to sign a Batman as well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon What is it about the word unique you don’t understand?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 howard Ow! Damn, paper cut. Nothing worse than a paper cut.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 raj Well, obviously you don’t remember your circumcision.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon There’s Neosporin and Band-Aids in my top desk drawer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 howard Why don’t you keep that stuff in the bathroom?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 leonard He does. And in the kitchen. And in the car. And in his pocket.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon Yeah, but the ones in my pocket are mine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny Hi!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 leonard Hey. Guess who’s going to be at the comic bookstore on Thursday?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny Um, can you give me a hint?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 leonard Stan Lee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny Um, Stanley, Stanley, Stanley Tucci?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 leonard No, no, Stan Lee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny Oh, oh, Stan Lee! Cool!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 leonard You have no idea who he is, do you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny Of course I do. You’re an important part of my life and I pay attention to the things you are interested in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 leonard Good, good, so, who’s Stan Lee?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny Um, he was on Star Trek.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 leonard Nope.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny Star Wars?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 leonard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny Um, uh, Stan Lee, oh, he was in those goofy kung fu movies you love so much?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 leonard That’s Bruce Lee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny Oh. So, is this Bruce Lee’s nerdy brother, Stan?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 howard Sheldon, why do you have all these unopened paychecks in your desk?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon Because most of the things I’m planning to buy haven’t been invented yet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 howard But there must be thousands of dollars here. Why don’t you put it in the bank?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon I don’t trust banks. I believe that when the robots rise up, ATMs will lead the charge.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 howard You’ve also got something from the Pasadena Municipal Court.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon Undoubtedly yet another snide response to my repeated letters complaining that the flags in front of the courthouse are flying in the wrong order. From left to right, it’s supposed to be federal, state, and then city of Pasadena.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny I’m sorry. You sent more than one letter about that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon It bothers me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 howard Sheldon, this is a summons.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon A summons for what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 howard Looks like you ran a red light on Marengo Avenue at 9:30 p.m. on November 16. They got you on a traffic camera. Nice picture.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon November 16? Penny, that’s the evening you fell in your bathtub and I had to drive you to the emergency room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny No, it isn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon Yes, it is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny No, it isn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon Penny, I have an eidetic memory. Also, that’s a picture of you in the passenger seat holding your dislocated shoulder.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny Mmm, no, it isn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon Okay, then why is a summons for a traffic violation committed in your car, bearing your license plates, coming to me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny Okay, look, they sent me the ticket. I told them I wasn’t driving and they were all, if it wasn’t you, who was it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon So you betrayed me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny No! It wasn’t a betrayal. It was more of a can’t afford any more points on my license. I already have to buy my insurance from this place in the Cayman Islands.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon But the only reason I was driving your car was because you were in distress and I was rescuing you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny Yes, yes, look, and now you have a photo to remember that heroic day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 leonard It’s not that big a deal. You just go down to the court on Thursday and you pay the fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon I’m not going to pay a fine. That would imply I’m guilty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 howard You are guilty. That one I liked.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon I am not guilty. I only have a learner’s permit, Penny was the teacher. When the light turned yellow she said go, go, go, so I went, went, went.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny Sheldon, I’m sorry. I’ll be happy to reimburse you for the fine. You know, as soon as I get a part in a movie or my own TV series.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon You don’t need to reimburse me because I’m not paying. On Thursday, I will have my day in court and justice will be done. In fact, I’m going to begin preparing my defence right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 howard Okay, he’s going to jail.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 leonard Oh, that’s right. Thursday is Stan Lee Day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon Now you see what you’ve done? Because of you, we’re all going to miss Stan Lee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 leonard Whoa! What do you mean all?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon Well, you’re my friends. You’ll be standing by my side, supporting me, feeding me legal precedents, and if you had the upper body strength, carrying me out on your shoulders when I’m victorious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 leonard Yeah, okay. No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon Are you saying that you will not stand beside me as I plead my case?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 leonard That’s what I’m saying.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon Howard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 howard Wow. Uh, Stan Lee, or you in court? Uh, if this was Sophie’s Choice it would’ve been a much shorter movie. No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon Raj? You’ll be there, won’t you? All right, then, my so-called friends have forsaken me. So, I guess it’ll just be me and my eyewitness.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny Oh, balls.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon Please try to wear something appropriate. It won’t help my case if the judge is busy trying to read the word Juicy scrawled across your buttocks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon Penny. Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon That’s just wrong.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny All right, let’s go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon Wait, hold on. Before we get to the courthouse, I’d like to call on your skills as an actress.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny What is this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon I’ve taken the liberty of scripting your appearance on the witness stand because, let’s face it, you’re somewhat of a loose cannon. Now, don’t worry, it’s written in your vernacular. So shall we rehearse?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny Do I have a choice?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon Well, of course you have a choice. Although we live in a deterministic universe, each individual has free will. Now, sit down. I call your attention to the events of November 16. Do you remember that date?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny Darn tootin’, I do, if the court will excuse my homespun, corn-fed Nebraskan turn of phrase.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon Excellent. Go on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny The reason that date is, like, so totally fixed in my memory is that I had the privilege to be witness to one of the most heroic acts I’ve ever seen in, like, ever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon And who performed that heroic act?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny Why, you did, sir. You. Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and may I add, it is a privilege to know you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon There’s no need for compliments, this court is only interested in the facts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny But it is a fact that it’s a privilege to know you. Totally. A teardrop rolls down my cheek?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon Only a suggestion. A catch in your throat would work just as well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny But it is a fact that it’s a privilege to know you. Totally.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon Maybe you should put on your Juicy pants again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 judge Pay the cashier. Sheldon Cooper?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon Good morning, Your Honour. Dr. Sheldon Cooper appearing in pro se. That is to say, representing himself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 judge I know what it means. I went to law school.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon And yet you wound up in traffic court. Anyway, if it would please the court, I’d like to begin with an opening statement.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 judge The court would advise you to make it quick, as the court had a dicey-looking breakfast burrito this morning and just took an Imodium.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon Very well, a quick opening statement. Like a milking stool, my case rests on three legs. I will demonstrate that I was improperly instructed in driving by a woman whose lack of respect for society borders on the sociopathic. I will argue that the emergency met the legal doctrine of quod est necessarium est licitum, that which is necessary is legal. But first, I will raise a Sixth Amendment issue. I’m unable to confront my accuser, a non-human entity, to wit, a camera. So, to sum up, improper instruction, quod est necessarium est licitum, Sixth Amendment. My milk stool is complete.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 judge Impressive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 judge Guilty. Pay the cashier.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon I object. You’re completely ignoring the law.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 judge No, I’m following the law. I’m ignoring you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon Really? I would point out that I am at the top of my profession, while you preside over the kiddy table of yours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 judge Dr. Cooper, before I find you in contempt and throw you in jail, I’m going to give you a chance to apologize for that last remark.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon I am a scientist. I never apologize for the truth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon That’s my spot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 raj I can’t wait to ask Stan Lee why he insists on giving all his characters first and last names that start with the same letter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 leonard Oh, come on, why would you do that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 raj Bruce Banner, Reed Richards, Sue Storm, Stephen Strange, Otto Octavius, Silver Surfer, Peter Parker, oh, and worst of all, J. Jonah Jameson, Jr.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 howard Okay, I’m cutting. I’m not gonna talk to Stan Lee after you cheese him off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 leonard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny Sheldon’s in jail.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 leonard Sheldon’s in jail?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 raj You called it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 leonard For what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny What do you think? For doing the same crap he always does, except to a judge. He has to stay in there until he apologizes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 leonard So tell him to apologize.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny Oh, gee, thanks, Leonard. That didn’t occur to me. If he doesn’t apologize by 5 o’clock he is going to spend the night in jail.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 leonard Oh, no, that’s terrible. Ooh, the line’s moving. Got to go. Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon Excuse me? Excuse me, jailor?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 guard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon I need to use the restroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 guard Knock yourself out. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon That’s the toilet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 guard Well, it ain’t a wishing well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon Please tell the judge I’m ready to apologize.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 leonard Look at that. To my friend, Leonard, from Stan Lee, Excelsior!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 howard Awesome. Mine says, To my friend, Howard, from Stan Lee, Excelsior!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 raj Mine says, To Raj, from Stan Lee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 howard That’s ’cause you pissed him off about his character names.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 raj Hey, I didn’t even mention Dum Dum Dugan or Green Goblin, Matt Murdock, Pepper Potts, Victor Von Doom, oh, and worst of all, Millie the Model.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny We’re home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 leonard Oh, hey, buddy. How’d it go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon You know very well how it went.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 leonard Yeah, but we all want to hear it from you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon I was found guilty and fined $533.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny I’m going to write you a cheque for that. As long as you promise to put it in your drawer and never cash it, like the others.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon I also now have three points on a driver’s licence I do not yet possess, and I was forced to issue an undeserved apology, simply because I refuse to urinate in a stainless steel bowl in front of criminals.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 howard Plus, you didn’t get to meet Stan Lee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 leonard Okay, that’s enough, Howard. The poor guy’s had a tough time. He had to spend the entire afternoon in jail wearing that suit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 howard You’re right, so it would be cruel to mention that after he finished signing autographs, Stan Lee took Stuart and us out for gelato.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon You had gelato with Stan Lee?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 howard He said we could call him Stan.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 leonard Except for Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon Well, I hope you’re satisfied, Penny. You are responsible for all the evil that has befallen me today.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny Okay, I realize that…
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon Not finished. It is because of you that I now have a criminal record, and it is because of you that I missed out on having gelato with Stan Lee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny Okay, maybe you’ll have another chance to have…
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon No, no. I will never have another chance to have gelato with Stan Lee because opportunities to have gelato with Stan Lee come but once in a lifetime. The moving finger writes, and having writ, moves on!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny Did he just somehow give me the finger?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 howard Not just the finger. The moving finger.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny Hey, Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 stuart Oh, hey, Penny. Wow. Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 stuart Nothing. I’m just getting ready to close up and head out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny Ah. Cool. Got any fun plans?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 stuart Oh, yeah. Big night tonight. Gonna share a can of tuna with the cat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny Oh, nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 stuart Not even my cat. I just feed it. Some nights it doesn’t even show up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny Oh, okay. Well, I was hoping, um, you could do me a favour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 stuart Sure, yeah, name it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny Well, I’m kind of responsible for Sheldon missing Stan Lee, and I really want to make it up to him. So I was hoping you could give me his phone number so maybe I can arrange for them to meet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 stuart Oh, I’m sorry, I don’t have his phone number.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny Hmm. Damn. All right. Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 stuart Mm-hmm. Wait. I have his address.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny Really? Great!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 stuart But I can’t give it to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny Then why did you tell me you had it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 stuart I don’t know. Just chatting. You’re looking at a guy who could very well get stood up by a stray cat tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny I’m sorry, Stuart. Thanks anyway.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 stuart Mm-hmm. Wait.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny Yeah?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 stuart Maybe we can make a deal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny What kind of deal?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 stuart I will give you the address if you go to my cousin’s wedding with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny You’re extorting a date out of me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 stuart I kind of have to. The cousin who’s getting married is the cousin I usually go to weddings with.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny Can I bring Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 stuart Sure. What the hell.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny Deal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 stuart We’ll tell people he’s your cousin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon This is Stan Lee’s front door. We were on Stan Lee’s curb, then we were on Stan Lee’s walk, and now we’re at Stan Lee’s front door.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny Yup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 sheldon Oh, Lord, you just rang Stan Lee’s doorbell. At Stan Lee’s house. We’re about to go in and have milk and cookies with Stan Lee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode16 penny Okay, sweetie, I don’t know if we’re gonna have cookies.
