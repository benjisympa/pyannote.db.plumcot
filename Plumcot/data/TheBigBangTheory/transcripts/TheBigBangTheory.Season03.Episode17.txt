TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Why do I always have to carry the heavy stuff?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Well, it’s very simple. In our ragtag band of scientists with nothing to lose, I’m the smart one, Wolowitz is the funny one, and Koothrappali is the lovable foreigner who struggles to understand our ways and fails. That leaves you, by default, as the muscle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter One more floor, and I’d be the pulled muscle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 penny Oh, it’s about time, I’m starving.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Uh, well, we didn’t actually get Chinese food.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 penny Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Don’t panic, this is better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 penny Oh, no, you didn’t trade the food for magic beans, did you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Of course not. And, technically, magic beans would be food, although eating them would be quite a waste, since you could plant them and overnight have a giant beanstalk, which would provide enough roughage for a small city.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 penny Yeah, sometimes I don’t listen, sometimes I just watch your jaw go up and down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter We were on our way to the Chinese restaurant when we thought we saw Adam West, so we followed him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 penny Who’s Adam West?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Who’s Adam West? Leonard, what do the two of you talk about after the coitus?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 howard_wolowitz My guess is, “Hey, four minutes! New record!” That’s why I’m the funny one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Anyway, we followed the guy to this garage sale, and they had the coolest stuff.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 howard_wolowitz They were closing up. We got this whole box for sixty bucks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter We didn’t even get to go through it all. There could be anything in here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 penny There a new girlfriend in there? ‘Cause you might need one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter No. But there is an original final draft Ghostbusters script with actual slime stains! Oh, you’re right, it’s Ghostbusters 2. Never mind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Oh, my God. An Alf doll. When I was 11 my mother got me one to help me sleep after my dad left. I used to pretend that my dad had moved to the planet Melmac, and Alf was going to bring him back to me. But he never did. Where’s my daddy, puppet? Where is he?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 penny That is so sad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 sheldon_cooper No, what’s sad is that you don’t know Adam West was TV’s Batman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Here’s Spock’s head with no body. Here’s Mr. T’s body with no head. Oh, yeah, here’s Spock’s body with Mr. T’s head. I pity the fool who’s illogical.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 penny Okay, I’m just gonna go home and make a grilled cheese and window-shop on eHarmony.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Okay, bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 penny Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Ooh, look, an Indiana Jones connect-the-dots.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 raj_koothrappali And an Aquaman action figure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Looks like someone drew a penis on him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Huh? That’ll come off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 howard_wolowitz You see what you’re doing? Stop that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Fascinating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 sheldon_cooper It appears to be a Lord of the Rings ring.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 raj_koothrappali It’s even got the Elvish engraving on it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 sheldon_cooper It’s not Elvish. It’s the language of Mordor written in Elvish script. One Ring to
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 raj_koothrappali One Ring to find them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 howard_wolowitz One Ring to bring them all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter And in the darkness bind them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Holy crap, are we nerdy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 howard_wolowitz So, I was doing some checking on the ring.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Hold on. Sheldon, is there ketchup on that table?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Yes, there is. Oh, here’s a fun fact, ketchup started out as a general term for sauce, typically made of, uh, mushrooms or fish brine with herbs and spices. Some popular early main ingredients included blueberry, anchovy, oyster, kidney bean and grape.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 raj_koothrappali No, that’s okay. I’ll get it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Listen, I was looking at the ring, and it seemed a little weird. No copyright notice on it. So, I took it down to this buddy of mine who deals with, shall we say, the seedy underbelly of the collectibles world.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Seedy underbelly?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 howard_wolowitz You know, your black market phasers, your screen-worn Lieutenant Uhura panties, that kind of stuff.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Who’s this mysterious buddy you suddenly have?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Just a guy. I know a guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Is it Eddie Crispo?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 howard_wolowitz No, I can’t tell you who it is. Stop asking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Who else could it be? It has to be Eddie Crispo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 howard_wolowitz I know lots of dangerous people, okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Name one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Eddie Crispo. Anyway, he said this isn’t a replica. It’s the real deal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 sheldon_cooper If you’re suggesting that that is the actual ring of power forged by Sauron in Mount Doom, I look at you with an expression of exhaustion and ever so slight amusement.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter He’s not saying it’s a magic ring. You’re not, are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 howard_wolowitz No, but it’s close. Look at the markings inside. Those are production markings. Nine rings were made for use in the Lord of the Rings movies. Three were given to members of the cast. The rest were destroyed. Except one. One was stolen. Gentlemen, this is the one ring.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Mine!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter No, it is not yours. We all went in on the box together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Well, yes, but I found it in the box, and the laws of maritime salvage clearly state that the finder of a sunken treasure is the owner of the treasure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter How is this maritime salvage?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Other than the lack of water, how is it not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Wait, wait. Sheldon, stop being crazy for a second. How much is something like this worth?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Well, it’s tough to say since it’s hot, but on the underground market, my guy figures…
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Your guy Eddie Crispo?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Yes. He figures ten, maybe 15 thousand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Okay, that’s a lot of money. The wise thing to do is invest it in something practical. Like a jet ski.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Why do you want a jet ski?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 raj_koothrappali All the wealthy and beautiful people in movies ride Jet Skis. That can’t just be a coincidence.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 sheldon_cooper We can’t sell it. We have to keep it and love it and polish it, and only take it out occasionally when we go to the park and re-enact our favourite scenes from the movies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 howard_wolowitz It’s sad how great that sounds.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Guys, it’s stolen. It should go back to Peter Jackson. He made the movies, it belongs to him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Fine. He can have it back as long as he promises to make me a hobbit in his next movie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 raj_koothrappali There are no Jewish hobbits.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Clearly, you’ve never been to my house for dinner on Rosh Hashanah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter We are not blackmailing Peter J… All right, where’s the ring?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 sheldon_cooper You mean my ring?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 sheldon_cooper The ring was unguarded, it was just sitting on the table, anyone could have taken it. Proof? I did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Give me that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Look, let’s be reasonable. We all want to do different things with the ring, but your ideas are stupid, and I want a jet ski.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 sheldon_cooper I found it. The ring is mine. I don’t understand why in this group I never get my way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter You always get your way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 sheldon_cooper I’ll stipulate to that if you give me the ring.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 penny Hey, guys. Enjoying your food that I actually brought you instead of promising food, but bringing you a box of random crap?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, it’s delicious, the sarcasm’s a little stale, though. Hey, how about this? Until we figure out what to do with the ring, Penny holds on to it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 penny What ring?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter This ring.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Looking for something?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Will you hold on to this for a couple of days?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 penny Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter It’s a prop from a movie, and we’re kind of fighting over it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 penny Okay, just to be clear, the first piece of jewellery my boyfriend gives me is a prop from a movie, and I don’t even get to keep it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 howard_wolowitz If you had gone out with me three years ago, by now, you’d have my great Aunt Ida’s brooch that she smuggled out of occupied Belgium in a cat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter How am I looking now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Ow! You hit me! I’m bleeding!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter What was that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 penny Sheldon tried to take the ring and I punched him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter That’s my girl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 howard_wolowitz So, Sheldon, how’s it feel to get beaten up by a girl?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Gentlemen, have you come to the realization that the only reasonable course of action is to sell the ring and divide the money?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 raj_koothrappali I was afraid of that. Go ahead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 man_on_screen#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 Greetings from Mumbai. I am Raj’s attorney, Venkatesh Koothrappali.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Also my cousin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 howard_wolowitz You brought a lawyer?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 venkatesh_koothrappali Don’t answer that. I’ll get straight to the point. My client’s prepared to surrender any interest he has in the ring in exchange for two Kawasaki Jet Skis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter We’re not giving him two Jet Skis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 venkatesh_koothrappali Look, we’re big boys, why don’t we just cut to the chase and meet in the middle? One Kawasaki Jet Ski, done and done.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter No Jet Skis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 venkatesh_koothrappali All right, forget the Jet Skis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Forget the Jet Skis? That was our line in the sand! What happened to “tear them a new one?”
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 venkatesh_koothrappali What can I say? They played hardball. We lost.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 raj_koothrappali You’re useless.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 venkatesh_koothrappali I told you that when you hired me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 raj_koothrappali I’m signing off now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 venkatesh_koothrappali Call your mother, she worries.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Okay, just so you know, if we’re bringing in cousins who are lawyers, prepare for shock and awe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter You know what? I am ending this. Penny didn’t want to hold the ring anymore. She gave it to me, I have it. I’m sending it back. Where’s the ring?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 sheldon_cooper You mean this ring? Next time be aware of your surroundings while urinating in a public men’s room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Give me that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 sheldon_cooper No, it’s mine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 raj_koothrappali It’s all of ours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Okay, now, this is ridiculous!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Then let go!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter I’m not letting go, you let go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 howard_wolowitz I say this ring belongs to the last person who can hold on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Fine. But can’t we go home and start this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Sure. Let go of the ring.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter All right, it starts now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 howard_wolowitz You do realize there’s a giant bug movie marathon tonight on the Syfy Channel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Wait, my laptop.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 howard_wolowitz You know, there’s a point when this becomes idiotic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter And it wasn’t when we were driving like this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 sheldon_cooper I would advise the three of you that resistance is futile. I have endless patience. I once spent two-and-a-half hours on hold with Hewlett-Packard customer service just to complain about their customer service.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter You want to talk about endless patience? Penny made me watch all five seasons of Sex and the City.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 raj_koothrappali There are six seasons, dude.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Oh, crap!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 raj_koothrappali No, no, no, the sixth season is great. We go to Paris with Carrie and get our heart broken, and then Mr. Big shows up, we don’t know if we can trust him again. It’s a wild ride.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Door.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Okay, everybody, and plie. And relevae.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 penny Whatcha doin’?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Last one holding the ring decides its fate. I know, it sounds silly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 penny No, no, no, no, no, no, you are my boyfriend. Nothing you do is silly to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 penny FYI, this is a bag from Victoria’s Secret.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter I’m out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 howard_wolowitz I’m sorry, Ma, I have to stay late at the office.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 raj_koothrappali No, he’s doesn’t! He’s lying to you!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Will you be quiet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Well, if you want privacy let go of the ring. I’m so glad we came to this gentile strip club! Howard, here’s more bacon to tuck into the shiksa’s G-string!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 howard_wolowitz I’ll call you back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 raj_koothrappali I think it’s lovely you call your mommy and let her know you’re going to be late for dinner. From what I know about these things, if a woman doesn’t breast-feed on time, it’s very uncomfortable for her boobies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Don’t you talk about my mother’s boobies!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 raj_koothrappali If you’re offended, let go of the ring and go on home to your mother’s boobies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Excellent, excellent. Tire each other out, the ring will be mine. Howard, why don’t you go after Raj’s mother?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Why don’t we go after your mother?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Go ahead. I have no illusions about my mother. She is a kind, loving, religiously fanatical right-wing Texan with a slightly out-of-scale head and a mild Dr. Pepper addiction. Anything you’d like to add?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 howard_wolowitz That’s not gonna Better pull out the big gun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 raj_koothrappali You’re right. Let’s talk about your grandmother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 sheldon_cooper No! I call no Meemaws.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Think about this. The only way your mother was born was your Meemaw had sex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 sheldon_cooper I don’t want to hear this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Then let go of the ring and walk away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Never.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 howard_wolowitz All right. I’ll bet your Meemaw didn’t just have sex to have your mother. I bet she had sex because she liked it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Stop it!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Yeah, Meemaw did the nasty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 sheldon_cooper I said stop it!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 howard_wolowitz We’re getting to him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Waterfalls!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 raj_koothrappali What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Waterfalls. Crashing waves. Babbling brooks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 howard_wolowitz What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Subliminal messaging. I’m going to make you want to pee. Dripping faucets. Leaky gutter. Peeing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 raj_koothrappali It’s, it’s not working, dude.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Oh-ho-ho, it’s working all right. I have to pee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Then let go of the ring and go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 howard_wolowitz No, actually, I wouldn’t mind going, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Fine. Um, on the count of three. One, two…
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Wait, just to clarify. When you get to three, do we stand up or do we pee?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 howard_wolowitz We stand up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Excellent choice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Three.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Something tells me this was a bad day to wear suede shoes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 sheldon_cooper I’ve done it! I’ve won! The ring is mine! It’s mine! We’re going to clean it up and make it pretty. My own. My love. My precious. Where’s the ring?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter It’s in a FedEx box on its way back to where it came from.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 raj_koothrappali The fires of Mount Doom?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Peter Jackson’s office in New Zealand. It wasn’t ours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 howard_wolowitz You quit the game! You had no right to take it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter I came in here, you guys were all sleeping. The ring was on the floor. No one was touching it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Well, so then we start the game over until there’s a winner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter There wasn’t ever going to be a winner. There was going to be a selfish, petty person with a ring and three people who used to be his friend. Is that really what you guys want? ‘Cause if it is, fine, I don’t want anything to do with you. And I don’t know what happened in that bathroom, but I am not cleaning it up! My precious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 sheldon_cooper I knew it. Give us the precious!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter NEVER!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode17 penny Ugh, gotta go back to dating dumb guys from the gym.
