TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny Having a little trouble catching your breath there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter No, no, I’m good. If my P.E. teachers had told me this is what I was training for, I would have tried a lot harder.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny Do or do not. There is no try.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Did you just quote Star Wars?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny I believe I quoted Empire Strikes Back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Oh, my God. I’m lying in bed with a beautiful woman who can quote Yoda. I love you, Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny Oh. Oh. Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter You’re welcome. I just wanted to put that out there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny Oh, yeah, no, I, I’m, I’m glad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Good. Glad is good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny Yeah. Yeah. No, no. Um. So, it’s getting pretty late. We should probably go to sleep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny Hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, probably.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny Okay, good night, sweetie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Hey, Leonard, where do you come down on giant ants?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 raj_koothrappali Sheldon says impossible. Howard and I say not only possible, but as a mode of transportation, way cooler than a Batmobile.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper You are ignoring the square-cube law. The giant ant would be crushed under the weight of its own exoskeleton. And for the record, the appropriate ranking of cool modes of transportation is jet pack, hoverboard, transporter, Batmobile, and then giant ant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Seriously? You have nothing better to do than sit around and discuss the possibility of giant ants?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 howard_wolowitz What’s with him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Perhaps he’s at a sensitive point in his monthly cycle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Are you saying he’s man-struating?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Not literally. But as far back as the 17th century, scientists observed a 33-day fluctuation in men’s hormone levels.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 raj_koothrappali Interesting. That might explain my weepy days in the middle of the month. You know what I’m talking about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Okay, forget giant ants. How about giant rabbits?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 raj_koothrappali Big or small, I don’t like rabbits. They always look like they’re about to say something, but they never do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Rabbits do have a respiratory system that would support great size. And on a side note, they are one of the few mammals whose scrotum is in front of the penis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 raj_koothrappali Maybe that’s what they want to talk about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Leonard, where do you stand on giant rabbits and scrotal position?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter I honestly don’t care.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 raj_koothrappali Really? Because every time we’ve talked about unusual animal genitals, you’ve always had some pretty strong and controversial opinions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter What do you want from me? I just don’t give a rat’s ass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Would that be a giant rat’s ass?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper For the record, giant rats are possible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Can we please talk about something else? Maybe something vaguely related to life as we know it on this planet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Okay, how about this for a topic, why is Leonard being a giant douche? Assuming giant douches are possible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Of course they are. Leonard’s being one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 raj_koothrappali Maybe he’s having a lover’s spat with Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter No, there was no spat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Oh, but something happened.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter I don’t want to talk about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper But I sense you’re going to and I don’t want to hear about it. Excuse me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 howard_wolowitz What’d you do, Romeo? You pour maple syrup all over your body and ask her if she was in the mood for a short stack?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 raj_koothrappali Did you think it would be funny to put on a pair of her panties and jump around, but it wound up just creeping her out?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter What? No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 raj_koothrappali I’m just asking, dude. It happens.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 stuart_bloom You guys still on for bowling tonight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Oh, yes. In fact, I’ve prepared some trash talk for the occasion. You bowl like your mama. Unless, of course, she bowls well. In which case, you bowl nothing like her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 stuart_bloom Oh. Ouch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper That is what is referred to as a burn on you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Did you ask her to start waxing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 raj_koothrappali Did you start waxing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 howard_wolowitz While making love, did you accidentally spank your own ass and cry out Mommy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter I’m walking away from you now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 howard_wolowitz That wasn’t a no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 raj_koothrappali Yeah, I think we’re getting close.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Did you take a Benadryl and fall asleep while pleasuring her? Because you can die that way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 raj_koothrappali Oh, that would be a good way to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Oh, hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Good, Penny, reminder, bowling tonight at seven o’clock.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny Oh, right, bowling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter You don’t have to come if you don’t want to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny No, no, it’s okay. I mean, let’s face it, you guys would get creamed without me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper We would indeed. In this particular case, your lack of femininity works to our advantage.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny It’s always nice chatting with you, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Sarcasm?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny Thinly veiled contempt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Remember, seven o’clock.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny Got it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Pacific Daylight time!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny Bite me!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Please reserve that butch spirit for the lanes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 howard_wolowitz I thought you were bringing your own bowling shoes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper These are my own bowling shoes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Then what’s with the disinfectant?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper I know where my feet have been.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 stuart_bloom Hey, Penny! And you guys. Albino Bob couldn’t make it, so I brought a substitute. I believe some of you know Wil Wheaton.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 wil_wheaton Hi, Sheldon. How’s it going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Well, well, well. If it isn’t Wil Wheaton, the Green Goblin to my Spider-Man, the Pope Paul the fifth to my Galileo, the Internet Explorer to my Firefox.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 wil_wheaton You’re not still carrying a grudge because I beat you at that card tournament, are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper I’m the proud owner of Wil Wheaton stinks dot com, dot net, and dot org. What does that tell you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 wil_wheaton It tells me that I am living rent-free right here . You ready to bowl?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Oh, I’m ready. I don’t know if Stuart told you what you’re up against tonight, but before you stands the co-captain of the East Texas Christian Youth Holy Roller Bowling League championship team. Seven to twelve year-old division. Also, Penny’s pretty good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 wil_wheaton Great. Then it’s on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Oh, foolish Wil Wheaton, it was never off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 wil_wheaton Yes!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper A common spare. The Miss Congeniality of the bowling pageant. Before you jump on Twitter to tout your modest accomplishment, watch how it’s really done. I am the ball. My thoughts are its thoughts. Its holes are my holes. Yes. Tweet that, Tweety Bird.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Hey, I just wanted to tell you I’m a big fan.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 wil_wheaton Oh, thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 howard_wolowitz I’m sure you’re probably sick of Star Trek questions, but, Whoopi Goldberg, you ever hit that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 raj_koothrappali Ah, beer. The magic elixir that can turn this poor, shy Indian boy into the life of the party. Oh, yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Chilli cheese fry?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny Yes. I love chilli cheese fries.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Really? You love them?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny Yeah, why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter No reason. I’m just glad to hear you’re comfortable saying you love something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny Do you really want to get into this right now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Get into what? Why wouldn’t you love the chilli cheese fries? They’ve been in your life a long time. They make you happy. They deserve to know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny Okay, look, you just caught me by surprise last night. I didn’t know what to say.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Okay, well, now you’ve had some time to think about it. So, what do you want to say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny I’m not sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter How can you not be sure?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny Okay, this isn’t the place to have this conversation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter No, the place to have the conversation was in bed after I said, I love you, and you said, Thank you, good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny Don’t push it, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter I am not pushing anything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny You are. You don’t get to decide when I’m ready to say I love you!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 raj_koothrappali Ah, the premature I love you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 howard_wolowitz I guessed premature. Does that count?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Penny, Penny, Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper This is for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny Ice cream?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper I’ve been familiarizing myself with female emotional crises by studying the comic strip Cathy. When she’s upset, she says Ach and eats ice cream.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny Um, Ach.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper If you were a cat, I would have brought you a lasagna.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny Did Leonard send you over here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper No, we haven’t spoken since your abrupt departure last night caused us to forfeit to Stuart and his dastardly ringer Wil Wheaton.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny Yeah, I’m sorry about that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper I’m not too proud to admit that I cried myself to sleep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny Again, I’m sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper And let me tell you sleep did not come easily with Leonard in the next room singing along with Alanis Morrisette.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny You’re kidding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper No. Clearly another woman in dire need of ice cream.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny All right, Sheldon, what part of this is supposed to make me feel better?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper The part where I tell you I’ve engineered a rematch with Stuart’s team for tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny Oh, honey, I don’t know. Things are a little weird with Leonard right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper You want me to remove him from the team? I’m the captain, I can do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny No, no, that’s okay. Just let me talk to him, and I’ll get back to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper When are you going to talk to him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny I don’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper He’s in the laundry room now. Now would be a good time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny You’re not gonna leave me alone until I do it, are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Oh, I think we both know the answer to that question.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny I think we should talk now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter What? No, it’s okay. We don’t have to talk ’cause there’s nothing to talk about. Everything’s good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny Really? So, you didn’t get all snarky ’cause I said something nice to a bowl of chilli fries?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter All right, maybe I overreacted. So we’re in two different places emotionally. So what? And maybe I’m a little ahead of you. That’s fine. You know. In fact, it makes sense, ’cause let’s face it, I’ve been in this relationship two years longer than you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny Look, Leonard, you have to know how much I care about you. It’s just that I’ve said the L word too soon before, and it didn’t work out very well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Really? I wouldn’t know what that’s like.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny I’m sorry. You know what I’m talking about, though.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny So, we’re good?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Yes, that’s what I’m telling you. We are good. We are great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper All right! Fence mended, problem swept under the rug. Time to bowl! Yes, I was eavesdropping, there’s a lot at stake here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Attention, all bowlers. I’ve taken the liberty of having these made for our rematch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny The Wesley Crushers?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper No, not the Wesley Crushers. The Wesley “Crushers.”
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny I don’t get it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Wesley Crusher was Wil Wheaton’s character on Star Trek.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny Still don’t get it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper It’s a blindingly clever play on words. By appropriating his character’s name and adding the S, we imply that we we’ll be the crushers of Wesley.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny Okay, I’m sorry, honey, but the Wesley Crushers sounds like a bunch of people who like Wesley Crusher.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper What? No! Again, it’s not the Wesley Crushers. It’s the Wesley “Crushers.”
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 howard_wolowitz You know, if you want it to mean you’re crushing Wesley, it’d be the “Wesley” Crushers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Do you people even hear yourselves? It’s not the Wesley Crushers. It’s not the “Wesley” Crushers. It’s the Wesley “Crushers.”
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 wil_wheaton Hey, look. They named their team after me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper No, it’s not the… Never mind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 stuart_bloom So, we’re all clear on the bet and the stakes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Oh, yes. The losers will be publicly humiliated in a fashion to be chosen by the victor. FYI, I plan on having you publish a scientific paper expounding the discredited Velikovsky hypothesis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 stuart_bloom Ouch again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 wil_wheaton Hey, Sheldon, I just wanted you to know that I’m really looking forward to wiping the floor with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Oh, yes? Well, before I respond, let me ask you a question. Is your mother a good or poor bowler?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 wil_wheaton After you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper No, after you, as we are currently crushing you, Wesley.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 wil_wheaton It’s customary for the player on the right-hand lane to bowl first.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 wil_wheaton It’s a custom, not a rule.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper I so loathe you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 wil_wheaton That’s right, Sheldon. Embrace the dark side.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper That’s not even from your franchise!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 stuart_bloom I, um, I want you to know that even though we’re on opposite sides, I, I bear you no ill will.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny Thank you, Stuart. It’s nice to know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 stuart_bloom Mmm, mmm. People from opposite sides often have good relationships. You know, Romeo and Juliet, Tony and Maria from West Side Story, what’s-his-name and the big blue chick in Avatar. I’m gonna bowl now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Be the ball, Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Leave me alone, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper You weren’t the ball.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny Hey, thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter This is fun, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter It’s good that we got out and did something physical.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny Mm-hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Gets us out of our heads. You get in your head, you start to overthink, overanalyze, obsess, you worry. That’s not what we’re doing tonight. Tonight we’re just throwing a ball at some pins.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny Yeah, that’s right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Mm-hmm, and someday, we don’t know when, maybe you’ll love me back. Ooh, I’m up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 all@ Shel-don! Shel-don! Shel-don! Shel-don!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Excuse me. I don’t know who you’re chanting for as I am currently the ball.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 all@ The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Thank you, Jesus! As my mother would say.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 wil_wheaton I’m glad you patched things up with your boyfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny Oh, yeah, me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 wil_wheaton It’s always tough when the L bomb gets dropped and you’re not ready for it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny Tell me about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 wil_wheaton I dated this one girl, and I told her that I loved her, and she said she wasn’t sure. And she strung me along for almost two years. It was brutal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny Oh, I’m sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 wil_wheaton Thanks. Yeah, I wish she had just broken up with me right there, put me out of my misery.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 wil_wheaton Yeah, would have been kinder.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 stuart_bloom Wil, you’re up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 wil_wheaton Oh, that’s me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Did you let Wil Wheaton get in your head?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny What are you talking about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper He’s evil. He plays evil mind games. Did he tell you his grandmother died?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny No!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Well, if he does, don’t believe it. He’s not above playing the dead meemaw card.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 wil_wheaton Yes!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Penny, you’re up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper All right, remember, his meemaw’s alive and be the ball.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny Yeah, I got it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter We really need a strike here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter So just take your time and concentrate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny Leonard, stop pressuring me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter I’m not pressuring you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny Yeah, you are! Just back off!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Okay, I’m sorry. I’ll shut up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny I didn’t mean shut up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Fine. Just tell me what to do, and I’ll do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 penny No, this isn’t fair to you, Leonard. I’m sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Wait! Where are you going? Penny, come back! I’ll get you ice cream!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter No, let her go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Are you insane? If she leaves, it’s over!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter I’m pretty sure it’s already over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 wil_wheaton Tough luck, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper You did this, didn’t you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 wil_wheaton Do you think I would really break up a couple just to win a bowling match?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper No, I suppose not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 wil_wheaton Good. Keep thinking that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Wheaton!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 stuart_bloom Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yeah, I’m telling you the Match.com chicks are much looser than on eHarmony. You know, I, I gotta call you back. I won a bet, and it’s time to collect.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode19 raj_koothrappali I don’t know about you, but I feel empowered.
