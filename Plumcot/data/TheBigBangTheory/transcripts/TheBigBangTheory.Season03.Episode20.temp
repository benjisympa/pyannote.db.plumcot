TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny Oh, damn, they cancelled my Visa. Oh, yay, a new MasterCard!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon Uh-oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon I was going to get my mail.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny Okay. Are, are you hoping to get it telepathically?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon I think you mean telekinetically. And no, I just wasn’t sure of the proper protocol now that you and Leonard are no longer having coitus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny God, can we please just say no longer seeing each other?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon Well, we could if it were true. But as you live in the same building, you see each other all the time. The variable which has changed is the coitus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny Okay, here’s the protocol, you and I are still friends, and you stop saying coitus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon Good, good. I’m glad we’re still friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon Oh, yes. It was a lot of work to accommodate you in my life. I’d hate for that effort to have been in vain.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny Right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon Just to be clear do I have to stop saying coitus with everyone or just you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny Everyone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon Harsh terms. But all right, I’ll just substitute intercourse.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny Great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon Or fornication. Yeah. But that has judgmental overtones, so I’ll hold that in reserve.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny So, how you been?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon Well, my existence is a continuum, so I’ve been what I am at each point in the implied time period.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny You’re just coitusing with me, aren’t you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon Bazinga.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny Mmm. How’s Leonard doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon He seems all right. Although he does spend a disturbing amount of time looking at photographs of you and smelling the pillow you slept on. Oh, but now that I think of it, he asked me not to tell you that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny I’ll pretend I didn’t hear it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon I’d rather you pretend I didn’t say it. I see you bought Mama Italia marinara spaghetti sauce.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny Yep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon That’s the sauce my mother uses. She likes cooking Italian because according to her, that’s what the Romans made Jesus eat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny Interesting. I’ll have to have you over for spaghetti some night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon I’m hungry now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny Oh. Um, okay. Why don’t you give me an hour and come over?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon Will you cut up hot dogs into little chunks and mix them in with the sauce?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny I don’t have hot dogs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon Oh, it’s all right, I do. Oh! You’re in for what my mother calls a real Eye-talian treat. .
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard Hey, where you been?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon I was talking with Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 howard What’s wrong with you? You can’t hang out with your roommate’s ex. That’s totally uncool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard No, no, it’s fine. I don’t care. I’m over it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 raj Yeah, he’s over it, that’s why he’s been whining all day about trying to invent that memory-wiper gizmo from Men in Black.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon Is he making any progress? Because I’d like to erase Ben Affleck as Daredevil.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 howard So would Ben Affleck. The point is, in a situation like this you got to pick sides. You’re either on Team Leonard or Team Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon Which one picks last?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 howard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon Well, usually I’m on the team that picks last. Unless there’s a kid in a wheelchair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard Sheldon, I got you your tangerine chicken. I hope you’re hungry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon Well, of course I’m hungry. And as I have no plans to eat with any other team, I will consume my tangerine chicken with the appropriate gusto. Mm, mm, mm!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon Just out of curiosity, do we still have hot dogs?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard I don’t know. Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon Just making dinner conversation. Go, Team Leonard!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 howard Oh, God, this is good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 raj Let me ask you a question. Do you believe you’re going to go to hell for eating sweet and sour pork?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 howard Jews don’t have hell. We have acid reflux.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard Do you want the last dumpling, Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon Certainly. It’s not like I have to moderate my food intake because I’m planning on eating again very shortly. Mm, mm, mm!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard So, you guys want to do something tonight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 howard Nah, I can’t. I got to pick up my mom from her water aerobics class. 18 overweight women flapping their arm fat in a swimming pool. Looks like the manatee tank at Sea World.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard What about you, Raj?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 raj Oh, there it is, now that you don’t have a girlfriend, you want to hang out with me again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard I never stopped hanging out with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 raj Oh, please, we all know I’m the friend you call when you have no other options. If we were the Justice League, I’d be Aquaman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 howard I wish you were Aquaman. Then I could send you to scoop my mom out of the old lady tank.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon Excuse me, I’m thirsty, so I’m going to go to the refrigerator and get myself a refreshing beverage.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard You know what? I’ll just spend the evening alone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 raj What, suddenly I’m not good enough for you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon Ah, I do so love beverages. Now I think I’ll take my after-dinner walk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard Since when do you take after-dinner walks?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 howard Yeah, since when do you take walks?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon I read a study online that walking after a meal not only aids in digestion, but increases serotonin, and you know me, if there’s one thing I like more than a refreshing beverage, it’s serotonin. Bye-bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 howard Hold on. I’ll walk down with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon Oh, that’s not necessary. You can go first.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 howard Or we could go together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon I can’t think of a reason why not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 howard Let’s go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon Hold on. Nope, no reason.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 raj I’ve missed you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon All right, say hello to your mother for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 howard Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 howard You said you were going for a walk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon I didn’t say outside.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 howard So what, you’re just gonna walk up and down the stairs?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon No, of course not. That would be odd and suspicious behavior.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 womans_voice Here Bubbles. Here boy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 howard Which way are you going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon Which way are you going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 howard I parked my scooter down the block.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon I’m going the other way. Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 howard Bye. Actually, I’m this way. Do I smell hot dogs?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon No. I mean, I have no idea what you smell.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 howard I definitely smell raw hot dog.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon Perhaps you’re getting a brain tumour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 howard All right, have a nice walk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon I shall. Have a nice scoot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 howard You might want to stand back. I’m sitting on top of 13 horses here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon Oh. Hello, doggie. Nice doggie. I bet you think you smell hot dogs. Look, a cat!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon Penny, Penny. Penny. Here. I had to trade the others for my life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 raj Hey, Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard Yeah?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 raj I haven’t had sex in a year.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard Where you going with this, Raj?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 raj Don’t flatter yourself, dude. I want to go out and meet a woman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard So, go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 raj Well, I need a wingman. I don’t want to come off like a lonely loser.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard And you think my presence will help with that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 raj Well, I do. Next to you, I’ll look like a catch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard I’m not going out tonight, Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 raj All right. Would you mind if I went to your room and downloaded some Asian pornography?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard Very much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 raj Doesn’t have to be Asian.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard Don’t worry. You’ll meet a girl someday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 raj No, I won’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard Yes, you will, and she’ll be beautiful, and kind and sexy and funny and everything you ever wanted in a woman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 raj You really think so?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard I do, and you’ll fall hopelessly in love and give her your heart. And she’ll take it and grind it into pathetic, little pieces.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 raj But we’ll have sex first, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon Mmm, mmm, mmm. That’s Eye-talian.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny So, um, was Leonard okay with you coming over?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon Oh, yes. In fact, he said, I’m fine, I don’t care. And he in no way said it in a manner which would lead one to believe that he was covering up feelings of anguish and betrayal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny Well, good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon I’m also pleased to report that he’s all cried out over you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny He’s been crying?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon Oh, I believe that was something else I wasn’t supposed to mention.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny Oh, God, I feel terrible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon Do you have a stomach ache, too?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny No. Why, do you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny Why did you ask if I had one, too?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon Just making polite dinner conversation. Your turn.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny All right. So, what’s new in your life?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon Well, my new shoes are not made for running.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny Have you been running?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon No. It’s just a suspicion I have. Mmm, mmm, mmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny I’m so glad you like it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon I do. Leonard never cooks for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny Well, maybe that’s ’cause Leonard can’t cook.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon You can’t cook and you made me this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny Whatever. Ooh, I’m gonna get the cheesecake out of the fridge.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon Oh, Lord, I’m in Jewish hell.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 raj Look at this. Do you think she’s really doing that or is it PhotoShop?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard I’m pretty sure Martha Stewart never got naked with a room full of big, fat Japanese guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 raj You don’t know that. Prison changes people.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard Hey, where you been?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon I told you, walking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard For an hour and a half?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon I got lost.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard How could you get lost? Your phone has GPS.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon Satellites are down. Solar flares.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 raj There are no solar flares right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon Yes, there are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 raj Dude, I’m an astrophysicist. If there were solar flares, I’d be all up in it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon I’m sorry. I misspoke. What I meant to say was my battery died.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard What the hell was that about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 raj I don’t know. Do you think this is really Hillary Clinton doing it with Oprah?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard Oh, we really need to get you a girl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon Leonard, Leonard, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard Oh, just come in!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard What do you want, Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon Maybe this isn’t a good time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard Tell me why you woke me up or I swear to God I will kill you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon Do you really think death threats are an appropriate way to begin this conversation? Sometimes your lack of social skills astonishes me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard What do you want?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon You may want to sit down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard I’m in bed!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon Point taken. You may want to sit up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard Sheldon!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon I’ve been seeing Penny behind your back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard Okay, when you say seeing Penny, what exactly does that mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon We had dinner last night. She made me spaghetti with little hot dogs cut up in it. Well, little hot dog. I gave up the other five hot dogs to a real dog. A real, big dog. A hell hound. Tangential to the primary story. How about I circle back to it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard Fine. Why did you have dinner with Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon I told you, she made spaghetti with little hot dogs. I like spaghetti with little hot dogs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard Then why did you have Chinese food with us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon I didn’t want to upset you. Howard made it very clear that my allegiance should be to male comrades before women who sell their bodies for money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard Is it possible he said Bros before Hos?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon Yes, but I rephrased it to avoid offending the hos.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard Sheldon, I don’t care if you want to be friends with Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon Oh. Well, so the emotional turmoil that’s been keeping me from achieving REM sleep was entirely unjustified?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon Well then as my meemaw would say, looks like we butchered a pig, but nobody wanted bacon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard I guess not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon And now, as promised, the tangent. Sheldon and the Hell Hound, or How I Lost My Hot Dogs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny Oh, um, I, I can come back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard D-don’t be silly. We’re neighbours, we’re going to run into each other, may as well get used to it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny Yeah, I guess you’re right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard You used to it yet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny Nope.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard Me neither. Oh, Sheldon seemed think that I would be upset about you hanging out with him. But I just want you to know it’s fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny Oh, oh, good, because, um, his mother called me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard His mother?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny Yeah, she wants me to take him shopping for sheets and towels.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard I was going to do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny Oh, well, then you, you do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard No, I don’t want to do it. You can do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny Okay, you can take him for shoes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard I just took him for shoes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny Well, all I know is he says they hurt his feet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard Fine. I’ll take him for shoes next Saturday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny Oh, no, no, no, a bunch of us from work are going to Disneyland next Saturday and Sheldon wants to come.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard You’re taking him to Disneyland?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny Well, he heard me making plans on the phone. Was I going to say no?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard All right. But let me know if you’re going to stuff him with junk food. I don’t want to bring home a nice dinner for him and see it go to waste.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny We’re going to Disneyland. He’s going to eat junk food.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard All I’m saying is give me a heads-up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny Okay, whatever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard And don’t let him go on Space Mountain after he eats. He’ll say he can handle it, but I promise you’ll end up with churro puke on your shoes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny All right, got it. Is there anything else?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard Yeah, don’t let Goofy near him. He’ll have nightmares and I’ll have to deal with it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny What’s the problem with Goofy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard Wish I knew. He’s fine with Pluto.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 raj Hey, do you think the elastic woman in The Incredibles needs to use birth control or can she just be a diaphragm?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 howard Well, that’s it. We’re officially out of things to talk about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny We’re home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard It’s ten o’clock, where have you been?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon We stayed for the California Adventure water show. It was pure Disney magic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard I was going to see that with him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny How was I supposed to know that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon It’s all right. I’ll see it again with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard And I have food here. You said you were going to call.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny I know, I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon I can still eat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny No, you already threw up once. Go put on your PJs and brush your teeth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon Okay, but just don’t fight
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard We’re not fighting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny Just go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard Aren’t you going to thank Penny for taking you to Disneyland?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon Thank you, Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny You’re welcome, sweetie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard Want a cup of coffee?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny Oh, um, I should probably get going.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard Come on. It’s just a cup of coffee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny Yep, okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 howard Oh, yeah, the whole thing seems a little twisted to me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard What am I smelling?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny Sheldon’s churro on my shoes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny He’s such an angel when he’s asleep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard Yeah. Shame he has to wake up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny I think we can do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard Smother Sheldon in his sleep? Wouldn’t that be wrong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny No, be friends. You and me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard Oh. Sure. Absolutely.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny Good. I’m glad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard Here’s an idea. I’m just throwing it out there, friends who have sex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 penny Good night, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 leonard Kidding. Just a couple of friends goofin’ around.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode20 sheldon No, Goofy, no.
