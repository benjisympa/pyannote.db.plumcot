TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon Hold.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 raj What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon Explain your sneeze.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 raj I’m sorry?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon Do you have allergies?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 raj No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon Is there too much pepper on your salad?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 raj I don’t put pepper on salads.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon I’ve heard enough. Sit over there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 raj Oh, come on. I don’t want to sit by myself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon That’s what Typhoid Mary said, and clearly, her friends buckled.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 raj Guys, help me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 howard Sheldon, come on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard Yeah, it’s just one sneeze. You’re on your own.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 howard See you, buddy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon Oh, Leonard, I have something for you. Per our roommate agreement, this is your 24-hour notice that I will be having a non-related female spending two nights in our apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard When you say non-related female, you still mean human, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon Of course. Pets are banned under the roommate agreement, with the exception of service animals, such as seeing eye dogs and, one day, cybernetically-enhanced helper monkeys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 howard Are you planning on kidnapping a woman?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon Sarcasm?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 howard Yes, but mixed with genuine concern.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon For your information, I’ll be playing host to Dr. Elizabeth Plimpton.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 raj The cosmological physicist from Princeton?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon Yes. And until you acquire a surgical mask, please address your comments to me through a napkin. We’ve been corresponding for years about our mutual interest in gravitational wave signatures of inflatons in the early universe. And now she’s under consideration for a position at our university.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard Why didn’t you tell me you knew Elizabeth Plimpton? I am a huge fan of hers!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon I didn’t realize I was obligated to share my connection with things you’re a fan of, but very well. You enjoy Canadian bacon. I’ve been to Toronto.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard Okay, fine. Where is she going to sleep?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon My room, of course.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 raj Holy crap! Holy crap!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 howard Yeah, um, I have a two-part question.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon Go ahead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 howard A, are you kidding me? And B, seriously, are you freaking kidding me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon A, I rarely kid. And B, when I do kid, you will know it by my use of the word bazinga.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 howard So you’re saying the two of you are going to be sleeping in the same bed?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon Yes. Bazinga. Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard Thank you. Why is a world-renowned scientist staying in our apartment instead of a hotel?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon Well, she doesn’t care for hotels. And who can blame her? Windows that don’t open, multi-user linens, keys shaped like credit cards, as if one walks around with unassigned slots in one’s wallet. All right, I believe I have time for one more question. Yes, Raj?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 raj When can I sit with you again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon When I’ve seen two consecutive negative throat cultures spaced 12 hours apart. You know the drill. All right, if you’ll excuse me, I am off to start a prophylactic course of antibiotics.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard I can’t believe he’s friends with Elizabeth Plimpton.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 raj I can’t believe they let him into Canada.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 howard Whoa, whoa, whoa. You heard the man. Where’s your throat cultures? Kidding. Sit down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 penny Hey, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon Oh, Penny, excellent. I have a question about these maxi pads. Are the wings truly functional or have I fallen victim to marketing hype?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 penny What? What are you doing with, what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon The stock boy at Walgreens was frustratingly uninformed on the subject.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 penny Sheldon, what are you doing with maxi pads?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon I have a lady friend who will be staying with me for a few days.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 penny Oh. What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon I want her to feel at home. I also bought scented soaps, pantyhose, Midol, calcium chews and what is apparently a yogurt specifically designed to regulate the female bowel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 penny Wait, wait, hold on, back up. You’re having a woman stay with you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon Yes. Why does that seem to flabbergast everybody?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 penny Oh, no, no, no, no. I’m not flabbergasted. I’m puzzled. Yeah, let’s go with puzzled.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon A word of warning. My guest is a noted physicist and the leading expert on quantum cosmology, so please try to avoid wasting her time with female jibber jabber.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 penny Female jibber jabber?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon Shoe sales, hair styles, mud masks, gossip about your friends Brad and Angelina.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 penny Oh, they’re not my friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon I’m not surprised, considering the way you talk about them behind their backs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard She’s here, she’s here. How do I look? Do I look smart?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon Oh, good grief. This isn’t about you. Coming! Now listen, one of the great minds of the 21st century is about to play host to one of the other great minds of the 21st century. So pay attention. Years from now, my biographer might ask you about this event.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard Oh, I have so many things to tell your biographer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 elizabeth Ah, Dr. Cooper, thank goodness. I completely forgot your address. But then I remembered that I’d written it on my hand. Lucky for me, I didn’t confuse it with what I’d written on my other hand, which are the coordinates for a newly discovered neutron star. ‘Cause if I tried to go there, I’d be crushed by hypergravity. Anyway, hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 elizabeth Nice to finally meet you in person.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon I would imagine it is. This is my friend and roommate, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard Hi-lo. Oops. I started to say hi, and then I switched to hello in the middle. It came out hi-lo. Duh. Uh, it’s nice to meet you. I’ve read both your books and most of your papers. I’m Leonard, I live
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon I apologize. He’s only an experimental physicist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 elizabeth No need to apologize. Some of my best friends are experimental physicists. Well, not my best friends, but I know them. My best friend is a molecular chemist named Wendy. I’m sorry, I’m rambling. Hi-lo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard Are you hungry, thirsty? Can I offer you anything?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon No, she’s my guest. If anyone should offer her anything, it should be me. Elizabeth, can I get you something? Perhaps a feminine hygiene product or a bowel-regulating yogurt?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 elizabeth Interesting choices. Based on my current needs, I guess I’d pick the yogurt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon Excellent. If the yogurt works, I bought some delightful scented candles.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard Look, it’s you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 elizabeth Thank you so much for opening up your home to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard Well, who wants to stay in a hotel? With windows that don’t open, those crazy card-shaped keys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 elizabeth I’m so glad you understand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon No, he doesn’t understand. I understand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard Well, I understand, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon You’re just misappropriating my understanding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard Oh, . I think any university would want you. Except, of course, any university that had already had you. Because they would’ve already wanted you before they, you know, got you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon From the mind that brought you hi-lo. Let me show you to your room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 elizabeth All right. I guess I am tired. Good night, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard Uh, sleep night. I mean, obviously, good night. I started to say sleep tight, then I changed my mind in the middle. I swear to God, I’m smart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon Get it together, man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon All right, let me show you some of the features of the room. First, windows. Conventional. Open, closed, open, closed, halfway open, or halfway closed, depending on your philosophical bent. Over here is my comic book collection. Feel free to browse. There’s a box of disposable reading gloves on the night stand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 elizabeth Good to know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 elizabeth What if there’s a disaster that destroys all the USB ports?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon Then there’s really no reason to live, is there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 elizabeth Can I ask a question about your roommate?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon He’s an odd duck, isn’t he?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 elizabeth What’s his relationship status?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon Well, there was a misbegotten adventure with a waitress who lives across the hall. It ended as inexplicably as it began. They had very little in common, except for carnal activity. That’s why I acquired these noise-cancelling headphones. If you decide to use them, please clean the ear pieces afterwards with the Wet Wipes you’ll find in the bathroom. They’re in the drawer labelled Wet Wipes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 elizabeth Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon Good. I’ll leave you to your night time ablutions. I’ve e-mailed you the morning bathroom schedule. You’ll also find a laminated copy in your welcome packet. It’s on the back of the emergency escape route diagram.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 elizabeth How thoughtful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon Sleep well, my friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 elizabeth You, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon Oh, let me just get one thing. It’s my backup emergency supply kit. The living room escape route doesn’t pass through here. Now, good night. And if there’s an apocalypse, good luck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard Yes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 elizabeth I saw your light on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard Is everything all right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 elizabeth Yeah, I just couldn’t sleep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard Me neither. Oh, look what I’m reading. It’s you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 elizabeth I thought you already read it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard I did, but it’s been a while, and I wanted to sound smart over breakfast.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 elizabeth Aw, you’re smart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard Oh, good. Wasn’t sure it was coming across.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 elizabeth What chapter are you on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard Uh, six.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 elizabeth Oh, the extragalactic distance ladder. Want to know a little secret?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 elizabeth I wrote the section on the Wilson-Bappu Effect completely naked.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard Really? Uh, sure doesn’t read that way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 elizabeth Here, let me show you. When we consider the brightness of pulsating variable stars, we start to see a possible explanation for some of the discrepancies found in Hubble’s constant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard Wow. You really make science come alive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon Vocal test. Morning vocal test. Second vocal test. Second morning vocal test.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard Morning, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon Morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 elizabeth Morning, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon Morning. I trust you had a pleasant night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 elizabeth More than pleasant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon Excuse me, I’m going to relieve myself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard How do you take your coffee?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 elizabeth Black.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard Okeydoke.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon Pee for Houston, pee for Austin, pee for the state my heart got lost in. And shake twice for Texas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard Something his mother taught him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon All right, Elizabeth, the bathroom is yours. The seat is down, and has been sanitized for your protection.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 elizabeth That’s very thoughtful, but I think I’ll finish my coffee first.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon Ah, so the yogurt didn’t work. I’ll fire off a critical e-mail to the manufacturer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 penny Oh, good, you’re up. Look, my car won’t start. I need a ride to work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon Did you once again ignore your check engine light?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 penny No, Mr. smarty-pants. I ignored the fill gas tank light.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon Leonard, Penny wants to exploit any residual feelings you have for her in order to get a ride to work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard Oh, yeah, sure, let me just put this in a travel mug.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 penny Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 elizabeth Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 penny Oh, Penny, this is Dr. Plimpton, a leading expert on quantum cosmology. Dr. Plimpton, Penny is a waitress who doesn’t understand the role gasoline plays in the internal combustion engine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 elizabeth Nice to meet you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 penny Nice to meet you, too. Are you enjoying your stay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 elizabeth Yes, very much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 penny Good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon Wonderful. Meaningless pleasantries accomplished. Elizabeth, Leonard’s bathroom time is coming up, and believe me, you do not want to follow him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 elizabeth Excuse me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard Okay, well, I guess I should get dressed so I can take everyone to work. You and Sheldon and Sheldon’s friend, Dr. Plimpton, who you just met. It’ll be fun. Like a clown car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 penny Hang on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard Hmm? Yeah? What? Huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 penny We just broke up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard What, uh, you and me? Yeah, we did. Not too long ago. How are you doing with it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 penny Not as good as you apparently.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard I, um, I don’t follow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 penny You know what? It’s, it’s none of my business. If you want to sleep with Sheldon’s doctor buddy right after we stopped seeing each other, go for it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard Well, now…
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon Excuse me. I’m uncomfortable with you recommending that Leonard pursue having intercourse with Dr. Plimpton, who I assure you has better things to do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 penny I’m not recommending it. I’m saying it already happened.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon That’s preposterous. Tell her, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard Well…
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard Come on. It wasn’t my fault.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon The implication being that you somehow tripped and fell into her lady parts?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 penny You know what? I’m just gonna take the bus to work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard Penny, I can still drive you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 penny Oh, no, no, it’s okay. You might slip on a banana peel and get me pregnant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon I must say, I’m shocked by this betrayal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard I didn’t betray Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon Not Penny, me!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard How am I betraying you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon Elizabeth’s my friend, and you’re playing with her!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard Yeah, I guess I did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 howard What the hell are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 raj Relax, it’s Nyquil.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard You still have a cold?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 raj Maybe, but I don’t care. That’s the great thing about Nyquil, it’s like ten-percent booze. I call it the nighttime sniffling, sneezing, coughing, so you can talk to girls medicine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard Are you having trouble sleeping? ‘Cause, boy, I was up all night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 raj Did you get a cold, too?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard No, but I was awake all night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 howard If you want, I can give you some of my mom’s sleeping pills.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 raj She won’t notice they’re missing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 howard She doesn’t know she takes them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard No, that’s okay. It was something else keeping me up last night. And again this morning. And, I didn’t mind. I was up last night. I was up this morning. I didn’t mind. Those are your clues.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 raj Ooh, ooh. Did the pigeon on your windowsill have more babies?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 howard Were you up making another stop-motion Lego movie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 howard ‘Cause let me tell you, it’s not enough to make the Legos move, they also have to capture your heart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard Okay, I’ll give you one more clue. It involved another person.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 raj Did you get a Japanese love pillow?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 howard How is a Japanese love pillow another person?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 raj It is if you love her and give her a name.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon Dr. Plimpton, I’d like you to meet my colleagues, Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 raj Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon And not-a-doctor Howard Wolowitz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 howard Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 raj I’m a big fan of your work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 elizabeth Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 sheldon And of course, you’ve already introduced yourself to Dr. Hofstadter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard Hey, you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 elizabeth Hey, you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard Boy, I’m kind of tuckered out. How are you feeling, Elizabeth?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 elizabeth You know what? I am a little tired. Would you be a dear and get me a cup of coffee?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard Sure. Black, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 elizabeth Actually, now I think I want it hot, brown and sweet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard Coming right up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 raj What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 howard What do you mean what? It’s Halo night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 raj I can’t. I’m too sick. Go away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 howard That’s why we moved Halo night here. Look, I brought my mom’s chicken soup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 raj I’m not hungry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 elizabeth Don’t send him away. Let him in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 howard Who’s that
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 raj I bought a parrot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 howard Yeah, right. Dr. Plimpton?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 elizabeth Hi. Howard, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 howard Uh, yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 elizabeth Can I ask you a question, Howard? Do you like role-playing games?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 howard Yeah, sure. In fact, I’m a dungeon master.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 elizabeth Not tonight. Tonight you are a delivery man. You brought soup, but uh-oh, Raj and I don’t have enough money to pay you. So we’ll have to come to some other kind of arrangement.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 howard Beg pardon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 elizabeth You two figure out the details, I’m going to go change into something I don’t mind getting ripped off my milky flesh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 howard What the frak?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 raj Go away. She wants New Delhi, not Kosher deli. Besides, you have a girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 howard We broke up weeks ago.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 raj Why didn’t you say anything?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 howard I was waiting for the right time. This is the right time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard Hey, who’s ready for Halo?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 raj Oh, this is like a nightmare. Get lost!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 howard He’s right. The numbers are shaky enough as it is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard I don’t understand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 elizabeth Oh, good. Leonard’s here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 raj Good?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard Elizabeth? What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 elizabeth What’s going on is you and Howard are my moving men and Raj is my new landlord and I don’t have enough money to pay any of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard Is she suggesting what I think she’s suggesting?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 howard Yep. Welcome to the Penthouse Forum.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 raj Okay, show of hands. Who’s up for this? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 leonard We’ll all be naked in front of each other.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 howard I’m out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 elizabeth Everybody ready?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode21 raj Follow my lead. Almost. We’re, we’re going to go out into the hallway and, uh, make a dramatic entrance.
