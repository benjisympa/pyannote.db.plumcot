TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 penny Okay, Babydoll Pink, let’s see if you can cover up the fact that I got my dad’s feet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 leonard It’s just two degrees, Sheldon. I just want to turn up the thermostat two degrees!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 sheldon Let me point out that two degrees can be the difference between water and steam.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 leonard Yes, if we lived in a teakettle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 sheldon This is the temperature you agreed to in the roommate agreement.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 leonard Aw, screw the roommate agreement!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 sheldon No, you don’t screw the roommate agreement. The roommate agreement screws you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 leonard You know what, go to Hell and set their thermostat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 sheldon I don’t have to go to Hell. At 73 degrees, I’m there already!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 penny Who is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 leonard Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 penny Hang on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 leonard Can I sleep on your couch tonight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 penny Uh, well, you can try, but the people across the hall are being very noisy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 leonard You heard that, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 penny Apparently, the one fella tried to adjust the thermostat, then the other fella went bat-crap crazy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 leonard So you agree, he’s nuts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 penny Well, not as nuts as the guy who chooses to live with him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 leonard Believe it or not, he was worse when I met him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 penny Oh, I do not believe that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 leonard You are so naive. Just like I was seven years ago. I’d just started at the university.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard Excuse me, I’m looking for Sheldon Cooper’s apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 man_with_a_box Oh, I bet you’re here to check out the room for rent.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 man Run away, dude.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 man Run fast, run far. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 leonard That should have been my first clue.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 penny So Sheldon’s last roommate tried to warn you off?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 leonard For all I knew, he was the crazy one. He had this really deranged look.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 penny Well, yeah, he’d been living with Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 leonard Sure, it makes sense now. . Anyway, I went upstairs and knocked on the door.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 large_black_transvestite Yeah?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard Dr. Cooper?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 transvestite No, you want the crazy guy across the hall.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 leonard In retrospect, that was clue number two.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon Yes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard I’m Leonard Hofstadter. I called you about the apartment. You said…
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon I know what I said. I know what you said. I know what my mother said on March 5, 1992. What is the sixth noble gas?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon You said you’re a scientist. What is the sixth noble gas?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard Uh, radon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon Are you asking me or telling me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard Telling you? Telling you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon All right, next question. Kirk or Picard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard Oh, uh, well, that’s tricky. Um, well, uh, Original Series over Next Generation, but Picard over Kirk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon Correct. You’ve passed the first barrier to roommate-hood. You may enter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard Oh, this is pretty nice. Uh, the bedrooms are back there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon That depends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard I don’t understand, their, their existence is conditional?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon No, but your ability to perceive their existence is conditional on you passing the second and third barriers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard There’s three?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon Each more daunting than the last. Have a seat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon No! That’s where I sit!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard What’s the difference?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon This seat is ideally located both in relation to the heat source in the winter and a cross breeze in the summer. It also faces the television at a direct angle allowing me to immerse myself in entertainment or game play without being subjected to conversation. As a result, I’ve placed it in a state of eternal dibs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard Can you do that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon Cathedra mea, regulae meae. That’s Latin for my chair, my rules. Now, you said on the phone that your area of study is physics.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard Uh, yeah, experimental physics.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon Hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard What is that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon Doesn’t concern you. You’ll be going to the university every day?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon And you have a vehicle?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard A car, yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon And you’ll be willing to drive me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard Well, can’t you drive?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon I can. I choose not to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard Okay, I suppose I could drive you. Well that’s a point in my favour, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon Why don’t you let me do this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard Come on, I just asked.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon Last question. In a post-apocalyptic world, which task would you assign the highest priority? Locating a sustainable food source, re-establishing a functioning government, procreating, or preserving the knowledge of mankind?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard Uh, I’m gonna go with preserving the knowledge.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon That’s correct. FYI, I would have accepted any answer other than procreating. Come, I’ll show you the rest of the apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard Oh, good. I passed the barriers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon The second barrier. Don’t get cocky. This is the bathroom. Are you fairly regular?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard Uh, I guess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon This isn’t going to work if you’re guessing. When do you evacuate your bowels?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard When I have to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon When you have to? I’m sorry, I don’t rent to hippies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard I, I’m sorry, uh, in the morning. Around eight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon I can’t give you eight. I can give you seven thirty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard Fine. I’ll take it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon Third barrier passed. You have won the right to see your room. Huzzah!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard Is this it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon No, this is my room. People don’t go in my room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard So where do you sleep?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon I don’t understand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard If people don’t go in there, and you’re people, and… You are people, aren’t you? Making a joke.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon Do you do this often?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard On occasion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon Your room. You may want to repaint. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 penny Okay, and after all that, you just moved in?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 leonard No, I didn’t just move in. First we had to iron out a few details. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon Roommates agree that Friday nights shall be reserved for watching Joss Whedon’s brilliant new series Firefly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard Does that really need to be in the agreement?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon We might as well settle it now, it’s going to be on for years. Initial here. All right, that’s television and movies. Section nine, miscellany. The apartment’s flag is a gold lion rampant on a field of azure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard We have a flag?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon Never fly it upside down unless the apartment’s in distress. And next, if either of us ever invents time travel, we agree our first stop will be this meeting today in precisely five seconds.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon Well that’s disappointing. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 penny Why on earth did you agree to all that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 leonard It was the best apartment I’d seen, the rent was very reasonable and after you’ve passed the first three barriers you kind of want to take it all the way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 penny Well, I’m sorry, Leonard, it’s very hard to feel sympathy for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 leonard Okay, how about this? Let me tell you about the first time I brought a girl over. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard Shh. Just pretend we’re not here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon Leonard?Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard I’m sure he’ll go away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon I’m just going to keep knocking till you answer. Leonard? Leonard? Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard What do you want? I didn’t say come in!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon You asked what I wanted. I wanted to come in. I’m here because you violated our roommate agreement. Specifically, section eight, visitors, subsection C, females, paragraph four, coitus. Roommates shall give each other 12 hours notice of impending coitus.”
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard I didn’t even know her 12 hours ago.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 joyce_kim That’s it! I’m out of here!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard But, Joyce, come on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon 12 hours? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 penny Oh, my God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 leonard Do I get some sympathy now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 penny A little bit. Okay. Let me get this straight. You move in with this guy, he makes you sign a ridiculous roommate agreement, then he walks into your bedroom while you’re doing this Joyce Kim, and you still stay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 leonard Actually, I couldn’t get too mad at him about Joyce Kim.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 penny Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 leonard Well, I was doing some government research at the time, you know, military, rocket fuel. It’s kind of secret.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 penny What does that have to do with Joyce Kim?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 leonard As it turns out, she was a North Korean spy. Luckily, Sheldon drove her out before I revealed anything important. Which I’m not saying I would have.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 penny So, what, that’s it? You’ve stayed with Sheldon all this time because he kept you from going to federal prison?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 leonard That was part of it. The other part is what happened with the elevator.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 penny Oh, yeah, I’m wondering about that. You said it was working when you moved in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 leonard It was, but one night, Sheldon came home from work… 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon What is going on here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard Hey, Sheldon. This is Howard and Raj. They work at the university, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_howard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_raj Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon I’ll get to you later. What are you sitting on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_howard I can’t speak for these guys, but I’m sitting on my tushie. It’s a joke.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard Yeah, not a good idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_raj Tushie is buttocks, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_howard Right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_raj Hilarious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon Explain the couch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard Oh, well, there were some people on the first floor moving out, and they sold it to me for a hundred dollars. Howard and Raj helped me bring it up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon But what’s wrong with the furniture we have?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard They’re lawn chairs. And there was no place for company.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon Did it occur to you that was by design?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard According to the roommate agreement, I’m entitled to allocate 50% of the cubic footage of the common areas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon But you didn’t notify me by e-mail, so this is still a breach.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard I did notify you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon Oh, you did, did you? Oh, drat! Hoisted by my own spam filter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard What am I doing in your spam folder?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon I put you there after you forwarded me a picture of a cat playing the piano, entitled this is funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_raj Oh, yeah, I saw that. That was hilarious. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 penny Okay, what does all this have to do with the elevator?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 leonard I’m getting to it. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon I assure you, you’ll be sorry you wasted your money on an iPod when Microsoft comes out with theirs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_raj Okay, do you have an opinion about everything?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_howard And you just assume you’re always right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon It’s not an assumption. Change seats with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_raj Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon I don’t like this spot. I have to keep turning my head.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_raj Fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard Ooh, it’s time for Babylon 5!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon We don’t watch Babylon 5 in this apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon Because no one likes Babylon 5.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard I like it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_raj Me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_howard So do I.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard There you go– three against one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon They don’t get a vote. It’s one against one. And according to the roommate agreement, all ties will be settled by me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard But I said no to that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon And I said yes. And I settle all ties. Change seats with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_howard Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon There’s a draft on my neck over here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_howard So, I get the draft?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon You’re protected by your turtleneck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_howard Fine. And it’s a dickey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon Hmm, I’m still not comfortable. Of course. There’s too many people here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard We can fix that. Let’s leave.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_howard Yeah, we can go over to my place.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon Wait. Let me get my jacket.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_howard You’re not going with us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_raj You’re the guy we’re trying to get away from.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon Oh. Well, in that case, I don’t need my jacket. And for the record, the correct syntax is I’m the guy from whom you’re trying to get away. Oh, yes, this is definitely going to be my spot. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 penny Okay, how do you know he said that? You left the room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 leonard Hey, do you want me to finish working on your man feet or not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 penny Fine. Go ahead. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 mrs_wolowitz Howard, are you having a playdate?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_howard I don’t have playdates! I have colleagues!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 mrs_wolowitz Do their parents know they’re here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_howard No, but if you keep screaming, maybe they’ll hear you!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard That your dad?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_howard She grows any more hair on her face, yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard Oh, man. Is that a two-stage rocket?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_howard Three. I designed the engine myself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_raj Cool. Can it break Mach 1?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_howard Oh, probably, if I could get my hands on that new fuel the government’s been working on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard Oh, this just might be your lucky day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 mrs_wolowitz Howard, what happened to the Oreos I left on the counter?!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_howard I haven’t seen your Oreos! Just take your bath without them! 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 penny So, why was it his lucky day?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 leonard Well, it turns out I had a little rocket fuel in the apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 penny What were you doing with rocket fuel in your apartment?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 leonard Mm, Joyce Kim was kind of curious about what I did for a living, and I was going to kind of show it to her. It’s not important. The point is, the guys and I went back to the apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 penny Are we ever going to get to the elevator?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 leonard Yeah, we’re really close. Uh, uh, we’re at the apartment. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard The trick is to mix it into Tovex in order to create a combustible gel that will generate over 8,000 kilonewtons of thrust.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_howard Nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_raj Cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon Won’t work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard Excuse me, but I’ve been working on this a long time. Trust me, it’ll work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon You don’t see your mistake, do you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard There’s no mistake.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon This is for a full-scale rocket, not a model.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard Well, I’ve adjusted the formula.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon Not correctly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard Okay, I’ve had it with you. You might be an expert on theoretical physics and science-fiction programs and where to sit on a freaking couch, but this is applied physics. And when it comes to applied physic… uh-oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_howard What’s happening?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard A bad thing. A very bad thing. Get the door. Get the door! Get the door! Get the door! Get the door!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_howard You’re waiting for the elevator?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard Oh. Right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_raj Wait. It’s here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon Give me that. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_leonard What’d you do that for? I had plenty of time. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_sheldon You’re welcome. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 leonard Not only did Sheldon save my life, he didn’t rat me out to the landlord. Or the police. Or Homeland Security.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 penny Okay, so, basically, you’re the reason I have to walk up and down three flights of stairs every day?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 leonard So I did something stupid. I’m sure you did stupid things when you were younger. What were you doing seven years ago?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 penny Excuse me, I was in high school. Studying, keeping my nose clean, doing volunteer work for the community. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 past_penny Not pregnant. Yes!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 sheldon Oh, Ubuntu, you are my favourite Linux-based operating system.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 leonard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 sheldon Hello. Why do I smell methacrylate?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 leonard Oh, uh, clear nail polish. I had a mani-pedi. Men can get those. Anyway, I may owe you an apology.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 sheldon There’s doubt?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 leonard I did agree to the thermostat setting, and I shouldn’t have tried to change it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 sheldon That’s not an apology, simply an acknowledgement that I was right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 leonard Okay, I’m sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 sheldon There you go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 leonard So, we’re good?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 sheldon Good what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 leonard Never mind. Okay if I watch some TV?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 sheldon Go ahead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 television_voice Up next Babylon 5.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 leonard You’re not even watching!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 sheldon I can hear it!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 leonard Oh, so the dialogue offends you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 sheldon I would hardly call that dialogue!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 leonard You’re insane, you know that?!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode22 sheldon Don’t make me turn that flag upside down, ’cause you know I’ll do it!
