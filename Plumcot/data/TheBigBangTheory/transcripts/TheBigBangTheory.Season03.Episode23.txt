TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Okay, we’ve got power to the laser.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper I should’ve brought an umbrella.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter What for? It’s not going to rain.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper I know that, but with skin as fair as mine, moon burn is a real possibility.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 howard_wolowitz That’s a bazinga, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper One of my best, don’t you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Howard, do you want to double-check the equatorial mount on the laser? We need it locked onto the Sea of Tranquility.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 howard_wolowitz You got it. Oh, Raj, no. Billions of dollars have gone into inventing the Internet and filling it with pictures of naked women, so we don’t have to peep through windows.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 raj_koothrappali It’s not like that, I’m watching someone’s TV. The Good Wife is on. I tell you, this is my new Grey’s Anatomy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Leonard, Leonard. What is that? What is that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Relax, it’s just a dirty sock.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper How on earth can you say dirty sock and relax in the same sentence?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, the world is filled with dirty discarded socks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Not my world.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Hey, you know who’d really dig seeing this experiment? Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper I wasn’t aware that lunar ranging was her thing. Although, I suppose the retro-reflector left on the moon by Neil Armstrong does qualify as a shiny object.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Why don’t you ask her to come up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter I don’t know, it’s still a little weird since, you know…
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 howard_wolowitz She dumped you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter She didn’t dump me. We were just in different places in the relationship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper I fail to see how a relationship can have the qualities of a geographic location.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Oh, it’s very simple. Leonard was living in a little town called please don’t leave me, while Penny had just moved to the island of bye-bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Screw you guys. I’m gonna go see if she’s home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 howard_wolowitz If it’s not too much trouble, I’d like to point this at the moon now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Wait a second, the good wife is crying. Something’s very wrong.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 penny Oh, hi. What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter We’re up on the roof bouncing laser beams off the moon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 penny I’m sorry, what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter It’s pretty cool. We’ve got a two-meter parabolic reflector and everything. I thought you might want to see it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 man_in_pennys_apartment#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 That makes no sense.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 penny Um…
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 How can you bounce stuff off the moon? There’s no gravity.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 penny Uh, Leonard, this is Zack. Zack, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 zack_johnson Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Oh, sorry, I didn’t know you were busy. Maybe another time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 penny Yeah, maybe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 zack_johnson Hey, I want to see this laser thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 penny Oh, but what about the party?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 zack_johnson It’s a surprise party, doesn’t matter when we get there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 penny Oh, right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Okay, well, yeah, come on up. So, how’d you two guys meet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 zack_johnson My company designs the menus for the Cheesecake Factory.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Your company?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 zack_johnson Well,, my dad, but me and my sister are VPs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter So, menus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 zack_johnson I know it sounds easy but there’s a lot of science that goes in designing them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Happy now? I’m moving the dirty sock.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Thank you. Raj, keep an eye out for the other one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 penny Hey, guys, this is my friend Zack.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 zack_johnson Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 zack_johnson Whoa! Is that the laser? It’s bitchin’.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Yes. In 1917, when Albert Einstein established the theoretic foundation for the laser in his paper Zur Quantentheorie der Strahlung, his fondest hope was that the resultant device be bitchin’.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 zack_johnson Well, mission accomplished.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Let me explain what we’re doing here. Um, in 1969, the astronauts on Apollo 11 positioned reflectors on the surface of the moon, and we’re going to shoot a laser off one of them and let the light bounce back into this photomultiplier.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 penny Oh! That’s very cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 zack_johnson One question. How can you be sure it won’t blow up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter The laser?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 zack_johnson The moon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper See, now this is a man for Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Uh, that’s a great question, Zack.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper No, it’s not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 penny Sheldon! Play nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Well it’s not a great question. How could somebody possibly think we’re going to blow up the moon? That’s a great question.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Don’t worry about the moon. We, we set our laser to stun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 zack_johnson Smart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Now, we’ll be able to see the beam when it leaves, but it won’t be strong enough when it comes back to be seen by the naked eye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 zack_johnson Naked.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Right. Uh yeah, funny. Uh, that device there will measure the photons that return and let us see it on this computer. Raj, get them some glasses.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 zack_johnson Cool, it’s gonna be in 3-D?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Preparing to fire laser at the moon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Make it so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 howard_wolowitz There it is. There’s the spike!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter 2.5 seconds for the light to return. That’s the moon! We hit the moon!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 zack_johnson That’s your big experiment? All that for a line on the screen?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, but, uh, think about what this represents. The fact that we can do this is the only way of definitively proving that there are man-made objects on the moon, put there by a member of a species that only 60 years before had just invented the airplane.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 zack_johnson What species is that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper I was wrong. Penny can do better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 penny Okay, guys, thank you, it’s been fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 zack_johnson Yeah, thanks. Should we invite them to the party?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 penny No, just keep walking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper He must be very skilled at coitus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 raj_koothrappali I’m telling you, dude, the only way to feel better about Penny going out with other guys is for you to get back on the whores.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Horse.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 raj_koothrappali What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 howard_wolowitz The phrase is get back on the horse, not whores.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 raj_koothrappali That’s disgusting, dude.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 howard_wolowitz No, it’s not… Never mind. He is right, though. If you want, I can turn you on to this great new dating site I found.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter No, thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 howard_wolowitz You sure? They say they can find a match for anybody.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Have they found a match for you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Tons. I’ve had, like, eight dates in the last month. And twelve if you count the ones who showed up and left.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper I can’t bring the nitrogen tank down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper All right, let me restate that. It’s very heavy, and I don’t want to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter I’ll help you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Thank you. Lift with your knees, not your back. Good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 raj_koothrappali You know what would be fun? Signing Sheldon up for online dating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Yeah, right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 raj_koothrappali No, think about it. We make it an experiment. Like when Frankenstein’s monster was lonely and he found a wife.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 howard_wolowitz He didn’t find a wife. They built him a wife out of dead body parts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Okay, we’ll call that plan B.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Coming!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 penny Damn you, you rat bastard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Are you drunk?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 penny Zack was a perfectly nice guy, and then you ruined him!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter How did I ruin him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 penny ‘Cause in the olden days, I never would’ve known he was so stupid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Come on, he wasn’t that stupid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 penny Yes, he was! He thought you were gonna blow up the moon!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Okay, yeah, he’s stupid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 penny He spent the entire night bragging about how he invented the word appe-teasers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter How is that my fault?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 penny You have destroyed my ability to tolerate idiots. Now, come with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Where are we going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 penny We’re gonna have sex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Why? I mean, okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 penny Put on your noise-cancelling headphones, ’cause it’s gonna get loud.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Oh! Not this again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper In what universe is this low-pulp? Good morning, Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 penny What, do you have eyes in the back of your head?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper When one gets beaten up every other day in school, one of necessity develops a keen sense of hearing. Incidentally, one can get beaten up in school simply by referring to oneself as one. I’m making English muffins. Would you like an English muffin?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 penny Oh, thanks, I’m not hungry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper FYI, my noise-cancelling headphones proved ineffective last night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 penny Yeah, sorry about that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper As a native Texan, I must say I’ve never heard the phrase yee-haw used in quite that context.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 penny Oh, God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Oh, God. That I’ve heard on multiple occasions. In what universe is that lightly toasted? This has to be the worst day of my life. Good morning, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter How many times have I asked you not to do that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Counting this instance? 317.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Where’s Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper She returned to her apartment. I presume to shower and vomit. Not necessarily in that order.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter I wonder why she didn’t say good-bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Are you expecting me to offer an explanation of human behaviour?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter I know. I just thought as an outsider, you might be able to provide a fresh perspective.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper I have no difficulty believing you’re not butter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Oh, hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 penny Oh, hi. Um, I gotta run. Early shift.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Okay, I’ll walk down with you. So, last night was fun, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 penny Yeah, it must have been. I just threw up in my closet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Bummer. Anyway, I was thinking tonight maybe we could catch a movie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 penny Oh, yeah, tonight’s not great for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Doesn’t have to be tonight. I’m free pretty much always.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 penny Leonard, last night was a mistake.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter When you say mistake, do you mean a fortunate mistake, like the discovery of penicillin?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 penny Look, I’m sorry. I was drunk, I was lonely, I hated Zack. Can we just forget it ever happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter No, it’s pretty well imprinted on my brain. Especially the whole rodeo thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 penny Oh, God!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter So, that’s it? Wham, bam, thank you, Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 penny Look, I said I’m sorry. Can’t u please let it go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter How am I supposed to let it go? You used me for sex! Morning, Mrs. Gunderson.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 mrs_gunderson Good morning, Leonard. Or should I say yee-haw?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Holy crap.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 howard_wolowitz What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 raj_koothrappali We finally have proof that aliens walk among us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Excuse me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 raj_koothrappali The dating site matched a woman with Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 howard_wolowitz You’re kidding. An actual woman?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Yeah, look. Breasts and everything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Trust me, breasts doesn’t necessarily mean woman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Since when?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 howard_wolowitz I’ll show you a picture of my Uncle Louie in a bathing suit sometime. Leonard, you gotta see this, we found a match for Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Great. Maybe she can have sex with him, and then walk out on him the next morning without so much as a how do you do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Do you know what he’s talking about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Nope. Why don’t you ask him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Leonard, what are you talking about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter I don’t want to talk about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 raj_koothrappali That was a lousy suggestion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Whatever. Right now, Dr. Sheldon Cooper has to send an e-mail to his perfect match. Greetings, fellow life-form…
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter If she can do it, I can do it. If she can do it, I can do it. If she can do it, I can do it. I can’t do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leslie_winkle Hello?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Oh, hi. Hey. Hi, Leslie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leslie_winkle Leonard Hofstadter. What’re you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Uh, I know! It’s been a while!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leslie_winkle Yeah, 18 months.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Right. Right. So how you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leslie_winkle Fine. You?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Uh, not bad. You remember when we used to have sex and you said that it didn’t mean anything, it was just for fun?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leslie_winkle Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Uh, do you, uh, want to do that again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leslie_winkle What happened? Blondie dumped you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter She didn’t dump me. We were just in different places in the relationship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leslie_winkle Right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Um, anyway, apparently, it’s okay to go back to people you’re no longer seeing and have recreational sex with them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leslie_winkle Uh-huh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter So, what do you say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leslie_winkle Let me think about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter She’s not coming back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Uh-oh. She wants to meet us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Not us. Him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Yes, but him doesn’t even know about her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Well, him about to find out about her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Really? Us gonna tell him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Who’s going to tell whom about what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Sheldon. Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Your surprise confuses me. I live here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Right. So, listen, what are you doing tomorrow afternoon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Be more specific.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Four thirty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper That’s not afternoon. That’s preevning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 howard_wolowitz What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper It’s a time of day I invented. It better defines the ambiguous period between afternoon and evening. Preevning. I’m fairly certain it will catch on as it fills a desperate need.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Right, okay. What are you doing tomorrow preevning?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Well, tomorrow’s Saturday. Saturday night is laundry night, so I’ll be spending the preevning pre-sorting and pre-soaking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Okay, what if I were to tell you, tomorrow, at 4:30 you could meet a woman who has been scientifically chosen to be your perfect mate?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper I would snort in derision and throw my arms in the air, exhausted by your constant tomfoolery.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 raj_koothrappali But it’s true. But we-we put all your vital information into this dating site, answered all their questions just like you would, and they found a match for you. Her name is Amy Farrah Fowler.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Please. Even assuming you could answer any question the way I would, the algorithms used by matchmaking sites are complete hokum.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 howard_wolowitz And that’s exactly the answer we gave to the question, what is your attitude towards online dating”
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Howard wanted to write mumbo jumbo, but I said no, our Sheldon would say hokum.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Well, come on, where’s your scientific curiosity?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Well, most of it is being applied to unravelling the secrets of the universe while the rest of it’s wondering why I’m having this conversation with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Okay, how about this. Even Spock had a date once every seven years.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper He didn’t date. It was pon farr. His blood boiled with mating lust.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Okay, well, why don’t you start with a cup of coffee, and you can pon farr Amy Farrah Fowler later.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper I don’t drink coffee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 howard_wolowitz All right, you can have a hot chocolate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper As I will not be engaging in this nonsense, my choice of beverage is moot. But for the record, I only drink hot chocolate in months with an R in them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper What’s life without whimsy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Okay, I’m out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Sheldon, I’ve hidden the dirty sock from the roof somewhere in your apartment. Unless you are willing to come with us to meet this girl, it will remain there forever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper You’re bluffing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Are you willing to risk it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Curse you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Thirty feet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 penny Oh. Hey, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter I was a perfectly happy, geeky, little lonely guy, and you ruined me!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 penny Are you drunk?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Come on. We’re gonna have sex, and it’s not gonna mean a thing!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 penny Are you out of your mind?!
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter I’m really starting to think there’s a double standard here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper In a few minutes, when I gloat over the failure of this enterprise, how would you prefer I do it? The standard I told you so? The classic neener-neener? Or just my normal look of haughty derision?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 raj_koothrappali You don’t know we’re wrong yet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Haughty derision it is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 amy_farrah_fowler Excuse me. I’m Amy Farrah Fowler. You’re Sheldon Cooper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Hello, Amy Farrah Fowler. I’m sorry to inform you that you have been taken in by unsupportable mathematics designed to prey on the gullible and the lonely. Additionally, I’m being blackmailed with a hidden dirty sock.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 amy_farrah_fowler If that was slang, I’m unfamiliar with it. If it was literal, I share your aversion to soiled hosiery. In any case, I’m here because my mother and I have agreed that I will date at least once a year.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Interesting. My mother and I have the same agreement about church.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 amy_farrah_fowler I don’t object to the concept of a deity, but I’m baffled by the notion of one that takes attendance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Well, then you might want to avoid East Texas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 amy_farrah_fowler Noted. Now, before this goes any further, you should know that all forms of physical contact up to and including coitus are off the table.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 sheldon_cooper May I buy you a beverage?
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 amy_farrah_fowler Tepid water, please.
TheBigBangTheory.Season03.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Good God, what have we done?
