TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 howard And now the kung pao chicken.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 leonard Alright.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 raj Smooth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 howard And finally, my moo shu pork.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 raj Whoo-hoo!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 howard Ah, there you have it, gentlemen. Our entire dinner unpacked by robot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 raj And it only took 28 minutes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon Impressive, but we must be cautious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 howard Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon Today, it’s a Chinese food retrieval robot. Tomorrow, it travels back in time and tries to kill Sarah Connor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 leonard I don’t think that’s going to happen, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon No one ever does. That’s why it happens.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Hey. Is the food here? Ooh. What’s that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 howard That, dear lady, is the Wolowitz Programmable Hand, designed for extravehicular repairs on the International Space Station.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Ah, cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 howard Ask me to pass the soy sauce.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Oh, does that come up much on the space station?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 howard Mostly with Asian and Jewish astronauts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny All right. Pass the soy sauce.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 howard Coming up. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 leonard So how’s work?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Oh, it’s not bad. Kind of hungry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 leonard Yeah, we all are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 howard Just wait.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon You realize, Penny, that the technology that went into this arm will one day make unskilled food servers such as yourself obsolete.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Really? They’re going to make a robot that spits on your hamburger?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon I thought you broke up with her. Why is she here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 howard Okay, here we go. Passing the soy sauce. Put out your hand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Oh ha-ha, oh. That’s amazing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon I wouldn’t say amazing. At best, it’s a modest leap forward from the basic technology that gave us Country Bear Jamboree.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 howard Hey, Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon Yes? Peace?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 howard No, not peace. Hang on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Does NASA know you’re using that thing as a napkin holder?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 howard You kidding? They still think it’s in a secure locker at JPL.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny You stole it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 howard Borrowed. The trick is to carry it out to your car like you own it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon Excuse me. Oh. Amy’s at the dry cleaners, and she’s made a very amusing pun. “I don’t care for perchloroethylene, and I don’t like glycol ether.” Get it? She doesn’t like glycol ether. Sounds like either. L-O-L.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Who’s Amy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 leonard His girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Sheldon has a girlfriend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon She’s not my girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny How long has this been going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 leonard Four months.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon She’s not my girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Are you telling me, for the past four months I have been asking you what’s new and you never thought to go with Sheldon has a girlfriend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon She’s not my girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Ah, du-du-du-du-du. How did they meet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 howard Raj and I entered Sheldon’s information on a dating site, and it spit out Amy Farrah Fowler.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Oh, my God! Sheldon and Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 howard Or, as we call them, Shamy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Shamy. I am so digging the Shamy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon All right, everyone pay attention. Yes, I have a friend named Amy Farrah Fowler. Yes, she is female. Yes, we communicate on a daily basis, but no, she is not my girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Okay, well, what do you communicate about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon Well, my work in physics, her work in neurobiology, and most recently, the possibility of our having a child together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 leonard Wait a minute– a child? You never see this girl. You just e-mail and text and Twitter. Now you’re considering having a baby?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon Amy pointed out that between the two of us, our genetic material has the potential of producing the first in a line of intellectually superior, benign overlords to guide humanity to a brighter tomorrow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 howard I’m guessing that future historians will condemn us for not taking this opportunity to kill Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Okay, I have a question.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon Yes, Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny You don’t even like people touching you. How are you going to have sex?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon Why on Earth would we have sex?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Oh, honey, did your mom not have the talk with you? You know, when your private parts started growing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon I’m quite aware of the way humans usually reproduce, which is messy, unsanitary, and based on living next to you for three years, involves loud and unnecessary appeals to a deity.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Oh, God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon Yes, exactly. Consequently, if Amy and I choose to bring new life into this world, it will be accomplished clinically, with fertility experts in a lab with petri dishes. Which reminds me, you have broad hips and a certain corn-fed vigour. Is your womb available for rental?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 leonard Still digging the Shamy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Look, Sheldon, before you race off to the fertility clinic, you might want to think about, uh gee, I don’t know, maybe actually spending some time with her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon You mean dating?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon I can’t date Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon She’s not my girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Okay, look, don’t think of it as dating a girlfriend. Think of it as, uh, getting to know the future mother of your child.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon Oh. I hadn’t considered that. I suppose she will have to have access to our progeny. And you don’t think I can achieve the required intimacy via text messaging?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Probably not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon Huh. It would appear as if the phone companies have been lying to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon Penny. Penny. Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny You do realize I stand on the other side of the door waiting for you to finish knocking three times.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon I know. I can see the shadow of your feet under the door.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Yeah, my point is it’s a waste of time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon If you’re looking for an example of a waste of time, I would refer you to the conversation we’re having right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny What do you want?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon I’ve decided to take your advice and have arranged to go on a date with Amy Farrah Fowler.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Oh, that’s great. Have fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon Wait. You have to drive me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon You know I don’t drive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Well, go ask Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon I did. He said, and I quote, ask Penny, it was her cockamamie idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Leonard said cockamamie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon Actually, I’m paraphrasing. Having been raised in a Christian household, I’m uncomfortable with the language he used. And to be honest, I’m not entirely comfortable with cockamamie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Okay, fine. When’s the date?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon Now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon Hurry. We’re going to be late.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Sheldon, did it ever occur to you that I might have other plans?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon I’m sorry. Do you have other plans?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Well, no, not per se, but…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon So this conversation is as pointless as your door-knocking soliloquy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Let me get my cockamamie keys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 howard Oh, God, that feels so good. Yeah, that’s the spot. Oh, baby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 mrs_wolowitz Howard, dinner’s ready!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 howard I’ll eat later. I’m busy! Oh, yeah. Just like a real hand. Hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon Thank you for driving me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny You’re welcome.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon I wish you weren’t wearing flip-flops. It’s dangerous to drive in flip-flops.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon Sorry. I just don’t want to be yet another flip-flop fatality.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Can I ask you a question?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon Given your community college education, I encourage you to ask me as many as possible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Yeah. Well, my question is, and I’m pretty sure I know the answer, is this your first date?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon That depends. Does square-dancing with my sister at a Teens for Jesus Fourth of July Hoedown count as a date?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon Then, this is my first date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Okay. Well, then, there’s a couple of things you should probably know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon I have a master’s degree and two doctorates. The things I should know, I do know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny My point is, I know more about dating than you, and if you were as smart as you think you are, you would listen to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon If you know so much, how come I have a date tonight and you have nothing better to do than drive me to it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Fair point.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 raj You know, there’s something I’ve always wondered about Aquaman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 leonard Yeah?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 raj Where does he poop?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 raj What would a toilet look like in Atlantis? How would you flush it? And when you did flush it, where would the poop go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 leonard Hold that thought. Hey, Howard, what’s going on? What? Hold on, Howard, Howard, slow down. The robot hand is stuck on your what? You’re not going to believe this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny So, um, Amy, Sheldon tells me you’re a neuro something-or-other.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 amy Neurobiologist. Your check engine light is on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Yeah, it’s okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 amy But the light indicates…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon Don’t bother. I’ve wasted many an hour tilting at that particular windmill.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Um, what is that scent you’re wearing? It smells great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 amy Dandruff shampoo. I have dry scalp.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Ah. Well, your hair looks very nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 amy Are you a homosexual?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny No, no, I was just giving you a compliment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 amy Hmm. Would have been more flattered if you were a homosexual.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Guys, how ’bout some music?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon Oh, no, I wouldn’t care for that. Amy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 amy No, thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Okay. Uncomfortable silence it is. Hey, Sheldon, have you told Amy what it was like for you growing up in Texas?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Well, why don’t you tell her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon All right. It was hell.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Any follow up, Amy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 amy No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny I myself grew up in Nebraska. Small town outside of Omaha. You know, nice place, mostly family farms, a few meth labs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon I’m sorry, how is this better than uncomfortable silence?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny I don’t know. I was just trying something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon Muggles.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 raj You slipped and fell into a robot hand?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 howard Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 raj Penis first?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 howard Yes. Now, help me!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 leonard I’d suggest a lubricant, but I have a feeling you fell on some of that as well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 howard Not funny, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 raj Really? A robot hand’s got a death grip on your junk, dude. That’s funny, ask anyone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 howard Please, before my mother walks in, just get this off me!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 leonard Okay, let’s see.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 howard No, no! Don’t touch, the program is paused.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 leonard Well, then let’s un-pause it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 howard No, no! I loaded the wrong program. The hand thinks it’s holding a screwdriver in outer space. If you continue the program, it’s gonna start twisting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 raj A-All right, um, how about this. When, when Winnie the Pooh got his head stuck in the honey tree, his friends all grabbed onto him and pulled and pulled.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 leonard You do what you want, I’m not touching another man’s honey tree.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 raj All right, uh, forget pulling. How about we get an electric saw and cut it off?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 howard What? No saws! One circumcision was enough.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 leonard How about an acetylene torch?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 howard Okay, I can’t believe this needs to be said out loud. No pulling, no saws, no torches.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 leonard Well, then what do you want us to do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 howard I…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 mrs_wolowitz Howard, I made cookies for you and your little friends!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 howard That’s great, Mom, thanks!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 mrs_wolowitz I’ll bring them up with some Hawaiian Punch!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 howard Don’t come up here!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 mrs_wolowitz Why not?! Are you ashamed of your mother?!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 howard Yes, but that’s not the point! Get me out of here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 leonard You have any ideas, Raj?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 raj Right now, all I can think about is cookies and Hawaiian Punch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Hey, here’s another possible topic of conversation. This is a big night for Sheldon. Right, Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon Big night? The winter solstice is a big night. It’s over 14 hours in Southern California.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 amy That’s an amusing factoid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny No, no. My point is, uh, tonight is Sheldon’s first official date. Discuss.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 amy Is this true?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon Apparently, a semi-incestuous Teens for Jesus Fourth of July Hoedown didn’t count.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny So, um, Amy, what about you? Do you date much?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 amy Once a year. It’s a deal I made with my mother in exchange for her silence on the matter, as well as the occasional use of her George Foreman Grill that seals in the flavour without the fat. How about you, Penny? Do you go on many dates?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Uh, yeah, I wouldn’t say many. A few. . What’s 
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon Your characterization of approximately 171 different men as a few.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny What? Where did you get 171 men?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon Simple extrapolation. In the three years that I’ve known you, you were single for two. During that time, I saw 17 different suitors. If we work backwards, correcting for observation bias and postulate an initial dating age of 15…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Whoa, wait, wait, wait. I did not start dating at 15.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon I’m sorry. 16?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny 14.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon My mistake. Now, assuming the left side of a bell curve peaking around the present, that would bring the total up to 193 men. Plus or minus eight men.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 amy Remarkable. Did you have sexual intercourse with all of these men?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon Although that number would be fairly easy to calculate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon Based on the number of awkward encounters I’ve had with strange men leaving her apartment in the morning, plus the number of times she’s returned home wearing the same clothes she wore the night before…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Okay, Sheldon, I think you’ve made your point.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon So we multiply 193, minus 21 men before the loss of virginity, so 172 times 0.18 gives us 30.96 sexual partners. Let’s round that up to 31.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Okay, Sheldon, you are so wrong. That is not even close to the real number. I’m gonna need a drink over here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 amy This is very interesting. Cultural perceptions are subjective. Penny, to your mind, are you a slut?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny No! No! No. Let’s just all finish our dinners, okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon This is an interesting topic. How many sexual encounters have you had?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 amy Does volunteering for a scientific experiment in which orgasm was achieved by electronically stimulating the pleasure centres of the brain count?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon I should think so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 amy Then 128.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 leonard Okay, come on. Almost there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 howard Don’t tug. No tugging.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 raj Next time, take your own advice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 leonard Excuse me, could you help us out?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 nurse My, my, my. What do we have here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 howard I slipped and fell.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 nurse Yeah, we get that a lot. What is this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 howard It’s a robot arm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 nurse Where’s the rest of the robot?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 howard I only built the arm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 nurse ‘Cause that’s all you needed, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 howard Can you please just help me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 nurse All right, all right. Hang on, stay calm. I need an orderly with a wheelchair. I got a robot hand grasping a man’s penis out here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 howard You think you could be a little more discreet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 nurse I’m sorry, we don’t have a code for robot hand grasping a man’s penis. Why is it hooked up to a computer?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 leonard Uh, it’s what controls the arm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 howard But it’s frozen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 nurse Did you try turning it off and back on again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 howard No, you see, it’s more complicated than that. No, wait! Winnie the Pooh is out of the honey tree.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 raj Now can we have cookies and Hawaiian Punch?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon You were right. This was a very productive evening. I saw a whole new side of Amy Farrah Fowler tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny I did not have sex with 31 guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon I’ll be happy to check the math, but numbers don’t lie, Penny. In any event, now that Amy and I have spent quality time together, I feel much more confident proceeding to the next stage of our relationship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny And that is?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon Using in vitro fertilization and a surrogate uterus to gift humanity with our progeny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny You’re still on that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon In these uncertain times, doesn’t humanity deserve a gift?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Okay, you know what? I’m gonna come at this in a whole new way. Sheldon, if you try to make a baby with Amy in a petri dish, I’m gonna tell your mother on you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon That’s no threat. My mother’s always wanted a grandchild.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny Really? Your deeply religious born-again Christian mother wants a test-tube grandbaby born out of wedlock?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon Curses.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 penny If I’d thought of that in the first place, I could’ve saved myself this whole night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon Well, it’s not that late. You could still go out and look for number 32. Good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 leonard Hey, Howard, what’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 sheldon I’ve decided not to procreate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode01 leonard Yeah, yeah, great. Howard, uh, slow down. What do you mean it happened again?
