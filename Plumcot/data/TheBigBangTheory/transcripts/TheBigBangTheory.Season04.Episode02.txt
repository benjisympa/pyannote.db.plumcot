TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Whatcha doin’ there? Working on a new plan to catch the roadrunner?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper The humorous implication being that I am Wile E. Coyote?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper And this is a schematic for a bird-trapping device that will ultimately backfire and cause me physical injury?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper What I’m doing here is trying to determine when I’m going to die.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter A lot of people are working on that research. So what is all this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper My family history factoring in longevity, propensity for disease, et cetera.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Interesting. Cause of death for Uncle Carl was KBB. What’s KBB?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Killed by badger.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter How’s that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper It was Thanksgiving. Uncle Carl said, I think there’s a badger living in our chimney. Hand me that flashlight. Those were the last words he ever spoke to us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter I don’t think you need to worry about death by badgers being hereditary.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Not true. The fight or flight instinct is coded genetically. Instead of fleeing, he chose to fight barehanded against a brawny member of the weasel family. Who’s to say that I don’t share that flawed DNA?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter You can always get a badger and find out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper But seriously, even if I disregard the Uncle Carl factor, at best I have 60 years left.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter That long, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper 60 only takes me to here. I need to get to here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter What’s there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper The earliest estimate of the singularity, when man will be able to transfer his consciousness into machines and achieve immortality.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter So, you’re upset about missing out on becoming some sort of freakish self-aware robot?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper By this much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Tough break. You want eggs?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper You don’t get it, Leonard. I’m going to miss so much, the unified field theory cold fusion, the dogapus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter What’s a dogapus?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper A hybrid dog and octopus. Man’s underwater best friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Is somebody working on that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I was going to. I planned on giving it to myself on my 300th birthday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Wait a minute. You hate dogs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper A dogapus can play fetch with eight balls. No one can hate that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 howard_wolowitz What do we owe you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter It came to $28.17. Let’s say six bucks apiece.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Here you go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Never mind. I got it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny Oh, you wanted me to pay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter It’s no big deal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny No, no, no, no. You’re right. We’re not going out anymore, I should pay for myself. What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 howard_wolowitz He said if he had woman parts, he’d eat for free the rest of his life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny Yeah, but you wouldn’t be able to talk to yourself. I’m a little low on cash.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Hmm? How much you got?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny Nothing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter How can you walk around with no money?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny I’m cute. I get by.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter It’s okay, you can owe me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, six bucks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper No, thank you. I’m not eating pizza tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny But it’s Thursday. Thursday’s pizza night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Not for me. Thursday is now Cruciferous Vegetable Night. Tonight’s selection, brussels sprouts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Really? You’re changing the Sheldonian calendar?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper It’s a small price to pay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny For what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter No, no, don’t ask.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper In order to live long enough to fuse my consciousness with cybernetics, I need to change my diet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny Wait. Cybernetics is robot stuff, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Correct.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny So you want to turn yourself into some sort of robot?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Essentially, yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny Okay, here’s my question. Didn’t you already do that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Flattering, but sadly, no. I’m also planning to begin an exercise regimen designed to strengthen my cardiovascular system. AKA jogging.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny Wait. Honey,have you ever run before?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Certainly. I’ve run from bullies, dogs, angry chickens, and one particularly persistent P.E. teacher determined to bend me over and give me a scoliosis test.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 howard_wolowitz You’re right, Penny jogs. Maybe you guys can run together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper That’s an excellent idea. Yeah, if we chat, it will create the illusion of time going faster.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny No, it won’t. Um, how does he know I jog?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Oh, he watches you from his car with high-powered binoculars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny Oh, my God, that is so creepy!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 howard_wolowitz I know! And he says he’s not gonna stop. Then see a shrink and figure out how to talk to women.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Ugh. U-u-ugh. Lenu-u-ugh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter What the hell? What’s the matter?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I have pain radiating from my navel to my lower right abdomen. I’m nauseated and feverish. I believe I may have cholera.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter There’s no cholera in Pasadena. Just like last summer, when there was no malaria in Pasadena.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Well, if it’s not cholera, then based on a quick Internet search, the other explanations in decreasing order of likelihood are Hirschsprung’s Disease, botulism, a 30-foot tapeworm or accidental ingestion of chrysanthemum blossoms.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter When would you have accidentally eaten chrysanthemum blossoms?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper It’s part of an unlikely scenario that involves sleepwalking and a 24-hour flower mart with a less-than-vigilant proprietor. Oh, Lord, my belly!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Have you had your appendix out?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I haven’t. I’ve been meaning to, but who has the time?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Let’s get you to the hospital.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper So this is how it ends, with cruel irony. Just as I make the commitment to preserving my body, I am betrayed by my appendix, a vestigial organ. Do you know the original purpose of the appendix, Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I do. And yet I’m doomed while you live on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Funny how things work out, isn’t it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Oh, Lord, I think it’s about to burst! On the other hand, it might have been the Brussels sprouts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Good night. Appendicitis. What a nervous Nelly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Penny. Penny. Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny Coming, coming. Hey, nice knees.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Thank you. They’re my mother’s.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny Oh. And the Flash shirt is what? Because you’re gonna run really fast?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper No, the Flash shirt is because it’s Friday, but it’s nice when things work out. Where’s your heart rate monitor?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny I don’t have one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper What about your pedometer?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny Don’t have one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Do you have telematics in your shoes connected to an iPod?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny Uh, no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper What do you do, you just go out there and gambol about like a bunny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny No. I just run till I’m hungry, then I stop for a bear claw.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Why are you doing that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny It’s good to stretch your muscles before you run.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny All right, let’s start with a toe touch. Okay, you do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I am doing it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny Oh. Wow. Good job. Okay, um, can you do this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper We’ll never know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny Okay, let’s just warm up on the run.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny Okay, let’s go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Yeah, I’ve been reading up on biomechanics. I think you’ll be surprised at my… Wah! Oh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny Oh, my God, are you okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I think so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny Oh, let me help you up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny Oh, Sheldon!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper If it makes you feel any better, Thursday is no longer Cruciferous Vegetable Night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Here’s my chicken curry. Howard, your shrimp biryani.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Thank you, sir.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Palak paneer, that’s Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter And for Rajesh Koothrappali, from whose homeland these tasty dishes originate, one large order of chicken McNuggets.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny Hey, what’s my share?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Uh, 12 bucks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny Okay, can I get you after Friday when I get paid?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny What am I up to now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Well, okay, with the Indian food, the pizza, the Thai food, the tank of gas, the frozen yogurt and your rent, uh, a little over fourteen hundred dollars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny What now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 howard_wolowitz He’s just expressing his admiration that you don’t even have to put out to get free stuff.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny It’s not free, I’m gonna pay him back. Shut up!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, are you gonna join us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Coming! . Greetings, friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Greetings, whatever the hell you are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 I am a mobile virtual presence device. Recent events have demonstrated to me that my body is too fragile to endure the vicissitudes of the world. Until such time as I am able to transfer my consciousness, I shall remain in a secure location and interact with the world in this manner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Really? That’s your question? When did he put a ramp in?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 You’re in my spot. This may seem a little odd at first, but over time you’ll grow accustomed to dealing with me in this configuration.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny Yeah, to be honest, I don’t see much difference.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 Thank you. That’s what I was going for. Now, Leonard, tomorrow, when we go to work, you’ll need to allow some extra time to get me down the stairs. For your convenience, I disassemble into four pieces.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter This is ridiculous. I’m coming to talk to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 You don’t know where I am. My physical body is safely ensconced in a secure, undisclosed location.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter You’re in your bedroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 No, I’m not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter I can hear your voice coming from your bedroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 No, you can’t. Wait. Come back. Halt. Authorized personnel only!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny So, either one of you weirdos want to buy my underwear? Only fourteen hundred bucks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, this is ridiculous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I’m behind you. Please look at me when you’re talking to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter I am looking at you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper No, you’re not. Pay no attention to that man in the bed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter You cannot exist as a virtual presence. Not here and certainly not at work. Oh, good God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper At my age, do you know how I’m statistically most likely to die?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter At the hands of your roommate?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper An accident.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter That’s how I’m going to make it look.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Until I can transfer my intellect to a more durable container, my body will remain safely ensconced in my bed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Fine, but don’t expect my help.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper You have to help, it’s in the roommate agreement.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter No, it’s not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Section 74.C. The various obligations and duties of the parties in the event one of them becomes a robot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter I’ll be damned.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 This is delightful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Uh-huh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 It’s much easier to enjoy the picturesque route we travel to work when you remove the spectre of fiery vehicular death.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Refresh my memory. Why didn’t I just put you in the trunk?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 Because I called shotgun. Remember?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 You seem tense. Perhaps this will relax you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter I don’t want to listen to music, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 Very well. I don’t understand why you’re not enjoying this. Together, in this car, with my enhanced capabilities, we’re like Knight Rider.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Except in Knight Rider, the car isn’t a yammering sphincter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 You mock the sphincter, but the sphincter is a class of muscle without which human beings couldn’t survive. There are over 50 different sphincters in the human body. How many can you name?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter I was wrong, this is exactly like Knight Rider.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 Perhaps you’d be interested in a different game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 This is a photograph of the 1911 Solvay Conference on the theory of radiation and quanta. Using Photoshop, I’ve introduced a few anachronisms. See if you can spot all 24. I’ll give you the first one. Madame Curie should not be wearing a digital watch. And go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter That’s it. Bye-bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 Bazinga.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Whoa!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 I have an override switch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter I almost died!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 And I’m safe and sound in bed. Who’s crazy now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter I’m still going to go with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 Hello, Professor Hoskins. Nice to see you, Mindy. Konichi-wa Dr. Nakamora. Sorry the Swedes disproved your theory. Leonard, my door.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter What about it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 Be a lamb and open it for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Why? What’s the problem?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 You think you have me stymied, don’t you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter No, I think a doorknob has you stymied.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Oh, look, it’s Leonard and R2-D-Bag.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 raj_koothrappali That’s my joke. I told it last night. You can’t just use it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 Raj, be a lamb and open the door for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Oh, sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 He’s a lamb. You’re not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 raj_koothrappali I’m a lamb.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 Isn’t this nice? The pleasures of fellowship and camaraderie without having to tolerate your germy breath on my skin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 howard_wolowitz I say we just take him to Tatooine and sell him to some Jawas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 raj_koothrappali That’s two, dude. Write your own jokes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny Oh, great. Hi, I’m Penny, I’ll be your waitress.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Why are you introducing yourself?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny I’d rather people not know I have any prior connection to you whatsoever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 Can you tell me the specials this evening?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny Sheldon, I’m not waiting on you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 Obviously. I don’t even have water yet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny Because you’re not here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 That’s discrimination against the otherwise located. I’m going to have to go over your head. Manager, manager. Oh, Lord, look who it is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Is that Steve Wozniak?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter I think it is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 The Great and Powerful Woz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Penny, Steve Wozniak was one of the cofounders of Apple Computer. He and Steve Jobs started it…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny Yeah, I know who he is. I watch Dancing with the Stars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 I must speak to him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Of course you must.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny You know, there’s an Olive Garden down the street. You guys should try it sometime.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 Excuse me, Mr. Wozniak?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 steve_wozniak Oh, hey. Nice virtual presence device.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 Thank you. I just want to say I’m a big fan. You’re my fifteenth favourite technological visionary.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 steve_wozniak Only fifteenth?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 It’s still six spots above Steve Jobs. I care neither for turtlenecks nor showmanship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 steve_wozniak Yeah, I never got that turtleneck thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 One of my proudest possessions is a vintage 1977 Apple Two. Despite the file system limitations of Apple DOS 3.3, it was a pretty nifty little achievement.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 steve_wozniak Thanks, we were shooting for nifty. You know, if you had it here, I’d autograph it for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 Don’t move for 15 to 30 minutes, depending on how the buses are running.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 steve_wozniak Nerds.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I’m coming, Woz, I’m coming. Ow! Aw.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 Penny. Penny. Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny What up, Shel-Bot?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 I can’t get out of bed. I hurt my ankle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny What do you want me to do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 Sing me Soft Kitty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny Really, you want me to sing Soft Kitty to a computer monitor?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 Would you rather come over and sing it to me in person?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 Closer to the microphone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny Happy kitty, sleepy…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 sheldonbot#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 No. You have to start over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode02 penny Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr.
