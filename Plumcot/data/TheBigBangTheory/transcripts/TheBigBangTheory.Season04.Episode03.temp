TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon All right, I’m ready for my next question.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 amy In a world where rhinoceroses are domesticated pets, who wins the Second World War?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon Uganda.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 amy Defend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon Kenya rises to power on the export of rhinoceroses. A Central African power block is formed, colonizing North Africa and Europe. When war breaks out, no one can afford the luxury of a rhino. Kenya withers, Uganda triumphs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 amy Correct. My turn.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon In a world where a piano is a weapon, not a musical instrument, on what does Scott Joplin play The Maple Leaf Rag?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 amy Tuned bayonets.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon Defend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 amy Isn’t it obvious?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon You’re right. My apologies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard What the hell are you guys playing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon It’s a game we invented. It’s called Counterfactuals.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 amy We postulate an alternate world that differs from ours in one key aspect and then pose questions to each other.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon It’s fun for ages eight to eighty. Join us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard All right. I like a good brainteaser. Give it a whirl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon You’re in luck, this is an easy one. In a world where mankind is ruled by a giant intelligent beaver, what food is no longer consumed?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard Uh, a BLT where the B stands for beaver? I don’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon Leonard, be serious. We’re playing a game here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard I can figure this out, let’s see. Um, well, beavers eat tree bark. The only tree bark I know that humans consume is cinnamon. So, I’ll say cinnamon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon Incorrect. Obviously, the answer is cheese Danish.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 amy In a world ruled by a giant beaver, mankind builds many dams to please the beaver overlord. The low-lying city of Copenhagen is flooded. Thousands die. Devastated, the Danes never invent their namesake pastry. How does one miss that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard This is ridiculous. You’re just making stuff up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 amy Is he always like this when he loses?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon Oh, yes. You should’ve been here for the great Jenga tantrum of 2008.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard You bumped the table and you know it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 amy Perhaps it would be kinder to play a game more suited to his abilities. We’ll close our eyes and count to ten while you hide.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard I’m going to my room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 amy Very good, Leonard. But next time, don’t tell us where you’re hiding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard Did you guys see the paper in The American Physics Journal on supersolids? It’s pretty interesting. This guy’s working from a hypothesis where…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 raj Spoiler alert! Spoiler alert.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 raj Don’t ruin it for me, man. I printed out a PDF to read on the potty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 howard On the potty? What are you, five?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 raj It’s a potty. What do you call it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 howard Toilet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 raj That’s a little vulgar for the dinner table, don’t you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 howard Oh, and potty is okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 raj Potty is innocent. Potty is adorable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 howard What do you do in the potty, wee-wee?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 raj If I don’t have to boom-boom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon Greetings. You all remember Amy Farrah Fowler.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 howard Nice to see you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 amy Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon Sorry we’re late.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 amy I must take responsibility. I had to stop for feminine hygiene supplies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 howard Ah, ah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon I believe she’s experiencing her menses.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 amy Actually, I’m not. In order to avoid surprises, I wear them all the time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard Ah, ah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 howard Okay. Toilet’s sounding pretty good now, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 penny Hey, look, it’s Shamy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 amy Shamy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon A juvenile amalgamation of our names. Sheldon and Amy,  Shamy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 amy Oh. I don’t like that. Don’t do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 penny All righty. What’s new?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 amy Well, just recently, I learned that you refer to us as Shamy, and I don’t like that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 penny I got it. But what I was going for was, you know, how’s your life?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 amy Like everybody else’s. Subject to entropy, decay and eventual death. Thank you for asking. Why is she not taking our order?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon I should’ve warned you, one has to navigate a labyrinth of social nonsense before one can be fed here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 amy Really? I assumed an establishment called the Cheesecake Factory would function more efficiently.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon It’s how they lure you in. I believe it’s called bait and switch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 penny Okay, I’m just gonna walk away, ’cause I don’t want to be here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard So, this is nice. First time we’ve all gotten together to eat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 amy You’re right, he’s a festival of humdrum chitchat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard Okay, that’s all I got. Howard, you’re up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 howard Um, tell us about your work, Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 amy I doubt you’d understand. Sheldon tells me you only have a master’s degree.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 howard Raj, do you have any questions for Amy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 amy I’m curious as to why we’re not eating alone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon They can’t function without me. I’m the social glue that holds this little group together. You’re welcome.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard Listen, can I talk to you about your girlfriend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon She’s not my girlfriend. She’s a girl and she’s my friend, but there’s no touching or unsanitary exchange of saliva.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard Got it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon Although, for the record, on one occasion, she licked her thumb to remove raspberry jelly from the corner of my mouth. It’s an action we both regret to this day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard Uh-huh. Anyway, I’m not sure she’s the best fit for our little, how should we call it, rebel alliance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon Oh, I never identified with the rebel alliance. Despite their tendency to build Death Stars, I’ve always been more of an empire man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard Yeah, not my point.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon I know what your point is. You’re intimidated by Amy’s intellect. To that I say, buck up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard Okay, let me just get right to it. Amy is judgmental, sanctimonious and frankly just obnoxious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon So?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard So we already have you for all that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon Are you suggesting I terminate my relationship with Amy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard No, no, of course not. Just have your relationship someplace else.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon May I point out that for eight long months, I suffered in silence as your female companion filled our apartment with her off-key country music caterwauling, the unappetizing spectacle of her grinding a pumice stone against her calloused feet in our living room, and night after night of uninformative TV documentaries about the Jersey Shore.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard Suffered in silence?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon Yes. And I’d thank you to do the same.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard Really? Silence?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 raj Ah. Nothing makes beer taste better than cool clear Rocky Mountain spring water. Where are the Rocky Mountains, anyway?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 howard Philadelphia.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 raj Really? I thought they were out West someplace.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 howard Think about it, Raj. Where did the movie Rocky take place?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 raj Philadelphia. Okay, now I get it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 penny So this is the plan? From now on, we’re just gonna hide out in here to avoid the Shamy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 raj I’m very comfortable here. Penny, dear, why don’t you shoot another silver bullet my way?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 penny Get one yourself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 raj Ooh, somebody’s been taking bitchy pills.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 penny God, he’s an ass when he drinks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 howard Oh, he’s an ass when he doesn’t. You just don’t hear it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard I think we need to start entertaining the possibility that the Shamy could go on for years.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 raj Well, if that’s the case, Penny will have to get satellite TV and maybe once a week run a vacuum through this place.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 penny I thought you were going to talk to Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard I did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 penny Well, what’d he say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard Well, he pointed out that he kinda, sorta had to put up with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 penny Kinda, sorta had to?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard I didn’t agree with him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 penny Well, you defended me, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard I tried, but he made a fairly well-reasoned argument.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 howard You’re not doing that right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 howard Gimme.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 howard Trust me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 penny No!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 howard I do this for my mom all the time. See? With the grain.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 penny Wow, that is better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 howard And someday, when you have varicose veins, I’ll show you how to massage them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 raj Oh, God, never again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard I assume by never again, you mean never again will you drink all of Penny’s beer, then run down to the gas station for a couple of 40s, a box of Slim Jims and the latest issue of Bombay Badonkadonks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 raj I was homesick.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 howard The highlight of the evening was when you showed us your Bollywood break dancing skills. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 raj That’s very offensive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 howard Yeah, we all thought so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard Oh, no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 howard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard John and Yoko.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 howard More like Yoko and Yoko.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon Greetings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon I brought Amy here to show her some of the work I’m doing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 amy It’s very impressive, for theoretical work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon Do I detect a hint of condescension?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 amy I’m sorry, was I being too subtle? I meant compared to the real-world applications of neurobiology, theoretical physics is, what’s the word I’m looking for? Hmm, cute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard_and_howard_together Oooh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon Are you suggesting the work of a neurobiologist like Babinski could ever rise to the significance of a physicist like Clarke-Maxwell or Dirac?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 amy I’m stating it outright. Babinski eats Dirac for breakfast and defecates Clarke-Maxwell.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon You take that back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 amy Absolutely not. My colleagues and I are mapping the neurological substrates that subserve global information processing, which is required for all cognitive reasoning, including scientific inquiry, making my research ipso facto prior in the ordo cognoscendi. That means it’s better than his research, and by extension, of course, yours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard I’m sorry, I’m-I’m still trying to work on the defecating Clark Maxwell, so…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon Excuse me, but a grand unified theory, insofar as it explains everything, will ipso facto explain neurobiology.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 amy Yes, but if I’m successful, I will be able to map and reproduce your thought processes in deriving a grand unified theory, and therefore, subsume your conclusions under my paradigm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon That’s the rankest psychologism, and was conclusively revealed as hogwash by Gottlob Frege in the 1890s!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 amy We appear to have reached an impasse.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon I agree. I move our relationship terminate immediately.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 amy Seconded.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon There being no objections…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 all No, uh-uh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon The motion carries. Good day, Amy Farrah Fowler.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 amy Good day, Sheldon Cooper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 howard Women, huh? Can’t live with them, can’t successfully refute their hypotheses.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon Amen to that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 penny Hey, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 penny I hear you broke up with Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon A breakup would imply she was my girlfriend. She was a girl who was my friend who is now a girl who is not my friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 penny Wow. That’s like the worst country song ever. So, how are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon Regarding what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 penny Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon I don’t follow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 penny Well, breakups, or whatever the hell this is, can be tough.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon Penny, I assure you, I’m fine. My relationship with Amy was purely intellectual. There were no emotional bonds, the severing of which would cause me any discomfort. The relationship simply outlived its utility, and I’m continuing on with my life as before.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 penny Okay. Good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m off to buy a pussycat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard I gotta tell you guys, I’m a little worried about Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 howard We’re all a little worried about Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard No, I mean since the Shamy hit a reef.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 howard Oh, I thought you were just making a generalization, you know, I’m worried about Sheldon someday setting off a low-yield nuclear device because the cafeteria ran out of lime Jell-O.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 raj What does hit a reef mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard Uh, went splitsville.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 raj Pardon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard Turned to boom-boom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 raj Ah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard I think Sheldon really misses Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 howard You should lend him your copy of Bombay Badonkadonks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard He got a cat to keep him company.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 raj You’re kidding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard He takes it everywhere, to bed, to the bathroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 raj He takes the kitty to the potty?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 howard I thought we discussed the P-word.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 raj Don’t try to change me, dude. I am what I am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon Oh, gentlemen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 howard Hey. Aren’t you going to introduce us to your little friend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon My apologies. Raj, Howard, I’d like you to meet Dr. Robert Oppenheimer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 howard Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 raj Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon Now, if you’ll excuse me, the father of the atomic bomb wants a saucer of milk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 howard Okay, I get it. We’re worried about Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard Hey. Oh, no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon Robert Oppenheimer was lonely.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard So you decided to get the whole Manhattan Project?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon Yes. This is Enrico Fermi, Richard Feynman, Edward Teller, Otto Frisch, and Zazzles.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard Zazzles?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon I was going to name him Herman von Helmholtz, but he’s so zazzy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard Okay, we need to talk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon About what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard Cats, Sheldon. You’re clearly upset about Amy being gone, and you’re trying to replace her with a bunch of cats.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon Clowder.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon A group of cats is a clowder. Or a glaring.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard Okay, yeah, fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon It’s the kind of thing you ought to know now that we have one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard Terrific. My-my point is you need to face up to what you’re feeling with this breakup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon It wasn’t a breakup. A breakup would imply that Amy was my girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard Okay, I got it, I got it, she’s not your girlfriend. Now listen to me. I know about loneliness. I know about trying to replace someone with other stuff. When I broke up with Penny, I got back into my cello, I built a bunch of model rockets, I got those weightlifting gloves and that five-pound dumbbell.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon You didn’t break up, she dumped you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard She didn’t dump me. It was mutual!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon I was there. She dumped you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard Okay, fine. Live with cats. Be like my Aunt Nancy. She had dozens of them. And do you know what happened after she died? They ate her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon You don’t have to sell me on cats, Leonard. I’m already a fan. All right, fellas, who’s in the mood for Fancy Feast? Well, that’s not fancy at all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard Hi, Mrs. Cooper. Thanks for coming.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 mrs_cooper Where is he?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard He’s in his bedroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 mrs_cooper Now, when you said on the phone he broke up with a girl, you meant an actual girl, not something you kids whipped up in a lab?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard No, she’s real.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 mrs_cooper Did they sin?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard No, no, it’s not like that. It’s, uh, I don’t know what it’s like. But there is something I should prepare you for.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 mrs_cooper Oh, relax, Leonard, I have raised that boy. I’ve seen him at his best, I’ve seen him at his worst. There’s nothing he can do that’ll surprise me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard Hold on to that thought. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon Come in. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard Surprise.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon Mom, what an unexpected pleasure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 mrs_cooper My, my, that’s a powerful smell.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon I’d like you to meet Oppenheimer, Frisch, Panofsky, Feynman, Weisskopf…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 mrs_cooper Yeah, I get it. You got a lot of cats and you gave ’em cute Jewish names.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon What are you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 mrs_cooper Leonard called, and he said that you were pining for a young lady.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon Oh, that’s preposterous. I’m not pining over anyone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 mrs_cooper Oh, lambchop, we can quibble what to call it, but I think we can both agree it’s creepy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon I do not agree. Cats make wonderful companions. They don’t argue or question my intellectual authority, and this little guy here, I think you’ll find to be quite zazzy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 mrs_cooper You should have called sooner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 mrs_cooper Shelly! Dinner’s ready!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon Coming!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 mrs_cooper No cats!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon Aw. What is she doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 mrs_cooper I called her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 amy Your mother thinks you might be losing your mind over me. As a neurobiologist, I was curious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon Well, rest assured, I am in full possession of my faculties.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard 25 cats!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 mrs_cooper Oh, God bless you, dear. Sheldon, sit down. Let’s talk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon All right, but you’re not fooling me. Whenever you say we have to talk, it means you want me to listen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 mrs_cooper Then stop talking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon Yes, ma’am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 mrs_cooper Now, the reason I called Amy over was to find out what type of person she is. And after chatting a bit, I have to say that while she is a perfectly unique young woman, you two are definitely not suited for each other.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon That’s a peculiar conclusion. By any standard, Amy is more similar to me than anyone I’ve ever met.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 mrs_cooper Oh, I’m sorry, Shelly, I can’t see it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon Well, whether you see it or not is irrelevant. I can’t see subatomic particles, but nevertheless, they’re there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 amy Excellent point.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon A physics point.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 amy Touche.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 mrs_cooper Well, putting aside the pig Latin, it’s a good thing that you two decided to end the relationship so I didn’t have to end it for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon Amy, after consideration, I believe we may have acted rashly. I propose we resume our relationship and attempt to resolve our differences.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 amy I’ll agree to that only if you’ll stipulate that 80% of our difficulties were caused by you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon I’ll go as high as 40.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 amy Sixty-five.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon Done. You understand that moving forward, we deal with the fact that my mother does not approve of you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 amy I do. I find being cast in the role of bad girl oddly titillating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon Would you like to see my cats?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 amy I would. I love cats. They’re the epitome of indifference.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 sheldon Ah, then you may find Zazzles a little cloying.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard I saw what you did there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 mrs_cooper He thinks he’s such a smarty pants. He’s no different from any man. You tell ’em not to do something, that’s all they want to do. If I hadn’t told my brother Stumpy not to clear out the wood chipper by hand, we’d still be calling him Edward. Now, don’t you move. I’ll bring over all the food.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 leonard No, no, no, I can do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode03 mrs_cooper Well, isn’t that sweet?
