TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 raj I’m telling you, if xenon emits ultraviolet light, then those dark matter discoveries must be wrong.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 sheldon Yes, well, if we lived in a world where slow-moving xenon produced light, then you’d be correct. Also, pigs would fly, my derriere would produce cotton candy, and The Phantom Menace would be a timeless classic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 raj Oh, you’re so arrogant. If you were a superhero, your name would be Captain Arrogant. And you know what your superpower would be? Arrogance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 sheldon You’re wrong again. If my superpower were arrogance, my name would be Dr. Arroganto.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard I love watching Raj and Sheldon try to work together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 leonard Yeah, it’s like if Alien and Predator decided to go partners in a Jamba Juice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 raj Has it occurred to you you’re missing the big picture? If you look at neutron scattering data…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 sheldon Oh, Penny? Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 penny What’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 sheldon Nothing. I just wanted to make Raj stop talking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard No, no, no. He won. Suck it up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 penny Well, I’d ask you guys if you want dessert, but I know Sheldon doesn’t eat dessert on Tuesdays. And even if Raj wanted something, he couldn’t tell me. Howard won’t order anything, but he will come up with some sort of skeevy comment involving the words pie or cheesecake. And Leonard’s lactose intolerant, so he can’t eat anything here without his intestines blowing up like a balloon animal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 leonard Hang on a second. I could have the fruit platter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 penny You want the fruit platter?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 leonard Does it have melon on it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 penny Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 leonard No, I can’t eat melon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 penny Oh, Howard, heads up. Your ex-girlfriend just came in for her shift.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 leonard When was the last time you saw her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard Oh, not since we broke up. Wow. How am I going to play this? Sophisticated and relaxed? Friendly, noncommittal? Cold and distant? .
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 bernadette Hi, guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 leonard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 sheldon Hello. I see you decided to go with pathetic and frightened.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 raj It’s one of his best moves.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard So, my dear, we meet again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 katee_sackhoff Hello, Howard. I’ve missed you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard I’ve missed you, Katee Sackhoff.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 katee_sackhoff One question.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard Anything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 katee_sackhoff Why am I wearing my Battlestar Galactica flight suit in bed?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard Why are you in bed with me? If we start to question this, it all falls apart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 katee_sackhoff Sorry. Oh, ravish me, Howard. My loins ache for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard Okay, if you insist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 mrs_wolowitz Howard, have you seen my girdle?!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard No, Ma!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 mrs_wolowitz I can’t find it, and I’m late for my Weight Watchers meeting!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard Maybe it committed suicide! Leave me alone! Now, where were we?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 bernadette I believe you were about to rip off my uniform with your teeth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard Bernadette? What are you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 katee_sackhoff Well, if I had to guess, I’d say I’m here because you saw me earlier this evening, and you’re still hung up on me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard No, I’m not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 bernadette Clearly you are. Otherwise, based on past experience, we’d be done by now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard Okay, I’m a little confused here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 george_takei Oh, my. Can I help?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard Not that kind of confused.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 bernadette What’s George Takei doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 katee_sackhoff Howard, do you have latent homosexual tendencies?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard No, of course not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 george_takei So you say. Yet, here I am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 katee_sackhoff George, let me ask you something. How did you deal with being typecast as a science fiction icon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 george_takei It’s difficult. You try and stretch as an actor, do Strindberg, O’Neill, but all they want is, Course laid in, Captain.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 katee_sackhoff Tell me about it. It’s frackin’ frustrating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard Wait. Katee, why are you leaving?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 bernadette She’s leaving because you really want to be with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 mrs_wolowitz Howard, I found my girdle! It was in the dryer!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard Great, Ma!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 mrs_wolowitz I think it shrunk! I’m spilling out like the Pillsbury Doughboy here!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard And with that mental picture, I think we’re done for the evening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 leonard You know, you never told me what happened between you and Bernadette.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard I did a stupid thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 leonard Yeah, I guessed that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard It was the kind of thing that makes it kind of hard to face her now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 leonard That covers anything from farting in bed to killing a homeless guy. Oh, my God. You ran over a hobo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard No. Stop asking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 leonard All right, fine. So you want to get back together with her, but you’re too ashamed to face her because of whatever it is you did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard In a nutshell.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 leonard Okay. Well, how about this? Kidnap Bernadette from the opera wearing a creepy mask so she doesn’t know it’s you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard Now, you see, I don’t know if you’re kidding or not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 raj You’re being unreasonable. Why can’t I have a desk?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 sheldon Our collaboration is a work of the mind. We don’t need desks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 raj You have a desk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 sheldon Correct.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 raj But I can’t have one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 sheldon You’re two for two.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 leonard Why can’t he have a desk, Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 sheldon Oh, Lord, will this day never end? As I’ve explained repeatedly to Dr. Koothrappali, whose ability to comprehend the American idiom fails him when it’s convenient, there’s absolutely no money in my budget for additional office furniture.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 raj Oh, but there’s money for a drawer full of Red Vines, a marshmallow shooting rifle, and a super executive ant farm with glow-in-the-dark sand?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 sheldon Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard Okay, what if he buys his own desk?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 raj Yeah, what if I buy my own desk?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 sheldon That’s ridiculous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 sheldon Because…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 raj Yes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 sheldon It’s my office.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 leonard Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 sheldon All right, all right. He can buy his own desk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 raj And I can put it in your office?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 sheldon Well, you really want to dot the I’s and cross the T’s, don’t you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 leonard Why would you want a glow-in-the-dark ant farm?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 sheldon They do some of their best work at night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 penny Ah, it’s okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 sheldon Penny? Penny? Penny? Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard Would you have opened the door if you knew it was me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 penny Not since I found out the teddy bear you gave me had a webcam in it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard I just have a question. Does Bernadette ever talk about me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 penny Oh, absolutely.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard She does?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 penny Yeah, sure. Just yesterday, she asked, why is Howard hiding under the table?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard She saw that, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 penny Oh, no, not at first. Right after I pointed it out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard Let me ask you something else. Is she seeing anybody?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 penny Uh, not that I know of. Hey, while we’re on the subject, why did you guys break up anyway?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard Oh, I’d rather not say.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 penny Howard, if you want my help, I’ve got to know what happened.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard But it’s embarrassing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 penny Yeah, that’s what I’m counting on. Spill.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard Okay. Well, you know World of Warcraft?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 penny Um, the online game? Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard Well, did you know that the characters in the game can have sex with each other?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 penny Oh, God. I think I see where this is going.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard Her name was Glissinda the Troll. Bernadette walked in on me while we were doing the cyber-nasty under the Bridge of Souls.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 penny Oh, you’re right. That is so embarrassing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard Would you talk to her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 penny Bernadette or the troll?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard Bernadette. She was so mad at me, she wouldn’t even listen to my side of the story.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 penny Well, what was your side?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard Well, for all we know, Glissinda the Troll wasn’t even a real woman. I mean, she could’ve been a 50-year-old truck driver in New Jersey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 penny Really? And that didn’t make her feel better?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard Will you talk to her, see if there’s any chance at all we could get back together?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 penny Oh, gee, Howard, I really don’t want to get in the middle of this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard No. Why would you? I’m just another lonely nerd, living with his mother, trying to find any scrap of happiness he can. You know, maybe to make up for the fact that his dad left him when he was 11.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 penny Okay, I will think about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard You know, I’ve always blamed myself for him leaving. I always thought it was because I wasn’t the son he wanted.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 penny Yeah, I said I’d think about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard I wasn’t athletic, yeah, I was kind of sickly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 penny Okay, fine. Look, look, I’m calling her now! See?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 leonard So anyway, Howard asked Penny to talk to Bernadette, and she did, and Bernadette agreed to meet him for a cup of coffee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 sheldon One question.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 leonard Yeah?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 sheldon Why on earth are you telling me all this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 leonard I don’t know. Sometimes your movements are so lifelike, I forget you’re not a real boy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 raj You said I could buy a desk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 sheldon This isn’t a desk. This is a Brobdingnagian monstrosity.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 raj Is that the American idiom for giant, big-ass desk?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 sheldon It’s actually British.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 raj Can you say it again for me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 sheldon Brobdingnagian.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 raj One more time?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 sheldon Brobdingnagian.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 raj Now three times fast?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 sheldon Brobdingnagian, Brobdingna… How did you even get it in here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 raj That’s for me, Ramon, Julio, Jesus and Rodrigo to know and you to find out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 sheldon All right, you’ve made your point. A fine prank, very amusing. Now get it out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 raj No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 sheldon Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 raj No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 sheldon Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 raj No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 sheldon Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 raj I have three brothers and two sisters, Sheldon, I can do this all day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 sheldon All right, if you’re not going to remove it, I’ll remove it for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 raj Knock yourself out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 sheldon Help me move my desk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 raj No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 sheldon Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 raj No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 sheldon Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 raj No. It’s too Brobdingnagian.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 sheldon Why do you even want this here? Its size is completely disproportionate to its purpose.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 raj Well, seeing as its purpose was to piss you off, I’d say it’s spot-on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 sheldon All right, I see what’s going on. This is the opening salvo in what will be an escalating series of juvenile tit-for-tat exchanges. Well titted.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 raj Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 sheldon Stand by for my upcoming tat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 raj Hey, Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 sheldon Yes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 raj No. See what I did there? I turned it around.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 bernadette Sorry, I had to clock out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard Oh, no, that’s okay. How have you been?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 bernadette Okay. You know, busy, school, work. You?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard Same. I took a scuba-diving course over the summer, but it turns out I’m terrified of the ocean.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 bernadette Too bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard You wouldn’t know anybody who wants to buy a wet suit, boy’s large? Yeah, forget it. Not important. So, are you seeing anyone?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 bernadette Well, to be honest, I…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 penny Hey, how are we doing over here? Can I get you something to drink?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard Not for me, thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 bernadette I’m okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 penny Are you gonna want to order food?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard Maybe later.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 penny Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard So, are you seeing anybody?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 bernadette No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 penny That’s what I told him when he asked me. I hope that’s not out of line.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 bernadette No, it’s fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard Penny, can we have a little privacy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 penny Oh. I’m sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 bernadette What about you, have you been seeing anybody?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard Well, you know how it is with guys. I mean, we have needs and…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 bernadette So you’ve been seeing other girls?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard Well, not real girls.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 bernadette Does that mean slutty trolls?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 penny You know, you look thirsty. I brought you some iced tea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 bernadette Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 penny It’s passion fruit, new on the menu.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 bernadette I know. I work here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 penny Oh, sorry. Yeah, you’re right. Doy. So, Howard, trolls, yay or nay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard Isn’t there somewhere else you can be?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 penny Not where I can hear you guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard Okay, fine. I’ll admit, there are dark, sordid little corners of the Internet where the name Wolowizard is whispered in hushed tones. But the only reason I go there, the only reason I’ve ever gone there is because I don’t have a real woman in my life. You happy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 penny Yeah, that’ll hold me for a while.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 bernadette Howard, you did have a real woman. I was right there in the next room while you were clicking that troll’s brains out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard Yeah, but we weren’t, I-I mean, you and I never…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 bernadette Had sex?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 bernadette Well, whose fault was that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 penny Complimentary nachos! You enjoy. Never had sex? Wow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard What do you mean, whose fault was that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 bernadette Well, we could’ve been having sex, but you never made the move.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard I didn’t think you wanted me to make the move.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 bernadette Howard, a girl doesn’t go out with a man like you, with your looks, your fancy patter and your tight hoochie pants if she’s not expecting him to eventually make the move.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 bernadette Really.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard Son of a bitch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 penny Hey, this is a little awkward, but my manager says I can’t actually give nachos away. So, just take that when you’re ready.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard Yeah, we had a really great talk, and we’re gonna start seeing each other again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 leonard Oh, congratulations. Have you broken it to the troll yet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard Did Penny tell you about that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 leonard No. Steve Patterson told me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard The greasy old fat guy in Facilities Management?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 leonard Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard How’d he know about it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 leonard He’s Glissinda the troll.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 raj Sorry, dude, the thermostat’s on my side of the room, so it stays Mumbai hot in here until you turn off that stupid Indian music!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 sheldon I’ll turn off the music when you get rid of that salmonella-ridden parakeet!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 raj Oh, too bad! Sheldon’s pathologically afraid of birds! Hey, look, Sheldon! Birdie, birdie, birdie!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 sheldon That’s it! Prepare for marshmallow death!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 raj Eat flaming Nerf! 
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 leonard So anyway, that’s great news about you and Bernadette.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard Yeah. I think I’m gonna take her to miniature golf.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 leonard Ah. Well, I guess for you guys that’s like regular golf.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard Short jokes? Really? You’re, like, a quarter of an inch taller than me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 leonard Yeah, and don’t you forget it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard I had a good time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 bernadette Me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 katee_sackhoff Kiss her good night. All right, now a little tongue.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 george_takei Hold on there. We’ve only just rekindled the romance. Let’s not sully the moment with the exchange of saliva.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 katee_sackhoff Don’t listen to him. She wants it. Tongue. Luh-luh-luh-luh-luh. See? Now make the move.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 george_takei Mm-mmm. Too soon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 katee_sackhoff Trust me, she’s ready. Make the move.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 george_takei No, no, no. A lady wants to be wooed, courted slowly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 katee_sackhoff How would you know?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 george_takei I read.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 katee_sackhoff Listen to me, Howard, it’s time. Make the move, now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 bernadette Mm! What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard You said, well, the move, remember?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 bernadette Oh, not now. We’re starting a new relationship. I need to get to know you again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode04 howard No, you don’t. It’s me. The lusty charmer with the fancy patter and the hoochie pants.
