TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter All I’m saying is, if they took all the money they spent trying to make a decent Hulk movie, they could probably just make an actual Hulk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper That is apt and amusing. I think I shall share that with Amy Farrah Fowler. She’ll appreciate the witticism.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper It’ll also help improve her initial impression of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter So what’s going on with you two?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Well, the status is as it always was. She’s a girl. She’s a friend. She is not my, please forgive me for doing this, girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Right, right. So you’re still just texting and emailing? You don’t feel any need to hang out with her, you know, be in the same room?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Leonard, you are my best friend. I’ve known you for seven years, and I can barely tolerate sitting on the couch with you. Imagine my attitude regarding prolonged physical proximity to Amy Farrah Fowler.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Got it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper I sense judgment on your part.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter No, no. Maybe a little.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper May I suggest that your criticism is based on jealousy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Jealousy? What do I have to be jealous of?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper I have a functioning and satisfying relationship with a female. You have none.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Oh, right. That.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Jealousy is an ugly green-eyed monster, not unlike the Hulk, who, by the way, also has a girlfriend. In this iteration, Jennifer Connelly, whom you may recall as the girlfriend of Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind, a feel-good romp if there ever was one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter I’m not jealous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Hu-u-urgh! Leonard not jealous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper You know, it just occurred to me, if there are an infinite number of parallel universes, in one of them, there’s probably a Sheldon who doesn’t believe parallel universes exist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Probably. What’s your point?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper No point. It’s just one of the things that makes one of the mes chuckle. What makes you chuckle, Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Hmm, recently? Not much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Is it because of the conflict that arises from your desperate need to pair-bond with a woman, and the apparent collective decision of all womankind to deny you that opportunity?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Um, shut up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper You know, when my grandfather died, and Meemaw was alone, my mom arranged for her to visit a centre three times a week where she could socialize with other lonely people. It’s very nice. They discuss current events, play bridge, get a hot meal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter That sounds lovely.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper It is if you like bridge. Do you like bridge, Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, I’m just not dating someone right now. I don’t need to go to a senior centre.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Meemaw resisted at first, but now she loves it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Fine. If I don’t meet someone soon, you can put me in a home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper It’s not a home. It’s a senior centre.We never put Meemaw in a home!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Hey, guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 raj_koothrappali Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper All right, I’ll bow to social pressure. Hey!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Excuse me. That’s my girlfriend, Bernadette. I assigned her her own ringtone, Bernadette by The Four Tops. Hello, Bernadette.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 raj_koothrappali When I call him, his phone plays Brown Eyed Girl. Which, now that I think about it, is not so good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter You realize he’s just rubbing our noses in the fact that he has a girlfriend, and we don’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 raj_koothrappali You mean, you don’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter You have a girlfriend? How could you have a girlfriend? You can’t even speak to women.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 raj_koothrappali Two words, deaf chick. It doesn’t matter if I can’t talk, because she can’t hear me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 raj_koothrappali That’s what she said.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Great. You have a girlfriend, Howard’s got a girlfriend, Sheldon’s got a girl…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper No, no, no, no!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter …who’s a friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter What about you, Stuart? You have a girlfriend yet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 stuart_bloom Oh, yeah. Yeah. I met her at Comic-Con, the one place in the world where saying I own a comic bookstore is an actual pickup line.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Oh. Well, good for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 stuart_bloom Not really. She’s horrible. When she wants to have sex, she puts on her plus-size Wonder Woman costume and shouts who wants to take a ride in my invisible plane?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Why don’t you just break up with her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 stuart_bloom No, no, I can’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 stuart_bloom ‘Cause then I’d be alone, like you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 raj_koothrappali Dude, why don’t you just invoke your girlfriend pact with Wolowitz?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Because I don’t need his girlfriend to set me up with one of her girlfriends. I’m perfectly capable of finding a girl on my own.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 raj_koothrappali Oh, Leonard, you remind me of the funny old story about a man who walks into a women’s correctional institution with a stack of paperwork that will allow the female convicts to go free.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter You’re saying I couldn’t get laid in a women’s prison with a handful of pardons.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 raj_koothrappali Are you going to let me tell the story or not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Leonard? Are you sleeping?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Are you ill?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Are you still depressed because you’re alone, and no one loves you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter I don’t know. Maybe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper I want you to know that I’m genuinely concerned about your well-being.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper You’re welcome. But it’s still no reason to have your feet in my spot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler May I offer an observation?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter What the hell? How long has she been here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Since we got home from the comic bookstore.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter That was two hours ago.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper As per your suggestion, we’re hanging out. Quite frankly, I don’t see what all the hoopla’s about. Go on, Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler From a neurobiological standpoint, Leonard, you may be alone because your psychological state is causing an actual pheromone-based stink of desperation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Did you know that, Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper I did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler I understand that some people find mates in social gathering places such as bars or taverns. Have you tried a bar or tavern?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter No, I’m not gonna try to pick up a woman in a bar.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Wise decision. You see, Amy, success at a bar is based on classic male attributes such as height, strength, attractiveness, the ability to hold one’s liquor and throw darts, separately or together. Leonard has none of these attributes, right, Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler That’s not true of all bars. Juice bars, for example.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Oh! Good point, Amy. Yeah, building on your premise, Leonard could frequent sushi bars, salad bars, oyster bars, the Apple Genius Bar, what are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Keep going. I’m listening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler That was rude.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper He does it all the time. He’s a cornucopia of social awkwardness.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler Cornucopia. What a mellifluous word.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Let’s make that our word of the day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler Agreed. And we’ll use mellifluous tomorrow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Well, I have to void my bladder. It was nice spending this time with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler Wait. I have a request.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Yes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler I’d like you to meet my mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper I see. Can I get back to you on that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler Certainly. Good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Good night. Leonard, Leonard, Leonard,
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Amy Farrah Fowler has asked me to meet her mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Yeah. So?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper What does that mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Well, you know how you’re always saying that Amy is a girl who’s your friend, and not your girlfriend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Uh-huh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter You can’t say that anymore.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Wait. What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Look, she obviously wants to take your relationship to the next level.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper I don’t want the next level. I like this level. Fix it for me!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Me? Well, how am I supposed to fix it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Simple! You want a girlfriend, Amy wants to be someone’s girlfriend. Take her off my hands. I give you my blessing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter That is insane.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper You’re right. It would never work. Amy finds you tedious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Okay, good luck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Wait! What am I supposed to do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Well, have you considered telling her how you feel?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Leonard, I’m a physicist, not a hippie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter All right, well, let me see if I can explain your situation using physics. What would you be if you were attached to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Screwed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter There you go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Amy’s right. He is tedious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 debbie_wolowitz Howard, get the door!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Why can’t you get it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 debbie_wolowitz You know I’m doing a bowel cleanse for my colonoscopy! I’m like an upside-down volcano here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Oh, hey. I hope you didn’t hear that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter The volcano thing? No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 howard_wolowitz What’s with the T-shirt? You working at the Apple store now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter No, it’s just something I threw on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 howard_wolowitz I know all your shirts. That’s not one of them. You were pretending to work at the Genius Bar to pick up women, weren’t you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Yeah. Turns out, they guard the iPods, but they don’t guard the shirts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 howard_wolowitz So, how’d it go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter It was going well. I was showing this super hot girl how to boot up in Safe Mode. The manager got suspicious, and, well, long story short, they really do have a little jail in the mall.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Just FYI, don’t try to go back with a fake moustache. I mean, they may not really be geniuses, but they see right through that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter I want to invoke the girlfriend pact, Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 howard_wolowitz You that desperate?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter No, I just, I want what you have. You know, I want a woman in my life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 debbie_wolowitz Holy Moses, how much liquid can be in one tukus?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter To be clear, I meant like Bernadette, not your mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Yeah, I know what you mean.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Well, I’m off to meet Bernadette’s friend. How do I look?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper As if one of the plants from Invasion of the Body Snatchers duplicated you in every way, only with an absurd amount of hair gel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter What are you working on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper I’m removing my digital footprint from the Internet so Amy Farrah Fowler can’t find me and compel me to meet her mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Ah, you’re going off the grid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Exactly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter The old Unabomber approach. Kudos.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Thank you. I’ve also sent Amy a relationship termination notice and changed my cell phone number and e-mail address.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter What if she just comes over?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper She’ll get lost. We no longer live at 2311 Los Robles. We now live at 311 Los Robles.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter You changed the address on the building? What about mail?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Oh, no worries, I explained my predicament to our letter carrier. He was sympathetic. His exact words were, Got your back, Jack. Bitches be crazy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Who is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler Amy Farrah Fowler.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Darn! She found me!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter She’s been here before.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper The only flaw in an otherwise perfect plan. Now, get my back, Jack.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter What do you want to do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Tell her I’m not here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Okay, where are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper I don’t know. You’ll have to devise a scenario that plausibly explains my absence, keeping in mind that the key to a good lie lies in the details.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Hi, Amy. Sheldon’s not here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Way to go on the details.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Thanks again for doing this, Bernadette.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, I take pacts very seriously. One time at my lab, a petri dish of genetically modified super-virus went missing. That day we made a pinky swear never to admit we crossed Ebola with the common cold.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Why the hell would you cross Ebola with the common cold?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski We never did. That would be a terrible, terrible thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 Hi. Sorry I’m late, I was at the gym. Spin class. Worked up quite a sweat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski Joy, this is Leonard. Leonard, this is Joy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 joy Hi. You don’t look like a genius. Go ahead, say something smart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Uh…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 joy Aah! Time’s up. Just kidding. First thing you need to know about me, I’m hilarious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Yeah. So, Bernadette tells me she knows you from self-defence classes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 joy Yeah. Israeli Krav Maga. Lots of fun. Basically, a hundred different ways to rip a guy’s nuts off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Wow. Wouldn’t think there’d be that many.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 joy Number 42!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Whoa!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski Isn’t she a pip?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Proxima Centauri’s the nearest star. The celestial bodies that follow are Alpha Centauri A, Toli, Barnard’s Star, Wolf 359, Lalande 21185, Sirius A, Sirius B, BL-Ceti, UV-Ceti, Ross 154, Ross 248, Epsilon Eridani, Lac-9352, Ross 128, Procyon A, oh, darn, that’s wrong! EZ Aquarii A, EZ Aquarii B, EZ Aquarii C, Procyon A. Those are the stars that are nearest to me. Tra-la-la and fiddle-dee-dee. Oh, dear. They really do be crazy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 joy This lobster’s good on the way down and the way up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Should be, it’s thirty dollars a pound.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 joy Hey, this is a date, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Yep, it is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 joy 73!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Whoa!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 joy Excuse me, I have to go to the little girls’ room and take a wicked whiz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski I’ll go with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 joy Fair warning, I had the asparagus. My pee is gonna stink up the place.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 howard_wolowitz I think she likes you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper EZ Aquarii B, EZ Aquarii C, excuse me, madam.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Rats!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler I believe a misunderstanding may have occurred when I asked you to meet my mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper No misunderstanding. I’ve learned what that request actually means, and I don’t want to be joined to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler In what way are you screwed? All I want to do is present you as my boyfriend to my mother so she’ll be satisfied that I’m in a relationship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper So we’d be perpetrating a ruse?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler Precisely.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper And you haven’t fallen hopelessly in love with me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler Don’t be absurd. I find the notion of romantic love to be an unnecessary cultural construct that adds no value to human relationships.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Amy Farrah Fowler, that’s the most pragmatic thing anyone has ever said to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler I trust this clarification allows us to return to boy-slash-friend-slash-girl-slash-friend status.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Of course. Would you like to join me for Chinese food?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, please, you’re suffocating me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper My apologies. Good night, Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler Good night, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Come on, just give her a chance. Maybe she’ll grow on you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Or maybe she’ll finally succeed in ripping my nuts off. There are still 93 ways she hasn’t tried yet. Look, Howard, I appreciate the effort, but this is, like, the worst date of my life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Seriously? I was once robbed by a pre-op transsexual I met on J-Date, and that didn’t even crack my top ten.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter I guess the difference is, I have some self-respect.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Not that I’ve ever seen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter It’s relatively new. I just know that I’m not gonna spend time with someone I don’t like simply to have a girlfriend. I’m okay on my own.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 joy Good news, I made lots of room for dessert.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Look, uh, Joy, it was nice to meet you, but…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 joy Yeah, you, too. Hey, you got anything for next weekend? I need a date for my cousin’s wedding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter You’re asking me out?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 joy Yeah. And it’s an open bar, so I’ll probably be giving it away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter I look forward to it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 mrs_fowler It’s nice to meet you, too, Sheldon. I honestly didn’t believe Amy when she told me she had a boyfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper I assure you I am quite real and I’m having regular intercourse with your daughter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 mrs_fowler What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Oh, yes. We’re like wild animals in heat. It’s a wonder neither of us has been hurt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 mrs_fowler Amy, what is he saying?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler You wanted me to have a boyfriend, Mother. Well, here he is. Have to sign off now. My hunger for Sheldon is stirring in my loins.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Oh, yes, it’s time for me to make love to your daughter’s vagina.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 mrs_fowler Oh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler Thank you, Sheldon, that went very well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Agreed. Amy, I find myself wondering if we should actually engage in coitus at least one time in our relationship. Bazinga. Bedtime. Please show yourself out.
