TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 howard Gagh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Problem?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 howard This is the worst cobbler I’ve ever eaten. I mean it tastes like it was made of actual ground-up shoemaker.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon Amusing. A play on the two meanings of cobbler.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 raj Hey guys, guess who I found at LAX. My baby sister Priya.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon Excuse me. I object. You propose a guessing game, yet you don’t give me enough time to guess. For the record, I was going to say your sister Priya.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 priya Oh, Sheldon. You haven’t changed a bit, have you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon Why would I change?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard The hope has been that you’d eventually bend to public opinion. So, Priya, what brings you back to LA?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 priya I have a one day layover on my way to Toronto. Corporate merger.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 raj Can you believe it? Little Priya’s one of the lead attorneys for the biggest car company in India.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon Given that when we met her she was finishing law school and planning an internship at a large Indian car company, it’s actually extremely plausible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard And your poll numbers just keep dropping.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 priya I want to catch up with all of you, but first I really must visit the loo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard I’m going too, I’ll show you where it is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 raj Alright, this goes without saying, but I’m just going to say it anyway. Hands off my sister.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon Why would I touch her, she’s covered with airplane germs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 raj I’m so not talking to you. I’m talking to him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 howard Hey, I’ve got a girlfriend now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 raj Oh please. My sister’s much hotter than your girlfriend and you know it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 howard Let’s just agree they’re both hot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 raj Dude, that’s my sister you’re talking about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 howard Okay, forget who’s hotter. The first time Priya came to LA, Leonard and I made a pact out of respect to our friendship, and to you, that neither of us would hit on her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 raj Did you pinky swear?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 howard Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 raj Okay then.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon Cobbler. I’m still laughing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 priya It’s really nice to see you again Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Yeah. It’s good to see you too. Here you go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 priya Thanks. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa. Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 howard So, you got any special plans with your sister?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 raj Oh, not really, just hang out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon I always tell people, if you have only one day in Los Angeles, make it a train day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 raj Train day?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon The fun starts with brunch at Carney’s in Studio City, a hot dog stand in a converted railroad dining car. Next stop, Travel Town, an outdoor museum featuring 43 railroad engines, cars and other rolling stock from the 1880s to the 1930s. Finally, we’re off to the glitz and glamour of Hollywood for dinner at, that’s right, the Hollywood Carney’s, a hot dog stand in a different converted railroad dining car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 raj I don’t think we’re going to do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon Well then apparently, you hate fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Hmm, Priya’s not back yet? Well, I guess that’s not unusual, women, men, the whole sitting, standing deal, so, what are we talking about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 raj Uh, my plans with Priya.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon He rejected train day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Did you make it clear that it’s two different train cars turned into hot dog stands?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon Abundantly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard I guess he just hates fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon That’s what I said.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 priya Okay, so, what’s new with you guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 howard I have a girlfriend now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 priya Hey, good for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 howard Yeah, I just wanna put it out there in case I inadvertently squirt any pheromones in your direction. Happy? . 
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard So, uh, Priya, what are your plans while you’re here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 priya I don’t know, I just have the one day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon Do you like trains?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 priya Not particularly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon You might as well just wait at the airport for your flight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon You are in a forest. There is quicksand to the west, a path leads to the east. Go east. An iron gate blocks your way. Open gate. It’s locked. Hmm, well, so much for that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard It’s getting pretty late, how come you’re still up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon I’ve found an emulator online that lets you play classic text based computer games from the 1980s.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard That’s pretty cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon Oh yes. It runs on the world’s most powerful graphics chip, imagination.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard You’ve really got to get out more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon Go north. You can’t go that way. Go west. A troll blocks your passage. Okay, fasten your seatbelts, kill troll. With what? With sword. You don’t have the sword. Good golly, it’s as if it’s actually happening to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 priya Raj finally went to bed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Yeah, well, Sheldon’s still up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 priya You said he goes to bed at nine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Yeah, he does but he got caught up in a computer game and…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon Hit troll with axe. Hit troll with axe. Hit troll with axe. Oh my, this is one tough troll.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 priya Can’t you get rid of him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard If the past is any indication, no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon Leonard, I’m trapped in quicksand, the axe is dragging me down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Drop axe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon Drop axe. Brilliant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Give me a minute. Sheldon,
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon Hold on. I have to figure out how to get the bucket, so I can carry the mud past the dragon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Sheldon, you need to work in the morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Well then, bed mister.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon Five more minutes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Really? You’re going to risk getting sleepy in the middle of your thermodynamic fluctuations seminar? You know what happens when you yawn in public.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon Everyone will see my oddly shaped uvula.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard You don’t want that, do you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon No. But it’s a shame our society mocks the differently uvulated. Who was at the door?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Oh, uh, building manager. They have to fix a pipe so the water will be off tomorrow from noon to two.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon That’s unacceptable. We’re supposed to be given written notice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard No, no, it doesn’t matter, we’ll be at work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon Well, what if I spill tomato soup on my shirt and have to come home to change, only to find there’s no water for an enzyme soak.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Bifurcated uvula, Sheldon!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon I’ll have the chicken noodle. Goodnight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard We’re going to have to be very quiet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon I know how to get the bucket! I can turn the axe around and use the handle to reach it. Let’s see. Go north. You are in a forest. Go north. You are in a forest. Go north. You are in a forest. Oh dear, I believe I’m lost. Well, I’ll just have to get a fresh start tomorrow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard No, no, no, no, no. You just need, you just need, you just need to map it out. Come on, I’ll help you. So, uh, you stopped at the stream and you turned north three times?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard You’re right, you’re lost, good luck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 priya Oh! Leonard, wake up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Huh! Sorry!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 priya For what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard I don’t know. When I’m in bed with a girl, it’s just, it’s my go to response.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 priya It’s six o’ clock, I have to get back to Raj’s before he wakes up and realises I’m gone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Oh, right, sure. I wish you could stay in LA a while longer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 priya Mmm. Me too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard You know, I was thinking, there are some great research facilities in India.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 priya Where are you going with this, Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Well, I’m just saying, I don’t have any real ties here, so if I were to move to New Delhi we could, you know, go out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 priya Leonard, didn’t we have this conversation five years ago.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Well, yes, but, things have changed, you know, you’re older, I’m older. Look, no more superhero bedsheets.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 priya Sweetheart, just because we have fun when I come to town doesn’t mean I want to have a serious relationship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard It doesn’t?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 priya Mm-mm. And besides, I could never bring a white boy home to my parents. They’d have a cow. Which is a much bigger deal in India.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard I’m not that white. My great-great grandmother was half Cherokee. I know that’s not the right kind of Indian but it is something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 priya Aha, you’re funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon Leonard. Leonard. Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon I heard a woman laughing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Oh, uh, yeah, I was trying to see if I could laugh as a woman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon Oh. Well, good job, quite convincing. I smell perfume.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Air freshener.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon And is that lipstick on your cheek and neck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Uh, rash, that’s a bad rash.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon My sympathies. I am no stranger to the crimson scourge that is dermatitis. Can I interest you in a topical steroid from my lotion and unguent collection?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Uh, yeah, yeah, that sounds great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon Very well, I’m sure I can find something that will help you ditch that itch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Okay, he’s in the bathroom, let’s go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon Do you prefer ointment or cream?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Uh, cream.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon With or without a numbing agent?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Without.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon Really? Leonard, there are no heroes when it comes to dermatitis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Fine. With.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon Prescription or non-prescription strength.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Use your best judgement.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon Well, I think I have a nice 2009 AnaMantle HC. It’s usually indicated for acutely inflamed haemorrhoids, but it also goes nicely with non mucosal body parts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Sounds great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon Excellent choice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Right, right, alright. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon Priya?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 priya Good morning, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon For shame, Leonard. For shame. And to think I was ready to waste the last of my good haemorrhoid cream on you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Making pretty good time, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon Is that really what you want to talk about, Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon What do you want to talk about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Please don’t tell anyone I spent the night with Raj’s sister.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon There it is. What if someone asks?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard No-one’s going to ask if I spent the night with Raj’s sister.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon Perhaps. But they might ask me something else.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Like what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon Like, has Leonard betrayed any of his friends recently?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Priya and I are both adults. We didn’t betray Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon In fact, you did, but I was referring to Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard What are you talking about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon April 12th, 2005, Bob’s Big Boy, Toluca Lake. Raj had just introduced us to Priya for the first time, and she was enjoying the sweet taste of Hindu rebellion in the form of a Bob’s Super Big Boy hamburger. In order to preserve your friendship, you and Howard made a pinky swear that neither of you would attempt to woo her. I had a patty melt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Okay, fine, I betrayed Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon And Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Alright, and Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon And me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard You?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon Violation of the roommate agreement, overnight guest notification clause.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Okay fine, I’m, I’m a horrible human being, I’m the Darth Vader of Pasadena.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon You’re far too short to be Darth Vader. At best you might be a turncoat Ewok.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard My point is, Priya’s gone. And it would be much better if no-one else found out about this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon You mean, you want me to keep a secret.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon You know I can’t keep a secret.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard You can if you try. Think about it this way, if I were Batman and you were Alfred, you’d keep that secret. Right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon Why do you get to be Batman?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Because, well, Batman has the secret.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon Well Alfred has secrets too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Like what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon Alfred knows that Barbara Gordon is Batgirl. Which I’ve now just told to Batman. See, I can’t keep a secret.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon Ta-da!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard What.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon Ta-da. It’s short for da-da-da-da!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Kind of busy here, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon I know, that’s why I shortened it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard What do you want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon I came to go over your alibi for last night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard What alibi?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon You’ve asked me to lie on your behalf, and as you know, I am deeply uncomfortable with impromptu dishonest, so I’ve provided you with an iron clad alibi. You couldn’t have spent last night with Priya, because you were with another woman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Oh, I’m so sure I’m going to regret this, but, who was I with?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon The fun loving, and morally loose, Miss Maggie McGeary.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Oh, God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon You met her at Pasadena’s most popular Irish watering hole, Lucky Baldwin’s, where Maggie spends her nights tending bar, with a head full of curls and a heart full of dreams.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Leonard, call me if you’re interested in coitus. Sincerely, Maggie McGeary.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon And if anyone were to actually call that number they will hear this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 mechanical_voice_on_sheldons_phone Top of the morning to you. You’ve reached Maggie McGeary. Leave a message after the wee little beep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon It’s pretty convincing, huh? And it wasn’t even a real person. And here is the clincher. A lock of Maggie’s flaming auburn hair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Where did you get that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon From an orang-u-tan in the primate lab.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard An orang-u-tan?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon Well, no-one’s going to run a DNA test on it, Leonard, honestly you over-think everything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Sheldon, I don’t need an alibi. Nobody’s going to ask about last night as long as you just zip your lip. Thankyou. Now don’t worry, everything is going to be fine. (Sheldon writes “I doubt it” on Leonard’s whiteboard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 raj Hey, Leonard, will you please tell Howard my sister’s never been attracted to him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard C’mon Raj, how am I supposed to know who she’s attracted to. Or was attracted to. Or who she might be attracted to. In the future.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon And I have nothing to contribute to this conversation. Because I too know absolutely nothing about Priya’s preferences in male companionship. And with that, I will re-zip my lip.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 raj Hey, so what did you guys think of the new episode of Caprica last night?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard I didn’t see it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 howard Didn’t see it? What were you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Uh, I was out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 raj On Caprica night?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Yeah, I, uh, went for a drink.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 howard Really, you, and where, where did you go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard To, uh, Lucky Baldwin’s.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon Oh, I’ve heard of that place, isn’t that Pasadena’s favourite Irish watering hole.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon Did you meet anyone interesting there, perhaps a promiscuous redheaded barmaid?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard As a matter of fact I.. I… I can’t… I can’t… I can’t do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon Sure you can, you’re doing fine, it’s very believable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Look, I’m sorry Raj, but the truth is I was with Priya last night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon Don’t listen to him, he’s still light headed from all the Irish whiskey and pickled eggs in his system.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 raj What were you doing with Priya?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon I believe they engaged in coitus but, more importantly, if Leonard had not abandoned his story, would you have found it plausible?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 raj What? You slept with my sister?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 howard How could you? We had a pact!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 raj Excuse me, I think how could you she’s my sister takes precedence over a five year old pinky swear!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon May I point out, in a parallel universe, your friends are saying Maggie McGeary, she sounds lovely.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Look, I admit it, I may have crossed a line here, but come on, Raj, your sister is a grown woman. To her, I’m a forbidden piece of white chocolate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 raj I… I don’t believe it, this is a terrible betrayal of my trust.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard No, no, no, would it help if I told you that I offered her my heart and she kind of stomped on it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 raj How hard did she stomp?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Very hard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 raj Okay, I’m good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 howard Yeah, well, Raj, I just want to say that I’d never betray your trust. Unlike Leonard, I respect you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 howard Mmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Was it out of respect that you didn’t tell Raj about the time you dropped his iPhone in a urinal?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 raj Dude! I put that thing on my face!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon I think a more amusing violation of Raj’s trust is when Howard convinced him that foreigners give presents to Americans on Thanksgiving.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 howard Hey, I didn’t see you giving back your Snoopy snowcone maker.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 raj That was all a lie? This year’s gifts are already wrapped!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 howard And as long as we’re talking about betraying our friends, how about the month Sheldon spent grinding up insects and mixing them into Leonard’s food.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon Well, excuse me. That was not a betrayal, that was an experiment to determine at what concentration food starts tasting mothy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard You put moths in my food?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 sheldon For science.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 raj I can’t believe you kissed my sister with moth mouth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode06 leonard Well, uh, I can’t believe.
