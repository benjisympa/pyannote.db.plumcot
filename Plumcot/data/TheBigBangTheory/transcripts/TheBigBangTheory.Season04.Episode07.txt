TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter No, seriously, I think I’ve finally figured out my problem with women.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper The capybara is the largest member of the rodent family.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter What does that have to do with me and women?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Nothing. It was a desperate attempt to introduce an alternate topic of conversation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter My problem is, I don’t project confidence. So I decided that the next time I meet a woman I think is attractive, rather than holding back and being cautious, I’m going to assume the mantle of self-assurance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Oh, yeah? What’s that look like?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Hi. I’m Leonard. And you are beautiful. You pop, sparkle and buzz electric. I’m going to pick you up at eight, show you a night you will never forget.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Where are we going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Good news. I made it onto the team for the new Defence Department laser-equipped surveillance satellite.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Excuse me. If we’re changing topics, I believe I have first dibs with capybara, a rodent the size of a baby hippo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Congratulations Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Thanks. Listen, I have to get a security clearance, so you guys might be hearing from the FBI.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Whoa, whoa, whoa! I don’t want to speak to the FBI.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 raj_koothrappali I’m brown and I talk funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 howard_wolowitz They’re just doing a background check on me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 raj_koothrappali It doesn’t matter. They’ll find a reason to give me a one-way ticket back to Gandhi-ville. By the way, when I say that, it’s not offensive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Don’t be ridiculous, Raj. You’re here legally.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Nobody cares. Do you know how long it’s been since I got through airport security without being given a colonoscopy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper You know, I try very hard to make our lunch hours educational and informative, but your insistence on talking about your own lives stymies me at every turn.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Fine, Sheldon, tell us about your giant rodents.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper No, you squandered your time with me, and the moment has now passed. Feast on your disappointment, much as the capybara feasts on its own waste.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Oh, Bella, don’t you see? Edward’s only pushing you away because he loves you. Coming.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 woman_at_door#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 Dr. Koothrappali? I’m Special Agent Page, FBI. May I come in? I’d like to talk to you about Howard Wolowitz. Oh, thank you. All right. Well, how long have you known Mr. Wolowitz?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Rum cake?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 No, thanks. Now, about Mr. Wolowitz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Seven years.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 I see.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 raj_koothrappali I’m in this country legally, you know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 I’m sure you are. Now, to your knowledge, has Mr. Wolowitz ever committed a crime?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Of course not. I’m here on an H-1B visa, which means I can’t be associated in any way with crime or criminal activity. And I’m not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 Good. To your knowledge, does Mr. Wolowitz have any foreign contacts?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 raj_koothrappali No, just me. Oh, there it is. Here comes a cavity search.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 Excuse me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Please don’t send me back to India, it’s so crowded. It’s like the whole country is one endless Comic-Con, except everybody’s wearing the same costume, Indian Guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 Dr. Koothrappali, I’m not…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 raj_koothrappali I love this country! The-the baseball, the freedom, the rampant morbid obesity! From California to the New York Island, I’m a real Yankee Doodle boy!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 Dr. Koothrappali, please.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 raj_koothrappali My country ’tis of thee, duh duh duh liberty, It’s really great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter So, when Howard said the FBI would be contacting me, I was expecting Mulder. Glad to see I got Scully.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 Who?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Mulder and Scully. X-Files. The truth is out there. Never mind. Uh, so, what would you like to know?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 You work with Mr. Wolowitz here at the university, correct?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Yes. Of course, we’re in different departments. He’s an engineer and I’m an experimental physicist. You know, one of those guys who examines the building blocks of creation and says, Hello, maker of the universe, I see what you did there. Good one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 Right. Now, how would you characterize your relationship with Mr. Wolowitz?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Good. It’s a good relationship. Of course, most of my relationships are good. Probably because I exude confidence. People are drawn to that, you know? Confidence, not exuding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 Do you know of any groups Mr. Wolowitz is a member of?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter You are beautiful, you know that? You pop, sparkle and buzz electric. I’m going to pick you up at eight, show you a night you will never forget.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 Sounds great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 Yeah. Can my six-foot-two Navy SEAL husband come with us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Is that, oh, my, I didn’t see the ring with my glasses off, so, look at that, I’m starting to exude.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Want to get that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Not particularly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Could you get that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper I suppose I could if I were asked.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Would you please get that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Of course. Why do you have to make things so complicated?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 Dr. Cooper?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 I’m Special Agent Page, FBI.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper You say you’re Special Agent Page, FBI.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 Here’s my I.D.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper And here is my Justice League membership card. But that doesn’t prove I know Batman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 I just want to ask you a few questions about Howard Wolowitz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Oh. All right. I doubt anyone would risk the stiff penalties for impersonating a federal officer just to ask questions about a minor league engineer with an unresolved Oedipal complex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper For the record, I truly support the FBI in the mission which is expressed through their motto?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 Fidelity, bravery, integrity?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Correct. Now to business. 18 years ago, I sent the FBI Crime Lab samples from a bag of excrement that had been lit on fire on my front porch for fingerprinting and DNA analysis. Why haven’t I heard back yet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 Well, the FBI Crime Lab does have a lot on its plate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper That’s of little comfort to a nation attempting to scrape burning feces off its shoes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 Would you mind if we talked about Mr. Wolowitz now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper A little, but go on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 Thank you. Would you characterize him as responsible?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper I’m going to answer that with a visual aid. This is my nine-disc complete Lord of the Rings trilogy blu-ray set.Mr Wolowitz borrowed it, damaged plastic retention hub number three, and then returned it to me, hoping I wouldn’t notice. Would you characterize that as responsible?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 That’s really not the sort of thing we’re interested in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper You heard me say blu-ray, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 I did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Very well. Would you be interested in knowing that Mr. Wolowitz once snuck onto my World of Warcraft account and changed the name of a certain level-80 warlock from Sheldor to Smeldor?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 I’m afraid not. Is there anything else?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Is there anything else? Where would you like to start? He refuses to pay fines when he’s overdue with books I lend him. He crashed the Mars Rover while attempting to impress a woman. He recommended that I go see the third Matrix movie because it was, and I quote, just as good as the first one. If that’s not irresponsible, I don’t know what is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 The Mars Rover?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Did I say Mars Rover?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 You did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper That was actually a poorly chosen example, as it had nothing to do with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 Yes, well, let’s talk about it anyway.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper I don’t want to. Not that my disinclination to discuss the topic should be interpreted as evidence of Howard Wolowitz’s culpability in the destruction of government property worth millions of dollars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 Thank you, Dr. Cooper. I think I have all I need.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Oh, good. I was afraid you were going to fixate on that Mars Rover incident.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Hey, buddies. Guess who didn’t get security clearance to work on the giant space laser?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter What happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Apparently, the background interviews didn’t go well. You guys wouldn’t know anything about that, would you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Well, actually, I may have gotten a little tipsy when I talked to her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter And I may have hit on her a little bit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 raj_koothrappali I may have thrown up rum cake on her shoes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 howard_wolowitz I see. Well, it’s good to know, when I need you guys, I can always count on you to step up and ruin everything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter I feel awful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Ah, me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter To tell you the truth, I thought if anyone was going to screw things up for Howard, it’d be Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Well, your expectations have been subverted. Aha.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter What are you doing up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Sleep eludes me, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Really? Maybe sleep has met you before.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Mockery? That’s all you have to offer?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter I’m sorry. Why can’t you sleep?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Who knows? I haven’t watched any scary movies recently. I’m no longer obsessing over why the predicted mass of the quantum vacuum has little effect on the expansion of the universe. And it’s been weeks since I took that accidental sip of Red Bull.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Did something happen today that’s bothering you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Well, I did mention the Mars Rover incident to that FBI agent and probably cost Howard his security clearance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper But why should that keep me up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Because you feel guilty?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Interesting. So you’re saying my insomnia is caused by a guilty conscience.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Actually, you don’t have insomnia. You’re sleeping now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Excuse me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter You’re having a guilt-ridden dream.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Do you have any evidence to support that hypothesis?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter How about that Gorn sitting on the couch?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper That seems fairly conclusive. No, Gorn, no. That’s where I sit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Thank you for agreeing to see me, Agent Page.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 Thank you for filing a complaint with my superior, Dr. Cooper. I understand you want to recant your statement about Howard Wolowitz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 Was your statement untrue?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 Then I’m afraid you can’t withdraw it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper I’m sorry. I don’t recall you saying no backsies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 Is there anything else?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Yes. I’d like to offer a laudatory statement about Howard’s many excellent qualities that I believe will tip the scales back in his favour. Howard Joel Wolowitz. H is for honesty, of which he has much. O’s for outstanding, which he is such. W’s for witty, he’s quick with a joke. A’s for artistic, his ability…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 I’m sorry, Dr. Cooper, this matter is already closed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper But I still have rd Joel Wolowitz left to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 It’s closed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper I don’t understand why you people are picking on my friend, Howard, when there are much more serious security threats to pursue. For instance, when I first met Leonard, he was on the verge of giving away rocket secrets to a North Korean spy, and not one agent ever investigated that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 page#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 This is Leonard Hofstadter?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper No, it’s a different Leonard. He’s Chinese, red hair, six fingers. Good-bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Raj. Have you seen Howard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 raj_koothrappali I think he’s eating lunch. Uh, Sheldon, I want you to meet Neil deGrasse Tyson from the Hayden Planetarium in New York.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper I’m quite familiar with Dr. Tyson. He’s responsible for the demotion of Pluto from planetary status. I liked Pluto. Ergo I do not like you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 neil_degrasse_tyson But I actually didn’t demote Pluto. That was a vote of the International Astronomical Union.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper If ifs and buts were candy and nuts, we’d all have a merry Christmas. Think about that, Dr. Tyson.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 neil_degrasse_tyson Is that the guy you were telling me about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Oh, yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Howard. The person at fault for you not getting a security clearance is me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 howard_wolowitz You?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Yes, but before you get upset, I want you to know I went to the FBI and retracted my statement.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 howard_wolowitz And they were okay with that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper No. If anything, I made it worse. In any case, I have been riddled with guilt, which is causing Gorn-infested REM sleep. So, I’m here now to say I’m sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Are you kidding me? You’ve set my career back at least two years, and you think you can make it right with I’m sorry?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Yes. I followed the social protocol. I attempted to right the wrong, and when I failed to do so I delivered a heartfelt apology. Now you say apology accepted, and I will offer you a one-time-only high five.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Your apology is not accepted.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper You’re tricking me. It really is, isn’t it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Leave me alone, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 neil_degrasse_tyson Dr. Cooper, I just wanted you to know I’m sorry for the role I played in the Pluto matter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Oh, shut up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 penny Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 penny What are you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper I have troubles, Penny. I’ve come to pour them out to the sympathetic ear of the local barkeep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 penny You know, they have a really nice bar over at the Olive Garden.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper I don’t like the Olive Garden. They treat me like family.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 penny Okay, Sheldon. What can I get you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Alcohol.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 penny Could you be a little more specific?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Ethyl alcohol. 40 millilitres.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 penny I’m sorry, honey, I don’t know millilitres.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Ah. Blame President James “Jimmy” Carter. He started America on a path to the metric system but then just gave up. He wonders why he was a one-term president.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 penny Would you say that’s about 40 milliliters?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper More or less.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 penny Great. Now, where were we?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper I believe you were about to ask me to choose a cocktail. Fortunately, thanks to computer-savvy alcoholics, there’s an app for that. Let’s see. Harvey Wallbanger. Eh. Sex on the Beach. I hardly think so. Rob Roy, Silk Slipper, Mad Hatter. Ooh! I’ll have a Rosewater Ricky.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 penny A what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper You’ll need pitted, brandied cherries, gin, rosewater, angostura bitters and overproofed rum. Now, first, dust the cherries with sugar, then spray them with a mixture of rum and bitters. Then ignite the rum, caramel…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 penny Here you go, one Rosewater Ricky.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper That’s not how it looks in the picture.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 penny Oh, yeah, you know, every bartender makes it differently. Why don’t you give it a try.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper All right. To the metric system. I can’t taste the cherries.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 penny All right. Sheldon, what’s on your mind?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper I wronged Howard, and he won’t accept my apology.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 penny Oh, right, that. Yes, Leonard told me. Sorry, honey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Penny, you face failure on a daily basis. How do you cope?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 penny I drink.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper To drinking. Nope. Oh, if only there were some way to force Howard to accept my apology so I could escape this miasma of guilt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 penny You know, sometimes stuff just happens, and there’s nothing you can do about it. For example, Lisa Peterson hasn’t talked to me since the 11th grade, because no matter how much you apologize, you can’t go back and un-dry-hump someone’s boyfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper I see. You’re saying I’m facing Starfleet Academy’s unwinnable command scenario, the Kobayashi Maru.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 penny Exactly. Sometimes you can’t win.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Captain Kirk won.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 penny Kirk cheated.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Impressive that you know that. It’s hard to believe I’m actually having this conversation with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 penny Right there with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Kirk beat the Kobayashi Maru by reprogramming the simulator. That’s it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper I’ll reprogram Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 penny What? Sheldon, you can’t reprogram people.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper No, you can’t reprogram people. To James Tiberius Kirk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Hello, all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Howard, you’re feeling better about me today, aren’t you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Not really.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Yes, you are. I’m using neurolinguistic programming to modify your thought patterns.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Oh. Go away, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper There’s a nine ninety five e-book down the drain.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 raj_koothrappali What’s in the bag?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper It’s for Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Oh. Sheldon, you can’t fix this with gifts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Nevertheless, I’ve hurt you, and whether you forgive me or not, I want you to have this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 howard_wolowitz You’re giving me a couch cushion?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper No. The cushion is merely symbolic. I’m giving you my spot on the couch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 howard_wolowitz But you love that spot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper No. I love my mother. My feelings for my spot are much greater. It is the singular location in space around which revolves my entire universe. And now it’s yours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Oh, my God, dude. Now you have to forgive him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 howard_wolowitz All right. Apology accepted.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper High five. Not too hard. Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 raj_koothrappali I haven’t cried like this since Toy Story 3.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 howard_wolowitz I got to tell you, Sheldon, I understand why you chose this spot. I mean, the temperature is good, but there’s no draft. I can see the television, but I can still talk to…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 sheldon_cooper I changed my mind. Get out of my spot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 penny How long?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter 94 seconds.
