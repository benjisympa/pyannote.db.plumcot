TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 raj You know who’s got to be the bravest person in the Marvel Universe? Whoever has to give She-Hulk a bikini wax.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 howard You want to talk brave, how about Captain America’s undocumented Mexican gardener?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard He’s not braver than whoever uses the bathroom after The Thing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 sheldon As usual, you’re all wrong. The bravest person in the Marvel Universe is the doctor who gives Wolverine his prostate exam.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 howard How about the guy who gets a prostate exam from Wolverine?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 sheldon Now you just being silly. Wolverine’s never displayed the slightest interest in helping others prevent prostate cancer. Hello. Yes, the elevator’s out of order you’ll have to use the stairs. Of course you can. Pizza dates back to the 16th century, while the first elevator was not installed until 1852. That means that for over 300 years, people carried pizzas up stairs. Be part of that proud tradition.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard I’ll go get Penny while that guy spits on our food.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 raj Do you think they gave Wolverine an Adamantium prostate?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 howard That’s a stupid question.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 raj We’re having a conversation about probing the heinies of superheroes. There are no stupid questions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 man Yes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard Oh, um, is Penny here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 man You’re Leonard, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 man Damn, it’s good to finally meet you, son.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard Okay, I think a bit of context here might help.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 penny Oh, hey, Leonard. I see you met my dad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard Oh, good. Context.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 pennys_dad Come on in, buddy. Take a load off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 penny Oh, gee, dad, Leonard can’t stay. He just dropped by to say hello. Thanks for stopping by, sweetie. I’ll see you later. Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard That was odd.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 sheldon Are you sure you have enough comics? You’re going to be monitoring the telescope for 12 hours, and by my estimate, you’ve only selected seven hours of reading material. That’s even factoring in your difficulty in parsing American comic book idioms like Bamf and Snikt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 raj Is that racist? It feels racist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 howard Don’t be oversensitive. He’s calling you illiterate, not your race.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 raj Oh, okay. Good. I don’t need more comics. Howard’s gonna stop by, we’re gonna play intergalactic battleship and Indian Monopoly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 sheldon I don’t care for novelty editions of Monopoly. I prefer the classics, regular and Klingon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 howard Actually, Indian Monopoly’s just like regular, except the money’s in Rupees, instead of hotels you build call centers, and when you pick a chance card, you might die of dysentery. Just FYI, that was racist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard You’ll never guess what just happened.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 sheldon You went out in the hallway, stumbled into an interdimensional portal which brought you 5,000 years into the future, where you took advantage of the advanced technology to build a time machine, and now you’re back to bring us all with you to the year 7010 where we are transported to work at the thinkatorium by telepathically controlled flying dolphins?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 sheldon Aw.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard Penny kissed me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 sheldon Well, who would ever guess that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 raj What… what kind of a kiss?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard A big kiss. On the mouth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 howard Is it possible that she was going for your cheek and you moved and she accidentally got lip? That happens with me and my mom all the time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard She introduced me to her father, kissed me and then shut the door in my face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard You think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 howard Yeah. This man is not my father. I’m being held hostage. So I’m going to do something insane in the hopes that you’ll call 911.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard Penny kissing me is not insane. She used to kiss me all the time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 sheldon Einstein defined insanity as doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. By that standard, Penny is cuckoo for cocoa puffs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard I’m just saying, it felt like it may have meant something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 howard Ah, this takes me back. Leonard obsessing about Penny. I mean, don’t get me wrong, I love your new stuff, but once in a while it’s nice to hear the hits.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 raj Ooh, ooh! Do our babies will be smart and beautiful. That one always makes me laugh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard Why do I bother talking to you people?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 sheldon If it’ll make you feel better, we rarely listen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 penny Hey, can I talk to you out here for a sec?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard Yeah, sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 sheldon I’m starting to think we’re never going to see that pizza.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 penny So you’re probably wondering what that was all about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard What, uh, the kissing and everything? Nah, women do that to me all the time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 penny Yeah, okay. The thing is, I kind of told my father we got back together again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard What? Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 penny Well, you’re the first guy he’s ever really approved of, you know? You’re a scientist who went to college and you don’t have a neck tattoo or outstanding warrants or, or a baby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard What kind of guys did you used to go out with?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 penny Just guys. Anyway, when I told him we split up, he was heartbroken, and he kept bugging me, how’s Leonard? why can’t you get back together with Leonard? I bet Leonard never tipped a cow over on himself. So to get him off my back, I told him we worked things out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard Really? How, how’d we manage that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard Well, did you apologize? Did you have to woo me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 penny Get over yourself. I whistled, you came running.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard Yeah, no, I don’t think so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 penny Okay, why are you arguing about this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard I’m just saying, if we fake got back together, that’s totally not how it fake happened.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 penny Oh, okay, whatever. Will you please just play along until my dad leaves?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard Hold on, you actually want me to deceive your father with some sort of sham play acting and kissing? Cause I’m good with that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 pennys_dad Penny, you out here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 penny Come on, honey, not in front of my dad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 pennys_dad Relax, I’ve seen you do a lot worse with a lot stupider.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard See? He doesn’t mind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 pennys_dad So, Leonard, I’m taking your gal out for a steak dinner, you want to join us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 penny Oh, dad, that’s nice, but Leonard has to work. Right, Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard Uh, I do, I have to work. But I’m gonna blow that off to spend the evening with my sweetie and her father, ’cause, you know, just the kind of boyfriend I am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 penny Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard Come here, you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 howard C-7.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 raj Miss.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 howard How could that be a miss? C-6 was a hit, C-8 was a hit. Part of your starship has to be on C-7.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 raj Not if it has a hole in the middle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 howard What kind of spaceship has a hole in the middle?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 raj A Romulan battle bagel?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 bernadette Knock-knock.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 howard Oh, great, you made it. Come on in. I invited her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 bernadette So where’s the telescope?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 howard It’s in Hawaii, but Raj controls it from here. He’s hoping to see Epsilon Eridani dim, which would be evidence of a planet orbiting it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 bernadette So we just sit and stare at the screen, waiting for something to happen?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 howard I did it with you when we rented The Notebook. Yes, Gena Rowlands is a treasure. You’d better open up that bottle of wine or I’m gonna end up with swimmer’s ear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 raj Excuse me. I can’t be drinking, I’m about to make an important scientific discovery here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 howard What? Galileo did his best work while drinking wine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 raj How do you know that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 howard Well, he was Italian. It’s a reasonable assumption.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 raj Dude, can you even open your mouth without spewing a cultural stereotype?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 howard Oh, I, I’m sorry, Galileo drank diet sprite. Look, you’re my best friend, she’s my girlfriend, you should bond. You know, like you and my mom did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 raj Your mom creeps the hell out of me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 howard Yes, but she’s stopped calling you slumdog millionaire.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 raj I do appreciate that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 bernadette Here we go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 howard Well I’d like to propose a toast. To science and friendship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 bernadette Hold on. Wait. No, it’s okay, go ahead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 howard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 bernadette Oh, I was working with Penicillin-resistant gonorrhoea in the lab today and I was just trying to remember if I washed my hands.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard Thanks for the steak, Wyatt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 pennys_dad My pleasure. It’s nice to have dinner with a boyfriend of Penny’s that knows how to use a napkin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 penny So not funny, dad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 wyatt Let me tell you about this one genius she was going out with, this, this fella Donnie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 penny Oh, will you please let it go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 wyatt Donnie was gonna make millions turning farm waste into biofuel and selling it to the government.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard A lot of people are doing that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 penny Oh, see?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 wyatt Yeah, but all Donnie did was mix pig poop with a little water and pump it into his mom’s Camry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 penny Yeah, that’s great. It’s a funny story. Moving on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 wyatt And Donnie was a rocket scientist compared to that boy who wanted to get beer pong into the Olympics. What was his name, sweetheart?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 penny Curtis, and I’m pretty sure he was joking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 wyatt I don’t know. That petition looked real to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 penny Yeah, okay, I think this ends the ex-boyfriend portion of our evening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 wyatt Well, I’m just glad you finally found yourself a keeper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard Thanks, Wyatt. I’m a keeper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 wyatt Leonard, you want to come in for a nightcap?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 penny Oh, gee, dad, he’d love to, but Leonard has to work in the morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard Maybe I could go in a little late.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 penny No, no, no, you can’t. Your career is far too important.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 wyatt Behind every great man is a nagging woman who won’t let him have any fun, am I right, Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard Don’t I know it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 wyatt Well, good night, son.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard Good night, Wyatt. Oh, good night, honey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 penny Good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard I love you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 penny Love you, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 sheldon Oh, friggety-frak. Not this again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 howard Three, four, five, pass go, get 2,000 Rupees, Six, seven, whoops. Can’t go any further. There’s a sacred cow in my way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 raj Bernadette, please tell your boyfriend to cool it with the cow jokes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 bernadette It won’t help. Once he finds a joke he likes, he sticks with it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 raj Yeah. Like his haircut material.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 bernadette Oh, right. Did you get your hair cut?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 raj No. I got them all cut.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 bernadette Which is still so funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 raj And when you go to a Chinese restaurant, he always gets the same fortune in his fortune cookie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 bernadette Right. Help, I’m a prisoner in a Chinese fortune cookie factory.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 howard Okay, I think that’s enough about me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 raj He’s right. Let’s make fun of his mother. Howard, come rub my feet! My corns are killing me!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 bernadette Howard, help me out of the tub! I’m stuck again!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard Coming. Hey, lovebug.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 penny Shut up. You know what I’ve been doing for the last hour?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard Mm, dreamily doodling Mrs. Leonard Hofstadter in a notebook?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 penny Listening to my father go on and on about what a great guy you are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard You got to admit, I am, I’m delightful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 penny Why are you making this so difficult?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard It’s not difficult for me. I’m having fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 penny Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard What do you want me to do? You started this. Do you want to go over and tell him we’re broken up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard Well, then, what do you want?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 penny I don’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard Don’t you think that’s something you should have figured out before you stomped over here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 penny Maybe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 sheldon Leonard, Penny, excellent. I’d like to say I’m very happy that you’re back together, and if I can figure out a way to do so and sound sincere, I will. In the meantime, I’d like to go over some proposed changes to the roommate agreement specifically to address Penny’s annoying personal habits.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 penny Oh, my God. What personal habits?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard I have a list. FYI, overuse of the phrase, oh, my god, is number 12.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 penny Okay, Sheldon, you don’t have to do this because Leonard and I are not…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard Ba-ba-ba-ba. Are you sure you want to include him in this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 sheldon Include me in what? Is there a plot afoot? I’ll have no truck with plots.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 penny No, you’re right. No, there’s, there’s no plots, no trucks, no feet. So what other annoying habits shall we discuss?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 sheldon Uh, we don’t discuss anything. Leonard is the signatory to the Roommate Agreement. As such, he bears responsibility for all your infractions and must pay all fines.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard Fines?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 sheldon Yes. If Penny’s going to be spending nights here again, you’ll need to set up an escrow account. Sign here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 raj Hello, Hawaii. This is Dr. Koothrappali in Pasadena. I’d like you to reposition the telescope, please. Scarlett Johansson’s house! I’m kidding, Hawaii. Mahalo. Whoo!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 howard It might have been a mistake to open that second bottle of wine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 bernadette Well, live and learn. So, Raj, do you think this planet you’re looking for could have an atmosphere that supports life?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 raj Maybe. If it did, I’d be famous. I’d be on the cover of magazines. And then, instead of living alone in my tiny apartment, I’d have a big mansion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 bernadette That sounds great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 raj It is. If you like wandering around a big, empty house with no one to love you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 howard We’d come visit you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 raj No, you wouldn’t. You’d be intimidated by my wealth and fame. My only friends would be my genetically engineered monkey butler, and the little people I hired to be my living chess set.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 bernadette He’s taking a turn to the dark side, isn’t he?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 howard Hold on. He could come back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 raj Oh, what’s the point of everything?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 howard Nope. He’s gone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 raj You know it’s been more than a year since I’ve even kissed a girl?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 howard What about that hook-up at Comic-Con you told me about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 raj Oh, grow up. I was lying. I lie all the time. Nobody wants to kiss me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 bernadette Oh, you poor, poor thing. Raj, you have to know you’re a wonderful man. There are a lot of girls out there who’ll want to kiss you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 raj Where?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 bernadette You just have to look.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 howard No!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 bernadette Well, this was fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 wyatt Oh! I think I got a nibble.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard Oh, b-be careful. Give him some line. Okay, now reel him in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 wyatt Oh, look at that baby. They’re really biting, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard Yeah. They do that when you set it on easy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 wyatt Oh, that’s me. Hello. Oh, hi, sweetie. Yeah, I got up early and didn’t want to wake you, so I went out for coffee and ran into Leonard on the way back. Guess what, we’re fishing. Yeah. Right here on his couch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard Hey, baby. I love you! Mwuh, mwuh, mwuh, mwuh, mwuh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 wyatt That’s Leonard says he loves you. What? I see. The whole thing’s bull squirt, huh? Well, that’s very disappointing. Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard Oh, hey. There’s been something I’ve been meaning to tell you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 wyatt I can’t believe you would lie to me like that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard Just for the record, I did not want to be a part of this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 wyatt I’ll get to you in a minute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard No hurry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 wyatt That my own daughter thinks I don’t love her enough to support her no matter what choices she makes, well, that hurts me deeply.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 penny I’m sorry, daddy…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 wyatt Let me finish.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 penny Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 wyatt I thought we were past the days when you would try to pull the wool over my eyes. Telling me the baggie in your underwear drawer is potpourri? And the pee stick in your bathroom is to check for diabetes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 penny You know, I’m sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 wyatt You’re a grown woman, and I respect your right to make your own decisions, but all I ask is you respect me enough to be honest about them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 penny You’re right. Look, from now on, I will tell you the truth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 wyatt Thank you. Now, why don’t you go and put some clothes on and we’ll grab a bite to eat before I head for the airport. Now you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 penny Daddy, he had nothing to do…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 wyatt Keep walking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 penny Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 wyatt Please, please, please don’t give up on her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 wyatt I can’t go back to the skateboard idiots, the white rappers and all those sweaty dumb-asses with their backwards hats.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard Gee, I don’t know if it’s in the cards, sir.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 wyatt Then, stack the deck. Cheat. Lie. I don’t care. I want grandkids before I die, and I want them to grow up in a house without wheels.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard I’ll give it a shot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 wyatt Thank you. Now I’m going to do something here to help you along.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard Excuse me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 wyatt Just don’t panic. Now, get your sorry, lying ass out of my face and make sure I never see it again!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard Oh, the reverse psychology thing. I see. That’s very clever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 wyatt Don’t yap. Just get out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard I’ll friend you on Facebook.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 sheldon Oh, there you are. Just so you know, I was up all night, but I have finally completed the Penny-specific section of the new roommate agreement.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard Yeah, well, not necessary. We broke up again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 sheldon Do you even think about other people, Leonard? Do you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 raj Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard Oh, how’d it go last night?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 raj Oh, you know. Same old, same old. Looked through a telescope, saw some stars. Big whoop.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard Really? You waited months for time with that telescope. What happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 raj Why? You writing a book?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 sheldon I’m going to propose a hypothesis. Last night, Raj accidentally made contact with an alien civilization and has been ordered by the United States government to keep it a secret.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 raj Nothing happened. Can we please just change the subject?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 sheldon That sounds rehearsed. We are not alone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 howard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 sheldon Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 howard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 raj Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 leonard You get to play with Raj’s big telescope last night?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 howard Whoa. Where did that come from?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 raj He never touched my telescope.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 howard Way to go shutting up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 raj I did shut up. Now you shut up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 howard Fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode09 raj Thank you. How come you didn’t call me this morning?
