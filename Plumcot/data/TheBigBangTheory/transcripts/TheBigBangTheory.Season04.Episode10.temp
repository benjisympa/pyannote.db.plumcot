TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon Clarify something for me. Isn’t the point of a communal meal the exchange of ideas and opinions? An opportunity to consider important issues of the day?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 leonard It is. You just kind of put a damper on things when you said, the next person I see talking with food in their mouth will be put to death.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon Well, we could argue about who said what all night long, but to set things back on course, I will propose a new topic of conversation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 leonard Great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon What is the best number? By the way, there’s only one correct answer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 raj Five million, three hundred eighteen thousand and eight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon Wrong. The best number is 73. You’re probably wondering why.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 leonard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 howard Uh-uh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 raj We’re good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon 73 is the 21st prime number. Its mirror, 37, is the 12th, and its mirror, 21, is the product of multiplying, hang on to your hats, seven and three. Eh? Eh? Did I lie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 leonard We get it. 73 is the Chuck Norris of numbers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon Chuck Norris wishes. In binary, 73 is a palindrome, one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one which backwards is one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one, exactly the same. All Chuck Norris backwards gets you is Sirron Kcuhc.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 raj Just for the record, when you enter five million three hundred eighteen thousand and eight in a calculator, upside-down it spells boobies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 leonard Remember when you were wondering why the girls didn’t want to eat with us tonight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 howard Yeah, I get it now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 penny I love your little heart locket, Bernadette.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 bernadette Oh, thanks. Howard gave it to me. It’s the cutest thing. Every time I have dinner with his mom, the next day I get jewellery.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 amy Did you know that the iconic Valentine’s heart shape is not actually based on the shape of a human heart, but rather on the shape of the buttocks of a female bending over?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 penny Oh, so I spent seventh grade dotting my I’s with little asses? Cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 zack Hey, Penny, how’s it going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 penny Hey, Zack, what are you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 zack My dad’s company prints the menus for this place. I’m just dropping off some new ones laminated. Makes ’em easier to clean if people throw up on ’em. Guess how I got the idea?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 penny Yeah, I got it, I got it. Uh, Zack, these are my friends Bernadette and Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 bernadette Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 zack Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 amy Hoo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 zack Okay, well, it was good to see you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 penny Yeah, you, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 bernadette He’s really cute. How do you know him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 penny Oh, we went out a couple of times.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 amy I’m often flummoxed by current slang. Does went out mean had intercourse?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 bernadette Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 penny No, no. But in this case, yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 amy Interesting. And was it not satisfactory?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 penny No, it was great. He just didn’t really challenge me on an intellectual level.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 bernadette Couldn’t you just fool around with him and then listen to NPR?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 penny Wouldn’t help. Zack can’t even spell NPR.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 bernadette It’s what I do with Howard. I’m much smarter than he is. But it’s important to protect his manhood.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 amy Hoo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 bernadette What’s the matter?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 amy I’m suddenly feeling flushed. My heart rate is elevated, my palms are clammy, my mouth is dry. In addition, I keep involuntarily saying hoo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 penny Oh, we know what’s causing that, don’t we?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 amy It’s no mystery. I obviously have the flu coupled with sudden-onset Tourette’s syndrome.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 howard Did you hear about the accident at the bio lab?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 leonard No. What happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 howard They were injecting rats with radioactive isotopes and one of the techs got bit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 raj Did he get superpowers?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 howard No, he got five stitches and a tetanus shot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 raj Oh. Well, that’s disappointing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 howard Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 raj Well, you get bit by a radioactive animal in a lab, you kind of want to turn into a superhero.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 howard Yeah, but who’d want to become Rat-Man?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 raj Who wouldn’t? You could zip through a maze in nothing flat, squeeze through really small holes, and shut down restaurants in a single bound. And the best part is, if I were Rat-Man, you could be my sidekick, Mouse Boy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 howard Mouse Boy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 raj You don’t like Mouse Boy? How about, uh, uh, Kid Vermin?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 howard First of all, if we had superpowers, I wouldn’t be the sidekick. You’d be the sidekick.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 raj Rat-Man is nobody’s sidekick.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 howard Leonard, settle this. Of the two of us, who’s the obvious sidekick?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 raj Yeah, Leonard, who?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 leonard 12 years after high school, and I’m still at the nerd table.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon Aren’t you slicing that man’s brain a little too thin?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 amy It’s too thin if I were making a foot-long brain sandwich at Quiznos. For examination under a two-photon microscope, it’s fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon Well, you’re the expert. If the correct way to do it is the wrong way, then I yield.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 amy Very well. If you die and donate your body to science, I promise to slice your brain like Canadian bacon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 amy Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to take my temperature.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon Are you monitoring your circadian rhythms in order to identify your periods of maximum mental acuity? I did that one summer. Ah, youth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 amy No, I experienced some distressing symptoms last night, so I’m checking my vital signs every hour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon I’d be happy to create a chart and participate in a differential diagnosis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 amy Oh, that sounds like fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon All right. What were the symptoms?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 amy Elevated heart rate, moist palms, dry mouth and localized vascular throbbing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon Localized to what region?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 amy Ears and genitalia.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon Interesting. Not body parts that usually team up. What about environmental factors? Describe the scene for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 amy I was sitting in a restaurant with Penny and Bernadette, drinking water, carbonated as it was a special occasion. Penny’s friend Zack stopped by and said hello and I said hoo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon Who?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 amy Zack.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon Then why did you ask?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 amy Ask what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon Who.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 amy Zack.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon All right, let’s start over. What did you say when Zack walked in?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 amy Hoo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon Zack.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 amy Why do you keep saying Zack?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon Because you keep saying who.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 amy I’m not saying hoo now. I said hoo last night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon And the answer was Zack, correct?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 amy There was no question. I simply said hoo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon All right, I think I have enough to go on. Possible explanations for your symptoms are, in descending order of likelihood, hyperthyroidism, premature menopause, hosting an alien parasite or, and I only include it for the sake of covering absolutely all bases, sexual arousal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 amy Where would I have picked up an alien parasite?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 howard There you are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 raj Oh, hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 howard Let me ask you a question. What are you most afraid of?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 raj I don’t know. Um, nuclear war. Accidentally being buried alive. Any of those movies where you get that phone call that says you’re going to die, and then you do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 howard No. Something very specific that we both know you, Rajesh Koothrappali, are terrified of.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 raj Well, type two diabetes runs in my family. The thought of losing a toe…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 howard Spiders! You’re afraid of spiders!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 raj What the heck is this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 howard A jar with a big spider in it, of course. Bravery test. First one to take his hand out is the sidekick.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 raj Are you crazy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 howard Perhaps. Are you scared?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 raj No. But it’s a stupid test.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 howard Oh, really? What if the earth was in danger and the only way to save it was to stick your hand in a jar with a spider?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 raj Oh, yeah? What if the earth was in danger and the only way to save it was to take a shower in the locker room and let other guys see you naked?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 howard Oh, come on. That’s never gonna happen. Now put your hand in the jar or forever be revealed as my sidekick.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 raj All right, I will.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 howard How did you get so brave all of a sudden?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 raj It’s easy. The spider’s crawling up your arm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 howard Get it off! Get it off! Please, Raj! Ah! Ah! Ah! Please. Oh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 amy My blood work shows thyroid function normal. Cortisol levels normal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon How about your follicle-stimulating hormone levels?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 amy Sheldon, I am not going through menopause.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon Are you sure? You said that with the testy bark of an old biddy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 amy I think we need to face the cold, hard truth, I was sexually aroused by Penny’s friend Zack.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon Hang on. I don’t know that we’ve given the alien parasite hypothesis a fair shake.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 amy Let’s look at this logically. I have a stomach, I get hungry. I have genitals, I have the potential for sexual arousal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon A cross we all must bear. You know, in difficult moments like this, I often turn to a force greater than myself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 amy Religion?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 amy No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon Don’t. It’s terrible. However, in it, we learn that when Spock finds himself drawn off the path of logic by feelings bubbling up from his human half, he suppresses them using the Vulcan mental discipline of Kolinar.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 amy Are you suggesting we live our lives guided by the philosophies found in cheap science fiction?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon Cheap science fiction?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 amy What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon Using Kolinar to suppress my anger at that last comment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 amy Is it possible that your concern for me at this moment is motivated by nothing more than simple jealousy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon I hadn’t considered that. Give me a moment. All right, I’ve considered it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 amy And?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon I reject it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 amy You reject it because you don’t feel jealousy, or because you are suppressing jealousy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon I think I’ll eat my lunch at home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 amy That’s not your lunch, Sheldon, those are the cadaver brain specimens.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon Oh. As they were incorrectly sliced, you can see how I could mistake them for my sashimi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 penny Hey. Isn’t tomorrow your usual laundry night?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon The supermarket was out of my regular fabric softener. If this one under or over-softens, I’ll need time to make things right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 penny That’s thinking ahead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon The alternative would be to think backwards. And that’s just remembering.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 penny So how’s Amy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon Amy’s changed. I might have to let her go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 penny Oh, no. Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon I thought she was a highly evolved creature of pure intellect, like me. But recent events indicate that she may be a slave to her baser urges. Like you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 penny Just going to skip over that insult.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon What insult?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 penny Yeah. That’s why I’m going to skip over it. Are you saying that Amy is, oh, what’s the
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon Forget science. She’s horny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 penny Oh! Okay. Wow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon It’s simple biology. There’s nothing I can do about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 penny Are you sure?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon What are you suggesting?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 penny I’m suggesting there might be something you could do about Amy’s urges?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon It’s illegal to spay a human being.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 penny Yeah. That’s not what I had in mind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon Oh. Oh! You mean something I could do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 penny Exactly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon Well, I was hoping to avoid this. But I might as well get it over with. Thank you, Penny. I’ll let you know what happens.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 penny Oh, Amy, you lucky girl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon Yes. This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Is this the Zack Johnson who used to have coitus with my neighbour Penny? Sorry to bother you. Hello. I’m looking for a Zack Johnson who used to have coitus with my neighbour Penny. Coitus. It means intercourse. And I have a feeling I’m speaking to the right Zack. This is Sheldon Cooper. Fine. Shelly. Yes, that does sound like a girl’s name. No, it doesn’t bother me. Yes, Smelly Shelly does bother me. Let me tell you why I’m calling. I’d like to know if you’d be interested in having sex with Amy Farrah Fowler. Amy Farrah Fowler. Yes, that is a girl’s name. Good grief. It’s like trying to talk to a dolphin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 leonard Really? This is going to decide who’s the hero and who’s the sidekick?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 howard You got a better idea?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 leonard Every idea is better than this idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 howard Ding!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 raj Wait. What the hell is ding?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 howard It’s a bell.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 raj I don’t think this kind of wrestling has a bell.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 howard Fine. How do you want to start?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 raj I say, uh, how about one, two, three, go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 howard One-two-three-go? That’s for babies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 raj Okay, how about, uh, on your mark, get set, go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 howard That’s for a footrace. If you want to race, we have to go outside.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 raj No, it’s chilly outside. Didn’t bring my jacket.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 howard Oh, for crying out loud. What kind of superhero needs a jacket?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 raj What kind of superhero says dibs on the red tights, dibs on the red tights.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 howard All right, how about this? Ready, wrestle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 raj Wait. Are we starting now? Or is that what you’re going to say when we do start, or…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 howard We’re starting now!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 raj Don’t yell at me!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 leonard Suppose there are worse ways to spend a Friday night. None come to mind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon Look at this stamp. On what authority are they permitted to mutilate patrons as they enter?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 amy I’m sure it’ll wash off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon Little comfort tonight. I look like a Hell’s Angel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 amy There’s Zack.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon Are you sure this is what you want to do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 amy It’s not what I want to do, it’s what I have to do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon Go, Amy Farrah Fowler. Follow your endocrine system.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 amy Thank you, Sheldon. You’re a good friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon Please don’t drag this out. This is never going to come off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 amy Excuse me? Zack? I am Amy Farrah Fowler. We met the other night. I have spent my life in pursuit of pure knowledge. Until I met you, my decisions were founded in logic and reason. And yet here I stand before you, 130 pounds of raging estrogen, longing to grab hold of your gluteus maximus and make Shakespeare’s metaphorical beast with two backs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 zack My gluteus what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 amy On the other hand, as I look at the blank, ape-like expression on your face, I have decided to adopt the Vulcan practice of Kolinar. Good-bye, Zack.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 zack Bye. Hoo. That should hold me for a while.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 howard I’m legally obligated to inform you that I took a karate lesson when I was 11. I’d be a regular ninja by now if my mom could’ve arranged a carpool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 raj Oh, yeah? Well, I’ve been taking Pilates class at the rec center, and my abs look like sections of a Hershey bar.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 howard Oh, yeah? Won’t matter, you’re going down!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 raj No, uh-uh, you’re going down!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 howard If anybody’s going to go down, it’s going to be you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 leonard Fellas. It’s been 30 minutes. Nobody’s touched each other.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon I’m glad you decided to reject your animal hindbrain and return to the realm of pure intellect.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 amy As am I. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 sheldon What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 amy An experiment. Nope. Nothing. Never mind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 raj You realize you can’t win.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 howard I prefer to think that I can’t lose.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 raj You’re wrong. It’s only a matter of time before you fall into Rat-Man’s rat trap.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 howard You pathetic fool! If there were a rat-catcher, wouldn’t it catch Rat-Man?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 raj Just because I didn’t express myself well doesn’t mean my underlying point was invalid! You bloviating buffoon!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 howard You narcissistic nincompoop!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode10 raj You crimson coward! Oh, Leonard, wake up, you’re missing some very excellent superhero quips.
