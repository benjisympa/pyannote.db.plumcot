TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 raj Water Demon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 howard Ice Dragon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 leonard Lesser Warlord of Ka’a.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 sheldon Not so fast. Infinite Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 leonard Infinite Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 sheldon Yes, Infinite Sheldon defeats all other cards and does not violate the rule against homemade cards because I made it at work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 leonard Do you understand why people don’t want to play with you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 sheldon No, although it’s a question I’ve been pondering since preschool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 leonard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 zack Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 leonard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 penny Hey, your copy of Science magazine was in my mailbox.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 leonard Oh, thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 penny Mm-hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 zack Check it out, all about planets this month.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 leonard That’s an atom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 zack Agree to disagree. That’s what I love about science, there’s no one right answer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 leonard So, you and Zack again, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 penny Yeah, yeah, me and Zack again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 zack Were we here earlier?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 penny Okay, we should, we should go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 zack Ah, not yet. I want to talk science with the science dudes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 howard Oh, and the science dudes want to talk science with you. What do you want to talk about, rocks, dinosaurs, our friend the beaver?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 zack You know, I saw this great thing on the Discovery Channel. Turns out that if you kill a starfish, it’ll just come back to life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 sheldon Was the starfish wearing boxer shorts? Because you might have been watching Nickelodeon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 zack No, I’m almost sure that it was the Discovery Channel. It was a great show. They also said dolphins might be smarter than people.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 leonard They might be smarter than some people.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 zack Well, maybe we can do an experiment to find out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 sheldon Oh, that’s easy enough. We’d need a large tank of water, a hoop to jump through, and a bucket of whatever bite-sized treats you find tasty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 zack I don’t get it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 leonard A dolphin might.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 zack Oh, I see. You guys are inferring that I’m stupid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 sheldon That’s not correct. We were implying it. You then inferred it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 zack Let’s go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 penny You know, for a group of guys who claim they spent most of their lives being bullied, you can be real jerks. Shame on all of you. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 raj What the hell did I do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 penny You laughed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 leonard You think Penny’s right? Were we bullying Zack?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 howard No, I know bullying. He left here unswirlied and his ass crack was underpants-free.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 raj And nobody drew a penis on his forehead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 leonard That happened to you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 raj First day of cricket camp. They drew it so the testicles were my eyes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 leonard I don’t know, I think we might owe the guy an apology.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 howard So go apologize.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 leonard Why me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 howard You started it, we just piled on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 leonard What would I even say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 sheldon Zack, I’m sorry you’re stupid. Have a Milk Dud.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 raj A Milk Dud?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 sheldon Yeah, Milk Duds, with their self-deprecating name and remarkably mild flavour, are the most apologetic of the boxed candies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 leonard I got a better idea. We’re all responsible. I say we all go. Come on, who’s with me? Free comic books to anyone who comes with me. I might get punched. You really want to miss that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 raj Junior Mints are pretty apologetic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 sheldon You’re embarrassing yourself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 sheldon Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 leonard Yeah, we came to talk to Zack. Hey, Zack.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 zack What do you want?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 leonard Listen, uh, the stuff we were saying before, we were just kidding around.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 zack No, you weren’t. You were making fun of me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 leonard Come on, that’s what we do. We give each other a hard time. Hey, Sheldon, you look like a praying mantis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 sheldon That’s very hurtful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 leonard See?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 zack I don’t know, it still wasn’t very nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 sheldon Milk Dud?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 zack Oh, I love Milk Duds. Okay, we’re cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 sheldon Junior Mints.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 zack You guys want to come in and have a beer?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 leonard Uh, we’re on our way to the comic book store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 howard Leonard’s buying.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 zack Really? I haven’t been to a comic book store in literally a million years.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 sheldon Literally? Literally a million years?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 leonard Don’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 zack You want to go with ’em?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 zack Okay, see you later.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 penny Wait, w-w-wait-wait-wait, you’re ditching me to go look at comic books?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 zack Are you mad at me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 penny I’m not happy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 zack Milk Dud?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 zack Wow, this place is awesome. Where do they keep the Archies?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 sheldon In the bedrooms of ten-year-old girls, where they belong.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 zack Oh, no, you’re thinking old-school Archie. It’s much more sophisticated now. Like, there’s two universes, and Archie’s married to Betty in one and Veronica in the other. Midge is even breaking up with Moose.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 raj No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 zack About time, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 stuart Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 zack Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 stuart You guys finally chip in for a bodyguard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 leonard Uh, no. Oh, this is Zack. He’s a friend of ours. Zack, this is Stuart. He owns the store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 zack Wow, lucky you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 stuart Yeah, I work 70 hours a week and average a dollar sixty five an hour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 zack Sweet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 stuart Is that sarcasm?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 howard Uh, no, it’s an indictment of the American education system.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 raj The Archies are over here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 zack Yippee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 stuart So are you guys coming to my New Year’s Eve costume party?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 sheldon Of course. We’re coming as the Justice League of America.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 howard Switching it up from last year when we came as the Justice League of America.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 sheldon To that point, it occurs to me that we might have an opportunity to finally snare Best Group Costume if we shore up our weak link, which is clearly Leonard as Superman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 leonard Hey, I got new boots this year. Guaranteed to add three inches.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 sheldon That’s sad. Let’s ask ourselves, is there anyone we know who would make a more manly and convincing son of Krypton?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 stuart Than than Leonard in high-heeled boots? Howard’s mother in high-heeled boots?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 sheldon I was thinking specifically of the gentleman over there moving his lips as he enjoys the latest exploits of Betty and Veronica.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 leonard Zack?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 howard He is the only person we know with actual muscles.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 leonard You can’t replace me with Zack.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 sheldon Why not? Penny did it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 howard Yeah, she seems happier. Why wouldn’t we be?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 zack Score. I got an Archie, Betty and Veronica, and a Jughead. All set for my weekend number twos.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 sheldon Congratulations. Zack, how would you like to be Superman?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 zack I don’t know, sounds like a lot of responsibility.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 leonard Fine, if Zack’s going to be Superman, I want to be Green Lantern.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 raj But I’m Green Lantern.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 leonard You can be Aquaman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 raj I don’t want to be Aquaman. He sucks. He sucks underwater. He sucks fish pee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 sheldon Excuse me, I believe Aquaman uses his telepathic powers to request the fish do their business elsewhere.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 zack Hey, babe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 penny I’m still mad at you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 zack Well, you won’t be when you hear the great news.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 penny What great news?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 zack We’re going to a costume party at the comic book store on New Year’s Eve, and you get to be Wonder Woman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 sheldon Complete with bulletproof bracelets and lasso of truth. Invisible plane sold separately.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 penny Wait, why me? Wh-Why can’t your girlfriend be Wonder Woman?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 howard She and her lab team are under quarantine. Seems at the Christmas party they were doing Jell-O shots out of petri dishes that used to contain yellow fever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 penny Okay, what about your friend Amy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 sheldon Amy Farrah Fowler doesn’t believe in wearing costumes. She isn’t the free spirit I am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 penny Okay, well, forget it. I’m not spending my New Year’s Eve at a comic book store wearing a Wonder Woman costume.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 howard He says he’ll wear it if you’ll be Aquaman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 leonard What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 sheldon We’re going to be late. I’m pacing nervously.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 leonard You’re jogging.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 sheldon This is how the Flash paces.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 sheldon I’m not Sheldon. I’m the Flash. And now I’m going to the Grand Canyon to scream in frustration. I’m back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 howard I’m Batman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 sheldon Oh, I hardly think so. The real caped crusader calls his crime-fighting cohorts when he’s running late.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 howard I had to walk. I couldn’t get Raj on the back of my scooter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 raj I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again. Aquaman sucks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 zack Look up in the sky. It’s a bird. It’s a plane. I forget the rest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 penny All right. Let’s get this thing over with.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 sheldon I’m sorry. But in what universe is Wonder Woman blonde?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 howard Relax. No one’s going to be looking at her hair. Ow! I mean, ow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 zack Hold on. The costume came with a black wig. Where is it, babe?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 penny No. I’m not wearing it. It looks stupid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 zack Come on. We’re trying to win a contest here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 penny Forget it. I’m not wearing the wig.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 zack Penny, there’s no I in Justice League.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 howard Well, actually.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 sheldon Don’t. He’s making our case.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 zack Okay, babe. Uh, kind of embarrassing me in front of my friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 penny Okay. You know what? I changed my mind. I’m not going.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 raj Looks like someone else is going to have to be Wonder Woman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 zack Babe, open up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 penny I’m not talking to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 zack Then who are you talking to? Babe?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 penny What the hell is wrong with you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 sheldon I’m the Flash. I just knocked 30,000 times.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 penny Okay. What do you want, Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 sheldon I understand why you’re upset.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 penny Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 sheldon Yes. You’re afraid that costume makes you look fat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 penny No. Wait, wait, does it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 sheldon Don’t worry. Wonder Woman was an Amazon. And Amazons tend to be very beefy gals.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 penny Good-bye, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 sheldon But they’re not blonde, so put on your wig. Hello?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 raj Stupid Aquaman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 leonard If it makes you feel any better, when I was dating Penny, she used to flip out on me all the time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 zack Whoa. You dated Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 leonard She didn’t tell you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 zack She told me she dated a guy named Leonard. Who would have thought it was you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 leonard Who else would it be?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 zack I don’t know. Somebody bigger and, yeah, sure. Why not you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 sheldon I may have failed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 howard Okay, I guess we just go without a Wonder Woman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 zack I don’t want to go without Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 raj Oh, great. No Superman, no Wonder Woman? All we’ve got is a skinny Flash, an Indian Aquaman, a nearsighted Green Lantern, and a teeny, tiny Dark Knight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 sheldon Obviously, we’re no longer a Justice League. We have no choice but to switch to our Muppet Baby costumes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 raj Ooh, I call Kermit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 sheldon I’m Kermit. You’re Scooter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 raj Oh, man. Scooter sucks. He’s the Aquaman of the Muppet Babies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 howard No, we can still make this work. Leonard, you talk to Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 leonard What makes you think I can convince her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 howard You got her to have sex with you. Obviously, your superpower is brainwashing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 leonard Okay, let me see if I understand this. You want me to convince my ex-girlfriend to go to a costume party with her new boyfriend just so we can win a stupid prize?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 sheldon Yes. And make her wear the black wig. Good luck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 penny Go away, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 leonard It’s Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 penny Oh. Go away, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 penny It’s open.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 leonard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 penny I’m not going to that party, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 leonard Okay, listen. You don’t have to wear the wig. At this party, we’re gonna win first prize just by showing up with a girl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 penny It’s not the wig.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 leonard Did I do something? I mean, I tried to be friends with Zack, like you said, which believe me, was difficult, given how you and me used to be, you know, you and me, and now you and him are you and him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 penny Okay, look. We’re not really me and him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 leonard Then what are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 penny I don’t know. I only started seeing Zack again so I wouldn’t be alone on New Year’s Eve. How pathetic is that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 leonard Not as pathetic as dressing up like this and going to a comic book store on New Year’s Eve.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 penny You make a cute Green Arrow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 leonard Green Lantern.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 penny Like there’s a difference.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 leonard There’s a big difference. Arrow. Lantern.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 penny Whatever. Look, if Zack and I had just gone to a regular club or a party, it would have been fine, but this, with the costumes, and you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 leonard What about me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 penny Nothing. Let’s go to the party. How do I look?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 leonard Um, I guarantee you’ll be the prettiest girl there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 howard Okay, the good news is, we have a Wonder Woman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 sheldon Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 zack Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 sheldon What’s the bad news?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 howard Superman probably isn’t getting laid tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 zack Aw, damn.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 stuart And the award for best group costume goes to Justice League of America number three!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 sheldon Thank you! Thank you so much!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 stuart Okay. Okay, ten seconds to midnight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 all Ten, nine, eight…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode11 sheldon No, wait! I have a speech.
