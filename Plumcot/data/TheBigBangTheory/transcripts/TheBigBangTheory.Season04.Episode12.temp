TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 howard Ma, Ma, calm down. Listen to me. I know it says click with the mouse, but on a laptop, the trackpad is the mouse. Now, put your finger on it. Doesn’t matter which finger. Good choice. Now move it down to your e-mail icon. Yeah, the little envelope. What do you mean, what does it look like? It looks like an envelope! Fine, you don’t like the computer, don’t use it! Sure, we can exchange it for a salad spinner. Good-bye!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 raj That’s a Hanukkah present you’re regretting, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon I won’t say that all senior citizens who can’t master technology should be publicly flogged, but if we made an example of one or two, it might give the others incentive to try harder.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard I had a great idea. You know how we’re always having to stop and solve differential equations, like when you’re doing Fourier analysis, or using the Schrodinger equation?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Howard doesn’t. He’s only an engineer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard I was thinking, we could write a little app that would use handwriting recognition, and then run it through a symbolic evaluation engine. You just use your smartphone, take a picture of the equation and bam!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 raj You know what’s a great app? The one that makes fart noises.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon You know, Leonard, that’s actually a valid idea. Very good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard Can you say that and not make it sound like I’m a cat who learned how to use the toilet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon No. The two achievements are equally surprising and equally admirable, though if pressed, I’d have to give a slight edge to the cat. I’ll save you the pain and nervousness of waiting for the answer. I agree to be part of your project. Congratulations.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard Oh, yay for me. What about you guys? I can’t promise anything, but people do make money off stuff like this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 howard A few extra bucks would be nice. I could finally move out of my mother’s house.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 raj Where would you go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 howard I always dreamed about building a little place of my own over the garage.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 raj You know, if I made more money, I could take time off from work and give pretty girls submarine rides.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 howard What’s that? Some weird sex thing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 raj No. You take pretty girls underwater in your private submarine, and you show them fish. Why does everything have to be dirty with you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard I was thinking we could work on this at night, and then maybe in a couple of weeks, we’ll have ourselves an app to sell.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 howard Sounds like we’re in business.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 raj I think we should take a picture to capture this moment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Oh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 raj Was that the best 99 cents I ever spent, or what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard I checked the App Store. No one is doing handwriting-recognition differential equation solving.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Oh, dear Lord, shush.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon You have so few good ideas, Leonard. And you’re just going to spill the beans in front of an outsider?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 penny Who, me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 howard Sheldon, I don’t think Penny cares about handwriting-recognition based differential…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon The stars at night are big and bright, deep in the heart of Texas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard She’s not going to steal our idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 penny What idea?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard We’re gonna write an application…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon The prairie sky is wide and high, deep in the heart…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 penny Okay, stop, stop!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Of Texas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 penny Whatever your secret is, I’m sure it’s boring, so I’m not interested.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard It’s not boring at all. You see, in higher order mathematics, there are certain sets of equations that…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 penny Bored.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard Satisfied?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Hardly. Consider this unlikely but very plausible scenario. A young woman alone in the big city. Her ridiculous dream of becoming an actress lies shattered about her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 penny Hey, wait a minute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 howard Well, hang on. Let’s see where he’s going.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Then it hits her. How is she going to survive? I mean, she has no prospects, no marketable skills. And then one day, she meets a group of geniuses and their friend Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 howard Hey, I…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 penny Hang on. Let’s see where he’s going.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon She befriends them, and then lies in wait until they reveal a marketable idea, which she steals and sells to the highest bidder.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard That is ridiculous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Oh, is it? Well let’s see you come up with an explanation as to why this woman hangs out with us all the time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 penny Oh, great. You know what? I’ve already mooched dinner off you guys. I don’t need to listen to this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 howard There’s your answer, free food.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon All right, I’ve taken the liberty of drafting these workflow charts which outline our various duties and the path we will follow as we develop our ground-breaking new app.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 raj Hey, why am I in charge of phone support? Seems a bit racist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon A customer service representative with an Indian accent will create the impression we’re a vast enterprise that uses overseas call centres.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 raj Oh. Very clever. But still racist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Duly noted, Steve from Wichita.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 howard Why am I listed as your executive assistant?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Because the word secretary has fallen into disrepute. FYI, my mother’s birthday is coming up. I’m going to need you to pick up a present.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard Okay, we need to stop for a minute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Leonard, please, we can talk during our break. We have one coming up at midnight. We’ll need snacks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard Sheldon, you’re not in charge. It’s my idea. I’m in charge.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Oh, of course you are. Look at the organizational chart. You’re clearly listed as founder.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard Well, yes, and you’re listed as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon You missed Chief Science Officer, Chairman of the Board, and Head of the Secret Santa Committee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard Okay. You need to get clear on this right now. I am in charge of this project.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 raj Ooh. Leonard’s going all alpha nerd on Sheldon’s ass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon All right. All right, I’m not going to argue with you. Sheldon Cooper is nothing if not a team player. Dr. Hofstadter, you have the conn.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard Thank you. I thought we might start by talking about the user interface.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Oh, dear Lord, we’re doomed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard So this button here will allow you to scan a new equation, but over here, you can press this, and just substitute new values for the coefficients.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Good one, boss.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon This diagram. I assume you were opening with a joke. It certainly buoyed up this employee’s esprit de corps.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard It’s not a joke. It’s the real design.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon In that case, may I offer 27 little tweaks to make it slightly less embarrassing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard Sheldon, I think this will work. Let’s just try it my way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Oh, I’m, I’m sorry. I assumed that you wanted candid truth-telling from your employees, but I realize now, you want the mindless nattering of complacent yes-men.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard Are you done?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon If you say so, boss.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 howard So right now, this button-press event is just triggering a dummy procedure call…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon How about this for the app name? The Surprisingly Helpful Equation-Linked Differential Optimized Numerator.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 raj So it spells Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Does it? A happy accident.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard We’re not doing names now. Howard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 howard Like I was saying, right now it’s just a dummy procedure, but eventually, it will drop us into…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon All right, fine. If we’re not going to give it a name, can we at least give it a secret code designation?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Well, but hear me out. The atomic bomb was The Manhattan Project. Windows 95 was originally Project Chicago. For our app, I would humbly suggest Project Nodlehs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard That’s just Sheldon backwards.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Another happy accident.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard We’re not wasting time with names right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon I see. Is that decision open for discussion?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Is the decision to not discuss it open for discussion?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 howard Again, right now it’s just a dummy procedure, but eventually, it will drop us into…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon I call for a vote of no confidence and an immediate change in leadership.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard Oh Sheldon, stop it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary to dissolve the bonds that tie three competent scientists together…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard That’s enough, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon All right, let’s get right to the vote. Show of hands all those opposed to Leonard and his reign of tyranny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard Okay, that’s it, you’re fired.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Really? Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard Because you’re impossible to work with.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon I see. And is that open for discussion?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Oh. Good morning, shoemaker. I think you’ll be pleased with what the elves were up to last night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard But I fired you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Oh, I know. I’m now an independent contractor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard No, you are now nothing. You have no connection to this project whatsoever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon But I made it better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard I don’t want it better. I want it my way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Well, that speaks volumes, doesn’t it? All right, I suppose I’ll go put on my bus pants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard What the hell are bus pants?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon They are pants one wears over one’s regular pants when one sits on bus seats that other people have previously sat on. But perhaps from your lofty heights atop the corporate ladder, you’ve lost touch with the struggles of the common man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard Look, I’m still happy to drive you to work. Nothing’s changed in that regard. We’re still roommates, we’re still friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Except you identified me, your best friend, as a gangrenous limb that needed to be severed from the organism and tossed away. The desperate act of a little man with a big Napoleon complex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard You know what? Go put on your bus pants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 raj Mm. Last night, I had a dream we got so rich from the app, you and I bought matching side-by-side mansions. But there was a secret tunnel connecting your front yard to my back yard. What do you think that means?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 howard It means after we play handball, I’m showering at home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Good morning, Friend Howard. Friend Raj. I see you gentlemen are enjoying beverages. Perhaps they would taste better out of these.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 raj World’s Greatest Astrophysicist?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Don’t thank me. You earned it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 howard Howard Wolowitz. Why not World’s Greatest Engineer?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon I’m sorry. I typed that into the label maker, but I just couldn’t press enter. Now down to business. What would it take for you to abandon Leonard and join me in a rival company? Unless, of course, the mugs are sufficient, in which case, welcome aboard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 howard We’re not quitting on Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon I understand. And your loyalty is admirable. But what if I were to up the ante?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 raj What are you talking about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Monogrammed key chains with a built-in laser pointer. No? How about can cosies emblazoned with our university mascot? Go, Beavers. I’ll be back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 howard Okay, let’s try this one. Spherical Hankel function.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard Hold on. That’s it!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 howard Eureka!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 raj Hey, we agreed when it was Eureka time, we were all gonna say it together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 howard Fine. Let’s say it together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 raj No. The moment has passed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Greetings, gentlemen. How goes your little project?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 raj You mean, Project Lenwoloppali?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Ah, a combination of all your names. Very clever. I assume Koothranardowitz was taken?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard We’re actually scanning equations and getting good results.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Oh, well then, by all means, carry on. I wouldn’t want to impede your progress.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard Howard, did you solve the install time problem yet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 howard No. It’s a little tricky. I’m gonna try having it pick up the libraries dynam…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard What are you doing?!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Playing the theremin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard No. I mean, what are you doing with a theremin?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Playing it. I’ve loved the theremin from the first moment I heard the original Star Trek theme. And it’s been killing me that it just sits in my closet, gathering dust.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard Sheldon! We’re working here!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon That’s all right. I can barely hear you over my theremin. Well, that was a little uncalled for.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard No, that was completely called for. We need quiet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon So, your project is more important than mine?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard Well, seeing as your project is to sabotage my project, yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Don’t beat around the bush, Leonard. If you don’t want me here, just say the word, and I’ll leave.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Could have beaten around the bush a little.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Nobody knows the trouble I’ve seen, nobody knows my sorrow-ow-ow-ow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 penny What you doing? Trying to contact your home planet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon I’m practicing my theremin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 penny Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Nobody knows the trouble I’ve seen. Glory, hallelujah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 penny Something got you down, there, Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Leonard kicked me out of my own apartment. And his app team.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 penny Oh, honey, I’m sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon He wouldn’t drive me to work today. I had to wear my bus pants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 penny Is that so?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Yes. And they’re still sticky.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 penny Aw.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Probably going to have to throw them away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 penny Hey, you don’t need Leonard and his app. You can make one with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon With you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 penny Seriously, I have a great idea for one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Is it better than your idea to move to Los Angeles and become a famous actress?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 penny Okay, look, when you see someone wearing shoes you like, you just snap a picture of them, and the app goes on the Internet to find out where you can buy them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon That’s your app idea?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 penny Well, you don’t like it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon I didn’t say that. But no, I don’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 penny Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Oh, Penny, where do I begin? The simple-mindedness of your idea is exceeded only by its crass consumerism and banality.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 penny And Leonard didn’t want to work with you? Imagine that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon I know, it’s baffling. Nobody knows the trouble I’ve seen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 penny Sheldon, I’m gonna make some cocoa. Do you want some?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Do you make it with milk or water?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 penny Milk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Real cocoa?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 penny That’s what it says on the packet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Do you have those little marshmallows?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 penny No, sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Well, I suppose it’s appropriate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 penny What does that mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon A disappointing drink for a disappointing day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 raj Hey, look at this. 20 people from the university have already signed up for our private beta.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard I’m telling you, the Lenwoloppali Differential Equation Scanner meets a real need. We’ve got a hit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 raj What do you think we should sell it for?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 howard Well, based on the fact that our potential market is about 70 or 80 guys, and you want a submarine, I’d say about a million dollars a pop.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 raj Well, what if we put out a lite version for half a million? You know, get the word of mouth going.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 penny Hi. I’m sorry to bother you guys, but you’ve got to come take your Sheldon back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard What’s he doing in your apartment?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 penny Well, he was moping down in the lobby, so I invited him over, and now I regret it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard Why do you regret, uh, never mind, stupid question.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 penny Look, can’t you just let him play with you until bedtime?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard We’re not playing. This is real work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 howard We’re going to be hundred-aires.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 penny Okay. What if I got him to apologize and promise to behave?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard Then I guess we would let him back on the app team, and while we’re doing that, you could take an aerial tour of L.A. on your flying pig.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 penny Okay. Wait right here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 raj I’ll tell you one thing. If I get rich enough, that’s the kind of girl I want to take on a submarine ride. And yes, that time, I meant it to be dirty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Really? Leonard wants me back?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 penny Oh, yes. He says they are lost without you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Well, we sure saw that coming.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 penny That’s right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon You know what I’m going to do? I am going to sit here and just let them stew.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 penny No, no, no. You know, they have suffered enough. Everybody’s suffered enough. The thing is, you’re going to have to offer him a face-saving way out of this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon How?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 penny Say you’re sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Oh, no. Mrs. Mary Cooper didn’t raise her no liars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 penny Okay. Um, how about this? You know how you’re always trying to learn about sarcasm?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 penny No?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon I was being sarcastic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 penny Oh. Good for you. So all you have to do here is say you’re sorry to Leonard, but say it sarcastically.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Of course. He will hear it as an attempt to mend fences, as opposed to the withering condemnation you and I will know it to be.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 penny Yeah. Yeah, that was my plan. All right. Come on. Let’s go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Oh, by the way, thank you for the delicious cocoa.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 penny Oh, you’re welcome.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Boy, I’m getting good at this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard Okay, now that you’re back on the team, let’s get you caught up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Before you begin, let me say again how deeply sorry I am for my earlier behaviour and how much I respect and admire your leadership.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard Thank you. So as you can see, not only can you store your favourite equations, but you can forward them to your friends or post them on Facebook right from the app.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Well, I must say, I am impressed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 leonard Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon You all have clearly put in a lot of hard work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 howard We have.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon As a result, you have taken the most important step on the road to success, learning what not to do. Now, let’s start fresh. Howard, we’re going to need some tea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 penny Okay, these are Uggs. These are Crocs. These are knockoff Manolo Blahniks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Bored.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 penny Look, you said it yourself, we have to create a database before you can write an alga-thingy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Algorithm. You see, Penny, Alan Turing defined an algorithm…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 penny Bored. Okay. These are Steve Maddens. These are Nine West. These are Target. Oh, but don’t they look like Chanel? These are Michael Kors. These are Roxy. These are Sachel’s. Oh, these are Betsy Johnson, they’re so cute…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode12 sheldon Nobody knows the trouble I’ve seen, nobody knows my sorrow…
