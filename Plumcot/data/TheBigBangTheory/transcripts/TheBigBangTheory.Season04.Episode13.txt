TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny Hey. So you guys ready to order?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Since we come in every Tuesday night at six o’clock and order the same exact thing, and it’s now six oh eight, I believe your question not only answers itself but also stands alongside such other nonsensical queries as who let the dogs out? and, uh, How are they hanging?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny Okay. So, the usual, with extra spit on Sheldon’s hamburger.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Penny, a moment? Do you have plans this weekend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny Oh, gee, Amy, I’m sorry, I’m actually pretty busy this weekend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Probably serving food that was ordered today.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler That’s too bad. I was hoping you could be my plus-one at the Institute of Interdisciplinary Studies’ symposium on the impact of current scientific research on societal interactions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny The what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter It’s an annual science conference. We’ve all been invited to speak.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny Oh. Oh, okay, well, you know, like I said, I have plans, so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Shame. Since you’re my best friend, I thought it would be a good bonding opportunity.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny I’m your best friend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Don’t you read my blog?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny Oh, don’t feel bad. I never read Leonard’s, and I used to sleep with him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Do you know anybody else who would appreciate an all-expense-paid spa weekend at a four-star resort in Big Sur?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny No, I really, I’m sorry, free what? Sorry, what, what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter I think her weekend just opened up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny Wait, wait, just to be clear, when you guys say spa, does that mean the same thing as when regular people say it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Pretty much. Except we keep our shirts on in the sauna.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny You know, it is going to be difficult, but I’m going to cancel my plans so I can do this for my bestie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Please don’t touch my breasts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny I, I wasn’t going to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler All right. I just want to establish boundaries.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny Boy, this is great. I haven’t had a vacation in ages.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 sheldon_cooper In order to take a vacation, one first has to work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny You know, for a smart guy, you really seem to have a hard time grasping the concept, don’t piss off the people who handle the things you eat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler That does seem to be a valid principle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 sheldon_cooper I trust Penny will adhere to the Official California Restaurant Workers’ Solemn Oath of Ethics and Cleanliness.”
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler I don’t believe there’s any such thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 sheldon_cooper You lied to me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Good morning. If I could have everyone’s attention, please? I know we’re all eager to get on the road to Big Sur, so if we focus, I’m sure we can get through this orientation in under a half an hour. Then it’s just Q&A, quiz, safety drills, pose for commemorative group photo and we’re off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Don’t worry. Just sit next to me during the quiz, and you can copy my answers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Raj? What are you doing? I don’t think so. You’ve had your allotted six ounces. The first bathroom break isn’t until the Denny’s located near Bakersfield, which is approximately two and half hours away. Remember, people, we’re only as strong as our weakest bladder.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Nobody cares about your Kegel exercises.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 sheldon_cooper All right. We have seven people, and two cars. In the lead car, driven by Leonard, will be myself, Amy Farrah Fowler and Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Yes! He had you in the other car, but I got you upgraded.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny Yay!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 sheldon_cooper She made the case that if we break down in the middle of nowhere, your Nebraska backwoods skills and brawny hands will give us the best chance to survive in the wild.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny Brawny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter They’re bigger than mine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Red Leader to Red Five, come in. Red Leader to Red Five, come in. Howard, you promised.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Fine. Red Five to Red Leader. What do you want now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 sheldon_cooper It’s eleven fifteen. I’m requesting your quarter-hourly location update.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Still right behind you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Copy that, Red Five. Radio contact is sufficient. No need to extend your middle finger.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny So, Amy, I’ve been wondering, are you and Sheldon going to be sharing a room?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler No, we discussed it. We decided we didn’t want to jeopardize our relationship by getting to know each other too well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Indeed. Nothing sours a friendship more than over-familiarity with someone’s toilet routine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter I can vouch for that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Not you, him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny Oh. Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Although yours was an eye-opener.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Don’t worry, Penny. You’re my plus-one. You’ll bunk with me. And FYI, travel makes me constipated, so I’m the ideal hotel roommate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny Terrific. Are we there yet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski I hope we get there in time to see the keynote address.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Really? You want to see the keynote?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Actually, I was thinking we could go straight to the room and take a nap.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski Really? And miss the keynote?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 howard_wolowitz We can watch it later on C-SPAN. Besides, I was really looking forward to you and me napping together in the hotel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski Well honey, if you’re that tired, why don’t you just take a nap here in the car?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 howard_wolowitz No, see, it’s not…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski Hang on. It’s Leonard. Hi, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, hi. Listen, I just got a text from Raj. He wanted me to tell you that when Howard says nap, he means sex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh. Thank you, Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Are you an element in the actinoid series?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 sheldon_cooper No. Amy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Are you usually radioactive when found in nature?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 sheldon_cooper No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Are you in the lanthanoid series?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Amy, it’s Penny’s turn. Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny Uh, I don’t know. Are you food?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 sheldon_cooper That’s not apropos. We’ve already established I’m found in the periodic table.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny Well, it’s a table, right? I mean, why can’t there be food on it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 sheldon_cooper I knew she wasn’t lead car material.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny Who elected you Road Trip God?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter It was a late-night vote. We were all exhausted, and he was threatening to filibuster. It’s not technically Road Trip God, it’s Travel Supervisor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Although Road Trip God does have a certain ring to it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny I don’t understand why you people just let him bully you like this. Someone should stand up to him. What’s he going to do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny I can’t believe you let him kick me out of the car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 howard_wolowitz What could we do? He’s the Travel Supervisor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski Don’t worry, Penny. This is a better car anyway.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Yeah. It’s the Love Car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny Should I ask?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski They say we’re young and we don’t know, we won’t find out until we grow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Well, I don’t know if all that’s true, ’cause you got me, and, baby, I got you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 together#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 Babe, mm da-da, da-da, da-da, I got you, babe, da-da, da-da, da-da, I got you, babe…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny Red Leader, I’m really sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski@howard_wolowitz I got you, babe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler I missed you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny You know what? I missed you, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 very_tall_and_powerfully_built_man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 Bernadette?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, my God, Glenn!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 glenn Great to see you!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski Are you here for the conference?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 glenn Yeah, I’m doing a global warming panel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, good for you. Uh, Glenn, this is my boyfriend Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 glenn Oh. Nice to meet you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Hi. Ow. Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 glenn You’re a lucky man. Bernie’s a great gal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Yes. Bernie sure is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski I’ll try to catch it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 glenn Oh, great. Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Hey, Bernie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Please tell me he’s your gay cousin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski No. He was one of my professors in college.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Oh! That’s a relief.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski Then we went out for a year. Come on, let’s check in, so we can take that nap.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 howard_wolowitz No, it’s not necessarily proportional. Shut up!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 howard_wolowitz That green bag is Dr. Cooper’s. Here’s an extra five. Make him wait. Oh. Right to the nap, huh? Okay? Uh, so, this Glenn guy. You say you went out with him for, like, a year.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski Do we really need to talk about my old boyfriend now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 howard_wolowitz No. I guess not. What is he, like, six-four, six-five?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski Six-seven.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Probably has a hard time finding a suit that fits.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski Is something bothering you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 howard_wolowitz No. It’s just…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 howard_wolowitz I’m just thinking. If you had sex with that guy, I mean, there’s nothing I can do here that will make any kind of impact.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski Howard, it’s not a contest. I love you. I want to be with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Yeah, great, love you, too, but, if it were a contest, I wouldn’t have a chance, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski You can’t think that way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Yep. Loser.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski Howard, stop it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Sorry. I just never figured that a guy like me going out with a girl like you would ever have to compete with a guy like that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski Wait a minute, a girl like me? What’s that mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 howard_wolowitz I’m… I…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski Are you saying you don’t think I’m hot enough to go out with a guy like Glenn?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 howard_wolowitz No! No, I’m saying exactly the opposite.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski I’m too hot to go out with a guy like Glenn?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Yeah, let’s go with that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Still nothing. Remind me to try again in an hour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny Will do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler So, girl talk?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny Um, sure. What do you, what do you got in mind?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Do you subscribe to the Freudian theory of penis envy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny Um, I never really thought about it. Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Sometimes I think it might be nice to have one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Not for sex, for convenience. You can’t deny that, by comparison, our internal plumbing is extremely high maintenance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny Again, I’ve never given it much thought.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler We have time now. Think about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny Oh, good. Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski Can I stay here tonight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny Yeah. Why, what happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski Howard’s a complete and total ass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny Oh, yeah, that. Come on in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski Thanks. I’ll sleep on the floor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Not necessary. Penny and I are perfectly comfortable sharing a bed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny We are?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Of course, we’re best friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny Oh, right, right, the blog.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Word of warning, though. I’m prone to night terrors, so if I wake up kicking and screaming, don’t panic. Just pin me down and stroke my hair, and I’ll be fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny Hey, can I stay here tonight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Shh-shh-shh-shh. Sheldon’s asleep. What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny Well, Howard’s a complete and total ass, Bernadette’s in my bed, and no matter how much you stroke Amy’s hair, she bites.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny Never mind. Can I stay here or not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Uh, sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter So, how do you wanna do this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny Well, I’m not getting in bed with him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, it is a little like getting into Dracula’s coffin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny We’re just gonna have to make the best of this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Okay, when you say make the best of it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny Sleep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Right. So we’ll just call the middle here the Neutral Zone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny The what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Star Trek. You know, the Neutral Zone between the Federation and the Romulan Empire.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny Oh, okay. Just like old times.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Of course, sometimes the Federation and the Romulans would enter the Neutral Zone to negotiate a temporary truce.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny Sweetie, let me put this in a way you’ll understand. From the waist down, my shields are up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Got it, got it. We can do all kinds of stuff from the waist up, you know?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny Go to sleep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Please tell me you’re not having coitus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny We are not having coitus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Can you guarantee that it won’t happen at any time during the night?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 announcer Next on Turner Classic Movies, Bridget Jones’s Diary.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 raj_koothrappali Oh, my God, I’m crying already.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Raj? Raj? Raj? I need to sleep here tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 raj_koothrappali Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Howard is a complete and total ass, Bernadette is in Penny’s bed, Amy bites, and Penny may or may not have coitus with Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 raj_koothrappali Okay. Come on in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny Leonard, are you asleep?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny I really appreciate you letting me stay here tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Sure, no problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny I know it’s kinda weird.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter True dat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny True dat?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter I’ve gotten a lot more street since we broke up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny Right. Still mad at me about that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter No. No, I understand. I got too intense, you had to back off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter I’ve gotten a lot better at that, you know. I’ve dated four different women since we broke up and I didn’t tell any of them that I loved them and wanted to have their babies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny Good for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Okay, good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny Good night. You know, maybe it wouldn’t be the worst idea in the world to violate the Neutral Zone for just one night. Oh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 raj_koothrappali Hey, Leonard, Sheldon kicked me out of the room, gave me your key.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Penny’s here. No, we don’t want to watch Bridget Jones’s Diary!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Good morning and welcome to Science and Society. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, BS, MS, MA, PhD, and ScD. OMG, right? Perhaps that joke was a little too hippie-dippy for this crowd. All right then, we’ll begin with opening remarks. Miss Rostenkowski, would you like to start us off by discussing your assessment of science’s responsibility to society?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski Sure. I think all branches of science have to move cautiously these days. It’s not just giant nuclear weapons that can destroy the world. As a microbiologist, I can tell you even the tiniest organisms can still tear you a new one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Interesting. I think what you might need to know about my colleague is that though she claims her field of interest tiny organisms, she certainly has spent her fair share of time around what we can assume was pretty massive weaponry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski I think Mr. Wolowitz needs to keep in mind that the past is the past. But he should know that I am the kind of girl who could get all the giant missiles she wants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Are we talking about women wanting penises? Because I’d like to weigh in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Dr. Koothrappali, would you care to join the conversation?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 raj_koothrappali Certainly. I’d like to raise two points. Number one, I think they are talking about penises. And number two, these mimosas are kicking my little brown ass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter I’d like to kick your little brown ass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 raj_koothrappali What did I do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Oh, I don’t know. Maybe when you walk into a hotel room and you see a guy getting back together with his girlfriend, you should consider doing something other than crawling into the adjoining bed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 raj_koothrappali I did. You said no Bridget Jones.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny We weren’t getting back together! It was a one-time thing!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Excuse me. We’re not taking comments or questions from the audience just yet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny Oh, shut up, Sheldon!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Hi, bestie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny Yeah, hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 sheldon_cooper All right, why don’t we see if we can bring this back to topic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Let me ask you something, Bernie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 sheldon_cooper I guess not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 howard_wolowitz How would you feel if you met my ex-girlfriend and she was like Angelina Jolie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, come on, Howard, be realistic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 howard_wolowitz What, I’m not hot enough for Angelina Jolie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 raj_koothrappali I’d like to weigh in here. No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 sheldon_cooper All right, why don’t we open it up to Q&A from the audience?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 penny Yeah, I have a question. Is there anybody who can get me the hell out of here and back to Los Angeles tonight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 glenn I’m driving back to L.A. tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski Um, Penny, that’s Glenn. Glenn, that’s Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter No!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Red Leader to Red Five. Red Leader to Red Five. Anybody up for a little game? I spy with my little eye, a nonferrous metal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Must be out of range.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Leonard, can I ask you a question?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Are you bothered by the fact that your former girlfriend left the symposium with what is probably the most beautiful man I’ve ever seen in my life?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter No. Why do you ask?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Because we’re going 120 miles per hour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode13 sheldon_cooper All right, if no one’s going to guess, I was spying the aluminium rims on the police car we passed a few miles back.
