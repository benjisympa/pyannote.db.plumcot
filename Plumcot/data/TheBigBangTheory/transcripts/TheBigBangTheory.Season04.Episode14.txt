TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Good evening. I’m your guest lecturer, Dr. Sheldon Cooper. I was expecting applause, but I suppose stunned silence is equally appropriate. I agreed to speak to you this evening, because I was told that you’re the best and the brightest of this university’s doctoral candidates. Hmm. Of course, that’s like saying you are the most important electron in a hydrogen atom. ‘Cause, you see, there’s only one electron in a hydrogen atom. Best and brightest, my sweet patootie. All right, let’s begin. Show of hands, who here is familiar with the concept of topological insulators? Don’t kid yourselves.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter I found another tweet from a student at Sheldon’s lecture. Dr. Cooper has taken a relatively boring subject and managed to make it completely insufferable. Plus, he looks like a giant insect.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 howard_wolowitz Look. Listen to this one. Does Einstein’s theory explain why time flies when you’re having fun, but when you’re listening to Dr. Cooper, it falls out of the sky, dead?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Ooh, somebody took pictures and uploaded them to their Flickr account.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Wow. How do you get an entire lecture hall to flip you off at the same time?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 howard_wolowitz Apparently, if you’re Sheldon, all you need to do is turn your back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny Hey, Leonard, is your wi-fi down? I can’t get on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Oh, Sheldon changed the password. It’s now Penny is a freeloader. No spaces.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny Thanks. What are you guys doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon gave a lecture at the university tonight. We’re reading the reviews.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny Oh. How’d he do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 howard_wolowitz Well, picture the Hindenburg meets Chernobyl meets Three Mile Island meets Tron 2.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny That bad, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Read this woman’s tweet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny Listening to Dr. Cooper has made me want to start cutting myself again
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Good evening, Leonard, Howard, Raj, freeloader.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 howard_wolowitz So, how’d the lecture go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter In a word, triumphant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Really? Triumphant?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Oh, yes, you should have seen those young people. Thirsty for knowledge, drinking in my wisdom. I may have changed a few lives today.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny Oh, please let me tell him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter I don’t know, I kind of promised Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Tell me what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 howard_wolowitz Actually, we should all share the moment. Raj, if you would.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Oh, tweets about my lecture. Hmm. That’s rather unfair. That’s downright cruel. Plus, insects have six legs. Yeah, I’m not familiar with the acronym KMN.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Oh, uh, from the context, we think it means kill me now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Well, I suppose everyone’s entitled to their own opinion. I think I’ll turn in. I didn’t want to teach those poopy heads, anyway.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 howard_wolowitz FYI, I think that’s what Darth Vader said just before he started building the Death Star.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 howard_wolowitz Sheldon still moping?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, it’s weird. Even though he didn’t want to give the lecture in the first place, being rejected by those students really hit him hard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Mmm, I know the feeling. It’s like accidentally walking into a gay bar and then having no one hit on you. It-It happened to a friend of mine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski Are you guys doing okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 howard_wolowitz Yeah, Leonard and I are fine, but I think Raj needs to meet a girl really soon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski Well, that shouldn’t be too hard. He’s such a cutie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Thank you, but cute is for bunnies. I want to be something with sex appeal, like, like a labradoodle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 howard_wolowitz Labradoodle?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter We might be starting to zero in on your problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski Don’t you listen to them. You’ve got plenty of sex appeal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 raj_koothrappali You really think so?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah. You’re a hottie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Well, thanks, Bernadette. And just for the record, labradoodles are hypo-allergenic, which is a very sexy quality to those troubled by animal dander.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler So, what do you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper It’s a charming illusion, but it does not cheer me up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler Not even when I do this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler Well, that was the last arrow in my quiver of whimsy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Do you realize that teaching is the first thing I’ve failed at since my ill-fated attempt to complete a chin-up in March of 1989?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler If this humiliating experience is really troubling you, there are things we could do about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper For instance?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler Well, the first thing that comes to mind is isolating the part of your brain where the memory is stored and destroying it with a laser.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Hmm, no. One slip of the hand, and suddenly I’m sitting in the Engineering Department, building doodads with Wolowitz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler All right. Have you considered improving your socialization skills, thus allowing you to communicate more effectively with other people?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Isn’t that their burden? I’m the one with something interesting to say.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler Fair enough, but in its essence, teaching is a performance art. In the classroom paradigm, the teacher has the responsibility to communicate, as well as entertain and engage.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper I sense that you’re trying to slow-walk me to an epiphany. Would you mind very much jumping to it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler Perhaps you should consider taking acting lessons.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Acting lessons. Interesting. It might help if I could act as though I care about my students and whether or not they learn.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Penny. Penny. Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper You’re an actress, correct?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny I’m not an actress. I’m an actress.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper All right. You’re an actress. I need you to teach me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny You want an acting lesson?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Perhaps two. I’d like to master the craft.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny Okay, where is this coming from?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper It has been suggested to me that acting techniques could improve my lecturing, at which, if certain tweets and blogs are to be believed, I suck the big one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny Yeah, I saw those. They were funny. I printed a few out and put ’em on my fridge.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper So, when could we start?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny Okay, just to be clear. You are asking me for help because I know something that the brilliant Dr. Sheldon Cooper doesn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper I suppose that’s one way to look at it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny I think it’s the only way to look at it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Are you going to help me or not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny Probably. I’m just enjoying the foreplay. Does this mean you are done mocking my acting career?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Oh, I’m sorry, I thought making the transition from actor to acting teacher was the signal that one’s career had reached the end of the road.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny Forget it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper I’ll pay you 40 dollars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny Saturday, nine a.m. Bring cash.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 howard_wolowitz Raj, I have amazing news!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 raj_koothrappali What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 howard_wolowitz I just got offered a fellowship at the Weitzmann Institute in Israel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Dude, that’s incredible!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 howard_wolowitz I know. The only thing is, I’m gonna be gone for two years.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Aw, I’m gonna miss you. Are you going with him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski I have to stay here for school.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 howard_wolowitz That’s what we’re here to talk to you about. You see, Bernadette has needs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 raj_koothrappali What kind of needs?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 howard_wolowitz Sexual needs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski Most of them regular, some of them kind of messed up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 howard_wolowitz So, while I’m gone, you’re going to have to satisfy her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski What do you say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 raj_koothrappali I say okey-dokey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 howard_wolowitz What ya thinking so hard about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Just that I’m definitely not gay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Penny. Penny. Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny What’s wrong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Nothing. I was acting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny You were acting?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Yes. In preparation for today’s studies, I read Stanislavski’s An Actor Prepares, Stella Adler’s
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny Well, good for you. Come on in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper How shall we begin?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny Well, I thought we’d start with some basic movement exercises. You know, get our bodies warmed up a little.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny So I just want you to relax and kind of move around in the space. You know, just do whatever feels natural. Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper You said to do whatever feels natural. This feels natural. Certainly more natural than what you’re doing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny Come on, you got to work with me. We need to get connected with our bodies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Penny, my body and I have a relationship that works best when we maintain a cool, wary distance from each other.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny All right, let’s just say we’ve warmed up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper You’re the teacher.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny Okay. One of the things that might help you in connecting with your students is being a little more spontaneous. So why don’t we try some improvisation?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Why not? It seems like you’re improvising your entire curriculum.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny This is all about listening and responding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Gotcha.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny I’m going to create a character and a situation, and you just jump in when you feel it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Action.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny Okay, it’s not a movie. It’s improv. So no one calls action.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Hey, you taught me something. Who would have thought it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny Okay. Uh, no, the shipment has not arrived, and I really need those shoes. They are my biggest seller. Yes, ladies sizes six through ten. Thank you. Oh, sorry, I have to go, I have a customer. Bye-bye. Hi. Can I help you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper I’d like a frozen yogurt, please.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny Yogurt?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny Um, okay, sure. Luckily, we sell both shoes and yogurt here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper You do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny Yes. Look up at the sign, and remember, improv is always about saying yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper All right. Yes. I see a sign. It says Camarillo State Mental Hospital.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper It’s the only explanation I can come up with for why you think you sell shoes and yogurt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny Okay, you know what? Let’s just try a different improv. Uh, oh, this time we will be two winos living under a freeway overpass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Oh, and we’re going to use props?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny You bet. I had dreams, you know. I was gonna be famous. Show everybody back home I could be someone. Now look at me. Want some?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper You have any frozen yogurt?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter I’m still not adjusted to how the SyFy channel spells their name now. S-Y-F-Y. That’s siffy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Uh-huh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Hello? Oh, my God! Is he okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 raj_koothrappali What happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Hang on. Hang on. Uh-huh. Okay, thank you. Howard was on his scooter, and got hit by a truck. He’s in critical condition.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Oh, no!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski Did you hear? Isn’t it terrible?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Have you seen him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski They wouldn’t let me in. Oh my Howie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter It’ll be okay. It’ll be okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 raj_koothrappali It’ll be okay. It’ll be okay. It’s Howard. Howard, hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 howard_wolowitz Raj, is that you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Yeah, I’m right here, buddy. How are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 howard_wolowitz Shh, shh. Listen to me. I’m not gonna make it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 raj_koothrappali No, no, no, don’t say that. You’re going to be all right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 howard_wolowitz Raj, I don’t have time. Now, pay attention. My last wish is that you look after Bernadette.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Of course, of course. Now when you say look after, you mean…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski Sexually.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Excuse me, Bernadette. I have to hear it from him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 howard_wolowitz Sexually.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Got it. Take care. I guess I have no choice but to make sweet, guilt-free love to you over and over again for the rest of my life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski That’s how I heard it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Or it could be sy-fee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 raj_koothrappali What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter S-Y-F-Y. Sy-fee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Oh, right. Good one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny So, did you get a chance to go over the scene I gave you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Yes. I didn’t care for it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny Okay, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is an American classic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper So is the McRib sandwich. I don’t care for that, either.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny Fine. What would you rather do as a scene study?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper I’m glad you asked. I took the liberty of adapting a Star Trek fan fiction novella I wrote when I was ten into a one-act play.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny And you think it’s better than Tennessee Williams?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Why don’t we leave that for future generations to decide?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny Where No Sheldon Has Gone Before.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper It’s the story of a young boy who is transported from the ignorant backwoods of East Texas to the 23rd Century, where his genius is not only appreciated, but celebrated.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny KMN.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Now, in this pivotal scene, Sheldon’s mother, played by you, argues with an emissary of the United Federation of Planets, Mr. Spock, the role I will bring to life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny Okay, that’s fine, but let’s try and get you out of your comfort zone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Why would we want to do that? It’s called the comfort zone for a reason.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny Okay, the whole point of this is to loosen you up a little, so I’m thinking you’ll play the role of your mother, and I will bring life to Mr. Spock.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper I’m sorry. You’ll be Spock?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny It’s only logical.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Very well. I’ll set the scene.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper East Texas. A warm summer night. A woman, Mary, stands on a porch. In the distance, we hear a lonesome train whistle. Woo-woo. The droning buzz of cicadas. Zzzzzzzzz. A coyote howls at the moon, frightening sensitive young boys everywhere. Aw-aw-aw! Out in the woods, an owl screeches.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny Okay, okay. We get it. You set the scene.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Hoo!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny Now just read your mother’s line.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Shelly! Shelly, how many times have I told you not to leave your sciencey stuff out on the porch? Goodness, I’ll never understand that boy. But then again, I’m a religious nut, and my mind is closed to so many things.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo. Spock to Enterprise. Transport successful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Glory be to Heaven, some sort of creature just manifested out of thin air. George, put down that Pepsi can full of bourbon that ain’t foolin’ no one, and get your shotgun!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny Greetings, Mary Cooper. I am Spock.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper I’m sorry. I just don’t buy it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny Just keep going!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Oh, my, your sudden appearance startles me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny We have been monitoring your son Sheldon from the 23rd Century, and we have determined that he is now ready to join us. His unique genius is our best hope for bringing peace to a vast and troubled galaxy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper I understand. Oh, Shelly? A man’s here to take you away to the future! Be sure to pack clean underwear.”
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny Okay, okay, let’s try that last line again, and this time, maybe try choking up a little.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny Well, you’re losing your son.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Yes, but he’s going to a better place where he won’t get beat up. So much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny All right, come on, just try it my way. Pretend you’re sad to see him go. I’m gonna lead you in. His unique genius is our best hope for bringing peace to a vast and troubled galaxy. That’s your cue.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper I’m sorry. I just love that line. Even the way you do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny All right, come on, come on. Put some real emotion into it. Blah-blah, blah, blah, vast and troubled galaxy. Go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Oh, Shelly? A man’s here to take you away to the future. Be sure to pack clean underwear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny That’s good. That’s good. That’s good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Mommy, why are you crying? ‘Cause I’m gonna miss you, Shelly-bean, even though you creep the bejeezus out of me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny Okay, I guess we’re improvising now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Well I’m sorry. It’s not my fault. I’m just incredibly smart, and everyone around here is dumber than a bag of rocks. Oh, now, don’t you start crying. You get in that spaceship. Mommy’s late for Indian bingo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 penny Mrs. Cooper, hey, it’s Penny. Yeah, I think I broke your son. Hey, hold on. Talk to your mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Mommy, I love you. Don’t let Spock take me to the future!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski Okay, Raj, I know you’ve been avoiding me and Howard, and I’m not leaving until you tell me what’s going on inside that little head of yours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Like the wild elephant I am trumpeting my love for you!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski Like a hidden flower my sweet fragrance comes into view!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 raj_koothrappali My heart burns for you like the sun at noon!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski My desert welcomes you like the rainy monsoon!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 raj_koothrappali You are my heart!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski My universe!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 raj_koothrappali You are my heart!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski My universe!

TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 chorus_of_everyone_in_cafeteria#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 Hey! You are my heart! My universe! You are my heart! My universe! You are my heart! My universe! My universe!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Dance number aside, I’m so not gay.
