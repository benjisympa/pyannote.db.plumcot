TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Here’s what I wonder about zombies. What happens if they can’t get any human flesh to eat? They can’t starve to death, they’re already dead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 howard_wolowitz You take this one. I spent an hour last night on how do vampires shave when they can’t see themselves in the mirror?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Well-groomed vampires meet in pairs and shave each other. Case closed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Yeah, okay, so, zombies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter I guess it depends on the zombies, Raj. Are we talking slow zombies, fast zombies? Like, in 28 Days, if those zombies didn’t eat, they starved.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 howard_wolowitz You’re thinking of 28 Days Later. 28 Days is where Sandra Bullock goes to rehab and puts the audience into an undead state
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Hey, don’t bag on Sandra Bullock! You think it makes you look cultured, but you just come off as bitter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Oh, Dr. Siebert, twelve o’clock.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Why’s the president of the university slumming in the cafeteria?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Perhaps he’s emulating Shakespeare’s Henry V, who dressed as a commoner and mingled among them, to find out how he was being perceived by his subjects. Course, if he’d have read any of the thirteen hundred e-mails I’ve sent him on the subject of his administration, he could have saved himself the trouble.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Or maybe he heard it’s Tator Tot Tuesday. That’s why I’m here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 president_siebert Hey, there’s my favorite geniuses! How are we doing today?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper That depends, how much longer do you plan on fondling my shoulder?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 president_siebert Sorry, Dr. Cooper, I forgot you have a touch phobia.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper It’s not a touch phobia, it’s a germ phobia. If you’d like to go put on a pair of latex gloves,
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 president_siebert Yeah. So, listen, fellas, who’s up for a little party this Saturday night? Open bar, good eats, might even be a few pretty girls.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Sounds great!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 howard_wolowitz I’m in!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Hold on. Just because the nice man is offering you candy, doesn’t mean you should jump into his windowless van. What’s the occasion?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 president_siebert Just a little fund-raiser for the university.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Aha! The tear-stained air mattress in the back of the van.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 president_siebert I understand your reticence, Dr. Cooper, and I sympathize, but the hard facts are, occasionally, we have to shake a few hands and kiss a few butts to raise money for our research.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper I don’t care, it’s demeaning. And I refuse to be trotted out and shown off like a prize hog at the Texas State Fair. Which, by the way, is something you don’t want to attend wearing a Star Trek ensign’s uniform.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 president_siebert All right, let me put it this way. You’re gonna put on a suit, you’re gonna come to this party, and you’re gonna explain your research to a bunch of old people, or I swear to God, I’ll blind you with a hot spoon, like they did to that little boy in Slumdog Millionaire.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Oh, you don’t want that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 president_siebert So, Saturday night! It’s gonna be off the hook.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Ugh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 president_siebert Get over it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Oh, boy! Tator tots and a party invitation? What a great day!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 penny There you go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Are you sure this is right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 penny Yeah, just tuck that part in your pants; you’ll be fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Okay, let’s go smooch some rich, wrinkled tuckus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 penny Oh, Howard, I can’t believe Bernadette let you go to a fancy party wearing a dickey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Excuse me, my girlfriend doesn’t pick out my clothes. My mother does.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Oh. We should get going.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 howard_wolowitz What about Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Sheldon is not going.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Really? What do we tell Siebert?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Tell him Dr. Cooper feels that the best use of his time is to employ his rare and precious mental faculties to tear the mask off nature and stare at the face of God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 penny Sheldon, it’s Saturday night, you’ll be doing laundry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Don’t tell him that, tell him the mask thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Hey, put your tie back in your pants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Nice place. Reminds me of my parents’ house back in New Delhi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 howard_wolowitz You’re kidding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 raj_koothrappali No. We are very wealthy. But the only difference is, we have more servants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter More than this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 raj_koothrappali More than we can use. You see, in India, we don’t make the mistake of letting our poor people have dreams.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 president_siebert Ah. There’s my band of brainiacs. Where’s Dr. Cooper?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter He’s tearing the mask off nature to look at the face of God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 president_siebert The board of directors insists he has a beautiful mind. I think he’s just bananas. Come on, let me introduce you to one of the university’s leading donors.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 raj_koothrappali I think we were misled about the cute girls.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 president_siebert Mrs. Latham, I’d like you to meet three of our outstanding young researchers. This is Dr. Leonard Hofstadter, Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali and Howard Wolowitz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 mrs_latham Well, what happened to you, Wolowitz, couldn’t stick with it long enough to get your PhD?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 howard_wolowitz I’m an engineer. Most engineers don’t bother with a PhD. But you may be interested to know I designed the zero-gravity waste-disposal system for NASA.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 mrs_latham Got it, you’re a space plumber.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 howard_wolowitz I’m gonna go hit the bar.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 mrs_latham Tell me about these two.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Do him first.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 president_siebert Dr. Hofstadter is representing our experimental physics program tonight. I think you’ll really enjoy hearing about his fascinating work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 mrs_latham Right. Fascinate me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Uh.. b.. d.. uh.. uh..
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 mrs_latham They’re cute when they’re about to wet themselves, aren’t they? I’ll make it easy for you. When you arrive at the lab in the morning, what sort of machine do you turn on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Coffee maker?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 mrs_latham All right, Dr. Kooth… uh, whatever it is, you’re up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 raj_koothrappali It’s Koothrappali. I have to tinkle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper And so, instead of bowing to pressure, and going to that pointless soiree, I stayed right here and did a load of whites.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler Well, normally I respect your macho rebellious attitude toward The Man, but, in this case, I think you’ve made a foolish mistake.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Unlikely. But make your case. Keeping in mind that your critical attitude is ruining our Saturday night together, and I’m not above minimizing your window.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, like it or not, until you manage to upload your intelligence into a self-sustaining orbiting satellite, equipped with high-speed Internet and a cloaking device, you will be dependent on other members of the human race.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper That’s it. Prepare to be minimized.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler I’m not finished. All scientists have to fund-raise, Sheldon. How do you think I paid for my lab?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Your lab is funded by some Middle-Eastern dilettante?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler Technically, Faisal is my fiance. But I do have a state-of-the-art two-photon microscope and a place to stay in Riyadh for the winter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Well, that explains those puzzling camel race photos on your Facebook page.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler And consider this, without you to make the case for the physics department, the task will fall to people like Leonard and Rajesh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Are you trying to scare me? ‘Cause you’re succeeding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler Well, then prepare to be terrified. If your friends are unconvincing, this year’s donations might go to, say, the geology department.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Oh, dear,not, not the dirt people!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler Or worse, it could go to the liberal arts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper No!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler Millions of dollars being showered on poets, literary theorists and students of gender studies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Oh, the humanities!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter On the bright side, I don’t think President Siebert will be making us go to any more fund-raisers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 howard_wolowitz It was so much easier at my bar mitzvah. The old people just came up to you, pinched your cheek and handed you a savings bond.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Oh, don’t be such gloomy Gusses. Look at the size of these shrimp! At what point do we start calling them lobsters?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Face it, Raj, we crashed and burned tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 mrs_latham Oh, you didn’t do that badly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Mrs. Latham, the first machine I turn on in the morning is the helium-neon laser, ’cause it needs to warm up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 mrs_latham I no longer care, dear. But don’t worry, I really enjoyed meeting you this evening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter You’re kidding. That was good for you? ‘Cause I was sweating through my T-shirt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 mrs_latham Excellent! There’s nothing I like better than making smart people feel ill at ease.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 mrs_latham Oh, I don’t know, it’s one of the fun things you get to do when you have lots of money. Watch. Hey! Who said you could eat that shrimp? See? Fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper No, no, no, I’m just here for your money. I don’t want to shake anyone’s germy hands. Explain it to them, Siebert.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper I must confess I don’t understand you, President Siebert. First you say you want me to appear at your fund-raisers, but now you say you never want me to go anywhere near your fund-raisers. Forgive me, but that sounds like a mixed message. Here we go again. If there’s simply no talking to me, why did you call? I’m sorry, someone’s on the other line. Why don’t you see if you can organize your thoughts, and we’ll try again later. Cooper-Hofstadter residence. Go for Cooper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Hello, Mrs. Latham. Yes, I live with him. I don’t, I, I really don’t know why. Tonight? Sure, that’d be great. Okay, I’ll, I’ll see you then. Bye. She wants to have dinner and talk about my research.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper An entire dinner to talk about your research? Where you going, the drive-thru at Jack in the Box?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Well, wherever we’re going, she’s sending a car to pick me up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Okay, I see what’s happening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper My stature intimidates her, so she’s using you to get to me. Crafty old gal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Excuse me, but you are not the only distinguished scientist in this apartment. I’ve been published in peer-reviewed journals, I received a Dissertation of the Year award for experimental particle physics.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper No, that can’t be it. And since you seem to have forgotten, the reason we live together is we’re best friends. And I got your back, Jack.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter That was a great meal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 mrs_latham I’m glad you enjoyed it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter The only time I eat this well is when my mom’s in town and she takes me out to dinner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 mrs_latham Is that so?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter You kind of remind me of her. She enjoys making people uncomfortable, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 mrs_latham Well, you remind me of a boy I dated in college.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter No kidding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 mrs_latham Sweet boy. Very smart. If only he’d had money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, um, so, hey, speaking of money, how are you feeling about helping the physics department get a cryogenic centrifugal pump and molecular sieve?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 mrs_latham Well, I must say, you make a very persuasive case for it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Oh, good, good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 mrs_latham And I’m seriously considering taking it to the next level.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Terrific. Great. What level is that? Okay, now you don’t remind me of my mom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper I’m sorry, so, eventually, zombies are going to attack the rehab facility where Sandra Bullock is?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 penny Yes, Sheldon. Keep watching.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper You know, it’s a shame, all that work she’s doing to get sober, only to be torn apart and eaten alive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Hey. How was dinner?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Swell. I need a drink. Do we have any alcohol?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper No. But we have potatoes, I could make you vodka. It’ll take two weeks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 penny Leonard, are you okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Um, I’m not sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 howard_wolowitz What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Well, Mrs. Latham said she was seriously considering donating money so we could get a cryogenic centrifugal pump.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Oh, wow!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Yes!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Then she stuck her tongue down my throat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 penny Okay, we can’t keep explaining everything. Read that book we got you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter She hit on me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Wait-wait-wait. Are you telling us that old lady wanted to have sex with you in exchange for giving your department millions of dollars?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter I think so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 howard_wolowitz You lucky duck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 penny You’re really a broken toy, aren’t you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter I was able to get out of there before anything else happened, but she wants to see me again tomorrow night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Excellent! What are you planning to wear?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Penny, you’re an expert on trading sexual favours for material gain, walk him through this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Well, n-no, hold on a second, I’m not going to sleep with her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper But we need a cryogenic centrifugal pump.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Well, forget it! It’s not gonna happen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Well, come now, Leonard, this may be your only chance to make a real contribution to science!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter I repeat, not gonna happen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 penny What was all that about me trading sexual favours for material gain?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper It was a compliment. I believe in giving credit where credit is due.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Okay, fine. I’ll tell him. Leonard, Mrs. Latham’s car is here for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter I won’t be too late. I’m just gonna make a final pitch for the funding and then say good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Hold on, I have something for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter What’s this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Just a few things you may need tonight. There’s, uh, baby oil, condoms and, uh, a little something I procured from the school of pharmacology. They say it is to Viagra as Viagra is to a green M&M.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter I am not going to have sex with her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Maybe this will overcome your reluctance. I went on the Internet and found a photograph of a 25-year-old Mrs. Latham to get your libido humming. Check out those saddle shoes. Rar!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Are you insane? I’m not going to prostitute myself just so we can get some new equipment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Oh, come on! Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Good night, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Given how much time you spend engaging in pointless self-abuse, you might consider, just this once, using your genitalia to actually accomplish something!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 penny He still won’t shag the old lady, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper No. But thank you for asking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Hey. Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 mrs_latham Hello, Leonard. I hope you’re hungry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter I’m very hungry. For food, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 mrs_latham Oh, I made you uncomfortable last night. I’m so sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter No, that’s okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 mrs_latham No, it most certainly is not. Leonard, I’m making the donation to your department regardless of what happens between us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 mrs_latham Well, of course. There’s no quid pro quo here. You and your colleagues are doing remarkable research, and you deserve the money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Oh. Then what was last night about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 mrs_latham I took a shot, sue me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 mrs_latham You’re a very handsome man, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 mrs_latham It was foolish of me to think someone your age might ever be interested in someone like me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Oh, don’t say that. You’re a very attractive woman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 mrs_latham Oh, please.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter No, it’s true.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 mrs_latham Well, aren’t you sweet. Just for the record, you’d remember a night with me for the rest of your life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter I’m sure I would. But why, why, exactly?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 mrs_latham You’re a very smart man. How do you think I landed such a rich husband?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter I hadn’t really given it much thought.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 mrs_latham Well, think about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Do you mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 mrs_latham Yep. I’m that good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Oh, what the hell.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 penny Good morning, slut.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 penny Oh, please, I recognize the walk of shame when I see it. All you’re missing is a little smeared mascara and a purse with panties wadded up in it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Oh, nothing’s going on. Excuse me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Are you just getting home?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper That’s a good sign, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 penny Oh, yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper I’m so proud of you! You sold yourself out like a common streetwalker!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter No, I didn’t do it for the money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper She stiffed you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 penny I believe that’s what your roommate did to her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 penny Again, read the book we gave you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter No, I mean, I, I, I got the money first.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Smart. Get paid up front. Yeah.
