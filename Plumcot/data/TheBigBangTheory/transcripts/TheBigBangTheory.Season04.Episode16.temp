TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard What’s so funny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 bernadette Nothing. Just thinking about the noises people make during sex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard I do sometimes get a bit carried away, don’t I?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 bernadette It’s cute. You sound a little like a drunken monkey. Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard You know it’s meant as a compliment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 bernadette That’s how I take it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard This is perfect. I hope this moment never ends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 bernadette Me too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard Well, gotta go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 bernadette Oh! Already? Why don’t you stay over?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard Well, I’d love to, but you know my mother needs me in the morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 bernadette Please, I think the woman can manage to put a wig on by herself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard It’s not just the wig. It’s pinning her hair up, drawing on her eyebrows. It’s a two-person job.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 bernadette It’s just, when you leave right after we make love, it makes me feel cheap.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard Oh, honey, I’m sorry. What can I do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 bernadette Stay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard Okay. Like, what, another five, ten minutes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 bernadette Go home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard Your call.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 bernadette Howard, have you ever considered us living together?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard Boy, I don’t know. You, me, Ma living under the same roof?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 bernadette No, I mean just you and me. You can move in here, or we can find a place.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard I’ve got a better solution.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 bernadette What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard We wait for my mom’s heart to explode from all the salt she eats. Then we just stick her in the ground, flip her mattress and move into the big bedroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 bernadette Great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard Look at us planning a future together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 mrs_wolowitz Who’s there? Are you a sex criminal?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard Sex criminals don’t have keys, Ma.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 mrs_wolowitz Where were you so late?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard I was out with Bernadette.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 mrs_wolowitz I know what that means, I watch Dr. Phil. I hope to God you used a condom!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard I’m not having this conversation with you, Ma!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 mrs_wolowitz God forbid you get one of those new fancy sex diseases!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard Nobody has a disease!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 mrs_wolowitz I hope not. I share a toilet with you. Is that what you want? To give your mother herpes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard That’s it. I don’t have to take this. Good luck with your eyebrows in the morning!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 mrs_wolowitz Who’s there? Are you a sex criminal?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard I’m still leaving! I just forgot my Claritin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 leonard Hey, what’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard I need a place to crash.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 leonard Uh, sure. Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard Big fight with my mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 leonard Still arguing over which CSI is the best?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard No, we agreed they all have their merits. This was about Bernadette.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 sheldon What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 leonard Howard’s gonna sleep here tonight. He had a fight with his mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 sheldon Did you offer him a hot beverage?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 leonard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 sheldon Leonard, social protocol states when a friend is upset, you offer them a hot beverage, such as tea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard Tea does sound nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 sheldon You heard the man, Leonard. And while you’re at it, I’m upset that we have an unannounced houseguest, so make me cocoa. Point of inquiry, given that Leonard is your secondary friend and Koothrappali is your primary friend, why didn’t you seek refuge under his roof?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard There’s no room. His sister is staying with him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 leonard Wait, wait. What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 sheldon Cocoa, Leonard. Focus. I’m down in the dumps here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 leonard Priya’s in town?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard Yeah, some work thing. Anyway, my mother seems to think that Bernadette…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 leonard Hold on. When did Priya get here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard I don’t know. A couple of days ago. The thing is, Bernadette doesn’t like that I have to take care of my mother, and my mother doesn’t trust Bernadette.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 leonard Yeah, that’s a real pickle. Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 sheldon Don’t worry. As your tertiary friend, I am prepared to step in and comfort you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard That’s not really necessary.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 sheldon No, no. I’ll finish making the tea, while you narcissistically ramble on about whatever’s troubling you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 sheldon That’s what tertiary friends are for.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 raj Who is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 leonard It’s Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 raj You can’t come in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 leonard I just want to talk to her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 raj I forbid it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 priya Open the door, Rajesh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 raj You heard me. I forbidded it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 priya Forbidded it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 raj Forbaded it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 priya Get out of the way. What are you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 leonard What are you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 priya I have business in Los Angeles.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 leonard Why didn’t you call?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 raj Clearly, she was sending you a message to take a hike, Mike.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 priya I’m sorry. I thought about calling, but I just wasn’t sure if seeing you was such a good idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 leonard I know. Last time I came on too strong. Can we talk in private?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 raj No!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 priya Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 raj It’s completely inappropriate for a single woman to entertain a man in private. If you insist on talking, you must do it on the couch! All right, you may talk in the bedroom, but I want this door to remain open! All right, just this once you may close the door. But keep in mind I’ll be right out here monitoring the situation! Oh, damn it. Leonard, when you get this message, call me. Priya, this is your brother. When you get this, tell Leonard to check his voicemail.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 sheldon Would you be sleeping over again this evening? Because you’re welcome to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard That’s very nice of you, but I made other plans.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 sheldon Well, just keep in mind that should you ever need a slightly apathetic tertiary friend, I stand at the ready.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 priya Hi, Howard. Hi, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 sheldon Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 raj Why are you holding hands? I forbid you to hold hands.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 priya Rajesh, you know Leonard and I spent the night together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 raj Yeah, but you were just sleeping, because I forboded you to have sex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 leonard The word is forbade.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 raj Are you sure? That doesn’t sound right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 priya Listen, Rajesh, Leonard and I have decided to see each other again, and you don’t get to tell me who I can and can’t have a relationship with.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 sheldon Actually, he can. The Hindu Code of Manu is very clear in these matters. If a woman’s father is not around, the duty of controlling her base desires falls to the closest male member of her family, in this case, Raj. The code also states that if she disobeys, she will be reborn in the womb of a jackal and tormented by diseases. If true, that seems like an awfully large gamble given that the prize is Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 raj There it is, Priya. We’re Indian. We believe this stuff.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 priya I think it also says that if you eat beef, you need to live with cows for three months and drink their urine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 raj Some of it makes sense, some of it’s crazy. My point is, you can’t go out with Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 penny Who can’t go out with Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 raj My sister.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 leonard Penny, this is Raj’s sister, Priya.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 priya It’s very nice to meet you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 penny Oh, yeah, you, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 sheldon Priya, if you’re experiencing any tension or awkwardness, it may stem from the fact that Leonard and Penny used to, if I may quote Howard, do the dance with no pants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 penny Sheldon!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 leonard Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard Hey, Bernadette, can I talk to you for a second?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 bernadette Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 raj Penny, you became disenchanted with Leonard as a lover. Would you please tell my sister why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard Listen, my mom’s going to Palm Springs to visit her sister. That’s two whole nights in a row I can sleep over with you all the way to morning. Unless the desert air dries out her sinuses, in which case I’ll have to schlep out there with the big humidifier.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 bernadette That’s it? That’s your big solution to all of our problems? If your mom’s nose holds up, we get two nights together?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard Isn’t that great?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 bernadette No, it’s not great. You need to make a choice. Me or your mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard Oh, uh…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 bernadette Wrong answer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard No, wait. You didn’t let me finish.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 bernadette I’m listening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard Uh…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 bernadette Agh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 amy I came as quickly as I could.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 penny Okay. Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 amy To comfort you, of course. Sheldon told me about Leonard dating Rajesh’s sister. So I high-tailed it over here to pick up the pieces of your broken heart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 penny Amy, I’m fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 amy You don’t have to be strong for me. Now let’s talk about Priya, that man-stealing bitch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 amy In situations like this, best girlfriends are often catty about the other woman. Rawr.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 penny Really, I am not upset about Leonard and Priya.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 amy Oh. Then perhaps you don’t understand what’s going on. Your former boyfriend has replaced you with what appears to be a very suitable mate. Arguably much more suitable than you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 penny Oh. Well, good for him. Hey, what do you mean, more suitable?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 amy Well, granted, Penny, your secondary sexual characteristics are reasonably bodacious. But Priya is highly educated, she’s an accomplished professional, and she comes from the culture that literally wrote the book on neat ways to have sex. Whereas you, on the other hand, are a community college dropout who comes from the culture that wrote the book on tipping cows.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 penny Yeah. Okay, I got it. I got it. So, what is all that stuff?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 amy This is a portable electroencephalogram. I’m doing research on emotions and brain activity. So when you start crying, I can see which region of the brain is activated. Then I’m going to stimulate the analogous area in the brain of a rhesus monkey and see if he cries. Cool, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard I choose you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 bernadette Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard Yep. I moved out of my mother’s house. Cord is cut. I’m all yours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 bernadette What did she say when you told her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard I don’t know. She hasn’t responded to my email yet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 bernadette This is so great. I love you, Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard I love you, too. So what’s for dinner?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 bernadette Well, I don’t really have much of anything in the house.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard That’s fine. Why don’t we go fool around in our bedroom? And then you can go shopping.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 leonard I thought maybe after we eat, we could see an early movie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 priya I’d love that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 leonard I love the way you say, I’d love that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 raj She says it the same way I do. I’d love that. Everybody in India says it that way. It’s not a big deal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 priya Rajesh, don’t be a child.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 raj I’m not being a child. Leonard, I swear to God, if your sister ever comes to town, I shall have my way with her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 leonard My sister’s 38 and married.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 raj All the more shame that will fall upon the house of Hofstadter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 penny Ooh, I thought I smelled pizza.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 sheldon That’s remarkable. If pepperoni were an explosive substance, you could replace German shepherds at our nation’s airports.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 priya Hi. Penny, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 penny Oh, yes. Hi, hi. I’m sorry. I didn’t know you had company. I don’t want to impose.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 sheldon No, no. It’s not an imposition. At this point, in our ecosystem, you are akin to the plover, a small scavenging bird that eats extra food from between the teeth of crocodiles. Please, fly into our open maw, and have at it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 penny If I had more than a box of baking soda in my refrigerator, I wouldn’t have to take that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 amy Hi, bestie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 penny Hi. So, um, Priya, you’re a lawyer, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 priya I know. Pretty boring, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 leonard Oh, come on. It’s not boring at all. She’s currently helping set up a secondary derivative market which would allow overseas car firms to hedge their investments against potential advancements in battery technology. Hmm?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 priya Thank you, Leonard. That doesn’t make it sound boring at all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 amy So, how you holding up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 penny I’m fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 amy Oh, who are you kidding? She’s breathtaking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 priya So, Penny, Leonard tells me you’re an actress. That must be pretty exciting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 penny Oh, yeah, yeah. It’s real great. Today I drove to Van Nuys for an audition I thought was going to be for a cat food commercial. Turned out to be porn.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 sheldon Did you get the part?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 penny I didn’t do the audition.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 sheldon Given the state of your career, can you really afford to be picky?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 priya I took acting classes when I was at Cambridge. I loved it. We did Taming of the Shrew.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 leonard Oh, wow. I love Taming of the Shrew. I did a paper on it in high school. Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting? In his tail.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 priya In his tongue.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 leonard Whose tongue?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 priya Yours, if you talk of tails, and so farewell.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 leonard What, with my tongue in your tail?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 amy I’m regretting my earlier cattiness. She is an absolute delight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 bernadette Wow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard Wow, indeed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 bernadette I can’t believe we’re finally living together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard Yeah. You know what would make this moment perfect?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 bernadette What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard A little snack. You got any string cheese?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 bernadette No. I, I might have some cheddar.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard Not as good. You can’t make strings with it. Remind me to put it on your shopping list.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 bernadette Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard You have hypo-allergenic detergent?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 bernadette No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard Better put it on the list. If you wash my underwear with regular soap, I get little red bumps on my tuchus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 bernadette Wait a second. I’m doing your laundry?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard Well, honey, it’s not gonna do itself. Oh, before I forget, tomorrow morning, you’re driving me to the dentist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 bernadette I have to take you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard You don’t have to take me. You get to take me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 bernadette Wait a minute. Are you telling me your mother usually takes you to the dentist?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard It’s not weird. There’s lots of kids there with their moms.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 bernadette I can’t believe this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard What? It’s fun. If I have no cavities, afterwards, we go out for a treat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 bernadette All right, Howard, let’s get something straight right now. I’m not going to be your mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard Whoa, whoa, whoa! Where did that come from?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 mrs_wolowitz Who’s that? Is it a sex criminal?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard Nobody wants to do that to you, Ma.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 mrs_wolowitz Where were you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard Didn’t you read my email?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 mrs_wolowitz You know I can’t turn on that ferkakta computer. I left you some brisket on the kitchen counter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 howard Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 mrs_wolowitz Remember to floss after. We have the dentist in the morning!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 penny Oh, hey. What’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 amy I just wanted to check in on you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 penny Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 amy It seems like the appropriate thing to do when one’s best friend finds herself replaced by a smart, beautiful woman with the smouldering sexuality of a crouched Bengal tiger.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 penny I already told you, I’m okay with it. I mean, if anything, I’m quite pleased that Leonard has found someone that makes him so happy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 amy It’s okay, it’s okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 penny Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 amy Now, let’s get these electrodes attached and see what’s going on in that pretty little noggin of yours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 penny Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 penny I smell Chinese food.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 sheldon It’s actually Thai. You’re slipping.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 penny Are Leonard and Priya here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 sheldon They went to Catalina for the weekend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 penny Oh. Where’s Raj?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 sheldon At home, forbidding it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 penny How about Howard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 sheldon I’m given to understand his mother grounded him for running away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 penny Oh, okay. Well, I guess it’s just the two of us, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 sheldon Actually, it’s the three of us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 amy What up, bestie? Good news. Thanks to you, I was able to make a rhesus monkey cry like a disgraced televangelist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 penny Great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 amy So, you feeling better?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 penny Not really.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 amy Sheldon, you have a guest who’s upset.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 sheldon Right. I’ll make tea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 penny Oh, sweetie, it’s okay. I don’t want tea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode16 sheldon I’m sorry. It’s not optional.
