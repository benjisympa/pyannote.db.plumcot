TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Buona sera, Luigi’s Pizza. Buona sera. It means good evening in Italian. May I say, having to explain that to you calls into question the authenticity of your ristorante?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Okay, I’m out of here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Un momento. Oh, for heaven’s sake, now you’re being deliberately stupid. Where are you going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter I’m having dinner with Priya at Raj’s. I think Howard’s going to be there. You want to join us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper But tonight’s Thursday. On Thursdays, everybody comes over here and has pizza. Or a reasonable facsimile prepared by someone claiming to be Luigi, but who sounds suspiciously like Jackie Chan.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Can’t we make a one-time exception for tonight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper We could. We could also stop using the letter M, but I think that idea is isguided and oronic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Just come with me to Raj’s.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Well, I don’t want to go to a party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter It’s not a party. It’s the same group of people who hang out here, hanging out over there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper I’m sorry, but five people eating and chatting is a party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter How come it’s not a party when we do it here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Because we don’t throw parties.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter I don’t know what to tell you, Sheldon. I’m going to see Priya. Everyone’s over there. You coming or not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Well, no, sir, and do you know why? In a word, tradition. Every Thursday night for the last eight years, you and I and our friends have gathered here in this very spot to break bread covered with cheese and sauce, discuss the issues of the day, and yes, share a laugh or two. But I guess our rich heritage means nothing to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter I guess you’re right. See you later.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Wait! Leonard! Wait! What am I going to do for dinner?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Come with me to Raj’s and eat there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper I can’t do that. What if he serves haggis and blood pudding?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter I really doubt that’s what he’ll serve.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper But what if he does? I’ll be obliged to dine on liver and lungs stuffed in a sheep’s stomach. And frankly, blood pudding is essentially the same thing. I don’t know why he’s serving both.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter What do you want to do? You want to come with me, or do you want to sit here alone?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper No, I’ll go to your haggis party. But I’m telling you, this is adness. This is utter and coplete adness.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Oh, dear!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Raj’s television. I just realized we’re about to spend an evening watching a plasma screen with a cluster of dead pixels in the upper left-hand corner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter So don’t watch TV. Read a book.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper And be a social pariah? Oh, you know that’s not my style.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Ugh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper The audible sigh is a show of exasperation, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Is it about me or the dead pixels?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Hey, you’re just in time. We made Tex-Mex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Oh, sounds great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Oh, Indians making Tex-Mex. Might as well have had the Chinese pizza.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 priya_koothrappali Hey, you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 howard_wolowitz That’s got to be fun for you, huh? Watching Hofstadter suck the saliva out of your sister’s mouth?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Excuse me. Before this evening goes any further, we need to decide where everyone is going to sit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 priya_koothrappali There is no assigned seats, Sheldon. Just sit anywhere. Make yourself comfortable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Oh, what fun. We’re like hippies at a love-in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Just sit here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Yeah, right on, man. Right on. Oh, look, it’s Harry Potter and 98% of The Sorcerer’s Stone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Okay, we’ve got fajitas with all the fixins, so you make your own.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Wonderful. Dinner, some assembly required.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 priya_koothrappali Do you want a margarita, Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper A margarita? Where are we? What is happening?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 penny Oh. Hey, Sheldon. What can I get ya?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Water. Neat. With a little umbrella.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 penny Where are all your friends?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Sadly, Penny, this evening, I am the Dark Knight, roaming these mean streets alone. A windbreaker for my cape, and a stern expression for my cowl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 penny Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Excuse me? Isn’t this the point where the world-weary barkeep absentmindedly wipes down the bar and coaxes the woes out of the troubled patron?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 penny Well, I was getting your stupid umbrella, but all right. What’s troubling you, buddy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper I don’t think your heart’s in it, but since you asked. Apparently, because Leonard is dating Raj’s sister, we’re all forced to hang out at his apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 penny Oh, the horror.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Indeed. Yeah, at one point, Raj put on reggae music, and his sister took off her shoes. It was like the last days of Caligula. Oh, I have to get this. Umbrella?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 penny Ugh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Wonder what she’s exasperated about. Hello?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, are you all right? When last we spoke, you were going to take a taxi home from Raj’s, but according to Facebook, you just checked in at the Cheesecake Factory.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Yes, I was in a taxi, but the driver didn’t look at all like the photograph on his license, so I leapt out and ran for it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Wise.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 penny There you go. Just like recovering alcoholics drink in the Caribbean.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Hi, bestie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 penny Oh. Hi, Amy. How you been?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Fine. From this angle, I can see up your nose.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 penny Yeah, it’s a great time to be alive, isn’t it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Don’t worry. My problems can wait while you two hens finish your clucking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 penny Look, Sheldon, Leonard is dating Priya. She is staying with Raj. That means you’re all probably gonna be hanging out there more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Penny, I’m sorry you got dragged into this. I know you’re devastated that your ex-boyfriend has found an exciting new lover with flawless, caramel-coloured skin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 penny Okay, I’m not upset about Leonard and Priya.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Your flaring nostrils indicate otherwise.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Cluck-cluck-cluck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, look at me. I think it’s time to face the fact that Leonard is the nucleus of your social group. Where he goes, the group goes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Leonard the nucleus? That makes no sense. I’m the whimsical elf that everyone looks to for a good time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler I’m not saying that you’re not fun. You’re the most fun person I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 penny A lot of people think I’m fun to be around.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Don’t be needy, bestie. That’s probably part of what chased Leonard away. What I am saying, Sheldon, is that your group is Leonard-centric. If it were a town, it would be Leonardville. If it were an Islamic nation, Leonardstan. If it were the birthplace of motion pictures, we’d all be singing Hooray for Leonardwood.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 penny Ooh, I got one. If you guys were a band, you’d be called Leonard and the Leonards.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler So needy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter What you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper I’m setting out snacks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter You do realize everyone’s eating at Raj’s again tonight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper I didn’t say the snacks were for you now, did I, Nosy Rosie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter You’re having people over?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Yes. Must be killing you wondering who. Fine, I’ll tell you. Stuart from the comic bookstore, Barry Kripke from the university, Penny’s ex-boyfriend Zack and TV’s LeVar Burton.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Really? LeVar Burton’s coming here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Possibly. I Tweeted him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Okay, well, tell him I loved him on Star Trek.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Please, Leonard, stop trying to horn in on my new friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Of course. Good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Yeah?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper We had a good run, you and I.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper But change is a part of life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter It certainly is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Okay. I have guests coming. I’m afraid I’m going to have to ask you to leave now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter I am leaving.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Don’t make this harder than it is, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Good-bye, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper And good-bye to you, sir. He’ll be back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Of course I’ll be back. I live here!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Well, it would appear LeVar Burton won’t be joining us so let’s get started. Um, I thought we’d begin by going around the room, introducing ourselves and saying a little bit about why we’re here. Okay. I’m Sheldon. Uh, for regular readers of The New England Journal of High Energy Physics, I need no introduction. If you’re not familiar with that publication, there’s a free copy in your goody bag. Stuart?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 stuart_bloom Um. Hi. I’m Stuart. I run a comic bookstore, which for financial reasons, I’m currently living in. And I guess what I’m hoping for most out of tonight is a hot shower.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper That’s very nice, Stuart. Zack?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 zack_johnson I’m Zack, and I’m, uh… uh… could you come back to me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Of course. Barry?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 barry_kripke I’m Barry Kwipke, and I’m here because you told me there was going to be a whaffle. When is the whaffle?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Patience, patience, Barry. The whaffle… the raffle is the grand finale to an evening-long festival of fun and folly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 barry_kripke One more question…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Yes, you must be present to win.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 zack_johnson Okay, I’m ready. I’m Zack, and I’m, uh… oh, crap, why is this so hard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 penny Oh, hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 bernadette_rostenkowski Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Yo, P-dog.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 penny What’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 bernadette_rostenkowski We’re here to kidnap you for a girls’ night out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Parenthetical, the term kidnap is being used playfully.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 penny I kind of figured that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Good. Now put this pillowcase over your head.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler She used to be much more fun, until Leonard punched her in the heart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 bernadette_rostenkowski We just thought you might want to go out and have a good time, maybe go dancing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 penny Oh. Gee, thanks, but I’m not really in the mood.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler You do understand that it will distract you from obsessing over the rich variety of sweet loving that your ex-boyfriend is currently receiving from the fiery jewel of Mumbai.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 penny Okay, look, if I agree to go out with you guys, will you promise to stop pestering me about Leonard and Priya?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 bernadette_rostenkowski Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 penny All right. I’ll go change. Come on in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler If you’d have let me bring the chloroform, we wouldn’t have had to put up with all this jibber-jabber.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 zack_johnson Anyway, after we get done snowboarding, I go back to the lodge and get in the Jacuzzi. There’s no one around, so naturally, I’m free-balling it. Next thing I know, this beautiful chick shows up, drunk out of her skull, wants to get in with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Question. Was it a Jacuzzi or a hot tub?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 barry_kripke Weally? That’s your question?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 zack_johnson What’s the difference?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Jacuzzi is a commercial brand. Hot tub is the generic term, i.e., all Jacuzzis are hot tubs, but not all hot tubs are Jacuzzis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 zack_johnson Is that like all thumbs are fingers, but not all fingers are thumbs?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Surprisingly, yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 zack_johnson Nice. Now, what exactly are toes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 stuart_bloom Can you please get back to the drunk girl? I’d like something to think about in the shower.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 zack_johnson Oh, yeah. Right. Anyway, she takes off all of her clothes, climbs into the hot tub, and the first thing I notice…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper The water level rose.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 zack_johnson No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Of course it did. It’s said that Archimedes, the ancient Greek mathematician, discovered the principle of displacement while taking a bath.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 barry_kripke Tewwific. Go ahead, Zack. Naked dwunk girl, fwee-balling, continue.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Forgive me, but I think you’ll find my story is more interesting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 barry_kripke Does yours have wet bweasts in it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Better. It has a gold crown. You see, the king wondered how much gold was in it and charged Archimedes with coming up with the solution. Because the crown was irregularly shaped, there was no way to mathematically determine its volume. But, while bathing, Archimedes realized he could immerse the crown and measure the amount the water rose.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 zack_johnson So, long story short, I nailed her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper When he finished, he shouted Eureka!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 zack_johnson No, I always shout, Holy Moly! Don’t know why. Just do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper All right, that concludes the getting to know you portion of the evening. Who’s ready to play some vintage video games? And tonight’s selections include ColecoVision’s Smurf Rescue in Gargamel’s Castle, Atari’s Cookie Monster Munch, and for you text adventure aficionados, Zork. Pick me, pick me. I’m fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 barry_kripke That all sucks the big haiwy meatball. How about I go get the kawaoke machine out of my car, get plastered and blow the woof off this place?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 zack_johnson Great, I’ll make a beer run.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 stuart_bloom And I’ll take a shower. We’ll meet back here in fifteen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 barry_kripke Check.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper I’m unhappy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter This is delicious. Where’d you learn to make chili?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 priya_koothrappali When I was at university in England, my flatmate was from Texas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter I hope she wasn’t anything like my flatmate from Texas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 priya_koothrappali Sheldon is a bit quirky, isn’t he?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Oh, please. That crazy bastard’s looking at quirky in the rearview mirror.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Did you know that, per our roommate agreement, I have to wash my feet before I get in the shower? And not in the sink. We each have special buckets.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Raj, did you ever tell your sister about the time Sheldon got punched by Bill Gates?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 priya_koothrappali Oh, God, you’re kidding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Nope. Gates gave a speech at the university. Sheldon went up to him afterwards and said, maybe if you weren’t so distracted by sick children in Africa, you could have put a little more thought into Windows Vista.”
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Bam. Right in the nose. Made me proud to own a PC.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 raj_koothrappali I’d like to propose a toast to a rare and wonderful Sheldon-free evening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Hear, hear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Cheers. You realize that’s the first time we’ve ever done that without having to listen to Sheldon tell us why it’s called a toast?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 priya_koothrappali Why is it called a toast?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Oh, the ancient Romans put spiced toast in their punch bowls.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Sheldon tells it better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter He kind of does.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Aw, hell, I miss him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 penny So, where do you guys want to go dancing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 bernadette_rostenkowski We were hoping you’d know a place.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Yes, perhaps somewhere packed tightly with young, beautiful bodies sweating and writhing against each other in a glorious orgy of the flesh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 penny Oh, yeah, I know that place. What do you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler That should display enough of your bosom to attract a new mate, or a hungry infant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 penny Okay, let’s go through this one more time. Just because Leonard has a new girlfriend does not mean I need to go out and hook up with some guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 bernadette_rostenkowski But you could if you wanted to, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 penny Well, yeah, I guess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 bernadette_rostenkowski Pick out the hottest guy in the room, take him home, do unspeakable things to him, then kick him to the curb with a smile on his face and teeth marks on his heinie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 penny More or less.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler What’s that like?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 penny I don’t know. It’s fun while you’re doing it. And then after, it’s mostly embarrassment, self-loathing and regret.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 bernadette_rostenkowski I would take that deal all day long.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 penny Yeah, well, it’s not gonna happen tonight. You know, for the first time in my life, I am not in a relationship, and I’m totally okay with it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler You know, if being on your own is new to you, I’d be happy to share some tension-relieving techniques for ladies I’ve perfected over the years. For example, do you have an electric toothbrush?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 penny Um, no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler You should get one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 bernadette_rostenkowski What’s that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler It appears to be something preserved between two pieces of acrylic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 penny Oh, it’s a snowflake from the North Pole. Leonard gave it to me last year.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, God, that is so romantic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 penny Yeah, it was.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 bernadette_rostenkowski Leonard’s really one of a kind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Saying that while holding a snowflake is a little bit heavy-handed, don’t you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 penny Let me see that. Oh, screw it. I can deal with a little self-loathing. Let’s go find me a heinie to bite.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Outstanding. And if we fail, we can always stop at CVS and pick you out a nice toothbrush. I call mine Gerard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 bernadette_rostenkowski That’s kind of creepy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 stuart_bloom Anybody do Walking on Sunshine yet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 stuart_bloom Dibs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 priya_koothrappali I’m sorry, Sheldon bought a loom and learned how to weave?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter He actually got pretty good. He made us all matching serapes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 raj_koothrappali I still wear mine when there’s a nip in the air.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 priya_koothrappali Now, was this before or after he adopted the 25 cats?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Long before the cats. I think it was around the time he tried to declare our apartment a sovereign nation. I still have some of the currency.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper All my friends. All my friends. All my friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 howard_wolowitz I think it’s like Beetlejuice. We said his name too many times.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Come on in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Hey. I thought you were with your new buddies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper I had to leave. They were having fun wrong.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 priya_koothrappali Come here, Sheldon. Sit here with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 priya_koothrappali Would you like some homemade chili?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Are there beans in it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 priya_koothrappali Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Then it’s not chili. Real chili has no beans in it, but you’re from a foreign land, so your ignorance is forgiven.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 priya_koothrappali Sheldon, do you want some or not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Yes, please. Your girlfriend’s a little short-tempered.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 raj_koothrappali I’d like to propose a toast to friends, no matter how quirky.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode17 all@ Cheers.
