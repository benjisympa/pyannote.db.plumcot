TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 dr_brian_greene My new book, The Hidden Reality, takes on a grand question. Is our universe the only universe? You see, there’s a growing belief among scientists like me that ours may only be one among many universes populating a gigantic cosmos. In The Hidden Reality, I explore this possibility without presuming any knowledge of mathematics or physics on the part of the reader.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon Hysterical.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 amy I’m glad you talked me into this. We work so hard, sometimes, it’s nice to goof off and do something silly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon Agreed. Wait till you hear how he dumbs down Werner Heisenberg for the crowd. You may actually believe you’re in a comedy club.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 greene You can think about Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle much like the special order menu that you find in certain Chinese restaurants, where you have dishes in column A and other dishes in column B, and if you order the first dish in column A, you can’t order the corresponding dish in column B. That’s sort of like the Uncertainly Principle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon Ba-dum-bump.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 amy Say, I heard an interesting tidbit about Howard and Bernadette.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon Really, Amy? Gossip? I’m disappointed in you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 amy Now, now. Evolutionary biologist Robin Dunbar has identified gossip as an aid to social bonding in large groups.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon Forgive my language, but poppycock.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 amy What if he’s right? And by not participating in gossip, society breaks down into small feral bands of tattooed motorcycle riders fighting to the death over the last few cans of tuna fish?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon Fine. In the parlance of the urban music scene, what’s the 4-1-1?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 amy Bernadette is thinking about breaking up with Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon I believe our nation’s tuna cans are safe. Excuse me. Dr. Greene, question?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 greene Yes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon You’ve dedicated your life’s work to educating the general populace about complex scientific ideas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 greene Yes, in part.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon Have you ever considered trying to do something useful? Perhaps, reading to the elderly?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 greene Excuse me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon Yeah, but not your books. Something they might enjoy. I kid, of course. Big fan.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard Nice shot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon Thank you. My father taught me archery as a child. It’s odd how the activity brings back the smell of Kmart bourbon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard Perfect.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon I know. What an elf I would have made. Whoo, what do you think you’re doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard Shooting at a target?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon With what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard An arrow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon Really? I didn’t see you draw one from your quiver.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard I’m not going to do that, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon Leonard, the people at Nintendo can only go so far in helping us recreate an actual athletic experience. We have to do our part, too. That was uncalled for, but I’ll play along. Ow! I had an unusual experience with Amy last night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard Really? How could you tell?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon She was attempting to engage me in gossip.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard You don’t say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon Yes. I think prolonged exposure to Penny has turned her into a bit of a Gabby Gertie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard So, what’s the gossip?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon Oh, please, I was just pointing it out. I have no desire to engage in the activity.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard Fine, don’t tell me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon All right, get this. Bernadette is thinking about breaking up with Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard Oh. That’s too bad. I wonder what happened.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon Mm, it’s hard to say. I can only speculate based on the data I collected watching my parents’ marriage implode. In that case, the woman dives into religion, while the man dives into a bottle-blonde bartender who tries to buy my love with action figures. Oop! Out of arrows.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard Boy, you sure get your money’s worth out of these games.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard – Priya, can I come in?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 priya Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard Oh, God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 priya What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard It’s okay. You didn’t know. I’ll take care of it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 priya What, what did I do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard Sheldon doesn’t allow flossing that close to the mirror.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 priya You’re kidding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard It’s a splatter thing. There’s a little piece of tape on the floor you’re supposed to stand behind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 priya That’s madness.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard I know. Just do it. There’s a big inspection coming up, and I don’t want to lose my TV privileges.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 priya You really need to let me take a look at that roommate agreement one of these days.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard Mm, I don’t know. I get a lawyer, he gets a lawyer, it’s just easier to stand behind the tape.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 priya Oh, by the way, a fellow at work said I could use his Dodger tickets this weekend. Does that sound like fun?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard Yeah! Dodgers are baseball, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 priya You’ll need to explain the game to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard Mm, it’s complicated, but as I remember it, the essentials are, get chosen last, get hit by the ball, cry, go home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 priya Well, regardless, I’ve got four tickets, and I was thinking we can bring Bernadette and Howard. She’s really interesting, and I bet I can get used to him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard Well, it might not be a great idea to invite those two.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 priya Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard Don’t tell anybody I told you, but I heard she might be breaking up with him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 priya Oh, too bad. Although I do know one person for whom that’s good news.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard Really? Who?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 priya My brother. He’s got a big crush on Bernadette.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard What? You’re kidding!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 priya Mmm. I found poems he wrote about her. Very disturbing. Oh, Bernadette, please play my clarinet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard Wow, that’s hard to believe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 priya Yes. And for years, everyone in my family was convinced that he was the clarinet enthusiast. Hmm. What’s that piece of tape?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard Oh, that one doesn’t apply to you. You sit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard Hey!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 penny Hey! How’s it going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard Not too bad. Did you hear about Howard and Bernadette?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 penny ‘Course I heard about it. How did you hear about it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard I heard about it from Sheldon. He got it from Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 penny Oh, damn it. I told Amy that in the strictest confidence. Boy, some people are such blabbermouths. Well, whatever, I’m sure Bernadette can do better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard Do you think a sexually ambivalent Indian astrophysicist with selective mutism and alcohol issues is better than a hundred-pound Jewish guy who lives with his mom?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 penny You are kidding. Raj likes Bernadette?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard I didn’t say Raj. Who said Raj?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 penny Okay, give. How do you know? Did he tell you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 penny Well, then who?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard I can’t say.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 penny Priya told you. What a little gossip. You know, not an attractive quality in a woman, Leonard. Not judging, just my opinion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard Well, The point is, if this got out, it would destroy Howard and Raj’s friendship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 penny You don’t have to worry. Unlike Amy and Priya, I know how to keep a secret.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard You’re the one who told Amy in the first place.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 penny In confidence!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 raj Hello, Mummy. Hello, Daddy. How are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 mrs_koothrappali We’re very rich in a very poor country. So, all in all, can’t complain.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 dr_koothrappali So, Priya, how are enjoying staying with your brother?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 priya It’s fine. But if I’m going to stay in Los Angeles much longer, I think I should get my own place.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 mrs_koothrappali Why? Is Rajesh not making you feel comfortable? Rajesh, why aren’t you making your sister comfortable?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 raj I am making her comfortable. Besides, she’s not sleeping here half the time anyway.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 dr_koothrappali What? Where are you sleeping, Priya?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 priya It’s a figure of speech, Daddy. It means I-I work late.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 mrs_koothrappali Please tell me you’re not dating an American. I knew this would happen. Rajesh, are you letting your sister date that little Howard boy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 dr_koothrappali Now, hold on. If she is dating an American, that’s not a bad way to go. He’s Jewish. Those chaps are very successful, and they don’t drink a lot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 raj It, it doesn’t matter. Howard has a girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 priya For now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 raj What does that mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 priya I’ll tell you later.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 raj Is something going on with him and Bernadette?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 mrs_koothrappali Who’s Bernadette?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 dr_koothrappali Doesn’t sound Jewish.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 mrs_koothrappali You can’t tell by that. Winona Ryder is Jewish.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 dr_koothrappali Okay, we’re getting off the subject. Rajesh, I want you to try harder to make your sister feel welcome.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 priya Thank you, Daddy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 raj Don’t worry. Everything I have, I share with her. Including my friend Leon…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 priya Good night, Mummy. Good night, Daddy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 raj Oh, my God, I think you broke my toe!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 priya Well you should have kept your mouth shut.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 raj Fair enough. Now, what’s up with Clarinet? Bernadette!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon I’ve been thinking about Dr. Greene’s efforts to make science palatable for the masses.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard Oh, yeah? What about it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon That’s all. I’ve just been thinking about it. Now, I’m thinking about fractal equations. Now I’m thinking about the origin of the phrase train of thought. Now I’m thinking about trains.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 raj Are you listening to this guy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 howard Hmm? Oh, I’m sorry. I was somewhere else.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard Lucky bastard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon Now I’m thinking about Jell-O.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 raj So what’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 howard It’s a Bernadette thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 raj Oh, no. I hope everything’s okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard Whatever it is, we’re here for you. You can tell us anything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 raj Yeah. Good or devastating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 howard I’m gonna ask her to marry me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard Marry you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 raj What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 howard Yeah. I just need to figure out the right time to pop the question.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard Oh, I’d wait.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 raj No rush, no rush.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 howard Oh, great. It’s my cousin David about the ring. Hey, David, what’d you find? Oh, sure, a half a carat’s fine. Her freakishly small hands make anything look big. It’s one of the reasons I love her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard Man, he’s going to be blindsided.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 raj I know. It’ll be awful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon Why are you smiling?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard Yeah, Raj, why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 raj Uh, a smile means something different in my country. You know, tears of joy, smile of sadness. India’s a goofy place.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon Oh, I’m back to trains. Woo-woo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 amy Did I tell you our lab got a grant to study addiction?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 amy Fascinating work. I recently trained a capuchin monkey to smoke cigarettes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon Have you learned anything?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 amy Yes. He looks much cooler than the non-smoking monkeys. Although it’s not much of a contest. The other monkeys just sit around and masturbate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon If you don’t mind, I’d like to stop listening to you and start talking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 amy By all means.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon Howard has announced his intention to propose marriage to Bernadette.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 amy I don’t understand. The original piece of gossip indicated an impending breakup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon I know. The group consensus is that his proposal will be met with an humiliating, soul-crushing rejection. Everyone was set a-twitter. Although oddly, no one tweeted.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 amy It’s not surprising that the story has captured the attention of our little circle of friends. Are you familiar with meme theory?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon I’m familiar with everything, but go on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 amy Meme theory suggests that items of gossip are like living things that seek to reproduce using humans as their host.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon I’m no stranger to memetic epidemiology. At Johnson Elementary School, the phrase Shelly Cooper’s a smelly pooper spread like wildfire.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 amy I should think so. That’s gold.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon Your meme hypothesis does intrigue me. How might we examine this more closely?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 amy Do you have any ethical qualms regarding human experimentation?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon It’s one of the few forms of interaction with people that I don’t find repellent.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 amy We need to fabricate a tantalizing piece of gossip.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon And a second non-tantalizing piece to use as a control.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 amy Then we’ll track its progress through our social group and interpret the results through the competing academic prisms of memetic theory, algebraic gossip and epidemiology.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon Look at you, getting me to engage in the social sciences. You’re a vixen, Amy Farrah Fowler.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 penny Oh, hey, Amy. What’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 amy Sheldon and I engaged in sexual intercourse. In other news, I’m thinking of starting an herb garden. Mum’s the word. Gotta go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 bernadette Oh, hey, Raj, what are you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 raj I just felt like drinking alone, because I’m deep and dark.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 bernadette Uh-huh. So, uh, Howard’s not here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 raj No. It’s just one of those times when it’s just you and me. Like when the three of us went to the movies and you and I waited outside the bathroom while Howard threw up Red Vines and Cherry Coke. Do you remember that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 bernadette Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 raj Me, too. Good times.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 penny Hey, 16 wants to order appetizers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 bernadette Oh, thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 raj This was nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 penny What the hell are you doing? Howard is your best friend, and that is his girlfriend. You should be ashamed of yourself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 raj I was when I came in, but it’s amazing what liquor does to guilt. Besides what you might not know is, Bernadette is planning on breaking up with Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 penny Well, I know that. How do you know that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 raj My sister told me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 penny Oh, that gossipy bitch! No offense.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 raj None taken. You should hear how she talks about you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 penny Okay, listen, just because Howard and Bernadette are having problems, does not mean you should be here sniffing around.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 raj What can I do? I can’t stop thinking about her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 penny All right, try thinking about this. Sheldon and Amy had sex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 raj Shut your ass!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 penny Yeah, it’s true. Amy told me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 raj How did that even happen? Did they know that’s what they were doing when they were doing it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 penny I-I guess they just figured it out at some point.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 raj Wow. I can’t believe old Smelly Pooper finally got laid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard Hope you’re hungry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon Interesting. A friendly sentiment in this country, cruel taunt in the Sudan. It’s a lesson in context.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard Will Amy be joining us for dinner?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon Yes, I believe so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard Good, good. Everything okay between you two?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon Yes. Why do you ask?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard No reason. I was just talking to Raj, and he mentioned what a lovely glow she has these days.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon Did he mean as if she’d been out in the sun, tending an herb garden without wearing a hat or sunblock?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard No. That’s not what he meant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon Well, we may never know. As my mother would say, the Asians are an inscrutable folk. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have work to do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard Yeah, you do. You dog, you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon Did you get that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 amy Every word. Our false gossip meme appears to have reached node lambda.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon This is moving faster than we thought.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 amy Agreed. It appears the rate of gossip transmission is proportional to the number of nodes squared.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon I must say, Amy, pretending to have intercourse with you is giving me a great deal of satisfaction.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 amy Slow down, Sheldon. I’m not quite there yet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard Pass the soy sauce.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 howard Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 amy Bernadette just asked about my sexual encounter with you. The meme has reached full penetration.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon Pun intended?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 amy No. Happy accident.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon This is remarkable. Took less than 24 hours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 amy I should let you know that she asked for details about our dalliance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon Interesting. So it went beyond the mere fact of coitus to a blow by blow, as it were.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 amy Pun intended?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon I’m sorry. What pun?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 amy Not important. I described your lovemaking as aloof, but effective.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon I wish you hadn’t done that. That’s going to make me a chick magnet, and I’m so busy as it is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 howard Hey, everybody, I got something I want to ask Bernadette, and I can’t think of a better time than when I’m with all my friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard Oh, hold on, Howard. There’s lots of better times.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 raj Leonard, please. The man is talking. Let him get it out, and let the chips fall where they may.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 howard Thank you. Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 bernadette Oh, God. What’s happening?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 howard I know things haven’t been perfect with us, and we’ve had our problems, but I just have to tell you, from the moment I…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 bernadette Howard, let me just stop you right here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 raj This is it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 bernadette Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 howard Yes, what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 bernadette Yes, I will marry you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 howard You will?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 raj You will?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 bernadette I will. I will!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 howard Oh, I love you so much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 bernadette Oh, I love you, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard Congratulations!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 priya Oh, it’s so exciting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 amy I wonder what changed her mind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 sheldon Perhaps your talk of my sexual prowess renewed her faith in love.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 amy As good an explanation as any.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard That’s great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 penny Oh, hey, Amy. Bernadette just texted me. Howard proposed?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 amy Yes, not important. Just stopped by to let you know I’m getting orthotics. Also, I’m carrying Sheldon’s baby. Mum’s the word.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 leonard You’re pregnant?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode20 amy Wow. Is there anything on there about orthotics?
