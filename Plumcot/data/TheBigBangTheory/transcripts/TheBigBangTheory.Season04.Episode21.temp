TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon Leonard, are you in the shower?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard I can’t hear you, I’m in the shower.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon I asked if you were in the shower, but that’s moot now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon Moot. Rendered unimportant by recent events.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard I can’t hear you, I’m in the shower.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon I have to skip the chitchat. Emergency.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard What kind of emergency?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon Mathematical. 32-ounce banana smoothie, 16-ounce bladder.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard You might not want to do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon I assure you I do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard Sheldon, I’m not alone in here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 priya Hello, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon What are you doing in there? She can’t be in here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard We were in here first, you can’t be in here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon According to the roommate agreement, paragraph nine, subsection B, the right to bathroom privacy is suspended in the event of force majeure. And believe me, I am experiencing a very majeure force.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon Come on, you can’t wait two minutes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 priya Oh, Leonard, let the man pee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon Penny? Penny? Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon Move. Move. Move!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon Dr. Leonard Hofstadter, you are officially charged with two violations of the roommate agreement. Do you waive reading of the charges?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard Yeah, fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 priya Hang on. No, my client does not waive reading of the charges.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard Oh. Cool. I’ve got a lawyer. And I’ve seen her naked.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 priya Proceed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon Very well. Count the first, on or about the 28th day of April, the accused did knowingly and with malice aforethought deny access to the shared bathroom in a time of emergency, to wit, my back teeth were floating. Count the second, the accused exceeded the agreed upon occupancy of the shower, to wit, one, unless we are under attack by water-soluble aliens.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 priya Can I see the roommate agreement?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon Um, it’s fairly technical.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 priya I think I can handle it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard Top of her class, Cambridge University. Licensed to practice law in three countries. And your face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 priya All right, based on a cursory reading, it doesn’t look like you have much of a case, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon Do so, do so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 priya Oh, I’m afraid not. Section seven here, on the right to enter the bathroom in emergency situations, is not specific as to what constitutes an emergency.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon Oh, that’s ridiculous. A bathroom emergency is self-explanatory.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 priya Is it? If Leonard forgot to trim his nose hair, could he barge in while you were showering?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon Irrelevant. Leonard doesn’t trim his nose hair. He thinks because he’s short nobody can see up there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 priya My point is, Sheldon, the legal principle is ambiguity in a contract benefits the party that did not draft it, in this case, Leonard. So much for count one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon But…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 priya There’s no buts, Sheldon, that’s how the law works.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard Schooled!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 priya As for the shower capacity issue, I cite addendum J. When Sheldon showers second, any and all measures shall be taken to ensure an adequate supply of hot water. I believe this supercedes the occupancy issue.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard Superceded!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon This isn’t over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard No offence, but shower sex with you is now the second best thing that’s happened today.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 raj Mmm, Greek food on pizza night? This is the most delightfully cruel thing we’ve done to Sheldon since we left that fake message from Stephen Hawking on his voice mail.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 priya Seriously?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 howard I wish to discuss your theories of black holes. Meet me at the Randy’s Donut by the airport at 2:00 a.m.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon What is that you’re eating? Tonight is pizza night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard I’d like to refer that to my attorney.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 priya According to what I see here, Thursday nights are Franconi’s pizza night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon Yes, and when Franconi’s went out of business, we switched to Graziano’s.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 howard That’s interesting. Can you just switch restaurants like that, Priya?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 priya A good question, Howard. Turns out you can’t. According to the document you drew up, Sheldon, the selection of a new takeout restaurant requires public hearings and a 60-day comment period. Were those criteria met?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 all Opa!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon This is Greek food? Leonard, you hate Greek food.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard Not as much as you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon Fine. I’m nothing if not adaptable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard I got you the lamb kabob.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon Thank you. If you think about it, Greek food isn’t that far from italian food. They share a spice palette. And what a civilization is the Greeks. They gave us science, democracy, and little cubes of charred meat that taste like sweat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon Penny? Penny? Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 penny Hey. What’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon The mean Indian lady tried to make me eat lamb. Congratulations. Pizza night will now be at your apartment. Order one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 penny Oh, I’m sorry, honey, I’m meeting Amy and Bernadette for dinner. But you’re welcome to tag along.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon A girls night? Oh, I don’t know if I’m up for an evening talking about rainbows, unicorns and menstrual cramps.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 penny Okay, suit yourself. We’ll probably be trashing Priya a little.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon Shotgun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 penny Okay, I’d like to propose a toast to a wonderful girls night out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy Fair warning, we can get ker-razy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 bernadette Yeah. Last week we smoked cigars and pretended to be dragons.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon Really, Amy? Tobacco and alcohol? Need I remind you not a lot of scientific discoveries were made by people having a good time?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy Why did you bring him? He’s harshing my buzz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 penny I felt sorry for him. Priya’s giving him a hard time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 bernadette Ooh, the Priya bashing’s starting early. Yay! Okay, what’s up with those pantsuits?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy I need some context.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 penny Pantsuits suck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy And that opens her up To justifiable ridicule for wearing them. Good one, Bernadette. See? Ker-razy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 bernadette Whee-ee-ee!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy You smell like baby powder.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon It’s talc. But as that’s a primary ingredient of baby powder, I understand your confusion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy Oh, I’m not confused at all. You’re like a sexy toddler.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon I don’t know how to process that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 bernadette I do. Amy and Sheldon sitting in a tree. K-I-S-S-S-S-I-N-G.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 penny That’s too many S’s for kissing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 bernadette Not if they’re doing it for a long time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 penny Sheldon, have you ever kissed a girl?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon Other than my mother, my sister and my mee-maw, no. But in the interest of full disclosure, I was once on a bus and had to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to an elderly nun who passed out from heat exhaustion. Every year I get a Christmas card from her, signed with far too many X’s and O’s.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 bernadette That doesn’t count. Aren’t you even a little curious?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 penny Yeah, you’re a scientist, where is the curiosity?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy I’m available for experimentation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon Thank you. Not necessary. We know everything there is to know about kissing. It requires 34 facial muscles and 112 postural muscles.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy Oh, blah, blah, blah. Give me some sugar, bestie .
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon I’m certainly glad no one said they were curious about Aztec human sacrifice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 penny Hey, I know, let’s take Sheldon dancing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 bernadette Oh, I totally want to see Sheldon dance. I bet he looks like a spider on a hot plate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon No, thank you, but for the record, I’m an excellent dancer. Proficient in the rumba, waltz and cha-cha.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon I don’t see why that’s surprising. I excel at so many things. You’ve had my sourdough bread.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 penny Did you take dance lessons?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon Against my will. In the South, pre-adolescent children are forced through a process called cotillion, which indoctrinates them with all the social graces and dance skills needed to function in 18th century Vienna.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 penny Oh, we are so taking you dancing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon No, you most certainly are not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 bernadette Well, what does your cotillion training say is expected of a gentleman when three ladies ask him to escort them to a dance soiree?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon I saved a nun’s life. Why am I being punished?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 penny Take us to a place we can waltz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 taxi_driver Where you can what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon Waltz. It’s a social dance from Austria, choreographed to a three-four time signature. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 taxi_driver Here we go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy I kissed a girl and I liked it, I hope my boyfriend don’t mind it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon What happened to you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 penny Shake it baby, shake it!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 bernadette Muy caliente, Sheldon!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 elderly_korean_gentleman Care to dance?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 bernadette Oh, I’m sorry, I’m engaged.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 korean How about you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 penny Oh, what the hell. Ooh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy How come if we’re the smart people, we don’t do this every night?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon What’s 16 times 14?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy My burps taste like cranberry juice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon And there’s your answer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy Would you like to come in for a nightcap?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon If you’re referring to the beverage, you know I don’t drink. If you’re referring to the hat you don while wearing a nightshirt and holding a candle, I have one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy I have yoo-hoo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon It’s hard to say no to yoo-hoo. The name literally beckons.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy Make yourself comfortable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon Thank you. Is someone smoking?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy Oh, that’s just Ricky.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon You own a smoking monkey?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy Don’t be silly. He’s one of the animals in my department’s nicotine addiction study.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon What’s he doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy I’m giving him emphysema. The least I can do is let him hang out and watch cable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon Remarkable. Aren’t you worried about secondhand smoke?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy A little. The real danger is him biting my face off while I’m sleeping.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon is he deliberately blowing smoke at me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy Yeah. He’s kind of an ass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon Thank you. May I share something with you that’s troubling me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy Of course. What’s rattling around that big bulbous brain of yours?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon Priya has essentially nullified my roommate agreement with Leonard, making life in the apartment very uncomfortable for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy And you want me to kill her? Done.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon No, of course not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy I trained Ricky how to smoke. I can train him to shoot a poison dart. No jury would convict us ’cause people love monkeys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon I understand the alcohol has stirred up whatever it is that makes girls go wild, but I really need to talk to smart Amy now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy Excuse me. Have you considered that your intelligence might be the very thing causing your dilemma?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy What do you think Ricky over here would do if an interloper encroached on his territory?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon Well, when challenged, monkeys generally assert their dominance through chasing, assault and a stylized penile display. That’s a little outside my comfort zone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy You’re being too literal. My point is, he would not meekly surrender to the rules, and neither should you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon Are you suggesting I play dirty?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy Yes, dirty. Dirty, dirty, dirty. Which brings me to our next order of business. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon Fascinating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy I hope you don’t take what I’m about to do as a comment on what we just did. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon Who’s to say you shouldn’t be dissecting our brains? You really are an ass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard Morning, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon Oh, good, you’re up. I’ve written a new and improved roommate agreement that benefits me greatly. I’d like you to sign it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard Why would I want to do that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon Excellent question. Do you remember what happened to the alien, played by talented character actor Frank Gorshin, in the Star Trek episode Let That Be Your Last Battlefield?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard Uh, Captain Kirk activated the self-destruct sequence and threatened to blow up the Enterpriseand kill them both unless he gave in?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon Affirmative. Computer, this is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Activate self-destruct sequence. Code 1-1-A-2-B.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 female_voice Self-destruct sequence activated.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard What are you gonna do, Sheldon, blow up the apartment?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon That was my first thought, but all my cool stuff is here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 priya So what happens when it counts down?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon Unless Leonard signs the new agreement in the next 41 seconds, this computer will send an e-mail to your parents in India saying that you’re in a secret relationship with the whiter-than-marshmallow-fluff Leonard Hofstadter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 priya Oh, my God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard What’s the big deal?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 priya Trust me, it’s a big deal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard They’re gonna find out about me eventually, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 priya Yeah, of course, just not today.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon 20 seconds.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard Are you ashamed of me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 priya Of course not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard Then why can’t we tell your parents?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 priya Please, don’t push this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon He does that all the time, doesn’t he? 15.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 priya Okay, fine, Sheldon, you win. Turn it off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard No, he’s bluffing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon I never bluff. Ten.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard It’s blackmail!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon Nine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 priya We give up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon Eight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard This is ridiculous. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon It’s a laptop with a full charge.
