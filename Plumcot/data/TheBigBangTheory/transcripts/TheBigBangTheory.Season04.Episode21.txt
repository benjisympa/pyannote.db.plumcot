TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Leonard, are you in the shower?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard_hofstadter I can’t hear you, I’m in the shower.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper I asked if you were in the shower, but that’s moot now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Moot. Rendered unimportant by recent events.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard_hofstadter I can’t hear you, I’m in the shower.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper I have to skip the chitchat. Emergency.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard_hofstadter What kind of emergency?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Mathematical. 32-ounce banana smoothie, 16-ounce bladder.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard_hofstadter You might not want to do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper I assure you I do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, I’m not alone in here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 priya_koothrappali Hello, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper What are you doing in there? She can’t be in here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard_hofstadter We were in here first, you can’t be in here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper According to the roommate agreement, paragraph nine, subsection B, the right to bathroom privacy is suspended in the event of force majeure. And believe me, I am experiencing a very majeure force.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Come on, you can’t wait two minutes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 priya_koothrappali Oh, Leonard, let the man pee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Penny? Penny? Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Move. Move. Move!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Dr. Leonard Hofstadter, you are officially charged with two violations of the roommate agreement. Do you waive reading of the charges?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 priya_koothrappali Hang on. No, my client does not waive reading of the charges.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard_hofstadter Oh. Cool. I’ve got a lawyer. And I’ve seen her naked.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 priya_koothrappali Proceed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Very well. Count the first, on or about the 28th day of April, the accused did knowingly and with malice aforethought deny access to the shared bathroom in a time of emergency, to wit, my back teeth were floating. Count the second, the accused exceeded the agreed upon occupancy of the shower, to wit, one, unless we are under attack by water-soluble aliens.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 priya_koothrappali Can I see the roommate agreement?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Um, it’s fairly technical.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 priya_koothrappali I think I can handle it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard_hofstadter Top of her class, Cambridge University. Licensed to practice law in three countries. And your face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 priya_koothrappali All right, based on a cursory reading, it doesn’t look like you have much of a case, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Do so, do so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 priya_koothrappali Oh, I’m afraid not. Section seven here, on the right to enter the bathroom in emergency situations, is not specific as to what constitutes an emergency.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Oh, that’s ridiculous. A bathroom emergency is self-explanatory.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 priya_koothrappali Is it? If Leonard forgot to trim his nose hair, could he barge in while you were showering?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Irrelevant. Leonard doesn’t trim his nose hair. He thinks because he’s short nobody can see up there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 priya_koothrappali My point is, Sheldon, the legal principle is ambiguity in a contract benefits the party that did not draft it, in this case, Leonard. So much for count one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper But…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 priya_koothrappali There’s no buts, Sheldon, that’s how the law works.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard_hofstadter Schooled!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 priya_koothrappali As for the shower capacity issue, I cite addendum J. When Sheldon showers second, any and all measures shall be taken to ensure an adequate supply of hot water. I believe this supercedes the occupancy issue.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard_hofstadter Superceded!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper This isn’t over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard_hofstadter No offence, but shower sex with you is now the second best thing that’s happened today.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 raj_koothrappali Mmm, Greek food on pizza night? This is the most delightfully cruel thing we’ve done to Sheldon since we left that fake message from Stephen Hawking on his voice mail.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 priya_koothrappali Seriously?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 howard_wolowitz I wish to discuss your theories of black holes. Meet me at the Randy’s Donut by the airport at 2:00 a.m.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper What is that you’re eating? Tonight is pizza night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard_hofstadter I’d like to refer that to my attorney.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 priya_koothrappali According to what I see here, Thursday nights are Franconi’s pizza night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Yes, and when Franconi’s went out of business, we switched to Graziano’s.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 howard_wolowitz That’s interesting. Can you just switch restaurants like that, Priya?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 priya_koothrappali A good question, Howard. Turns out you can’t. According to the document you drew up, Sheldon, the selection of a new takeout restaurant requires public hearings and a 60-day comment period. Were those criteria met?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 all@ Opa!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper This is Greek food? Leonard, you hate Greek food.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard_hofstadter Not as much as you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Fine. I’m nothing if not adaptable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard_hofstadter I got you the lamb kabob.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Thank you. If you think about it, Greek food isn’t that far from italian food. They share a spice palette. And what a civilization is the Greeks. They gave us science, democracy, and little cubes of charred meat that taste like sweat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Penny? Penny? Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 penny Hey. What’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper The mean Indian lady tried to make me eat lamb. Congratulations. Pizza night will now be at your apartment. Order one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 penny Oh, I’m sorry, honey, I’m meeting Amy and Bernadette for dinner. But you’re welcome to tag along.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper A girls night? Oh, I don’t know if I’m up for an evening talking about rainbows, unicorns and menstrual cramps.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 penny Okay, suit yourself. We’ll probably be trashing Priya a little.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Shotgun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 penny Okay, I’d like to propose a toast to a wonderful girls night out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy_farrah_fowler Fair warning, we can get ker-razy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah. Last week we smoked cigars and pretended to be dragons.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Really, Amy? Tobacco and alcohol? Need I remind you not a lot of scientific discoveries were made by people having a good time?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy_farrah_fowler Why did you bring him? He’s harshing my buzz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 penny I felt sorry for him. Priya’s giving him a hard time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 bernadette_rostenkowski Ooh, the Priya bashing’s starting early. Yay! Okay, what’s up with those pantsuits?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy_farrah_fowler I need some context.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 penny Pantsuits suck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy_farrah_fowler And that opens her up To justifiable ridicule for wearing them. Good one, Bernadette. See? Ker-razy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 bernadette_rostenkowski Whee-ee-ee!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy_farrah_fowler You smell like baby powder.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper It’s talc. But as that’s a primary ingredient of baby powder, I understand your confusion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, I’m not confused at all. You’re like a sexy toddler.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper I don’t know how to process that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 bernadette_rostenkowski I do. Amy and Sheldon sitting in a tree. K-I-S-S-S-S-I-N-G.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 penny That’s too many S’s for kissing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 bernadette_rostenkowski Not if they’re doing it for a long time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 penny Sheldon, have you ever kissed a girl?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Other than my mother, my sister and my mee-maw, no. But in the interest of full disclosure, I was once on a bus and had to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to an elderly nun who passed out from heat exhaustion. Every year I get a Christmas card from her, signed with far too many X’s and O’s.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 bernadette_rostenkowski That doesn’t count. Aren’t you even a little curious?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 penny Yeah, you’re a scientist, where is the curiosity?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy_farrah_fowler I’m available for experimentation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Thank you. Not necessary. We know everything there is to know about kissing. It requires 34 facial muscles and 112 postural muscles.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, blah, blah, blah. Give me some sugar, bestie .
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper I’m certainly glad no one said they were curious about Aztec human sacrifice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 penny Hey, I know, let’s take Sheldon dancing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, I totally want to see Sheldon dance. I bet he looks like a spider on a hot plate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper No, thank you, but for the record, I’m an excellent dancer. Proficient in the rumba, waltz and cha-cha.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy_farrah_fowler Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper I don’t see why that’s surprising. I excel at so many things. You’ve had my sourdough bread.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 penny Did you take dance lessons?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Against my will. In the South, pre-adolescent children are forced through a process called cotillion, which indoctrinates them with all the social graces and dance skills needed to function in 18th century Vienna.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 penny Oh, we are so taking you dancing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper No, you most certainly are not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 bernadette_rostenkowski Well, what does your cotillion training say is expected of a gentleman when three ladies ask him to escort them to a dance soiree?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper I saved a nun’s life. Why am I being punished?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 penny Take us to a place we can waltz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 taxi_driver#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 Where you can what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Waltz. It’s a social dance from Austria, choreographed to a three-four time signature.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 taxi_driver#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 Here we go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy_farrah_fowler I kissed a girl and I liked it, I hope my boyfriend don’t mind it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper What happened to you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 penny Shake it baby, shake it!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 bernadette_rostenkowski Muy caliente, Sheldon!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 elderly_korean_gentleman#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 Care to dance?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, I’m sorry, I’m engaged.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 korean#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 How about you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 penny Oh, what the hell. Ooh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy_farrah_fowler How come if we’re the smart people, we don’t do this every night?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper What’s 16 times 14?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy_farrah_fowler My burps taste like cranberry juice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper And there’s your answer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy_farrah_fowler Would you like to come in for a nightcap?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper If you’re referring to the beverage, you know I don’t drink. If you’re referring to the hat you don while wearing a nightshirt and holding a candle, I have one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy_farrah_fowler I have yoo-hoo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper It’s hard to say no to yoo-hoo. The name literally beckons.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy_farrah_fowler Make yourself comfortable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Thank you. Is someone smoking?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, that’s just Ricky.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper You own a smoking monkey?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy_farrah_fowler Don’t be silly. He’s one of the animals in my department’s nicotine addiction study.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper What’s he doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy_farrah_fowler I’m giving him emphysema. The least I can do is let him hang out and watch cable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Remarkable. Aren’t you worried about secondhand smoke?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy_farrah_fowler A little. The real danger is him biting my face off while I’m sleeping.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper is he deliberately blowing smoke at me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy_farrah_fowler Yeah. He’s kind of an ass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Thank you. May I share something with you that’s troubling me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy_farrah_fowler Of course. What’s rattling around that big bulbous brain of yours?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Priya has essentially nullified my roommate agreement with Leonard, making life in the apartment very uncomfortable for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy_farrah_fowler And you want me to kill her? Done.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper No, of course not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy_farrah_fowler I trained Ricky how to smoke. I can train him to shoot a poison dart. No jury would convict us ’cause people love monkeys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper I understand the alcohol has stirred up whatever it is that makes girls go wild, but I really need to talk to smart Amy now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy_farrah_fowler Excuse me. Have you considered that your intelligence might be the very thing causing your dilemma?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy_farrah_fowler What do you think Ricky over here would do if an interloper encroached on his territory?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Well, when challenged, monkeys generally assert their dominance through chasing, assault and a stylized penile display. That’s a little outside my comfort zone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy_farrah_fowler You’re being too literal. My point is, he would not meekly surrender to the rules, and neither should you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Are you suggesting I play dirty?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy_farrah_fowler Yes, dirty. Dirty, dirty, dirty. Which brings me to our next order of business.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Fascinating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 amy_farrah_fowler I hope you don’t take what I’m about to do as a comment on what we just did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Who’s to say you shouldn’t be dissecting our brains? You really are an ass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard_hofstadter Morning, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Oh, good, you’re up. I’ve written a new and improved roommate agreement that benefits me greatly. I’d like you to sign it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard_hofstadter Why would I want to do that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Excellent question. Do you remember what happened to the alien, played by talented character actor Frank Gorshin, in the Star Trek episode Let That Be Your Last Battlefield?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard_hofstadter Uh, Captain Kirk activated the self-destruct sequence and threatened to blow up the Enterpriseand kill them both unless he gave in?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Affirmative. Computer, this is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Activate self-destruct sequence. Code 1-1-A-2-B.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 female_voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 Self-destruct sequence activated.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard_hofstadter What are you gonna do, Sheldon, blow up the apartment?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper That was my first thought, but all my cool stuff is here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 priya_koothrappali So what happens when it counts down?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Unless Leonard signs the new agreement in the next 41 seconds, this computer will send an e-mail to your parents in India saying that you’re in a secret relationship with the whiter-than-marshmallow-fluff Leonard Hofstadter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 priya_koothrappali Oh, my God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard_hofstadter What’s the big deal?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 priya_koothrappali Trust me, it’s a big deal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard_hofstadter They’re gonna find out about me eventually, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 priya_koothrappali Yeah, of course, just not today.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper 20 seconds.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard_hofstadter Are you ashamed of me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 priya_koothrappali Of course not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard_hofstadter Then why can’t we tell your parents?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 priya_koothrappali Please, don’t push this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper He does that all the time, doesn’t he? 15.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 priya_koothrappali Okay, fine, Sheldon, you win. Turn it off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard_hofstadter No, he’s bluffing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper I never bluff. Ten.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard_hofstadter It’s blackmail!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Nine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 priya_koothrappali We give up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Eight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 leonard_hofstadter This is ridiculous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode21 sheldon_cooper It’s a laptop with a full charge.
