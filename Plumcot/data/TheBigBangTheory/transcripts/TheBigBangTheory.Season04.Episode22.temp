TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 amy I must say, Penny, this is great fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 penny Glad you’re enjoying yourself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 amy Until I met you and Bernadette, my trips to the bathroom had been entirely focused on elimination. Now they have a delightful social aspect.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 bernadette Amy, you must’ve been in the bathroom with other women before.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 amy Of course I have. But they were strangers and seemed off-put when I engaged in friendly stall-to-stall chit-chat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 bernadette Some women don’t like to get chummy when their panties are down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 amy You okay in there, bestie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 penny I’m fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 amy The reason I ask is that many people experience bladder shyness, the inability to pass urine
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 penny Yeah, I said I’m fine. Stop talking to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 amy She always this crabby when she urinates?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 bernadette We’re really not that close.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 penny Screw it. I’ll go later.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 amy And I’ll be right by your side.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 bernadette Did I tell you Priya invited me and Howard to have dinner with her and Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 penny Oh, that’s nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 amy No, it’s not. It’s a strategic manoeuvre. Leonard’s new girlfriend is testing Bernadette’s loyalty to you and the group. That bitch is crafty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 bernadette You think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 amy Of course. How does the cheetah attack a herd of wildebeests? By going after its weakest member.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 bernadette Well, what makes me the weakest member?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 amy Your trusting nature coupled with your teeny-tiny body. You wouldn’t last a minute on the Serengeti.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 penny Okay, Amy, you’re being silly. I am not concerned about who hangs out with who. And I certainly don’t have a problem with Leonard’s new girlfriend who wears way too much makeup. Ooh, these are cute. Of course if I buy them, I’ll have to rent my womb out to a gay couple.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 bernadette It doesn’t matter. I’m going to tell her we can’t make it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 amy Oh, no. You have to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 bernadette I don’t understand. I thought I was a teeny-tiny wildebeest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 amy You are, with hair that smells like strawberries. And we’re going to use that to our advantage.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 penny Wait. What are you talking about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 amy By accepting the invitation, Bernadette becomes a double agent inside the enemy camp. She could ferret out Priya’s tactics, identify her weaknesses and feed her false information, such as, Leonard’s no stranger to back-alley cockfights.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 bernadette I don’t know. I’m not a very good liar. They kind of whup that out of you in Catholic school.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 amy Don’t worry. I’ll teach you. I did two years of Cub Scouts before they found out I was a girl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 penny Okay, I don’t know you people. I’m just an innocent woman wondering if this shoe store will take my Texaco card.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 amy How do you feel about concealing a recording device in the cleavage of your ample bosom?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 bernadette I don’t want anything in my ample bosom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 amy Come on, Strawberries. Take one for the team.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 leonard Okay, see you later.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 sheldon Good news. I finally have a handle on my idea for three-person chess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 leonard That is good news. Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 sheldon Uh, do you know how I solved the balanced centre combat-area problem? Five words, transitional quadrilateral to triangular tessellation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 leonard That, that’s brilliant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 sheldon It’s what I do. But wait, there’s more. I also invented two new chess pieces. The serpent, and the old woman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 leonard Okay, now I have to ask. What do they do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 sheldon When the serpent slithers to an opposing player’s piece, that piece is considered poisoned and will die after two more moves. Ugh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 leonard All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 sheldon Unless, it gets to the old woman in time, in which case she sucks out the poison, turning her into the Grand Empress, a piece combining the power of the knight, queen and serpent.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 leonard Elegant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 sheldon That’s because it’s simple.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 leonard Okay, well, I look forward to playing with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 sheldon And…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 leonard And what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 sheldon And a third person. It’s three-person chess. I must say, ever since you started having regular intercourse, your mind has lost its keen edge. You should reflect on that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 leonard Excuse me, but Einstein had a pretty busy sex life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 sheldon Yes, and he never unified gravity with the other forces. If he hadn’t been such a hound dog, we’d all have time machines.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 leonard Got it. Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 sheldon You know I’m right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 leonard I think he’s getting worse.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 amy Oh, my metatarsal are barking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 leonard You okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 amy Yeah, yeah. I’m just breaking in some new shoes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 leonard Very pretty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 amy Thank you. Did you know that women wear high heels to make the buttocks and breasts more prominent?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 leonard Hadn’t really thought about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 amy Look.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 leonard Uh, sure. Very… prominent.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 amy Please, Leonard, don’t leer, you have a girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 leonard Sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 amy So, are you off to dinner with Priya, Howard and Bernadette?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 leonard Yeah. How did you know?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 amy I heard it at the mall, when I was shopping with my girlfriends, ’cause, you know, that’s kind of my life now. Have a good night. Try not to ogle my caboose as I walk away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 priya Hey, you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 leonard Hi. Hey, Raj, will you be joining us for dinner?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 raj The lonely guy and the two happy couples? I’d rather get a prostate exam from a leper who walks away with nine fingers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 priya Oh, would you please stop feeling sorry for yourself?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 raj I have to feel sorry for myself. I’m the only one who cares. Just like I’m the only one who’ll have sex with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 leonard Really? In front of your sister?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 priya We shared a room growing up. This is not news to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 raj Excuse me. I’m going to go wander the streets alone. Invisible, unwanted and unloved, a pathetic shadow in a city with no heart. I forgot my windbreaker. It’s chilly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 amy I don’t understand. Is this a way to break in new shoes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 penny No. Once these puppies touch the ground they’re mine, and I’ll have to wear them walking up and down Hollywood Boulevard in order to pay them off. Pretty, pretty, pretty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 penny The what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 amy Bernadette is with Priya and Leonard. Message received. Commence operation “Priya Wouldn’t Wanna Be-ya.”
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 penny Hey. Seriously? Didn’t you get enough of this cliquey crap in high school?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 amy I wish. A clique requires friends. I didn’t have any.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 penny None?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 amy I used to take my lunch down to the maintenance room and eat with the janitor. It was nice until his wife called me a puta and made me stop. Hang on. It’s the wildebeest. Priya just made a snide comment about your acting career.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 penny Wh… What the hell did she say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 amy She thinks it’s cool you’re following your dream, no matter what.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 penny That bitch!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 amy How do you want to handle it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 penny Um, okay. Tell Bernadette to tell Priya that I’m on my way to Prague to shoot a movie with Angelina Jolie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 amy Got it. Is it going to be in 3-D?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 penny What? I don’t know. It doesn’t matter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 amy I’m gonna say 3-D. That’ll let her know the studio has faith in it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 leonard You’re kidding. 3-D?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 bernadette That’s what I hear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 howard Then the studio must have real faith in it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 leonard Wonder why she didn’t tell me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 priya Have you been spending time with your ex-girlfriend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 leonard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 priya Then why are you surprised she didn’t tell you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 leonard Well, it’s not as much surprised as, uh, uh, you know, uh. th-th-th-the other thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 priya What other thing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 leonard Well, you know, if you, if, if, if you, uh, I don’t, oh, what’s the word I’m looking for?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 howard I’m not going to help you. This is hilarious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 bernadette She’s also dating an astronaut.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 priya Wow. That’s very impressive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 bernadette Yeah. But Leonard’s impressive, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 leonard Thank you. Befuddled. The word I was looking for was befuddled.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 sheldon Knight to old woman six-and-a-third. Brilliant move. Thank you. Will the two of you excuse me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 raj I need a hug.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 sheldon Sorry, I have company.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 raj Come on, Sheldon, open the door.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 sheldon I don’t want to hug you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 raj I don’t want to hug you, either. I was just feeling blue.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 sheldon Blue, as in depressed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 raj Well, not so much depressed as lonely.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 sheldon I don’t know what colour lonely is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 raj What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 sheldon Red is angry, yellow is frightened, green is jealous and blue is depressed. Perhaps we can assign a colour to lonely.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 raj Nothing rhymes with orange. It’s probably lonely.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 sheldon All right. Come in. You look positively orange with loneliness. No, I don’t see that catching on at all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 raj What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 sheldon I’m working on my three-person chess game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 raj Oh, cool. Can I play?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 sheldon It’s three-person chess. Did you bring a friend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 raj No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 sheldon Then as a mental exercise I invite you to figure out why the two of us can’t play three-person chess. Can you believe this guy? Social protocol does, however, require me to bring you a hot beverage in your time of need.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 raj No, thank you. I’m fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 sheldon It’s not optional. We’re out of tea. I hope you like bouillon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 raj I, uh, I guess you’re probably wondering what’s got me down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 sheldon Actually, I was wondering if I could add a third new chess piece. How do you think people would feel about Prince Joey, the king’s feeble-minded but well-meaning cousin?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 raj I’m going to be 30 years old, and I have no one in my life to love me. I’m such a basket case, I can’t even talk to a woman without having alcohol in my body.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 sheldon The fun thing about Prince Joey is every time he moves, there’s a one-in-five chance he’ll kill himself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 raj Sheldon, listen to me. I have a big decision to make, and I’m scared.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 sheldon Yellow. Go ahead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 raj A friend at the School of Pharmacology gave me these new pills they’re testing. He says it’s the next big thing for social anxiety disorder.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 sheldon Fascinating. What’s in it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 raj I’m not sure. Some sort of beta-blocker attached to a molecule extracted from the urine of cows.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 sheldon I like cows.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 raj That’s not the point.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 sheldon It was its own point. Go on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 raj I’m a scientist. My ability to think is my bread and butter. I’m afraid if I take this, I might lose that special, unique something that makes me so successful in my field.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 sheldon Rajesh, I’ve had the privilege of working alongside you for many years. My recommendation is that you gobble these up like Tic Tacs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 howard Okay, I’m still trying to work this out. How did Penny meet an astronaut?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 bernadette I don’t know. The regular way people meet astronauts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 howard Most of those guys live in Texas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 bernadette Obviously, this one doesn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 howard Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 bernadette Leonard lives here. Priya’s from India. People meet, Howard. God!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 howard Fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 bernadette You’ve met lots of astronauts, and I’ve never grilled you about that. I’d thank you to extend me the same courtesy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 howard I’m not grilling you, I was just curious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 leonard I still can’t get over the fact that she got a big movie part. Not that I care what my ex-girlfriend’s up to, ’cause I don’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 bernadette Maybe that’s where she met the astronaut, all right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 priya I’m sorry. What would an astronaut be doing working on a movie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 bernadette He’s a consultant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 leonard I thought the movie was about 18th-century Vienna?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 bernadette He can’t have a hobby? Excuse me, I have to pee. Or is that implausible, as well?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 howard It’s nice to have another couple to hang with, isn’t it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 penny All right, guys, you have to go back. I can’t afford you. “No, don’t send
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 amy Good golly, Penny, your whimsy is boundless. What do you got for me, wildebeest?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 bernadette I think they’re on to me. The story’s starting to fall apart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 amy Calm down. Everything’s going to be okay. We may have to kill her. Bernadette, I’m putting you on speakerphone. Where are you now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 bernadette In the bathroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 amy Oh, look at this, another one of our classic bathroom gabfests. What’s the problem?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 bernadette They’re just asking me all sorts of questions I can’t answer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 amy Just change the subject.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 bernadette I suppose I could get them back to talking about Leonard going to India to meet Priya’s parents.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 bernadette They said something about going there this summer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 penny What, are they getting engaged?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 bernadette I don’t know. I was too busy covering my heinie on Amy’s stupid astronaut story!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 amy What astronaut story?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 bernadette You texted me Penny’s dating an astronaut.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 amy I texted architect. That’s amusing. Auto-correct must’ve changed it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 bernadette Yeah, it’s hysterical.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 penny All right, look, just forget about the astronaut.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 amy Architect. Where would you have met an astronaut?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 penny Look, just find out what’s up with this trip to India.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 bernadette I don’t want to do this anymore!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 penny Don’t you quit on us!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 howard Bernie, you okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 bernadette It was an architect!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 raj Thank you for coming with me, Sheldon. You’re a good friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 sheldon I’m glad you think so. That’s what I strive to emulate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 raj Okay, let’s see if this drug works.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 woman_at_table Can I help you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 raj Forgive me for staring, but you’re very beautiful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 woman Thank you. That’s a great accent. Where are you from?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 raj India.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 woman Oh, cool. I’ve always wanted to go there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 raj It’s a beautiful country. You’d love it. May I join you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 woman Uh, okay, sure. Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 raj My name is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali, and this is my friend Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 woman Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 sheldon Oh, there’s no need to interact with me. I’m just here to observe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 woman What’s he observing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 raj We’re scientists. We observe everything. Here, go buy yourself a scone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 sheldon All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 raj And what is your name?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 woman Angela.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 raj Oh, derived from the word angel. Appropriate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 angela You’re cute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 sheldon I’d like to buy a scone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 server Oh, I’m sorry, we’re out. We have muffins.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 sheldon They sound delicious, but this money is earmarked for scones.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 angela What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 raj Oh, just getting comfortable. So how long have you lived in Los Angeles?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 angela I…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 sheldon They were out of scones.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 raj Sheldon, I’m talking to someone. You’re being rude. I’ll bet you’re an actress. If not, you should be. You have a very expressive face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 angela Oh, my God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 raj Wait, where are you going? We were doing so well. She never even got to see my penis. Ta-da!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 priya Who wants some more coffee?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 leonard Thanks, yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 howard Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 bernadette Let me help you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 howard Nice to see that the gals are getting along.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 leonard Gals? Who are you, Fred Flintstone?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 bernadette This trip to India sounds fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 priya Yeah, I think it will be.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 bernadette Are you concerned your parents might not approve of Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 priya A little. They’re very old-fashioned.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 bernadette Well, I wouldn’t worry about it. It’s not like you guys are getting engaged, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 priya Oh, God, no. We’re not there yet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 bernadette Not engaged. Very interesting. I have to tinkle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 priya You’ve been in there a lot tonight. Are you okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 bernadette Yes. Are you writing a book?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 priya Why are you getting upset?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 bernadette I’m not upset. Maybe you’re upset.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 priya What’s up with you? Bernadette?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 bernadette I can’t do this anymore! I’m a good girl! I went to Catholic school! 
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 howard Okay, well, it’s getting late. This was terrific. You win. Bernie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 leonard I think the word you’re looking for is befuddled.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 sheldon My catapult flings my bishop to Howard’s Queen’s Gorilla two.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 howard Nice. Okay, rook to transporter pad. And he comes out at Leonard’s Queen’s Bishop
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 leonard Hang on. When is my pawn allowed to use the golf cart?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 sheldon When it’s done charging. Or you land on the time machine. Obviously.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 leonard Oh, oh, Beekeeper to King 12. I capture your Pope and release the swarm. Checkmate on Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 sheldon I knew I should have given my Pope the jet pack.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode22 raj Hey, I’ve got winners.
