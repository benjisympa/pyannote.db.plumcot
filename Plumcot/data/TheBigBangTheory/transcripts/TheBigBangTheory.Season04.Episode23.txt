TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 penny Hey, do me a favour and take table seven.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski You mean the one with my one hundred and eighteen-pound rock-hard stud of a fiancé who’s prone to canker sores and pinkeye?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 penny Nah, I prefer to look at it as the one with my ex-boyfriend and his gorgeous, successful and sophisticated girlfriend, who makes me feel like a toothless Okie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski Do you want me to spill hot soup on her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 penny Oh, please, you’re not that kind of person.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski I know. But if she orders something low-fat I’ll totally give her the full-fat version.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Uh, that’s my water.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 sheldon_cooper What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter My water. You’re drinking it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Dear Lord! Have you been drinking it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Yes. It’s my water.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Well, that’s it then. I’m dead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Here we go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 sheldon_cooper I’m sorry, do I really need to connect the dots for you? The backwash into this glass is every pathogen that calls your mouth home, sweet home. Not to mention the visitors who arrive on the dancing tongue of your subtropical girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Hey! That’s my sister and my country you’re talking about. Leonard may have defiled one, but I won’t have you talking smack about the other.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski You guys ready to order?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Yes, I’d like a seven-day course of penicillin, some, uh, syrup of ipecac, to induce vomiting, and a mint.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t understand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz He drank from Leonard’s glass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 sheldon_cooper He drank from Leonard’s glass. Words they’ll be carving into my tombstone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter That’s actually my napkin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Oh, this is a nightmare!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Where are you going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 sheldon_cooper To the bar, to sterilize my mouth with alcohol. Gang way! Dead man walking!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski All right. Here you go. Two lemonades, one iced tea and a root beer for Priya.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 priya_koothrappali Is it diet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski That’s what you ordered.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 priya_koothrappali Thank you. Hey, have you and Howard started planning your wedding yet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah. We’re thinking of having it on a cliff overlooking the ocean.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Nothing soothes those pre-wedding jitters like the thought of falling and drowning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter What did your mother say when you told her you were getting married?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski He hasn’t told her yet. He’s waiting for the right time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz I was thinking of weaving it into her eulogy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 priya_koothrappali Howard, you’ve got to tell your mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Hey, have you told your parents you’re dating this short glass of skim milk here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 priya_koothrappali Uh, that’s different. First of all, we’re not engaged, and second, Indian parents are very protective of their children.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Right, right, whereas Jewish mothers take a casual, la-di-da approach to their sons.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 sheldon_cooper I gargled with tequila and may have swallowed a teeny bit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter You all right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Fine. Thank you for asking. I love you so much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Fire demon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Ooh, fire demon. Sheldon’s turning up the heat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Troll master.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Check it! Howard pulls one out from under the bridge. Nice!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Water nymph.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Oh, yeah, she’s got puddles in all the right places.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Could you please play the game without commenting on every card?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Sorry. Walking tree.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Last one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 raj_koothrappali I’m taking a stroll and I’m sporting wood.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Okay, the Eagle has landed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Bernadette and my mother are having a get-to-know-you lunch at the Old Town Deli.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Oh, that sounds lovely.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Hope so. Of course, if history is any indication, my mother will swallow her whole and spit out her bones like an owl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Have you met Bernadette’s parents?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz You mean Adolf and Eva? Not yet. One goose step at a time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Sheldon, that’s my water.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Oh, dear Lord!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter That’s not your water.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 raj_koothrappali I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Where’s the mouthwash?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Where indeed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Ma, I’m home! Where are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 debbie_wolowitz I’m in the toilet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz So, how’d it go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 debbie_wolowitz Too soon to say. I’m not done yet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz No, I mean lunch, today, with Bernadette.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 debbie_wolowitz Oh! I had a pastrami sandwich. She had eggplant lasagna. Like that’s what a person orders in a Jewish deli.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Besides food, did you get along? Did you talk?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 debbie_wolowitz Oh, sure. Did you know she’s going to school to become a microbiologist?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz No, she never mentioned it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 debbie_wolowitz I bet she did and you didn’t listen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Yeah, that’s probably it. So, what do you think? Do you like her? She’s great, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 debbie_wolowitz She’s a lovely girl. Cute as a button.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz That’s good to hear, ’cause I’ve got some news.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 debbie_wolowitz I hope it’s good news, because I’ve got nothing but disappointment in here!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Bernadette and I are getting married. Ma? You too busy bearing down? Ma? Oh, my God, Ma? Ma? Ma? Stand back, I’m gonna break the door down! Son of a bitch! Ma, help!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 penny Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 penny Haven’t seen you in a while. How’s it going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Oh, other than waiting out the exponential growth period of the virulent organisms trooping through my microvilli into my circulatory system, hunky-dory. Did I say something amusing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 penny I don’t know, maybe, I have no idea what you said.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 sheldon_cooper So your mirth is merely a discharge of nervous energy with no semantic content at all?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 penny My mirth. Classic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Is there a station coming up where I can board your giggling train of thought?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 penny It’s not a big deal, Sheldon. It’s just, ever since Leonard’s been dating Raj’s sister, I’ve had to keep my distance. I don’t get to hear all your jibber-jabber.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Jibber-jabber? I don’t jibber-jabber.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 penny What are you doing at work these days?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Oh, I’m working on time-dependent backgrounds in string theory, specifically quantum field theory in D-dimensional de Sitter space.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 penny Alright, come on, even you have to admit that’s jibber-jabber.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Interesting, do you know where the phrase jibber-jabber comes from?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 penny Oh, my God, you’re about to jibber-jabber about jibber-jabber.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Howard and his mother are at the hospital. Come on, we gotta go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 penny Oh, my God! What happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter I don’t know, I just got a text. Come on, hurry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 penny Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, let’s go!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 sheldon_cooper To a hospital? Full of sick people? Oh, I don’t think so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 penny Okay, well, your friend and his mother are there, we’re going.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 sheldon_cooper I can’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 penny Oh, don’t tell me you’re afraid of germs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Not all germs. Just the ones that will kill me. It’s the same way I’m not afraid of all steak knives, just the ones that might be plunged in my thorax.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Right, fine. I’ll tell Howard you didn’t come because you’re more concerned about your own well-being than his.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 sheldon_cooper I would think he would know that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 penny Okay, you know what? You are unbelievable. You buy all these superhero T-shirts, but when it’s time for you to step up and do the right thing, you just hide in the laundry room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Fine, I’ll go. Just for the record, my Aunt Ruth died in a hospital. She went in to visit my Uncle Roger, caught something and bit the dust a week later. The two of them now share a coffee can on my mother’s mantel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz So I knocked down the bathroom door, picked up my poor unconscious mother, carried her to the car, and drove like a madman to the emergency room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski You’re a real hero, Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz No, I did what any son would do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 penny Hang on a second, you picked up your mother? Her own legs are barely able to do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz I was filled with adrenaline. It happens to be how women lift cars off babies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 penny Yeah, I’m saying, it’d be easier to lift a car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz What can I tell you? After I found the courage to put her pants back on, I was unstoppable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter So, how is she?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz They’re running tests. I don’t know. It may have been a heart attack or heart-attack-like event.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 penny What’s the difference?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 sheldon_cooper A heart-attack-like event is an event that’s like a heart attack.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 penny Thanks for clearing that up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Regardless, coronary problems are eminently treatable. What’s more likely going to kill Howard’s mother are the antibiotic-resistant super-bugs festering in every nook and cranny of this hospital.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 penny Okay, you’re not helping.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Disagree.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Go sit over there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 sheldon_cooper I’ll sit over there, it looks cleaner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Is there a history of heart disease in your family?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz My family is the history of heart disease. There’s a cave painting in France of one of my ancestors doing this .
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski So it’s probably genetic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Well, maybe. Mom also had just gotten some news that might have upset her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz It’s not important.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski Come on, Howard, I’m going to be your wife. You can share anything with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz You’d think that. But no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski You told her we were going to get married and she had a heart attack?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz You can’t take that personally.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 penny How else is she supposed to take it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz What you’ve got to keep in mind is that ever since my dad left, I’ve been the whole world to my mother. I mean, she’d be threatened by any woman who can give me what she can’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski You mean sexual intercourse?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Well, when you say it like that you make it sound creepy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 priya_koothrappali What happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski Howard’s mother had a heart attack because I have sex with him and she can’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Bernie, wait!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 sheldon_cooper I’ll give you $1,000 if you’ll drive me home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 priya_koothrappali Nice of you to come for Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 penny Well, he’s my friend. It’s what you do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 priya_koothrappali I’m sorry, did I miss something?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 penny It’s just so weird. Howard Wolowitz is my friend. You know, once he tried to stick his tongue down my throat and I broke his nose.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 priya_koothrappali That’s a little easier to believe than he’s your friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 penny Yeah, tell me about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 priya_koothrappali You know, my brother had a group of friends like this in India. They dressed up in leotards and goggles and called themselves the New Delhi Power Rangers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 penny You mean when he was little.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 priya_koothrappali Not as little as you’d want him to be.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 penny You know, this stuff is horrible. You want to see if we can find the cafeteria and get real coffee?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 priya_koothrappali Sure. We’re going to the cafeteria to get some coffee. You want anything?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter I’m fine. That’s nice that they’re getting along.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Your girlfriend and your ex-girlfriend are hanging out together? Oh, yeah, that can only be good for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter What are you talking about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 raj_koothrappali One of them broke up with you. Do you really want her telling the other one why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter I don’t care. I don’t have anything to hide.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Good, good. Then you have nothing to worry about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter No, I do not. You are a mean little man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 raj_koothrappali You’d think it’d be because my parents didn’t love me, but actually they loved me a great deal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Bernie, it’s not you. She’s just set in her ways.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski How can we be together if the thought of us getting married might kill your mother?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz It’s the circle of life, sweetie. One day our son will marry someone and it will kill you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Howard, I have to go to the bathroom and no one will take me home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz What’s wrong with the bathroom here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Pneumococcus, streptococcus, staphylococcus and other assorted coccuses.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Sheldon, my mother is on her deathbed and my fiancée is grief-stricken over putting her there. I’m not taking you home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Will you at least go with me to the restroom here, so you can open the door and flush the urinal?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz No!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 sheldon_cooper This might be a good time to point out, Howard, that friendship requires a certain give and take. Hold the door!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 dr_bernstein Mr. Wolowitz?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Is she okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 dr_bernstein It wasn’t a heart attack. She’s awake, she’s resting comfortably. We’re still running a few tests.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Can I see her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 dr_bernstein Actually, she said, and I quote, she’d like to see the little Catholic girl first.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski Me? Why me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Jews have been asking that for centuries. There’s no real good answer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski Okay, well, wish me luck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Don’t worry, you’ll be fine. Let’s just hide Mr. Cross. If it touches her, it burns.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 dr_bernstein You brought a Catholic girl home to your mother?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 dr_bernstein Why don’t I write you a prescription for Xanax.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Finally. Oh, what fresh hell is this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 dr_bernstein Wait, you can’t leave here, you’ve been exposed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 sheldon_cooper No, I haven’t. It’s all good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 penny You want to talk about crazy mothers, Leonard’s mom wouldn’t give him any sort of approval growing up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 priya_koothrappali Oh, the poor thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 penny It makes him desperate to please women. That’s why the foreplay goes on and on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 priya_koothrappali It does, doesn’t it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 penny It’s like he’s trying to win a prize. A word of advice, don’t doze off. You will never hear the end of it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Help me! Come back! Penny!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter There are a couple of things I did with Penny that might be a little silly, but…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Like what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Every once in a while, before we’d go to bed, I’d put on a little show for her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 raj_koothrappali What do you mean, a show?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Well, you know, the way I took my clothes off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Like, to music?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter I’d look pretty stupid if there was no music.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 raj_koothrappali So you’d do a striptease?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter I wasn’t swinging around a pole.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Good, good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter There was one time I put body glitter on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Well, I don’t think you have to worry about Penny telling my sister that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter No, she wouldn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Your big problem is me telling her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter You really are a mean little man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 priya_koothrappali Oh, God, that’s so true.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 penny Yeah, I know, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Hey, what took you guys so long?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 priya_koothrappali Oh, we were just chatting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter That’s nice. What about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 penny We were just comparing notes about how you are in the sack.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter That’s funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 penny Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 raj_koothrappali What if she wasn’t kidding?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter It doesn’t matter. I’m the king of foreplay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Hey, how’d it go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski You’re a putz. You know what that means?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Yeah. Do you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski Your mother just taught it to me. She thinks she got food poisoning from that deli and she just wanted to make sure I was okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz And are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski No, because I’m engaged to a putz. You let me believe I was the reason she had a heart attack.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Well, based on the available evid…
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski Shut up! She said I’m a wonderful girl and that you’re lucky to have me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Where are you going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski To the toilet! Is that okay with you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Is it just me, or does she sound sexy when she’s angry?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Mountain Elf.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 raj_koothrappali He takes the elf from off the shelf.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Hell Hounds.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Hell Hounds. Who let the Satanic dogs out? Who? Who-who?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Colossal Serpent.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 raj_koothrappali I got a colossal serpent right here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Must you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Sorry, I’m just trying to cheer my buddy up. Rotting Zombie. Sheldon’s new Facebook photo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Zandor, Wizard of the North. Ha! I win.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode23 howard_wolowitz If you skip the part about being under a two-week quarantine because you were exposed to a deadly disease, absolutely.
