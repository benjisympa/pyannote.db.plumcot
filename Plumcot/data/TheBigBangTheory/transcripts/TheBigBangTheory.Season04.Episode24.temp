TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 penny Hey, you guys ready to order?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 howard Uh..
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 leonard Sure
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 penny Okay, Priya?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 priya Uh, I’ll have the Shepherd’s Pie. You want to split that with me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 leonard Oh, no, no, no, he doesn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 priya Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 leonard Well, you have milk in the taters, milk in the gravy, parmesan crust. Your lactose-intolerant boyfriend will turn into a gas-filled Macy’s Day balloon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon Not quite accurate. The Macy’s balloons are filled with helium, whereas Leonard produces copious amounts of methane.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 leonard So, no, on the Shepherd’s Pie. Can we move on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 leonard Sea bass. I’ll have the sea bass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 howard You gotta like this, the girlfriend and the ex-girlfriend bonding over your rooty-tooty stinky booty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 leonard Kill me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon It wouldn’help. The human body is capable of being flatulent for hours after death.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 bernadette Guys, sorry I’m late. I have amazing news.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon Bernadette, before you change the subject, does anyone have any final comments on Leonard’s faulty digestive system?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 leonard So, what’s your news, Bernadette?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 bernadette The thesis committee accepted my doctoral dissertation. I’m getting my PhD.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 penny Oh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon Oh, congratulations.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 penny Wow, so that means you’re a doctor, you’re a doctor, you’re a doctor, you’re a doctor, and Howard, you know a lot of doctors.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 howard Congratulations, honey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 bernadette Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 leonard So, Howard, tell us, how’s it feel knowing that when you two get married, you’ll be referred to as Mr. and Dr. Wolowitz?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon Unless he takes Bernadette’s last name. And considering her advanced status, that could open some doors for him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 howard Please, this isn’t about me. I’m proud of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 bernadette Well, you’ll be really be proud of this. I was headhunted by a big pharmaceutical company. They’re gonna pay me a buttload of money!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 howard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 leonard Bernadette, that’s great. Howard, do you make a buttload?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 howard Better than what you’ve got a buttload of.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 leonard Hey, if I roll down the windows in the car, everything’s peachy. If you do it, you’re still not a doctor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 penny Yeah, just a heads-up on the car window deal. It helps, but everything is not peachy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 raj Oh, if there was a problem, you can’t solve it, check out the hook while my DJ revolves it. Ice, Ice, baby. Ice, Ice, baby. .
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 priya Oh, God, I feel ridiculous in this dress.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 leonard You look beautiful, Lieutenant Uhura. Now prepare for inspection.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 priya Shh, my brother’s going to hear you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 leonard Relax, he’s got headphones on. And we’re ten miles above Earth in a starship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 raj Really, ten miles? You’re orbiting inside the atmosphere? Moron.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 priya I can’t believe I’m wearing my brother’s Halloween costume.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 leonard I can’t believe you think he only wears it on Halloween. Open the landing bay doors, shuttle craft approaching.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 raj Okay, gotta go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 howard Hey, what’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 mrs_wolowitz Is that my future daughter-in-law, the doctor?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 howard No, Ma! It’s Raj!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 mrs_wolowitz He’s a doctor too, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 howard Yes!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 mrs_wolowitz Like Leonard and the skinny weirdo!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 howard Sheldon, yes! Everybody’s a doctor but me!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 mrs_wolowitz Well, whose fault is that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 howard What’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 raj Leonard’s putting disgusting memories in my memory foam mattress. Can I stay here tonight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 howard Sure, but I’m going out with Bernadette. It’ll just be you and my mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 raj I guess that’s okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 howard Ma, can Rajesh sleep over?!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 mrs_wolowitz Of course, he and I can play doctor!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 raj She’s kidding, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 howard I don’t know, she’s pretty feisty since they put her on hormone-replacement therapy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 mrs_wolowitz Paging Dr. Cutie Pie!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon I must say, Amy, I was very impressed to see that Bernadette got her PhD.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 amy It’s indeed admirable. Although, it is microbiology.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon Your doctorate is in neurobiology. I fail to see the distinction.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 amy I’ll make it simple for you. I study the brain, the organ responsible for Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony. Bernadette studies yeast, the organism responsible for Michelob Lite. Is there something wrong with your neck?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon It’s a little stiff. What a remarkably fragile structure to support such a valuable payload. Not unlike balancing a Faberge egg on a Pixie Stick.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 amy Have you considered massage?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon I’d like to respond to that sarcastically. Yes, I relish the thought of a stranger covering my body with oil and rubbing it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 amy I was proposing you massage your muscles with your own hands.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon Still sounds like a lot of unnecessary touching.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 amy Trust me. With your right hand, locate the spot where the scapula meets the acromion process.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 amy Now push your third finger along the ridge of the shoulder blade, making a small rotation as you do so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon Rotating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 amy You should feel a small node-like object rolling back and forth along the bone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon You mean the myofascial point?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 amy Obviously. Now bear down on it like the seventh grade noogies we all know too well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon Oh, dear Lord, yes, yes, oh, yes! Amy, I’ve never been touched like this before! Oh! Oh, my hands are magic!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 amy Don’t flatter yourself. Your hands are blunt tools guided by my knowledge of the nervous system. I could just as easily have paralyzed you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon There’s someone at my door.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 amy That doesn’t interest me. Goodbye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 raj Can I sleep here tonight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 raj Leonard’s having astronomically inaccurate Star Trek sex with my sister.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon I can see how that would be upsetting. Come in. I’ll get the sheets and blankets for the couch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 raj Oh, don’t bother. I’ll just sleep in Leonard’s room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon No, I can’t authorize that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 raj Well, he’s in my bed. Why can’t I be in his?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon The Hammurabic Code is an eye for an eye, not a bed for a bed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 raj Come on, dude, I’m exhausted, and Tyra Banks says the most important item in your makeup bag is a good night’s sleep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon All right. This is a form indemnifying me from your use of Leonard’s bedroom. Sign here, indicating that I tried to stop you and did so using a stern facial expression.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 raj Good night, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon Wait. Not yet. We still have to go over safety procedures. Now, the apartment has three emergency exits located here, here, and here. In the event of a power outage, luminous paint will guide you to the nearest exit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 raj You’re kidding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon I never kid about safety.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 leonard What are you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 raj I was sleeping.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 leonard In my bed?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 raj Well, I would’ve slept in my own bed, but it was being used to bring shame to my family. And the memory of Gene Roddenberry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 leonard Oh, you heard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 raj Scotty, I need more power.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 leonard Sorry. Does Sheldon know you’re sleeping in here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 raj Are you kidding? He made me sign a waiver, participate in an emergency fire drill and take a refresher course in CPR. Thank God he had a dummy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 leonard Oh, yeah. Mouth-to-Mouth Mona. You know, she used to date Howard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 raj Oh, my God, she’s that Mona? Why can’t you and my sister spend your nights here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 leonard We tried. She doesn’t get along with Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 raj Sheldon doesn’t get along with Sheldon. It’s still no reason for me to have to listen to you arm your photon torpedoes every night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 leonard Okay, well, how about this. Until Priya gets her own place, you stay here and I’ll stay at your apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 raj Can I bring girls here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 leonard You? Sure. Bring as many as you want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 raj Okay, deal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 leonard Just not against their will.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 leonard Do you really think you should be eating that cake?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 howard Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 leonard If you’re gonna be a trophy husband for a rich wife, you might want to watch your waistline.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 raj He’s right. A minute on the lips, a lifetime on the hips.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 howard Yeah, ha-ha. First of all, I’m not threatened by my fiancée’s success. I’m proud of her. And secondly, I have my own career.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 leonard Until you have kids.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon Good news, Raj. I got the blood work back from the lab. You’re okay to stay for a while.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 raj When did you take my blood?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon Not important. Your sugar was a little high. I’d follow up with your regular physician. In the meantime, I have some paperwork here for you to go over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 raj What the hell is this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon Boilerplate stuff. A modified roommate agreement for a temporary house guest. And a living will and durable power of attorney.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 raj This says you can make end of life decisions for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon As your friend, let’s hope it doesn’t come to that. Please sign.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 raj Did you sign this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 leonard There’s a reciprocity clause. You get to pull the plug on him, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 raj Well, that seems fair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon Congratulations and welcome temporarily aboard. Here’s your I.D. Card, your key and your lapel pin. Which Leonard was too cool to wear. FYI, part of your responsibilities as roommate pro tem will be to drive me to and from work, the comic book store, the barbershop and the park for one hour every other Sunday for fresh air.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 leonard Bring a ball or a Frisbee, you know, something he can chase.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon Also, you’re tasked with bringing home all takeout dinners. Tonight is Thai food. You’ll find the standard order in appendix B or downloadable from my FTP server. If you have any questions, here’s the FAQ sheet, or if you prefer the human touch, I do a live web chat called Apartment Talk on Tuesday nights.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 leonard No backsies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 raj Sheldon, dinner!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon What is this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 raj This is the difference between eating and dining.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon Remarkable. I’m just realizing how much Leonard’s been skating by all these years.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 raj It’s not a big thing. Just think of me as a brown Martha Stewart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 penny Hey, Sheldon, did you change your Wi-Fi password again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon Yes, it’s “Penny, get your own Wi-Fi.” No spaces.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 penny Thanks. Wow! What’s with the fancy spread?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon My new roommate is bending over backwards to ingratiate himself to me. Uh, nice touch, by the way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 penny What do you mean, new roommate? What happened to Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon The same thing that happened to Homo Erectus. He was replaced by a superior species.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 raj I’m the new Homo in town. That came out wrong.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 penny All right, let me try this again. Where’s Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 raj He’s living at my place, so I’m living here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon You’re living here provisionally. But I must say it’s looking good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 penny Woah, Leonard and Priya are living together? That’s big.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon No. Origami napkin swans, that’s the headline.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 raj It’s a good thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 howard So do you know what kind of research you’ll be doing at this pharmaceutical company?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 bernadette Well, there are a couple of opportunities available, but I volunteered for the premature ejaculation project. I mean, it’s not like either one of us has heart disease. Oh, I almost forgot. I got you a little present.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 howard Oh, Bernie, no. You didn’t have to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 bernadette I wanted to. Come on, open it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 howard You bought me a Rolex? How much did this cost?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 bernadette Oh, you let me worry about the money. I just want my baby to have pretty things.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 raj More wine?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 penny Oh, no, no, no. I’ve had way too much already.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon Here’s an interesting fact about alcohol.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 penny Hit me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon Man is not the only species that ferments fruit in order to become intoxicated. Can you guess what the other is? Hint, sometimes they pack the alcohol in their trunks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 penny Monkeys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon When does a monkey have a trunk?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 penny When a suitcase just won’t do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon Mmm, all right. It would appear as if alcohol is playing keep-away with your intelligence. Good night. Please note, it is now past ten p.m. Per our roommate agreement, kindly refrain from raucous laughter, clinking of glasses, and celebratory gunfire.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 penny Okay, explain something to me. You watch Leonard put up with that guy for years and years. What has to break inside your brain for you to think, Oh, Krishna, I’ve got to get me some of that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 raj Well, it’s a lot better than having to wear noise-cancelling headphones in my own apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 penny What? Oh, God, yeah. Yeah. Leonard’s a noisy little dude in the sack.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 raj Every night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 penny Really? Even during allergy season, when he has to alternate between kissing and breathing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 raj It’s my sister. Can we not talk about this any more?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 penny Yeah. Sorry, sorry. Can I tell you a secret?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 raj Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 penny I screwed up. Leonard’s a great guy. Never should have broken up with him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 raj Well, uh, to paraphrase Shakespeare, It’s better to have loved and lost than to stay home every night and download increasingly shameful pornography.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 penny Oh, you poor baby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 raj What’s wrong with me, Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 penny Nothing, nothing. You know, if we weren’t friends, and you hadn’t brought up that creepy pornography story, I’d be on you like the speed of light squared on matter to make energy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 raj Hey, you totally got that right! E equals M C squared.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 penny I listen. I have no idea what it means, but I listen. To friendship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 raj To friendship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon Would you booze hounds please stop that infernal clinking? And the answer was elephant!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 leonard Mmm. Mmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 priya Leonard, sweetheart, we’re kissing, not eating hot soup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 leonard Sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 priya That’s my parents on video chat. Go hide in the bedroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 leonard Oh, come on! Why don’t we just tell them that we’re dating?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 priya Oh, we’ve been through this. It’s not the time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 leonard When is the time?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 priya I’ve got five brothers and sisters. One of them is bound to screw up real big, and then I’ll tell my parents about you. Now, shoo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 leonard Fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 priya Hello, Mummy. Hello, Daddy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 dr_koothrappali We heard there was a tornado in Kansas City. Is that close to you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 priya No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 mrs_koothrappali Where is your brother?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 priya Out with friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 dr_koothrappali I don’t like it, a young girl alone in an apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 mrs_koothrappali I’ll sleep so much better when you move back here next month.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 leonard You’re moving back to India?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 dr_koothrappali Who’s that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 mrs_koothrappali Oh, my God! There’s someone in your apartment. Call the police in America!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 leonard When were you going to tell me about this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 priya Oh, hello, Leonard. What a pleasant surprise! Mummy, Daddy, you remember Rajesh’s friend Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 dr_koothrappali I thought you said Rajesh was out with his friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 priya He has many friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 dr_koothrappali Rajesh has many friends?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 mrs_koothrappali Why are you lying to us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 leonard She’s lying because she doesn’t want you to know we’re dating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 priya Leonard!
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 leonard Well, what difference does it make? If you’re moving back to India, we’re obviously breaking up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 priya You know what? I don’t want to deal with this right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 leonard So. Hot in India?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 dr_koothrappali Of course it is. It always is. It’s India. Now, what do you have to say for yourself?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 leonard Uh. That is a beautiful tapestry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 penny Oh, God. Oh, God! Oh. Okay, look. This never happened. Do you understand me? Really? Still can’t talk to me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon What are you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon I said, what are you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 leonard I live here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon I have paperwork that says differently.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 leonard Priya’s going back to India.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon Irrelevant. Rajesh and I have a good thing going and you’re not going to ruin it. What are you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 howard I’ve been up all night. I had a fight with Bernadette.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 howard She gave me a beautiful watch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon Leonard, do you understand this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 leonard Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon Talk to him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 penny Damn.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 leonard What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 penny Oh. It’s, it’s not what it looks like.
TheBigBangTheory.Season04.Episode24 sheldon What does it look like?
