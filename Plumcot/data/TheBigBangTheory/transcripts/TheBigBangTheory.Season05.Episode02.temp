TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard Oh, uh, Priya’s calling in a few minutes on Skype, and we are gonna have a dinner date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon It’s eight o’clock in the morning in Mumbai. How can she have dinner?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard Fine, whatever. Priya will be having breakfast.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon All right, so technically it’s not a dinner date. I suppose you could call it a, uh, dinfast date. But if you did, you’d open yourself to peer-based mocking, such as, Hey, Leonard, how was your dinfast with Priya last night?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard That doesn’t sound like mocking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon You didn’t let me finish. Dinfast . Are those soy-based candles?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard I don’t know. Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon Paraffin candles may contain carcinogens. Unless lung cancer is the ambiance you were going for at your dinfast. Dinfast .
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard Listen, I don’t want to be rude, but Priya’s gonna be calling any minute, so…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon Oh, yes, Priya. Leonard, you know I make a point of never interfering in your personal affairs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard Yes, I’ve always admired that about you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon As well you should. But I’m going to make an exception here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard Oh, good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon Priya has moved back to India to pursue her law career. Instead of desperately trying to keep this intercontinental relationship alive, you could use that time to take up a hobby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard A hobby?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon Yes. I read recently about a fellow in Kansas with an enormous ball of twine. I bet you could give him a run for his money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard You know, some people might say that it’s great that we’re trying to make things work long distance. They’d say things like, love is stronger than the miles between you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon When I rise to power, those people will be sterilized.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard You video-chat with Amy all the time. How is this different?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon Don’t you like Amy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard Of course I like Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon Well, there’s the difference. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard Excuse me, that’s Priya.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 priya Hi, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard Hey, honey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 priya I miss you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard Oh, I miss you, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon I miss the old days when your romantic partners could be returned to the video store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon Thanks for letting me stay here while Leonard Skypes with his girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny Oh, it’s no problem. It’s actually kind of nice. You reading, me reading. We’re like an old married couple.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon If we were an old married couple, the wife would serve iced tea and snickerdoodles.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny I don’t have iced tea and snickerdoodles.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon A good wife would go to the store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny I want a divorce.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon Good. On the way to see the lawyer, pick up some tea and cookies. I must say, I am enjoying your new chair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny It’s great, isn’t it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon It is. Aligns the lumbar, cradles the coccyx, balances the buttocks. This is a chair worthy of the name.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny What name?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon Chair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny Oh, all right, well, I’m glad you like it. I mean, I still can’t get over the fact someone just threw it away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny Yeah, it was just sitting on the street. I paid a homeless guy ten bucks to help me get it up here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny What is wrong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon I’ve been sitting in garbage!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny Sheldon, take it easy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon You take it easy! I need to use your shower.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny I went into this marriage with so much hope.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon There’s a wet Band-Aid on the shower floor. .
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 raj This is fun. I’ve never used a hydraulic thermoforming press before.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 howard Pretty sweet, huh? This little baby set the university back 175 grand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard That’s three minutes. Should we see what we got?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 howard Hang on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 raj Oh, yeah. This is one good-looking panini.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 howard Hand me the tuna melt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard Yep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 howard Thank you. How’s it going with the long-distance love affair?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard Not easy, but we’re making it work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 howard When you say making it work, does that include doing the cyber nasty?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 howard You know, the virtual pickle tickle. The digital bow-chicka-bow-bow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 raj Come on, dude. This is my sister you’re talking about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 howard Hey, Leonard jiggling his junk at her through a webcam has got to be easier for you to deal with than him actually touching her with it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard There’s no junk jiggling. We just talk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 howard Are you insane? With high-speed Internet, you have at your fingertips the greatest advancement in the field of sex since the invention of the washcloth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard I can’t do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 howard Well, if you don’t, you’re gonna lose Priya to some fancy guy in a turban who grew up with Kama Sutra coloring books.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 raj How can you be so racist?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 howard Oh, come on, tell me I’m wrong.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon Oh, Leonard, good. There you are. I need you to check my head for chair lice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard I did it last night, I’m not doing it again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 howard Just his head, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard I don’t want to talk about it. You didn’t catch bugs from Penny’s chair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon Yes, I did. And now they’re cavorting at the base of my hair follicles like dancing hippies at the Redwood National Forest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard Sheldon, you do this all the time. You fixate on some crazy idea and then blow it way out of proportion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon Name one time I’ve ever done that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard How about when you put GPS trackers in your garbage because you were convinced North Korean spies were stealing your doodles? The chicken nuggets you were sure were human nuggets. The strangely-shaped cloud that was following you around town. The time you put on my shirt by mistake and were convinced you’d started growing again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon I said, name one. You really need to work on your listening skills.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon Penny. Penny. Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny Yello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon You need to remove that chair from the building. It’s a health hazard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny Okay, relax. I took off the slipcovers, had them dry-cleaned and then fumigated the cushions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny Yeah. It’s cleaner than my couch. Found half a Hot Pocket in there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon It certainly looks okay. Has a strong toxic chemical smell. That’s reassuring.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny Why don’t you give it a try, Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon All right. It is a comfortable chair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny Why don’t you just admit you overreacted?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon No, thank you. (Sees insect. More appear and swarm all over him. He jumps out of a daydream on his own couch. Jumps up and runs out to Penny’s apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard It’s like living with a Chihuahua.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon Penny. Penny. Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny What’s up, buttercup?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon You have to get rid of the chair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny Nope. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon Penny. Penny. Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny What’s the word, hummingbird?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon For your safety, please wait in my apartment as I call the authorities so they may remove the chair of death.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny No. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon Penny. Penny. Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny What’s the gist, physicist?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon Under my authority as a self-appointed member of the Centres for Disease Control street team, these premises are condemned. As a man with a keen sense of style, I must tell you, that chair does not work with the room. . Penny. Penny. Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard So, here we are. Back in bed together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 priya Yep, here we are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard Okay, so I, I, I guess I’ll just jump right in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 priya All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard Uh, you’re a naughty girl. And, and, uh, I, I want to punish you with my love?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 priya What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard Not good?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 priya That’s terrible. Try again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard Okay. Uh, uh, you’re not naughty. Uh, you’re, you’re, you’re dirty. You’re, you’re a, a dirty girl?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 priya Oh, yes. Yes, I am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard Yeah, yeah. Uh, okay. You’re a, you’re a, you’re a, a dirty, disgusting, revolting girl. Ugh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 priya God, Leonard, stop talking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard Why don’t you just give me five minutes? I’ll Google how to do this. I’ll call you right back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 priya Shh-shh-shh. Just be quiet and do what I tell you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard Okay, like usual. Good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 priya Take off your shirt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard All rightie. Shirt coming off. Ta-da! Man nipples.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 priya I said be quiet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard Yes, ma’am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 priya Now take off your shorts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard Taking shorts off. There we go. Naked, naked, naked!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 priya Wonderful. Now I’ll take off my clothes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard Cool. Uh-oh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 priya Here I am, baby. You miss these?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard Oh, damn it!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 priya Oh, Leonard! Already?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard No, no! No-no-no! The screen froze. It’s probably just buffering, just give it a second.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 priya Fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard So, how are your mom and dad?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 priya Yeah, I really don’t want to talk about my parents now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard Yeah. Sure, sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon If your video’s frozen, try resetting the TCP/IP stack.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard Oh! I didn’t even think of that. Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon You’re welcome. Please let me know when you and your girlfriend are done hogging the bandwidth for your self-abuse. I’m trying to stream a movie on Netflix in here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy Five, six, seven, eight. Tall and tan and young and lovely, the girl from Ipanema goes walking, and when she passes, each one she passes goes…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon Amy. Amy. Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy Oh… You are aware that your ritualistic knocking behaviour is symptomatic of obsessive compulsive disorder?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon Is not. Is not, is not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy Denial. Denial, denial. Come in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy Would you like to hear me play a bossa nova standard on the harp?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy How about the theme song to the classic television show Diff’rent Strokes? Now the world don’t move to the beat…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy Well, that’s every song I know. What’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon You’re good friends with Penny, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy Best friends, besties, BFFs, peas in a pod, sisters who would share travelling pants. Go on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon I was hoping she might listen to you about the dangers of owning unhygienic furniture.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy For general educational purposes, or has she acquired a bar stool dipped in cholera?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon Cholera is water-borne. You’re mocking me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy Yes, I am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon Penny has dragged a chair in off the street whose unknown provenance jeopardizes the health and welfare of every resident in our building.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy Sheldon, just because you have a focus on cleanliness bordering on the psychotic doesn’t mean I have to participate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon All right, name your price.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy Kiss me where I’ve never been kissed before.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon You mean like Salt Lake City?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy Never mind. I’ll talk to Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy Will you listen to me play my harp now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon No. I dislike the sound of the harp. Its overuse in classic television sitcoms always makes me think I’m going to experience an episode from my past. I’m sorry, Mommy. Don’t be mad at me. Don’t do that!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard I don’t know about this, Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 howard What? You’re having trouble with the long-distance lovemaking. This is your answer. There are two interfaces that simulate a human mouth. You have one, Priya has one in India. When you move your lips and tongue on yours, it transmits exactly what you’re doing to hers. See? Internet kissing. Give it a try.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard I don’t think so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 raj I’ll try it. Like this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 howard Almost. Really get your tongue in there, to activate the motion sensor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 raj Like this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 howard Close. Really French it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 raj Better?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 howard Yeah, you got it, you got it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 raj I’m impressed. This is very lifelike.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 howard Whoa! You just bit my tongue!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 raj I, I nibbled. I was being playful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 howard Why do you have to make everything weird?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 raj Sorry. Better?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 howard Oh, yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny Pretty cool, huh? Probably would cost, like, two hundred bucks in a store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy I do appreciate a bargain. This entire ensemble once belonged to my dead grandmother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny You’re kidding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy Everything except bra and panties. And they’re a leopard-spotted secret I share with Victoria.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny And now me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy I just have one question about the chair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny And what’s that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy Aren’t you worried about it being unhygienic?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny No, it’s completely fine. Hmm. I get it. Sheldon sent you. He put you up to this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy No, he didn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy Yes, he did. He absolutely did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny My God, Amy, that’s really crappy of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy It is?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny Yeah! Letting Sheldon use you to manipulate me? I thought you were my friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy No, I am your friend. Please don’t be mad at me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny I can’t even believe this. You know, maybe you should just go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy No, no, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry. I take it all back. Look. I’m, uh, I’m sitting in your chair. There’s nothing wrong with it. It’s a great chair. Please let me continue to be part of your world. Ow!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny What’s wrong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy Something in the chair’s biting my tushy. It’s not important. Ow!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny Wait. Get up, get up! Swear you won’t tell Sheldon what happened!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy I swear! Can I tell my doctor? I’m probably gonna need shots!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny Yeah, sure!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard Oh, hey, babe, I think I figured this thing out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 priya Oh, Leonard, listen…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard No, you listen. You’re my woman, and I’m gonna make you feel things you have never felt before.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 priya Leonard…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard That’s right, say my name, and beg me for more, ’cause, I’m gonna give it to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 priya My parents are here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 dr_koothrappali Hello, Leonard, if I may also say your name.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 howard Check it out. Free chair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 raj Yeah. Hey, you know, if this was in Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment, I wouldn’t wind up sitting on the floor all the time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 howard On three?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 together Three!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 raj What kind of idiot throws away a terrific chair like this?
