TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Oh, uh, Priya’s calling in a few minutes on Skype, and we are gonna have a dinner date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper It’s eight o’clock in the morning in Mumbai. How can she have dinner?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Fine, whatever. Priya will be having breakfast.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper All right, so technically it’s not a dinner date. I suppose you could call it a, uh, dinfast date. But if you did, you’d open yourself to peer-based mocking, such as, Hey, Leonard, how was your dinfast with Priya last night?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter That doesn’t sound like mocking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper You didn’t let me finish. Dinfast . Are those soy-based candles?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter I don’t know. Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Paraffin candles may contain carcinogens. Unless lung cancer is the ambiance you were going for at your dinfast. Dinfast .
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Listen, I don’t want to be rude, but Priya’s gonna be calling any minute, so…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Oh, yes, Priya. Leonard, you know I make a point of never interfering in your personal affairs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Yes, I’ve always admired that about you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper As well you should. But I’m going to make an exception here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Oh, good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Priya has moved back to India to pursue her law career. Instead of desperately trying to keep this intercontinental relationship alive, you could use that time to take up a hobby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter A hobby?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Yes. I read recently about a fellow in Kansas with an enormous ball of twine. I bet you could give him a run for his money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter You know, some people might say that it’s great that we’re trying to make things work long distance. They’d say things like, love is stronger than the miles between you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper When I rise to power, those people will be sterilized.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter You video-chat with Amy all the time. How is this different?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Don’t you like Amy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Of course I like Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Well, there’s the difference.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Excuse me, that’s Priya.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 priya_koothrappali Hi, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Hey, honey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 priya_koothrappali I miss you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Oh, I miss you, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I miss the old days when your romantic partners could be returned to the video store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Thanks for letting me stay here while Leonard Skypes with his girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny Oh, it’s no problem. It’s actually kind of nice. You reading, me reading. We’re like an old married couple.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper If we were an old married couple, the wife would serve iced tea and snickerdoodles.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny I don’t have iced tea and snickerdoodles.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper A good wife would go to the store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny I want a divorce.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Good. On the way to see the lawyer, pick up some tea and cookies. I must say, I am enjoying your new chair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny It’s great, isn’t it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper It is. Aligns the lumbar, cradles the coccyx, balances the buttocks. This is a chair worthy of the name.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny What name?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Chair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny Oh, all right, well, I’m glad you like it. I mean, I still can’t get over the fact someone just threw it away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny Yeah, it was just sitting on the street. I paid a homeless guy ten bucks to help me get it up here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny What is wrong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I’ve been sitting in garbage!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny Sheldon, take it easy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper You take it easy! I need to use your shower.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny I went into this marriage with so much hope.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper There’s a wet Band-Aid on the shower floor. .
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 raj_koothrappali This is fun. I’ve never used a hydraulic thermoforming press before.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Pretty sweet, huh? This little baby set the university back 175 grand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter That’s three minutes. Should we see what we got?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Hang on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Oh, yeah. This is one good-looking panini.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Hand me the tuna melt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Yep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Thank you. How’s it going with the long-distance love affair?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Not easy, but we’re making it work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 howard_wolowitz When you say making it work, does that include doing the cyber nasty?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 howard_wolowitz You know, the virtual pickle tickle. The digital bow-chicka-bow-bow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Come on, dude. This is my sister you’re talking about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Hey, Leonard jiggling his junk at her through a webcam has got to be easier for you to deal with than him actually touching her with it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter There’s no junk jiggling. We just talk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Are you insane? With high-speed Internet, you have at your fingertips the greatest advancement in the field of sex since the invention of the washcloth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter I can’t do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Well, if you don’t, you’re gonna lose Priya to some fancy guy in a turban who grew up with Kama Sutra coloring books.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 raj_koothrappali How can you be so racist?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Oh, come on, tell me I’m wrong.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Oh, Leonard, good. There you are. I need you to check my head for chair lice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter I did it last night, I’m not doing it again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Just his head, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter I don’t want to talk about it. You didn’t catch bugs from Penny’s chair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Yes, I did. And now they’re cavorting at the base of my hair follicles like dancing hippies at the Redwood National Forest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, you do this all the time. You fixate on some crazy idea and then blow it way out of proportion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Name one time I’ve ever done that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter How about when you put GPS trackers in your garbage because you were convinced North Korean spies were stealing your doodles? The chicken nuggets you were sure were human nuggets. The strangely-shaped cloud that was following you around town. The time you put on my shirt by mistake and were convinced you’d started growing again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I said, name one. You really need to work on your listening skills.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Penny. Penny. Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny Yello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper You need to remove that chair from the building. It’s a health hazard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny Okay, relax. I took off the slipcovers, had them dry-cleaned and then fumigated the cushions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny Yeah. It’s cleaner than my couch. Found half a Hot Pocket in there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper It certainly looks okay. Has a strong toxic chemical smell. That’s reassuring.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny Why don’t you give it a try, Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper All right. It is a comfortable chair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny Why don’t you just admit you overreacted?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper No, thank you. (Sees insect. More appear and swarm all over him. He jumps out of a daydream on his own couch. Jumps up and runs out to Penny’s apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter It’s like living with a Chihuahua.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Penny. Penny. Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny What’s up, buttercup?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper You have to get rid of the chair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny Nope.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Penny. Penny. Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny What’s the word, hummingbird?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper For your safety, please wait in my apartment as I call the authorities so they may remove the chair of death.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Penny. Penny. Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny What’s the gist, physicist?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Under my authority as a self-appointed member of the Centres for Disease Control street team, these premises are condemned. As a man with a keen sense of style, I must tell you, that chair does not work with the room. . Penny. Penny. Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter So, here we are. Back in bed together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 priya_koothrappali Yep, here we are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Okay, so I, I, I guess I’ll just jump right in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 priya_koothrappali All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Uh, you’re a naughty girl. And, and, uh, I, I want to punish you with my love?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 priya_koothrappali What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Not good?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 priya_koothrappali That’s terrible. Try again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Okay. Uh, uh, you’re not naughty. Uh, you’re, you’re, you’re dirty. You’re, you’re a, a dirty girl?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 priya_koothrappali Oh, yes. Yes, I am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, yeah. Uh, okay. You’re a, you’re a, you’re a, a dirty, disgusting, revolting girl. Ugh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 priya_koothrappali God, Leonard, stop talking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Why don’t you just give me five minutes? I’ll Google how to do this. I’ll call you right back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 priya_koothrappali Shh-shh-shh. Just be quiet and do what I tell you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Okay, like usual. Good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 priya_koothrappali Take off your shirt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter All rightie. Shirt coming off. Ta-da! Man nipples.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 priya_koothrappali I said be quiet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Yes, ma’am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 priya_koothrappali Now take off your shorts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Taking shorts off. There we go. Naked, naked, naked!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 priya_koothrappali Wonderful. Now I’ll take off my clothes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Cool. Uh-oh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 priya_koothrappali Here I am, baby. You miss these?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Oh, damn it!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 priya_koothrappali Oh, Leonard! Already?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter No, no! No-no-no! The screen froze. It’s probably just buffering, just give it a second.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 priya_koothrappali Fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter So, how are your mom and dad?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 priya_koothrappali Yeah, I really don’t want to talk about my parents now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Yeah. Sure, sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper If your video’s frozen, try resetting the TCP/IP stack.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Oh! I didn’t even think of that. Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper You’re welcome. Please let me know when you and your girlfriend are done hogging the bandwidth for your self-abuse. I’m trying to stream a movie on Netflix in here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Five, six, seven, eight. Tall and tan and young and lovely, the girl from Ipanema goes walking, and when she passes, each one she passes goes…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Amy. Amy. Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Oh… You are aware that your ritualistic knocking behaviour is symptomatic of obsessive compulsive disorder?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Is not. Is not, is not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Denial. Denial, denial. Come in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Would you like to hear me play a bossa nova standard on the harp?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler How about the theme song to the classic television show Diff’rent Strokes? Now the world don’t move to the beat…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Well, that’s every song I know. What’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper You’re good friends with Penny, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Best friends, besties, BFFs, peas in a pod, sisters who would share travelling pants. Go on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I was hoping she might listen to you about the dangers of owning unhygienic furniture.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler For general educational purposes, or has she acquired a bar stool dipped in cholera?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Cholera is water-borne. You’re mocking me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Yes, I am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Penny has dragged a chair in off the street whose unknown provenance jeopardizes the health and welfare of every resident in our building.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, just because you have a focus on cleanliness bordering on the psychotic doesn’t mean I have to participate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper All right, name your price.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Kiss me where I’ve never been kissed before.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper You mean like Salt Lake City?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Never mind. I’ll talk to Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Will you listen to me play my harp now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 sheldon_cooper No. I dislike the sound of the harp. Its overuse in classic television sitcoms always makes me think I’m going to experience an episode from my past. I’m sorry, Mommy. Don’t be mad at me. Don’t do that!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter I don’t know about this, Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 howard_wolowitz What? You’re having trouble with the long-distance lovemaking. This is your answer. There are two interfaces that simulate a human mouth. You have one, Priya has one in India. When you move your lips and tongue on yours, it transmits exactly what you’re doing to hers. See? Internet kissing. Give it a try.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter I don’t think so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 raj_koothrappali I’ll try it. Like this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Almost. Really get your tongue in there, to activate the motion sensor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Like this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Close. Really French it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Better?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Yeah, you got it, you got it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 raj_koothrappali I’m impressed. This is very lifelike.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Whoa! You just bit my tongue!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 raj_koothrappali I, I nibbled. I was being playful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Why do you have to make everything weird?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Sorry. Better?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Oh, yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny Pretty cool, huh? Probably would cost, like, two hundred bucks in a store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler I do appreciate a bargain. This entire ensemble once belonged to my dead grandmother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny You’re kidding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Everything except bra and panties. And they’re a leopard-spotted secret I share with Victoria.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny And now me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler I just have one question about the chair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny And what’s that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Aren’t you worried about it being unhygienic?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny No, it’s completely fine. Hmm. I get it. Sheldon sent you. He put you up to this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler No, he didn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Yes, he did. He absolutely did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny My God, Amy, that’s really crappy of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler It is?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny Yeah! Letting Sheldon use you to manipulate me? I thought you were my friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler No, I am your friend. Please don’t be mad at me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny I can’t even believe this. You know, maybe you should just go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler No, no, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry. I take it all back. Look. I’m, uh, I’m sitting in your chair. There’s nothing wrong with it. It’s a great chair. Please let me continue to be part of your world. Ow!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny What’s wrong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Something in the chair’s biting my tushy. It’s not important. Ow!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny Wait. Get up, get up! Swear you won’t tell Sheldon what happened!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler I swear! Can I tell my doctor? I’m probably gonna need shots!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 penny Yeah, sure!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Oh, hey, babe, I think I figured this thing out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 priya_koothrappali Oh, Leonard, listen…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter No, you listen. You’re my woman, and I’m gonna make you feel things you have never felt before.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 priya_koothrappali Leonard…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter That’s right, say my name, and beg me for more, ’cause, I’m gonna give it to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 priya_koothrappali My parents are here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 dr_vm_koothrappali Hello, Leonard, if I may also say your name.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Check it out. Free chair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Yeah. Hey, you know, if this was in Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment, I wouldn’t wind up sitting on the floor all the time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 howard_wolowitz On three?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 together#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 Three!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode02 raj_koothrappali What kind of idiot throws away a terrific chair like this?
