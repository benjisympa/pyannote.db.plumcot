TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard Who wants the last dumpling?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 penny Ooh, me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 sheldon Penny, a moment. We just had Thai food. In that culture, the last morsel is called the krengjai piece, and it is reserved for the most important and valued member of the group.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 penny Thank you all for this high honour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 sheldon I’ve seen pictures of your mother, keep eating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard All right, honey, if we’re gonna make the movie, we should go. This may be hard for you to hear, but when I say honey, I mean my fiancée. Yeah, well, now it means her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette It’s okay if he wants to come.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard Fine. But next time, we get a sitter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 penny All right, I got to go to work. I’ll walk down with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 sheldon Wait. Uh, which is closer to the new train store in Monrovia, the movie theatre or the Cheesecake Factory?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard Neither of them are close.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 sheldon Oh, well, then I guess it doesn’t matter which one of you drives me. Let’s play a fun guessing game to see who gets to take me. All right, this four-letter word describes either a printer’s type size or a compulsion to eat dirt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 penny Okay, I’m not driving him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 sheldon No, Penny, don’t give up, you can get this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard Aren’t you going with Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy No, I have no interest in model trains, stores that sell them, nor their heartbreaking clientele.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard Oh. Well, I have some work to do, so…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy I can’t imagine that would disturb me. Carry on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard Okay. Wouldn’t you be more comfortable at home?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy Not really, no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard All righty then. Guess I’ll just get started.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy Leonard, please. I don’t need the running commentary.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard Amy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy Yo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard You okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy Oh, sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard I thought you were reading.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy I was. Now I’m thinking about what I read. You all right, Leonard? You seem very uncomfortable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard I, I’m fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy Should I go? I’ve been told sometimes I overstay my welcome.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard What, who told you that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy Well, most recently my gynaecologist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard Well, you stay as long as you’d like.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy I’m glad to hear you say that, because I’m having a wonderful time. Hmm, I said the same thing to my gynaecologist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette What are you going to get at the train store, Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 sheldon Oh, I’m not buying anything. They’re having a lecture. H-O gauge railroading. Half the size of O-gauge, but twice the fun. Very controversial topic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard Which side do you come down on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 sheldon I’ll let you know after tonight. Unlike some people, I’m going in with an open mind. Who am I kidding? Of course we all know it’s O-gauge or no gauge.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard Can you believe grown men sit around and play with toy trains?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette That’s pretty big talk for a man with a closet full of magic tricks at his mother’s house.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard First of all, they’re not tricks, they’re illusions. And, secondly, when we get married, they’re all going up in the attic so you can have that closet for clothes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette Why would I keep clothes at your mother’s house?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard Well, don’t think of it that way. Once we move in, it’ll be our house.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette Is she moving out?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard Why would she move out? It’s her house.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette Hang on. You seriously think I’m going to live with your mother?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 sheldon Howard, I think I can help here. Yes, Bernadette, that’s exactly what he thinks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard Why not? It’s a great house, plenty of room, and if we have kids, Mom’s there to help. You know, when she tells the Three Little Pigs story, she actually has hair on her chinny-chin-chin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette I’m not gonna live with your mother. Not now, not ever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard Wow, someone obviously has some mommy issues.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette Raj, take me home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard Don’t listen to her. Go to the movie theatre.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette Take me home now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard Movie theatre.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 raj Mmmmmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 sheldon Okay, everybody calm down. There is a simple solution here. Raj, take me to the train store, and then I don’t care what you people do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy How was your shower?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard It was good, good. Just out of curiosity, what time do you usually go to bed?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy Oh, I’m up all night. I’m like a possum. Boy, you were not liked in high school, were you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard Not really. Is that my yearbook?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy Mm-hmm. Dear Leonard, you’re really good at science. Maybe one day you’ll come up with a cure for being a dork.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard Well, it wasn’t spray-painting a lightning bolt on my briefcase, I can tell you that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy If it makes you feel any better, the only person who signed my yearbook was my mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard Aw.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy Dear Amy, self-respect and a hymen are better than friends and fun. Love, Mom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 sheldon Well, you can add Jerry’s Junction to the list of train stores Sheldon Cooper will never set foot in again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard Rough night, Casey Jones?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 sheldon You don’t know the half of it. It was billed as a lively give-and-take on the merits of model train sizes. But it was actually a set-up to intimidate weak-minded spineless rubes into buying H-O starter sets.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard What’s in the bag?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 sheldon I don’t want to talk about it. But it’s not a spine,I’ll tell you that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy Well, I had a delightful evening, Leonard. We should do this again sometime.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard Ah, sure. That’d be nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy Glad to hear it. I need someone to accompany me to the wedding of Dr. Moranelli and Dr. Gustufson this Friday. They’re kind of the Brad and Angelina of the primatology department.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard Wouldn’t you rather bring Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy I would, but the last wedding we went to was a disaster. He behaved like a child the entire time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 sheldon Not my fault. You said there’d be other scientists there my age.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy Doesn’t matter. You’re out, he’s in. No date to the prom, two dates to a wedding. Hmm, how times change.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 sheldon Ha-ha, you have to go to a wedding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard I’ll get it!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 mrs_wolowitz Could you get it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard I said I’m getting it!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 mrs_wolowitz Fine, I’ll get it!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard I got it! Oh, hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette Hey. I don’t want to fight. I was just surprised when you sprung the whole living-with-your-mom stuff on me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard Yeah, well, I’m sorry I didn’t run it by you first.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 mrs_wolowitz I don’t know who you’re talking to, but in or out! We don’t need bugs!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard The bugs only come here because you’re their queen! Listen, how about this. Before we make any kind of decision about where we live, we have a trial run. Stay here for a weekend, see what it’s like.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette And your mom would be okay with that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard Sure she would. Ma, do you mind if Bernadette stays here this weekend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 mrs_wolowitz Hey, if she’s willing to give the milk away for free, who am I to say no?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard See? She’s good with it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 mrs_wolowitz Frankly, after all your sleepovers with the little brown boy, a girl is a big relief!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 sheldon All this years, I’ve been so wrong. The tinier the train, the more concentrated the fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 penny You’re a brain scientist. Can you explain to me why a brilliant man likes playing with toy trains?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy Not without cutting his head open, no. How about making my eyes like Cleopatra?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 penny Really? For a wedding?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy Perhaps you’re right. My cheekbones and beckoning pelvis already have a certain hello sailor quality to them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard Ready.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 penny Aw. So handsome. Like James Bond.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 sheldon Better than James Bond, because he’s tinier.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy I got you this to give to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 penny Oh, sweetie, guests don’t normally wear corsages to a wedding. That’s more of a prom thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy I never went to my prom. My mom paid my cousin to take me, but he just used the money to buy drugs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 penny Put the corsage on her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard Amy, this is for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy When you’re done copping a feel, that goes on my wrist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 sheldon All aboard! Woo-woo! It’s official. I’m an H-O trainiac.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard So, dinner went nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette Yeah. Yeah, I guess. Does your mother always cut your meat for you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard Only when it’s fatty. Well, don’t be jealous, babe. Someday you’ll get to cut it for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 mrs_wolowitz Bernadette! I found the extra head for the Waterpik if you want to use it!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette I’m okay, Mrs. Wolowitz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 mrs_wolowitz You sure? I just squirted half a brisket outta my teeth!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard Hey, Ma, how about a little privacy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 mrs_wolowitz Oh, I know what that means! Hubba-hubba!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette Oh, God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard Relax, it’ll be fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 mrs_wolowitz Let me know when you’re done canoodling! Mommy needs a foot rub!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy Would you like to dance?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard No, thank you. I’m really not much of a dancer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy You’re not exactly winning any trophies as a conversationalist, either.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard I’m sorry. The bride and groom seem happy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy Why shouldn’t they be? They have a feverish night of socially-approved copulation ahead of them. In some cultures, we’d stand outside of their bedroom cheering as they achieved orgasm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard That sounds like a late night, and I have work in the morning, so…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy Leonard, you may not have noticed, but I am being a delight here. And you’re not holding up your end of the evening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard Oh, sorry. This wedding just reminds me of my kinda-sorta girlfriend 9,000 miles away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy I have a kinda-sorta boyfriend who’s playing with a model train right now, you don’t hear me bitching about it. Leonard, a word of advice, moody self-obsession is only attractive in men who can play guitar and are considerably taller than you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard I’m not moody. I’m fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy You have any evidence to support that statement?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard Well, hey, I’m just as much fun as you are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy Really? Are you willing to draw a moustache on your finger as a conversational icebreaker? I am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard Okay, fine, what do you suggest?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy We just had a lovely meal, the band is on fire, and you’re sitting next to a beautiful woman wearing whorish makeup. Why don’t we head outon the dance floor and see if I can sweat through these dress shields.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard Once again, I, I’m really not much of a dancer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy Don’t worry, I’ll lead. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy Howard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard Ready for bed?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette No. I need to brush my teeth, but your mother’s been in the bathroom for, like, an hour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard Oh. Yeah, she sometimes has problems doing her business. Hang on. Ma, give up! Tonight’s not your night!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 mrs_wolowitz You don’t know that! I just sat down!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard Come on, take a break! Bernadette needs to brush her teeth!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 mrs_wolowitz She can come in and brush her teeth! I’m not embarrassed!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard Problem solved.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette No, it’s not. I’m not going in there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard Oh, come on, honey. She’s just sitting in there reading a magazine. You can’t see anything. I go in all the time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 mrs_wolowitz Ha! The eagle has landed!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard And we have splashdown. Wait here, I’m gonna go light a candle. And then we make passionate love.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy There we go, last floor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard I just can’t figure out what happened. I put my left leg in, I took my left leg out, I put my left leg in, and something just snapped.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy The hokey pokey is a young man’s game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard I did have a great time. Thank you for reminding me it’s okay to have fun once in a while.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy You’re welcome.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard And also for breaking the head off the ice swan so I could hold it against my pulled groin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy I excel at spatial reasoning, and I had a hunch that the graceful slope of its neck would cradle your genitals nicely.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard Well, okay. Again, thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy And again, you’re welcome.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard Want to come in, have a cup of tea?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy No, thanks. I’m gonna head home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard Okay. Well, good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy Good night. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 penny Ames, hi. How was the wedding?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy Great. Until I accidentally made Leonard fall in love with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 penny Come in, let’s talk. Do you want a glass of wine?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy Wine is one of the reasons I’m in this fix. That and this dang pelvis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 penny Okay, I’m sorry, what exactly happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy The inevitable, he was lonely and vulnerable from missing his girlfriend, while I was charming, supportive and, let’s face it, in this dress, the perfect combination of Madonna and whore.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 penny Oh, God, did he make a move on you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy No, but it’s only a matter of time. How could I have not seen this coming? Now I’m gonna have to break the little sad sack’s heart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 penny Yeah, I’m sure he’ll be okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy Oh, Penny, much as I would treasure knowing that the two of us had been defiled by the same man, Leonard just doesn’t get my motor running.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 penny So, um, what are you gonna do? Do you want me to talk to Leonard, let him down easy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy No. I’ll let him have tonight. Then in the morning, I’ll send him an e-mail letting him know this body is never gonna be his wonderland. I mean, frankly, you’ve got a better shot than he does.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 sheldon Leonard. Check it out. I bought an N-gauge locomotive. Half the size of H-O. Look, it fits in my mouth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard Sounds like you had a great night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 sheldon I did. How was yours?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard Not bad. I had a lot more fun with Amy than I thought I would.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 sheldon What exactly do you mean by that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard Well, it turns out she really knows how to help a guy loosen up and have a good time. Although, truth be told, my groin’s a little worse for wear. Ow! Why did you do that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 sheldon To send a message. She is not for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 sheldon Not for you!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette Good morning, handsome.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard Morning, Mom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette It’s me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard Yes, it is, and you’re so pretty in the morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette Your mom and I made you breakfast.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard Oh, wow. So you guys are getting along?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette Yeah, I guess. We’re very different people, Howard, so communication’s a little tricky.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 mrs_wolowitz Does he like the pancakes?!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette He didn’t try them yet!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard Is there any butter?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette It’s butter-flavoured syrup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 mrs_wolowitz So, what’s the word?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette He wants butter!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 mrs_wolowitz It’s butter-flavoured syrup
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette I just told him that!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard I don’t need any butter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette If you want butter, I’ll get you butter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard Well, I guess I’ll cut these by myself.
