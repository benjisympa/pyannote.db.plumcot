TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Who wants the last dumpling?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 penny Ooh, me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Penny, a moment. We just had Thai food. In that culture, the last morsel is called the krengjai piece, and it is reserved for the most important and valued member of the group.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 penny Thank you all for this high honour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 sheldon_cooper I’ve seen pictures of your mother, keep eating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard_wolowitz All right, honey, if we’re gonna make the movie, we should go. This may be hard for you to hear, but when I say honey, I mean my fiancée. Yeah, well, now it means her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski It’s okay if he wants to come.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Fine. But next time, we get a sitter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 penny All right, I got to go to work. I’ll walk down with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Wait. Uh, which is closer to the new train store in Monrovia, the movie theatre or the Cheesecake Factory?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Neither of them are close.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Oh, well, then I guess it doesn’t matter which one of you drives me. Let’s play a fun guessing game to see who gets to take me. All right, this four-letter word describes either a printer’s type size or a compulsion to eat dirt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 penny Okay, I’m not driving him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 sheldon_cooper No, Penny, don’t give up, you can get this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Aren’t you going with Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler No, I have no interest in model trains, stores that sell them, nor their heartbreaking clientele.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Oh. Well, I have some work to do, so…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler I can’t imagine that would disturb me. Carry on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Okay. Wouldn’t you be more comfortable at home?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Not really, no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter All righty then. Guess I’ll just get started.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Leonard, please. I don’t need the running commentary.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Amy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Yo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter You okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter I thought you were reading.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler I was. Now I’m thinking about what I read. You all right, Leonard? You seem very uncomfortable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter I, I’m fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Should I go? I’ve been told sometimes I overstay my welcome.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter What, who told you that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Well, most recently my gynaecologist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Well, you stay as long as you’d like.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler I’m glad to hear you say that, because I’m having a wonderful time. Hmm, I said the same thing to my gynaecologist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski What are you going to get at the train store, Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Oh, I’m not buying anything. They’re having a lecture. H-O gauge railroading. Half the size of O-gauge, but twice the fun. Very controversial topic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Which side do you come down on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 sheldon_cooper I’ll let you know after tonight. Unlike some people, I’m going in with an open mind. Who am I kidding? Of course we all know it’s O-gauge or no gauge.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Can you believe grown men sit around and play with toy trains?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski That’s pretty big talk for a man with a closet full of magic tricks at his mother’s house.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard_wolowitz First of all, they’re not tricks, they’re illusions. And, secondly, when we get married, they’re all going up in the attic so you can have that closet for clothes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Why would I keep clothes at your mother’s house?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Well, don’t think of it that way. Once we move in, it’ll be our house.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Is she moving out?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Why would she move out? It’s her house.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Hang on. You seriously think I’m going to live with your mother?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Howard, I think I can help here. Yes, Bernadette, that’s exactly what he thinks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Why not? It’s a great house, plenty of room, and if we have kids, Mom’s there to help. You know, when she tells the Three Little Pigs story, she actually has hair on her chinny-chin-chin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski I’m not gonna live with your mother. Not now, not ever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Wow, someone obviously has some mommy issues.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Raj, take me home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Don’t listen to her. Go to the movie theatre.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Take me home now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Movie theatre.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Mmmmmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Okay, everybody calm down. There is a simple solution here. Raj, take me to the train store, and then I don’t care what you people do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler How was your shower?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter It was good, good. Just out of curiosity, what time do you usually go to bed?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, I’m up all night. I’m like a possum. Boy, you were not liked in high school, were you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Not really. Is that my yearbook?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Mm-hmm. Dear Leonard, you’re really good at science. Maybe one day you’ll come up with a cure for being a dork.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Well, it wasn’t spray-painting a lightning bolt on my briefcase, I can tell you that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler If it makes you feel any better, the only person who signed my yearbook was my mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Aw.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Dear Amy, self-respect and a hymen are better than friends and fun. Love, Mom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Well, you can add Jerry’s Junction to the list of train stores Sheldon Cooper will never set foot in again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Rough night, Casey Jones?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 sheldon_cooper You don’t know the half of it. It was billed as a lively give-and-take on the merits of model train sizes. But it was actually a set-up to intimidate weak-minded spineless rubes into buying H-O starter sets.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter What’s in the bag?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 sheldon_cooper I don’t want to talk about it. But it’s not a spine,I’ll tell you that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Well, I had a delightful evening, Leonard. We should do this again sometime.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Ah, sure. That’d be nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Glad to hear it. I need someone to accompany me to the wedding of Dr. Moranelli and Dr. Gustufson this Friday. They’re kind of the Brad and Angelina of the primatology department.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Wouldn’t you rather bring Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler I would, but the last wedding we went to was a disaster. He behaved like a child the entire time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Not my fault. You said there’d be other scientists there my age.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Doesn’t matter. You’re out, he’s in. No date to the prom, two dates to a wedding. Hmm, how times change.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Ha-ha, you have to go to a wedding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard_wolowitz I’ll get it!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 debbie_wolowitz Could you get it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard_wolowitz I said I’m getting it!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 debbie_wolowitz Fine, I’ll get it!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard_wolowitz I got it! Oh, hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Hey. I don’t want to fight. I was just surprised when you sprung the whole living-with-your-mom stuff on me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Yeah, well, I’m sorry I didn’t run it by you first.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 debbie_wolowitz I don’t know who you’re talking to, but in or out! We don’t need bugs!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard_wolowitz The bugs only come here because you’re their queen! Listen, how about this. Before we make any kind of decision about where we live, we have a trial run. Stay here for a weekend, see what it’s like.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski And your mom would be okay with that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Sure she would. Ma, do you mind if Bernadette stays here this weekend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 debbie_wolowitz Hey, if she’s willing to give the milk away for free, who am I to say no?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard_wolowitz See? She’s good with it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 debbie_wolowitz Frankly, after all your sleepovers with the little brown boy, a girl is a big relief!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 sheldon_cooper All this years, I’ve been so wrong. The tinier the train, the more concentrated the fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 penny You’re a brain scientist. Can you explain to me why a brilliant man likes playing with toy trains?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Not without cutting his head open, no. How about making my eyes like Cleopatra?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 penny Really? For a wedding?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Perhaps you’re right. My cheekbones and beckoning pelvis already have a certain hello sailor quality to them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Ready.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 penny Aw. So handsome. Like James Bond.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Better than James Bond, because he’s tinier.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler I got you this to give to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 penny Oh, sweetie, guests don’t normally wear corsages to a wedding. That’s more of a prom thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler I never went to my prom. My mom paid my cousin to take me, but he just used the money to buy drugs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 penny Put the corsage on her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Amy, this is for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler When you’re done copping a feel, that goes on my wrist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 sheldon_cooper All aboard! Woo-woo! It’s official. I’m an H-O trainiac.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard_wolowitz So, dinner went nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah. Yeah, I guess. Does your mother always cut your meat for you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Only when it’s fatty. Well, don’t be jealous, babe. Someday you’ll get to cut it for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 debbie_wolowitz Bernadette! I found the extra head for the Waterpik if you want to use it!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski I’m okay, Mrs. Wolowitz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 debbie_wolowitz You sure? I just squirted half a brisket outta my teeth!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Hey, Ma, how about a little privacy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 debbie_wolowitz Oh, I know what that means! Hubba-hubba!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Relax, it’ll be fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 debbie_wolowitz Let me know when you’re done canoodling! Mommy needs a foot rub!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Would you like to dance?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter No, thank you. I’m really not much of a dancer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler You’re not exactly winning any trophies as a conversationalist, either.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter I’m sorry. The bride and groom seem happy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Why shouldn’t they be? They have a feverish night of socially-approved copulation ahead of them. In some cultures, we’d stand outside of their bedroom cheering as they achieved orgasm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter That sounds like a late night, and I have work in the morning, so…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Leonard, you may not have noticed, but I am being a delight here. And you’re not holding up your end of the evening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Oh, sorry. This wedding just reminds me of my kinda-sorta girlfriend 9,000 miles away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler I have a kinda-sorta boyfriend who’s playing with a model train right now, you don’t hear me bitching about it. Leonard, a word of advice, moody self-obsession is only attractive in men who can play guitar and are considerably taller than you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter I’m not moody. I’m fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler You have any evidence to support that statement?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Well, hey, I’m just as much fun as you are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Really? Are you willing to draw a moustache on your finger as a conversational icebreaker? I am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Okay, fine, what do you suggest?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler We just had a lovely meal, the band is on fire, and you’re sitting next to a beautiful woman wearing whorish makeup. Why don’t we head outon the dance floor and see if I can sweat through these dress shields.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Once again, I, I’m really not much of a dancer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Don’t worry, I’ll lead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Howard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Ready for bed?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski No. I need to brush my teeth, but your mother’s been in the bathroom for, like, an hour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Oh. Yeah, she sometimes has problems doing her business. Hang on. Ma, give up! Tonight’s not your night!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 debbie_wolowitz You don’t know that! I just sat down!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Come on, take a break! Bernadette needs to brush her teeth!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 debbie_wolowitz She can come in and brush her teeth! I’m not embarrassed!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Problem solved.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski No, it’s not. I’m not going in there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Oh, come on, honey. She’s just sitting in there reading a magazine. You can’t see anything. I go in all the time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 debbie_wolowitz Ha! The eagle has landed!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard_wolowitz And we have splashdown. Wait here, I’m gonna go light a candle. And then we make passionate love.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler There we go, last floor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter I just can’t figure out what happened. I put my left leg in, I took my left leg out, I put my left leg in, and something just snapped.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler The hokey pokey is a young man’s game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter I did have a great time. Thank you for reminding me it’s okay to have fun once in a while.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler You’re welcome.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter And also for breaking the head off the ice swan so I could hold it against my pulled groin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler I excel at spatial reasoning, and I had a hunch that the graceful slope of its neck would cradle your genitals nicely.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Well, okay. Again, thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler And again, you’re welcome.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Want to come in, have a cup of tea?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler No, thanks. I’m gonna head home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Okay. Well, good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 penny Ames, hi. How was the wedding?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Great. Until I accidentally made Leonard fall in love with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 penny Come in, let’s talk. Do you want a glass of wine?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Wine is one of the reasons I’m in this fix. That and this dang pelvis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 penny Okay, I’m sorry, what exactly happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler The inevitable, he was lonely and vulnerable from missing his girlfriend, while I was charming, supportive and, let’s face it, in this dress, the perfect combination of Madonna and whore.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 penny Oh, God, did he make a move on you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler No, but it’s only a matter of time. How could I have not seen this coming? Now I’m gonna have to break the little sad sack’s heart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 penny Yeah, I’m sure he’ll be okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, Penny, much as I would treasure knowing that the two of us had been defiled by the same man, Leonard just doesn’t get my motor running.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 penny So, um, what are you gonna do? Do you want me to talk to Leonard, let him down easy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler No. I’ll let him have tonight. Then in the morning, I’ll send him an e-mail letting him know this body is never gonna be his wonderland. I mean, frankly, you’ve got a better shot than he does.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Leonard. Check it out. I bought an N-gauge locomotive. Half the size of H-O. Look, it fits in my mouth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Sounds like you had a great night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 sheldon_cooper I did. How was yours?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Not bad. I had a lot more fun with Amy than I thought I would.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 sheldon_cooper What exactly do you mean by that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Well, it turns out she really knows how to help a guy loosen up and have a good time. Although, truth be told, my groin’s a little worse for wear. Ow! Why did you do that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 sheldon_cooper To send a message. She is not for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Not for you!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Good morning, handsome.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Morning, Mom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski It’s me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Yes, it is, and you’re so pretty in the morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Your mom and I made you breakfast.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Oh, wow. So you guys are getting along?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, I guess. We’re very different people, Howard, so communication’s a little tricky.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 debbie_wolowitz Does he like the pancakes?!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski He didn’t try them yet!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Is there any butter?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski It’s butter-flavoured syrup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 debbie_wolowitz So, what’s the word?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski He wants butter!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 debbie_wolowitz It’s butter-flavoured syrup
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski I just told him that!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard_wolowitz I don’t need any butter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski If you want butter, I’ll get you butter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Well, I guess I’ll cut these by myself.
