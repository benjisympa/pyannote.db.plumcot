TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon The entrance to the dungeon is a moss covered door. You manage to open it only to find yourself face-to-face with a hideous, foul-smelling, moss-covered ogre. What do you do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard I say, hey Ma, what’s for dinner?”
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon Seventeen. The ogre is amused by your joke and allows you to pass. By the by, I liked it, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 leonard Hey, how go the wedding plans, Howard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard Great. We spent five hours last night at Macy’s registering for gifts. Looks like I’m finally going to have that darling little earthenware asparagus dish I’ve always wanted.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 leonard See, this is the good thing about having a girlfriend 9,000 miles away. I can spend my nights doing whatever I want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard You mean like playing nerd games with us and then taking a suspiciously long shower?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 leonard Maybe. We enter the dungeon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon You see a dragon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard Really? So we’re playing Dungeons and Dragons, and we walk into a dungeon and see a dragon? Isn’t that a little on the nose?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon When you play Chutes and Ladders, do you complain about all the chutes and all the ladders?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 leonard Are you gonna eat that whole pie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj Maybe. Why not? Who do I have in my life to watch my figure for?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 leonard Oh, God, did you watch Bridget Jones again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj No, it’s just that everybody’s got someone. Sheldon’s with Amy, Howard’s getting married, you’re dating my sister.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 leonard Now that Howard’s getting married, maybe he’ll inflate one of his old girlfriends for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj You know who I blame for my loneliness? The United States of America. Your movies and your TV shows promised streets paved with beautiful blonde women with big bazongas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard Eat another pie, you’ll have your own bazongas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj That’s cruel. You know it goes straight to my hips.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon Gentlemen, please focus. You’re facing a fire-breathing dragon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj I don’t know if I want to play anymore.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon Because you don’t have a girlfriend? Well, good Lord, if that becomes a reason not to play Dungeons and Dragons, this game’s in serious trouble.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 amy Now, I assume we use this same wax later on to neaten up each other’s bikini regions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Yeah, my bikini region is fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 amy Who’s shocked? I’m not. So, Bernadette, how’s the wedding planning going? And I’m not asking as a prospective bridesmaid. Pick me! Pick me!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 bernadette We went cake-tasting yesterday. Raj came along. He cried and ate half the samples.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Oh, the poor guy’s so lonely. We should set him up with someone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 bernadette You know, I met a really cute girl at work. She’s married to a guy in one of our drug trials.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Well, hello? She’s married.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 bernadette Yeah, but her husband is in serious congestive heart failure, and a little birdie told me he’s in the placebo group.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Okay, so future grief-stricken widow is the one to beat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 leonard Are we ready to order?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon One moment. I’m conducting an experiment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard With Dungeons and Dragons dice?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon Yes. From here on in, I’ve decided to make all trivial decisions with a throw of the dice, thus freeing up my mind to do what it does best, enlighten and amaze. Page 14, item seven.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard So, what’s for dinner?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon A side of corn succotash. Hmm. Interesting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Um, Howard, can I see you for a minute, please?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard Uh, I don’t want to show any more of your friends how I can fit in the booster seats.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Uh, no, that’s not it. Just come with me, please.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon Let’s see what I’ll be washing that succotash down with. A pitcher of margaritas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 leonard Do you really want that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon That’s the great thing. It doesn’t matter. My mind is freed up to think about more important things.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj What’s it thinking about now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon Hamburgers and lemonade.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Um, Raj, there’s someone I want you to meet. This is my friend Emily. I know her from my spin class. Raj, relax. She can’t hear you. She’s deaf.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard Emily, this is our friend Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Oh! Look at you guys just hitting it off. I am so good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard She says it’s nice to meet you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj Does she really mean that or was she signing it sarcastically?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard Raj says it’s nice to meet you, too. She says she has to go back to her family, but Penny has her number if you want to text her and get together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj Okay, I’m going to play it cool. Tell her, maybe. Whatever, babe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard He’ll text you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj Ah, look at that. I have a date. I love America again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon And now for dessert, come on, hot fudge sundae, come on, hot fudge sundae. Bam! That’s what I’m talking about!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj Okay, as soon as she gets here, so she knows I’m cool with it, I’m going to make a joke about her being deaf. I was thinking, hey, did you hear the one about…? Oh, no, I bet you didn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard Maybe we should revisit your lonely fat guy plan.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj Oh, she’s here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard No joke. Oh, she says she’s sorry she’s late.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj Tell her it doesn’t matter. Tell her, her eyes shimmer like opalescent lilies in the lake of the palace of the celestial maidens.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard Really? That’s the first thing you want to say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj I worked on it all night. Use it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard Look, I don’t know the sign for opalescent.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj Then spell it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard I don’t know how to spell it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj You’re blowing this for me!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard He likes your eyes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj You’re making me sound like a caveman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard She says, thank you, you have nice eyes, too.”
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj Really? Ask her how many children she wants, and whatever number she says, say, me too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj Fine. Tell her I have a deep, sexy voice like James Earl Jones.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard She doesn’t know what James Earl Jones sounds like.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj Great. Then she won’t know I’m lying.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj Let’s see, what else can I tell you about me that would make you like me? Ooh, I love music. Do you love music?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard You really want to ask her that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj You’re right. Everyone loves music.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard She says, do you play an instrument?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj No, but when I was six years old, I tried to start a boy band called Frankie Goes to Bollywood. But I couldn’t get any other boys to join, so my parents asked the servants to be my backup dancers. Wait, when you sign servants, don’t sign it like I’m bragging. Sign it in a way that I sound humble with just a hint of, that’s right, I had servants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard Do you hear yourself
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj Yes, but she doesn’t. So get signing, hand monkey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard I think I wrote a letter to Santa Claus every day. And then on Christmas morning, under the tree is a little puppy with a red ribbon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard Texting Bernadette that I’m gonna be late.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj Dude, what is she saying?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard It’s a funny story about a puppy. Just smile and laugh. Quick, quick, stop smiling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj What? Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard The puppy died, it choked on a doll head. Sad face, sad face!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj It’s a little hard to see with the city lights, but that W-shaped constellation is Cassiopeia. And she was the mother of Andromeda who’s over there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard Look, pretty stars. This is her car. She hopes she can see you again sometime.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj Good, good. Oh, boy, help me out here. Does she want me to kiss her or not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard I speak sign language, I don’t read minds.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj If you were me, would you kiss her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard Yeah, but I’m a make out king. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj I was so smooth on that date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard You? I made you smooth. You were an idiot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj Whatever, dude. She kissed me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard It might’ve been on your lips, but it was my kiss.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj Oh, fine. Let’s agree she kissed both of us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Mustache is looking good there, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon Don’t thank me. Thank the dice. They told me what percentage of my face to shave.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard Why are you still doing this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon Because it’s working. In the past few weeks, unburdened by trivial decisions, I’ve co-authored two papers in notable peer-reviewed journals, and I’m close to figuring out why the Large Hadron Collider has yet to isolate the Higgs boson particle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 leonard You left out, got chafed testicles because you no longer wear underpants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon The dice giveth and the dice taketh away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Is Raj out with Emily again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 leonard Yeah, every night for the last month.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Wow, can’t believe he has a girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon Me neither.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard Here’s some other fun news on the Raj/Emily front. He gave her a pair of diamond earrings and leased her a car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny You’re kidding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 leonard You think she’s taking advantage of him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Oh, of course not. She wouldn’t do something like that. She’s deaf.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 leonard Deaf women can’t be gold diggers?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Handicapped people are nice, Leonard. Everyone knows that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon Yeah, I actually have information about Raj that would be helpful with this discussion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 leonard Could you tell us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon Let’s see. Snake eyes. Sorry, bud.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Wait, hang on. Doubles. Roll again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon Okay, get this. It doesn’t matter if he’s showering her with gifts, because the Koothrappalis are vastly wealthy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny What do you mean, vastly wealthy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon Well, wealthy means a lot of money, and vastly means even more. I’m not sure what’s tripping you up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 leonard Look, I know they have money. I don’t think it’s that much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon No, you’re wrong. See, as you know, a few years ago, I achieved one of my lesser dreams and became a notary public. Well, from time to time, I notarize banking documents for Raj. The Koothrappalis aren’t just rich, they’re Richie Rich rich.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Well, so how much is that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon About halfway between Bruce Wayne and Scrooge McDuck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard What the hell? The last time we went to the zoo, that son of a bitch made me buy him a churro.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 leonard Listen, guys, I’m sorry, I don’t mean to be rude, but I need to go call Raj’s sister, who I love so much. So vastly much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Okay, so he’s got money, and it’s a few gifts and a car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard And she got him to pay off all her credit cards.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny What? He paid off her credit cards? Damn it, I could’ve dated Raj for a couple months. But I, I wouldn’t have, because I’m not that kind of girl. We should really talk to Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard He’s not going to listen, he’s in love.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon Can’t figure out what to do? I remember those days. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to… stay right here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard Yeah, this is a bad idea. We should go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny No. I’m the one that introduced him to her. I’ve got to say something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard Wow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny You’re engaged to my friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard Hey, Bernadette doesn’t mind where I get my motor running, as long as I park in the right garage.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny I can’t believe you’re engaged to my friend. Oh, here she comes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard Smart. Whisper so the deaf chick can’t hear you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard Oh, hey, hi. Nice to see you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Um, can we talk to you about Raj?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard She says, sure, what about him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Okay, um, gosh, how do I start? Um, see, Raj is kind of naive. I mean, he hasn’t dated a whole lot of women. And I’m concerned that, without meaning to, you might be taking advantage of him. You know, by letting him buy you a bunch of expensive things.And I.. I… Howard, focus. Tell her what I’m saying.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard Right. Are you a gold digger or not? Oh, uh, something, something, who the something do you think you are? Mind your own something business and go something yourself. Oh, wait, I got this now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj I’m so mad at you!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Okay, wait…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj How dare you ambush my girlfriend at the gym!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny We didn’t mean for it to be an ambush. Just, it’s kind of impossible not to sneak up on deaf people. And hey, since when are you so chatty?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj I’m hammered.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Raj, come here. This girl is trouble. I mean, what kind of relationship is it where you buy her gifts and she gives you sex?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj The best one I ever had!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Okay, come on. You know you can do better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj Aha. I see what’s going on here. You and I had our crazy night together, and now you can’t stand to see me with another woman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj It’s okay. I can’t get mad at your feelings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny I don’t have feelings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj Yeah, that’s good. Keep telling yourself that. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny He is cuter now that I know he’s rich.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj I have a surprise for you. Cover your eyes. Open them. It’s a real ruby. It was a little expensive, but no one can put a price on love. Although, the people at Cartier took a pretty good shot at it. Oh, Mummy, Daddy. What a nice surprise.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 dr_koothrappali No, it’s not a nice surprise, it’s a bad surprise.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 mrs_koothrappali Penny called us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 mrs_koothrappali She told us you’re spending all our money on your new girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj I just got her a couple of things. She gives me things, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 dr_koothrappali Yeah, yeah, I’m a gynaecologist. I know exactly what she gives you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 mrs_koothrappali You need to find a nice Indian girl from a good family. If you keep seeing this woman, you’re cut off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj What? You’re going to make me choose between the woman I love and the money I have very strong feelings for?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 dr_koothrappali It’s up to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj Well, I choose love.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 dr_koothrappali Hah. You’re an idiot. Love doesn’t last. Well, he’s going to find out eventually. Think about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj My parents are making me choose between money and you. I choose you. No, I think we’ll have to return the car. And that necklace, yeah, that, too. But none of those things matter, because we have something better. We have love.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj Oh, Penny, I hurt so bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny I know, I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj Sometimes I put the TV on mute just to pretend she’s still with me. But I can’t watch the closed captioning without crying.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Oh, I’m so sorry. I wish I could make you feel better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj Seriously? I’m heartbroken and you’re hitting on me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny What? No!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj Look, Penny, you’re great, but I had a long talk with my parents, and they said if I date an Indian girl, I get a Maserati.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj Mmm. Oh, cheesecake, you’re just as good as a woman, even though I can’t have sex with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard Try throwing it in the microwave for a few seconds.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon Should I use the rest room or wait until we get home? Come on, papa needs to void his bladder. Oh, that’s not what you want to see after three buttermilks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Here you go, boys. I’ll pick it up when you’re ready.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard Thanks for dinner, buddy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 leonard Yeah, real big of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon Hurry, hurry, hurry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Oh, and don’t cheap out on the tip. We all know you’re loaded now.
