TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon_cooper The entrance to the dungeon is a moss covered door. You manage to open it only to find yourself face-to-face with a hideous, foul-smelling, moss-covered ogre. What do you do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz I say, hey Ma, what’s for dinner?”
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Seventeen. The ogre is amused by your joke and allows you to pass. By the by, I liked it, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Hey, how go the wedding plans, Howard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Great. We spent five hours last night at Macy’s registering for gifts. Looks like I’m finally going to have that darling little earthenware asparagus dish I’ve always wanted.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter See, this is the good thing about having a girlfriend 9,000 miles away. I can spend my nights doing whatever I want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz You mean like playing nerd games with us and then taking a suspiciously long shower?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Maybe. We enter the dungeon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon_cooper You see a dragon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Really? So we’re playing Dungeons and Dragons, and we walk into a dungeon and see a dragon? Isn’t that a little on the nose?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon_cooper When you play Chutes and Ladders, do you complain about all the chutes and all the ladders?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Are you gonna eat that whole pie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Maybe. Why not? Who do I have in my life to watch my figure for?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Oh, God, did you watch Bridget Jones again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali No, it’s just that everybody’s got someone. Sheldon’s with Amy, Howard’s getting married, you’re dating my sister.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Now that Howard’s getting married, maybe he’ll inflate one of his old girlfriends for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali You know who I blame for my loneliness? The United States of America. Your movies and your TV shows promised streets paved with beautiful blonde women with big bazongas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Eat another pie, you’ll have your own bazongas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali That’s cruel. You know it goes straight to my hips.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Gentlemen, please focus. You’re facing a fire-breathing dragon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali I don’t know if I want to play anymore.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Because you don’t have a girlfriend? Well, good Lord, if that becomes a reason not to play Dungeons and Dragons, this game’s in serious trouble.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 amy_farrah_fowler Now, I assume we use this same wax later on to neaten up each other’s bikini regions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Yeah, my bikini region is fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 amy_farrah_fowler Who’s shocked? I’m not. So, Bernadette, how’s the wedding planning going? And I’m not asking as a prospective bridesmaid. Pick me! Pick me!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 bernadette_rostenkowski We went cake-tasting yesterday. Raj came along. He cried and ate half the samples.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Oh, the poor guy’s so lonely. We should set him up with someone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 bernadette_rostenkowski You know, I met a really cute girl at work. She’s married to a guy in one of our drug trials.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Well, hello? She’s married.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, but her husband is in serious congestive heart failure, and a little birdie told me he’s in the placebo group.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Okay, so future grief-stricken widow is the one to beat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Are we ready to order?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon_cooper One moment. I’m conducting an experiment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz With Dungeons and Dragons dice?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Yes. From here on in, I’ve decided to make all trivial decisions with a throw of the dice, thus freeing up my mind to do what it does best, enlighten and amaze. Page 14, item seven.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz So, what’s for dinner?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon_cooper A side of corn succotash. Hmm. Interesting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Um, Howard, can I see you for a minute, please?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Uh, I don’t want to show any more of your friends how I can fit in the booster seats.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Uh, no, that’s not it. Just come with me, please.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Let’s see what I’ll be washing that succotash down with. A pitcher of margaritas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Do you really want that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon_cooper That’s the great thing. It doesn’t matter. My mind is freed up to think about more important things.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali What’s it thinking about now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Hamburgers and lemonade.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Um, Raj, there’s someone I want you to meet. This is my friend Emily. I know her from my spin class. Raj, relax. She can’t hear you. She’s deaf.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Emily, this is our friend Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Oh! Look at you guys just hitting it off. I am so good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz She says it’s nice to meet you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Does she really mean that or was she signing it sarcastically?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Raj says it’s nice to meet you, too. She says she has to go back to her family, but Penny has her number if you want to text her and get together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Okay, I’m going to play it cool. Tell her, maybe. Whatever, babe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz He’ll text you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Ah, look at that. I have a date. I love America again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon_cooper And now for dessert, come on, hot fudge sundae, come on, hot fudge sundae. Bam! That’s what I’m talking about!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Okay, as soon as she gets here, so she knows I’m cool with it, I’m going to make a joke about her being deaf. I was thinking, hey, did you hear the one about…? Oh, no, I bet you didn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Maybe we should revisit your lonely fat guy plan.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Oh, she’s here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz No joke. Oh, she says she’s sorry she’s late.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Tell her it doesn’t matter. Tell her, her eyes shimmer like opalescent lilies in the lake of the palace of the celestial maidens.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Really? That’s the first thing you want to say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali I worked on it all night. Use it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Look, I don’t know the sign for opalescent.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Then spell it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz I don’t know how to spell it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali You’re blowing this for me!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz He likes your eyes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali You’re making me sound like a caveman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz She says, thank you, you have nice eyes, too.”
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Really? Ask her how many children she wants, and whatever number she says, say, me too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Fine. Tell her I have a deep, sexy voice like James Earl Jones.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz She doesn’t know what James Earl Jones sounds like.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Great. Then she won’t know I’m lying.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Let’s see, what else can I tell you about me that would make you like me? Ooh, I love music. Do you love music?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz You really want to ask her that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali You’re right. Everyone loves music.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz She says, do you play an instrument?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali No, but when I was six years old, I tried to start a boy band called Frankie Goes to Bollywood. But I couldn’t get any other boys to join, so my parents asked the servants to be my backup dancers. Wait, when you sign servants, don’t sign it like I’m bragging. Sign it in a way that I sound humble with just a hint of, that’s right, I had servants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Do you hear yourself
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Yes, but she doesn’t. So get signing, hand monkey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz I think I wrote a letter to Santa Claus every day. And then on Christmas morning, under the tree is a little puppy with a red ribbon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Texting Bernadette that I’m gonna be late.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Dude, what is she saying?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz It’s a funny story about a puppy. Just smile and laugh. Quick, quick, stop smiling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali What? Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz The puppy died, it choked on a doll head. Sad face, sad face!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali It’s a little hard to see with the city lights, but that W-shaped constellation is Cassiopeia. And she was the mother of Andromeda who’s over there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Look, pretty stars. This is her car. She hopes she can see you again sometime.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Good, good. Oh, boy, help me out here. Does she want me to kiss her or not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz I speak sign language, I don’t read minds.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali If you were me, would you kiss her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Yeah, but I’m a make out king.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali I was so smooth on that date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz You? I made you smooth. You were an idiot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Whatever, dude. She kissed me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz It might’ve been on your lips, but it was my kiss.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Oh, fine. Let’s agree she kissed both of us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Mustache is looking good there, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Don’t thank me. Thank the dice. They told me what percentage of my face to shave.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Why are you still doing this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Because it’s working. In the past few weeks, unburdened by trivial decisions, I’ve co-authored two papers in notable peer-reviewed journals, and I’m close to figuring out why the Large Hadron Collider has yet to isolate the Higgs boson particle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter You left out, got chafed testicles because you no longer wear underpants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon_cooper The dice giveth and the dice taketh away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Is Raj out with Emily again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, every night for the last month.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Wow, can’t believe he has a girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Me neither.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Here’s some other fun news on the Raj/Emily front. He gave her a pair of diamond earrings and leased her a car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny You’re kidding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter You think she’s taking advantage of him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Oh, of course not. She wouldn’t do something like that. She’s deaf.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Deaf women can’t be gold diggers?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Handicapped people are nice, Leonard. Everyone knows that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Yeah, I actually have information about Raj that would be helpful with this discussion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Could you tell us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Let’s see. Snake eyes. Sorry, bud.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Wait, hang on. Doubles. Roll again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Okay, get this. It doesn’t matter if he’s showering her with gifts, because the Koothrappalis are vastly wealthy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny What do you mean, vastly wealthy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Well, wealthy means a lot of money, and vastly means even more. I’m not sure what’s tripping you up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Look, I know they have money. I don’t think it’s that much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon_cooper No, you’re wrong. See, as you know, a few years ago, I achieved one of my lesser dreams and became a notary public. Well, from time to time, I notarize banking documents for Raj. The Koothrappalis aren’t just rich, they’re Richie Rich rich.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Well, so how much is that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon_cooper About halfway between Bruce Wayne and Scrooge McDuck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz What the hell? The last time we went to the zoo, that son of a bitch made me buy him a churro.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Listen, guys, I’m sorry, I don’t mean to be rude, but I need to go call Raj’s sister, who I love so much. So vastly much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Okay, so he’s got money, and it’s a few gifts and a car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz And she got him to pay off all her credit cards.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny What? He paid off her credit cards? Damn it, I could’ve dated Raj for a couple months. But I, I wouldn’t have, because I’m not that kind of girl. We should really talk to Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz He’s not going to listen, he’s in love.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Can’t figure out what to do? I remember those days. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to… stay right here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Yeah, this is a bad idea. We should go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny No. I’m the one that introduced him to her. I’ve got to say something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Wow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny You’re engaged to my friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Hey, Bernadette doesn’t mind where I get my motor running, as long as I park in the right garage.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny I can’t believe you’re engaged to my friend. Oh, here she comes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Smart. Whisper so the deaf chick can’t hear you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Oh, hey, hi. Nice to see you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Um, can we talk to you about Raj?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz She says, sure, what about him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Okay, um, gosh, how do I start? Um, see, Raj is kind of naive. I mean, he hasn’t dated a whole lot of women. And I’m concerned that, without meaning to, you might be taking advantage of him. You know, by letting him buy you a bunch of expensive things.And I.. I… Howard, focus. Tell her what I’m saying.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Right. Are you a gold digger or not? Oh, uh, something, something, who the something do you think you are? Mind your own something business and go something yourself. Oh, wait, I got this now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali I’m so mad at you!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Okay, wait…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali How dare you ambush my girlfriend at the gym!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny We didn’t mean for it to be an ambush. Just, it’s kind of impossible not to sneak up on deaf people. And hey, since when are you so chatty?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali I’m hammered.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Raj, come here. This girl is trouble. I mean, what kind of relationship is it where you buy her gifts and she gives you sex?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali The best one I ever had!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Okay, come on. You know you can do better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Aha. I see what’s going on here. You and I had our crazy night together, and now you can’t stand to see me with another woman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali It’s okay. I can’t get mad at your feelings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny I don’t have feelings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Yeah, that’s good. Keep telling yourself that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny He is cuter now that I know he’s rich.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali I have a surprise for you. Cover your eyes. Open them. It’s a real ruby. It was a little expensive, but no one can put a price on love. Although, the people at Cartier took a pretty good shot at it. Oh, Mummy, Daddy. What a nice surprise.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 dr_vm_koothrappali No, it’s not a nice surprise, it’s a bad surprise.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 mrs_koothrappali Penny called us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 mrs_koothrappali She told us you’re spending all our money on your new girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali I just got her a couple of things. She gives me things, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 dr_vm_koothrappali Yeah, yeah, I’m a gynaecologist. I know exactly what she gives you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 mrs_koothrappali You need to find a nice Indian girl from a good family. If you keep seeing this woman, you’re cut off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali What? You’re going to make me choose between the woman I love and the money I have very strong feelings for?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 dr_vm_koothrappali It’s up to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Well, I choose love.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 dr_vm_koothrappali Hah. You’re an idiot. Love doesn’t last. Well, he’s going to find out eventually. Think about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali My parents are making me choose between money and you. I choose you. No, I think we’ll have to return the car. And that necklace, yeah, that, too. But none of those things matter, because we have something better. We have love.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Oh, Penny, I hurt so bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny I know, I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Sometimes I put the TV on mute just to pretend she’s still with me. But I can’t watch the closed captioning without crying.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Oh, I’m so sorry. I wish I could make you feel better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Seriously? I’m heartbroken and you’re hitting on me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny What? No!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Look, Penny, you’re great, but I had a long talk with my parents, and they said if I date an Indian girl, I get a Maserati.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Mmm. Oh, cheesecake, you’re just as good as a woman, even though I can’t have sex with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Try throwing it in the microwave for a few seconds.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Should I use the rest room or wait until we get home? Come on, papa needs to void his bladder. Oh, that’s not what you want to see after three buttermilks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Here you go, boys. I’ll pick it up when you’re ready.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Thanks for dinner, buddy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, real big of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Hurry, hurry, hurry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode04 penny Oh, and don’t cheap out on the tip. We all know you’re loaded now.
