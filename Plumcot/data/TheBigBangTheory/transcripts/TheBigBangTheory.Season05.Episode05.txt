TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter It’s from Game of Thrones. What do you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper I don’t know. If we’re going to start a fantasy sword collection, and I’ve long thought we should, is this really the sword to start with?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter What did you have in mind?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Well, off the top of my head, I’d have to go with Excalibur. It gives you the right to rule England.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter It would be a replica of a movie prop.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Fair enough. It’d give you the right to rule a replica of England.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Well, they don’t have an Excalibur here, so what do you want to do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Mm. Tough decision. There’s no weaponry from Lord of the Rings, forged in a Chinese sweatshop?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Just Bilbo Baggins’ sword over there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Two grown men with a hobbit’s dagger; wouldn’t we look silly? Okay, let’s go for it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 stuart_bloom Oh, I see you guys have found my little treasure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Yeah. It’s okay, I guess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Okay? It’s magnificent.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Buh-buh-buh-buh! What do you want for it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 stuart_bloom Oh, it’s hard to put a price on something that’s a copy of something that was on pay cable. But for my friends, let’s say 250?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Oh, that’s pretty steep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 stuart_bloom Well, it’s a limited edition. They only made 8,000 of these bad boys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Only 8,000? We’re wasting precious time. Buy it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Hang on. Can you do any better?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 stuart_bloom Are you kidding? I’m already giving you the friends and family discount.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Oh, did you hear that? We’re getting the friends and family discount. We are honoured and we will take it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Slow down. Two hundred.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper What are you doing? Two fifty is already the discounted price.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Will you shut up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 stuart_bloom Tell you what, I’ll go two thirty-five.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Nope. Maybe another time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 stuart_bloom Okay, two twenty five, my final offer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Take it, take it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Two hundred.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 stuart_bloom Man, you’re killing me!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Killing you? I can’t breathe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 stuart_bloom Two ten, and I’m losing money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Oh, now, we can’t let him lose money, Leonard. I’m so sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Two ten and you throw in the Iron Man helmet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 stuart_bloom Are you crazy? That helmet’s signed by Robert Downey Jr.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter So?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 stuart_bloom Okay, if you’re going to question the importance of an actor’s signature on a plastic helmet from a movie based on a comic book, then all of our lives have no meaning!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Okay, fine. Just the sword, two ten.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 stuart_bloom Thank you. I can eat meat this week.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter See that? I just saved us forty bucks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper I’ve long said, what you lack in academic knowledge you make up for in street smarts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 stuart_bloom You want me to wrap it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter No, it’s okay. I’m gonna stab my friend in the chest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 wil_wheaton Hey, Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 stuart_bloom Ah, hey, Wil.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Hello, Wil Wheaton.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 wil_wheaton Hi, Sheldon. Nice sword.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper It’s part of my sword collection. Do you have a sword collection?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 wil_wheaton No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper I’m not surprised.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 stuart_bloom Here’s the Batman 612 with the Jim Lee alternate cover that you wanted.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 wil_wheaton Awesome. What do I owe you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 stuart_bloom Forty bucks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 wil_wheaton Good deal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Sucker. Didn’t even ask for the friends and family discount.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 wil_wheaton Hey, I’m having a party at my house on Friday, and I was hoping you would stop by.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 stuart_bloom Will there be girls there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 wil_wheaton Yeah, of course.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 stuart_bloom ‘Cause there wasn’t last time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 wil_wheaton There will be girls. You guys are invited if you want to come by.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 wil_wheaton All right, great. Later.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper I see what you’re doing. You accept an invitation to a party at the home of my sworn enemy, he tells everyone we’re going to be there, and when we don’t show, he looks the fool. Fiendishly clever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter I was actually thinking about going.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper And then declaring the party a fiasco and storming out, leaving him humiliated in front of his guests. Love it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter No, I was gonna grab Raj and Howard and have a good time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 stuart_bloom Oh, great, more guys. It’s gonna be another Wil Wheaton sausage-fest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, can you grab me a water?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Possibly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Can you or can’t you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper It’s not that simple, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter It never is, is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper At this moment, our relationship exists in two mutually contradictory states. Until you either do not go or go to Wil Wheaton’s party, you are simultaneously my friend and not my friend. I’m characterizing this phenomenon as Schrodinger’s Friendship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Got it. Can I have my water?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Of course. Now get it yourself, you traitor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 penny Wait, what is going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper In case you have forgotten, Schrodinger’s cat is a thought experiment…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 penny No, no, no, no, I didn’t forget. Um, there’s this cat in a box and until you open it, it’s either dead or alive or both. Although, back in Nebraska, our cat got stuck in my brother’s camp trunk, and we did not need to open it to know there was all kinds of dead cat in there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler Homespun stories, knowledge of physics and a bosom that defies it. You’re the whole package, aren’t you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Sorry I’m late. Uh, I got great news. NASA picked my team’s design for the deep field space telescope that’s going on the International Space Station this spring.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 all@ Wow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski Howie, that’s wonderful! Congratulations!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 howard_wolowitz It gets better. Someone has to go up with the telescope as a payload specialist, and guess who that someone is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Mohammed Lee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Who’s Mohammed Lee?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Mohammed is the most common first name in the world, Lee, the most common surname. As I didn’t know the answer, I thought that gave me a mathematical edge.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 howard_wolowitz It’s me, Sheldon. It’s me. I’m going up in space! Technically, I’m an astronaut.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 all@ Wow, that’s amazing!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski Hang on a second. NASA doesn’t have a shuttle any more. How are you going to get up there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Oh, well, it’s really cool. You fly to Moscow, they take you out to Kazakhstan, and then you get into a Russian Soyuz rocket which shoots you into a low earth orbit. Or just sits there on the launch pad because the Kazakhi mafia sold the rocket fuel on the black market.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski Are those Russian rockets safe?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Well, I mean, safe as it can be when it was built by the good folks who brought you Chernobyl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter I’d like to propose a toast. The dream to go up into space is one we all share, and Howard’s making that a reality. We’re all very proud of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 all@ Cheers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper That was a lovely toast. Kudos.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Simultaneously, a festival of cloying clichés. You sicken me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 howard_wolowitz You’re really quiet. Is everything okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski Fine. Just a little tired.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 howard_wolowitz I hope not too tired, because I’m feeling particularly masculine right now. All systems go, if you catch my drift.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski I always catch your drift.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 howard_wolowitz All right, well, something’s obviously bugging you. What is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski I just can’t believe you signed up for the space program without even talking to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Oh, I get it. You’re worried about me. That is so sweet. You know, there’s a saying we have at NASA. What makes the right stuff so right is that it always comes home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski Just stop talking, Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 howard_wolowitz This isn’t the reaction I expected when I told you I was gonna be an astronaut.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski What did you think was going to happen?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Honestly? Sex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Do you realize what a big deal this is? What an honour it is to be chosen to go into space?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, I get it. I just wish you included me in the decision. We’re supposed to be partners. We’re supposed to be a team.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 howard_wolowitz I’m sorry. You’re right. Okay, let’s try this again. Bernadette, an opportunity has come up that impacts both of us, and I’d like to discuss it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 howard_wolowitz I’ve been offered a chance to go up to the International Space Station for three weeks. What are your thoughts on that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski Well, first of all, thank you for including me in the decision-making process.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Hey, we’re a team. So, what do you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 howard_wolowitz No?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Well why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski Howard, my father was a police officer. We never knew from one night to the next if he was going to come home alive. It was horrible. And I don’t want to live that way with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Hey, my father abandoned me and my mother when I was 11. We never saw him again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, boo-hoo, you’re not going to space!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Pretty cool about Howard, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Don’t talk to me as if nothing’s happened between us. And yes, it sure is, buddy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter For God’s sake, will you stop with the Schrodinger stuff.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Would you prefer a simpler application of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, in which I could either know where you are or whether I like you, but not both?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter You never stop talking, do you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler I don’t understand. What differences does it make if Leonard goes to Wil Wheaton’s party?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 penny Wil Wheaton is Sheldon’s mortal enemy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler Mortal enemy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 penny Mm-hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, I know you’re a bit of a left-handed monkey wrench, but, you really have a mortal enemy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper In fact, I have 61 of them. Would you like to see the list?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 penny Oh, say no, say no, say no, say no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper You just got off the list. Would you like back on it? This’ll just take a moment. It’s on a five and a quarter inch floppy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler A floppy disk?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Well, I started the list when I was nine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler How did Wil Wheaton get on the list?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 all@ Oh! Oh, God!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper As a child, I loved Wesley Crusher, Wil Wheaton’s character on Star Trek. So, I drove for hours by bus to a Star Trek convention at which Wil Wheaton was scheduled to appear, so that I could get my Wesley Crusher action figure signed. But he never showed, because apparently, it was cooler for him to be the lower-left corner on Hollywood Squares. Oh, damn! The floppy failed. Well, whoever was in charge of quality control at the Verbatim Corporation in 1989, congratulations, you just made the list.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski Howard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Change your mind about sex? I’m still mad, but I’ll do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski No, I’ve just been thinking. It doesn’t matter if I’m afraid for your safety. I don’t want to be the person who stands between you and your dreams.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski Really. If going into space means that much to you, I will never say another word about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski I love you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 howard_wolowitz I love you, too. So, sex now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski Okay. I just forgot to brush my teeth. I’ll be right back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 debbie_wolowitz Over my dead body my son goes into outer space!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski I’m ready.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Wait, let me see if I got this right. You actually asked Bernadette to leave your house in the middle of the night?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 howard_wolowitz What choice did I have? She went behind my back and turned my own mother against me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 raj_koothrappali Wow. You’re not only our first astronaut. You’re also the first one of us to kick a girl out of bed. You’re like a rock star.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Little bit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter I hate to say it, but she did kind of betray you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Interesting. You see betrayal in others, but not yourself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Going to Wheaton’s party is not betraying you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Oh, of course you would have to believe that. Evil always thinks it’s doing right. Excuse me, Stormtrooper. These are the droids you’re looking for.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter I’m going to a party. I’m not turning R2-D2 and C-3PO over to the empire!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Not yet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 raj_koothrappali So, what’s gonna happen next? Are you and Bernadette going to break up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 howard_wolowitz I don’t know. If we’re going to get back together, she’s going to have to apologize and accept that I’m a grown man who can make his own decisions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 raj_koothrappali Then she’s going to have to convince your mother to let you go into space.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Obviously.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski I had no choice. I had to tell his mother. He can’t go to space. He’s like a baby bird. Do you know he once got an asthma attack from reading an old library book?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler You’re kidding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 penny No, I was there that day. Sheldon threw his back out handing him that book.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t know what I’m going to do. I don’t want to break up over this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 penny Okay, why don’t you just tell him you made a mistake?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski Do you guys think it was a mistake? Am I the bad guy in this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler It’s not for us to judge. We’re just here to provide comfort and support while you come to grips with what a despicable thing you’ve done.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, God, you’re right. I took our love and threw it under his bus-sized mother. I need to apologize.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 penny Well, that, that’s good. I’m glad you came to that. But before you do, let me just ask you a big picture question.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 penny Are you a hundred percent positive you love and want to marry Howard Wolowitz?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski I do, with all my heart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 penny Got it. Just had to check.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler He’s great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter All right, Sheldon, we’re going to Wil’s. This is your last chance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper No, Leonard, this is your last chance. One day, a historian is going to come to you and say, is it true you were friends with Dr. Sheldon Cooper? And you’re going to have to choke back a hot sob of regret and humiliation as you mumble, I was, but I chose to go to a party thrown by the one kid from Stand By Me that no one remembers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter You want to drive?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 raj_koothrappali Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Hey, Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Oh, good. You picked me, you picked me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter No, I just got a text from Stuart. Brent Spiner is at the party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Brent Spiner?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper I don’t care.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Really? Brent Spiner, Mr. Data himself. You love him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper I did, but I think I’ve kind of outgrown Star Trek. You know, stock characters, ludicrous plots, beam me up. What a load of hooey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter I’m going. Live long and prosper, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Yeah, even that. You look like a dork.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 debbie_wolowitz Howard, Bernadette’s here!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Tell her I’m not home!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 debbie_wolowitz What kind of a schmuck play is that? She can hear you shouting!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski Can we talk?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 howard_wolowitz You can. I have nothing to say.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski All right. I just wanted to tell you I’m sorry I said something to your mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 howard_wolowitz I was gonna tell her eventually, but you went behind my back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski I know. I’m sorry. I got scared.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 howard_wolowitz If you’re gonna love me, you’re gonna have to love the whole package, the tenderhearted poet and the crazy daredevil.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Well, don’t say it if you’re not gonna mean it, ’cause I’m not just gonna stop with the space station. Yeah, I want to go to the Moon, I want to go to Mars. I want to take a one-man sub to the lowest depths of the ocean.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski Really? You got seasick on Pirates of the Caribbean.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Well, those big kids were rocking it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski I just did what I did because I love you so much, and the thought of losing you is more than I can handle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski You’re my soul mate. This is where you kiss me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Right, right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 debbie_wolowitz Make up all you want! Your tuchus is not leaving this planet!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 raj_koothrappali Hey, you know that beautiful actress who plays the Borg Queen in First Contact?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 raj_koothrappali Well, I just met her gynaecologist!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter What are you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Fighting for our friendship. As peculiar and annoying as you can be, you’re still my little buddy. I’m not going to let that end here tonight. Now put down that drink, let’s meet Brent Spiner and go home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 wil_wheaton Hey, Sheldon, I’m so glad you made it. I found something I think you might like.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper What I’d like is for him to have a more depressing home. This is quite lovely.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 wil_wheaton This is for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper An original mint-in-package Wesley Crusher action figure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 wil_wheaton I remembered your story about the time you went to a convention when you were a kid to get one signed, and I didn’t show up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 wil_wheaton Look at what I wrote.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper To Sheldon, sorry this took so long. Your friend, Wil Wheaton.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 wil_wheaton It’s my last one. I want you to have it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Look, everyone. Wil Wheaton is my friend!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode05 brent_spiner Oh, wow. I haven’t seen one of these in years. Remember how we used to make these things look like they were masturbating?
