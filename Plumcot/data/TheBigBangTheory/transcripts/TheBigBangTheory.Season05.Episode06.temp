TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 leonard So what kind of cruise is this you’re going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper It’s called the Born Again Boat Ride. Christian Quarterly gave it their highest rating, five thorny crowns. I do wish you’d come with me, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon Well, Mom, if I did, it would be conclusive proof that your God can work miracles.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper You’re missing out. It’s gonna be wall-to-wall fun. It’s all themed. There’s Jonah and the Whale Watching, all-you-can-eat Last Supper Buffet, and my personal favourite, Gunning with God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 leonard What’s Gunning with God? I’m afraid to ask.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper Oh, it is a hoot and a half. You write your sins on a clay pigeon, they fire ’em up in the air, and you pulverize them with a 12-gauge shotgun full of our Lord’s forgiveness.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon Frankly, Mom, I’m encouraged to see how advanced your group has become, willing to sail out into the ocean without fear of falling off the edge.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper For example, if Shelly was aboard, he’d write “smart mouth” on his pigeon, and then bam!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon The Lord giveth and the Lord bloweth away. Well, Mom, according to my itinerary for our weekend together, the fun begins with fried chicken.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper Sounds delicious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon Good, ’cause I got you everything you need to make it. You are in for a treat. My mother’s fried chicken is why we had to buy my dad the extra large coffin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 leonard Sheldon, she just got off the plane. She doesn’t want to cook.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon Of course she does. Making me food is her way of saying I love you. Making me food when she’s too tired to cook is her way of saying I really love you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper Actually, I wouldn’t mind going out for a bite, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon Won’t that spoil our appetites for the chicken you’re going to make me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 leonard All right, that settles it, we’re going out. Do you like sushi? There’s a great little place down the street.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper I’ve never had it, but there’s no harm in trying something new.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon There’s a lot of harm in trying something new. That’s why we test out drugs and cosmetics on bunny rabbits.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 leonard Sheldon, you’re talking like a crazy person.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper Actually, I had him tested as a child. Doctor says he’s fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon Told you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper Although, I do regret not following up with that specialist in Houston.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 all Irasshaimase!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon Stop yelling! I’m not happy about this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 leonard What’s the last thing you were ever happy about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon The prospect of fried chicken.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper This is exciting. Back home, the diner on Route Four serves sushi, but it’s just cut up fish sticks and a side of Uncle Ben’s. They put it on the menu in those kung fu letters, but that don’t make it sushi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 leonard Uh, kung fu letters might not be politically correct.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper Oh, I thought the one we couldn’t say was ching chong.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 leonard Yeah, yeah, that, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper So, Shelly, what’s up with you and your friend Amy, if you don’t mind a mother prying a bit?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon Well, there’s actually big news on the Amy front. She’s been studying the neurobiology of addiction in lower animals. She is this close to getting a starfish hooked on cocaine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper Do you have any idea what’s going on with those two?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 leonard It’s kind of like the Loch Ness monster. Maybe there’s something there, maybe there isn’t. We’ll probably never know. But sometimes it’s fun to creep yourself out thinking about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper How are you doing on the young lady front? I hear you’re in some sort of a long distance situation?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 leonard Uh, yeah, it’s Raj’s sister. It’s kind of tough. She’s in India. Also, her parents aren’t happy she’s dating someone white.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper Oh, that’s a funny turn, isn’t it? You never think about it going the other way. Well, you can’t force things. You need to figure out if you’re in a relationship or if you’re just calling it one. It’s like they say, a cat can have kittens in the oven but that don’t make ’em biscuits.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon And that reminds me of another saying. You can lead a chicken to Crisco, but you can’tmake your mother fry it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper Sheldon, you pester me one more time about chicken, I will put you over my knee right here in this restaurant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 leonard Please pester her. Please, for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 leonard So, Mrs. Cooper, what did you think of the sushi?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper It was good. The only thing that would have made it better is if it was cooked and if it was beef. Sheldon, when is your landlord going to fix the elevator?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon I don’t know. Lately we’ve been talking about converting it into a missile silo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 leonard Your son seems to think we need to launch a pre-emptive strike on Burbank.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon Get them before they get us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 raj Hey, look who decided to show up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 leonard Raj, what are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 raj I couldn’t find you guys so I bought six new friends. Three, sadly, are dead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon Mom, you remember Rajesh? Rajesh, my mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 raj Of course. Mrs. Cooper. So nice to see you again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper Well, it’s so nice to see you, too. I thought it was our Indians that had the occasional alcohol problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 leonard We don’t say that, either. I’ll make you a list.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper Oh, that would be mighty white of you. So, Raj, what pain are you trying to cover up with alcohol?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 raj Nothing, I’m fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper Are ya?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 raj No. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper That’s better. Now tell me what’s bothering you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 raj I’m so lonely.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon Oh, yes, born alone, die alone. It’s a tragic human condition. Now, Raj, if you’ll excuse my mother, she’s about to make a pecan pie that’ll be so good I’ll almost forget how she blew it with the fried chicken.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper Sheldon, your friend is hurtin’. What do we do when someone’s hurtin’?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon Offer them a hot beverage.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper And when they’re drunk as a skunk, what beverage do we offer?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon Coffee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper And what do we do it with? Now you listen to me. I know you feel like you can’t find someone, but there’s a lock for every key. Back home, there’s a girl works at the Wal-Mart. Tall, tall girl. Woman could hunt geese with a rake. Thought she’d never find a man, then one day, wouldn’t ya know, Harlem Globetrotters come to town. Long story short, today that woman travels the world with a semi-professional basketball player and two beautiful mixed-race babies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 raj I didn’t get a lot of that because of your accent, but the general tone was soothing and somehow I feel better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon I’m not going to get my pecan pie, am I?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 leonard You want some Oreos?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon Double Stuf?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 leonard No, regular.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon Nice. Kick a man when he’s down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon I’m glad we’re finally getting to do something together, just the two of us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper Sure. One thing you really miss when you’re on vacation is laundry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon Careful, you’re using too much Downey. You know if my clothes get too soft it makes me sleepy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper Well, this takes me back. Me doing your laundry, you next to me criticizing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon It is nice, isn’t it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 penny Mrs. Cooper. Hi!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper Oh, hello, darlin’.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 penny Sheldon, you didn’t tell me your mom was coming.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon It was in my weekly e-mail blast. Right between beet season is finally here, and uh-oh, red stool from beets leads to cancer scare.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper So, how’ve you been?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 penny Good, good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper I hear that Leonard has a new girlfriend. How are you doing with all that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 penny Oh, fine. You know, it’s been a while. I’m getting back out there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper Let me ask you, when you get back out there, are you wearing this? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 penny Well, it’s super cute on. That top has paid for itself in free drinks like ten times what it cost.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon Yes, Penny has a lot of her money tied up in promiscuity futures.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper Hon, you think maybe the reason why you’re having trouble finding a guy to settle down with is because you’re letting them ride the roller coaster without buying a ticket?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 penny Oh, they don’t always get to ride the roller coaster. Sometimes they only get to spin the teacups. Now I’m going out tonight. Would it be crazy to ask you to look at the outfit I’m going to wear?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper Oh, not crazy at all. And don’t beat yourself up. When I was your age, you could have me for a car ride and a bottle of strawberry wine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon Now that will not be in this week’s e-mail blast.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 howard So, this spring, I get to go to the International Space Station.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper Oh, my word, a trip to the heavens. If you ever want to live there eternally, I’ve got a good book you could read.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 howard Thanks, but I watch the Charlie Brown Christmas special every year, so I get the gist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper I bet your mom is really proud of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 howard Nope. She says if I don’t back out she’s going to go on a hunger strike. It would take years before she’d be in any kind of danger, but still.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon I’ve got a treat for us tomorrow, Mom. I’m taking you to see Saul Perlmutter give a lecture about his Nobel Prize-winning work in cosmology. And the best part is, at the Q and A afterward, I’ve worked up a couple of Q’s that will stump his sorry A.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper I don’t know, Shelly. I thought we could do a little sightseeing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon What sight is better than your little boy embarrassing a Nobel laureate?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper Come on, Sheldon, we’ll take your mom to see the Hollywood sign, the wax museum, the Walk of Fame.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 penny Ooh, maybe a little Rodeo Drive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper Well, I can’t spend twelve thousand dollars on a handbag, but it’s free to look upon those who do with righteous condemnation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 howard What do you say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon What do I say? I say you people need to stop ruining my mom’s visit with your sushi, and your sadness and your slutty shirts. Stop it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 howard He’s not talking about your shirt. Your shirt is fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 leonard These are delicious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper The trick to pancakes is bacon grease. I cook everything in it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 leonard Everything? Aren’t you worried about your health?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper Oh, doctors are always changing their mind. One week bacon grease is bad for you. The next week we’re not getting enough of it. Good morning, Shelly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon Mom, I want to apologize for my behaviour last night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper Apology accepted.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon Great. Now, you’re going to love the Perlmutter lecture. Look, he will be stating that the universe is older than 6,000 years, but I thought you could stick your fingers in your ears and hum Amazing Grace during those parts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper I am still going out with your friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon But I apologized. And that was hard for me because I didn’t do anything wrong.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper Shelly, I hung out with you in enough dusty lecture halls while you were growing up. I want to go sightseeing. So why don’t you have some pancakes, get dressed and come with us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon I’m not going, and you can’t make me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper You’re right, I can’t. Have a nice day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon Well, I’m going to stand here until you change your mind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper Well, then you are going to stand there all day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 leonard I’m just gonna take my bacon grease and slide over there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon I can’t believe my own mother is abandoning me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper I am not abandoning you. Sheldon, abandoning you is leaving you in a basket on a church doorstep. I am going to Hollywood and thank a wax Ronald Reagan for his service to our country.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon We appear to be at a crossroads in our relationship, Mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper Well, I guess we are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 leonard Sorry. Syrup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon All right, Mom. When you’re at the Ripley’s Believe It Or Not Museum, if they have an exhibit about a mother who threw away a chance to spend the day with the world’s most wonderful son, believe it, because it’s true. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 leonard I hadn’t…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon That lecture was a waste of time. I made more accurate diagrams of the expansion of the early universe on the nursery wall with the contents of my diaper. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 amy Are you getting sick?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon No, I’m just allergic to people who get Nobel Prizes for no good reason.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 amy Sheldon, is it possible that your foul mood, or, to use the clinical term, bitchiness, is because your mother isn’t making you a priority?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon No. Or to use the clinical term, nuh-uh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 amy Are you sure? The infant-mother pair-bond is the building block of primate psychology.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon Oh, there it is. It always comes back to monkeys with you. Just monkeys, monkeys, monkeys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 amy Sheldon, we’re all animals. And granted, there are aspects of you that are extraordinary, but when it comes to emotions and relationships, you’re just like everybody else.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon Are you trying to suggest that my emotional problems are no different than those of a stupid person?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 amy Actually, some research indicates that by not over-thinking, the less intelligent handle emotions better. Sure you’re not coming down with a cold?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon Oh, yes, the common cold. Just like everyone else. You’d love that, wouldn’t you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper Oh, this one’s sweet. You know, for your rosary rattlers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 leonard Mrs. Cooper, we say Catholics, not rosary rattlers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper My goodness, it’s a wonder you people in California can talk at all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 penny This is like the worst Hollywood tour ever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 leonard What are you gonna do? She wanted to see churches.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 penny Hey, they have wine here, don’t they?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 raj Hey, none of our gods have abs like that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 howard Yep, that’s the last Jew who did sit-ups. And look where it got him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper Hey, while we’re here, why don’t we all do some praying? Let’s put a little church in this church.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 leonard Oh, I’m not sure we should.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper It’s easy. I’ll show you how. Lord, Mary Cooper here. Coming to you from Gomorrah, California. I want to thank you for the blessing that is my little Shelly. I also want to thank you for the continued strength not to coldcock him with my Bible. All right, Penny, your turn.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 penny Okay, um, hey, God. What’s up? Um, I’m good, but, uh, it would be a big help to my family if you could get my brother to stop cooking meth. But no cops. Be cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper She also goes a little overboard on the love thy neighbour. Could probably use that chat you had with Mary Magdalene. Leonard, you’re up. Wasserman, you’re on deck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 leonard Okay. I don’t know, it’s probably a little late to ask you to make me taller. Oh, um, if you could help out with me and my girlfriend. She’s all the way in India. That would be great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper Hear that? Girl trouble. Turns out we were both wrong on that front. How about you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 howard Oh, me? No. Thanks, I’m good. I’m really just trying not to burst into flames.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper Rajesh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 howard He says he’s having trouble dropping those last five pounds.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper Huh, I might have gone with the talking-to-girls thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 howard No, you only get one wish.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon Look at the two of us. Me, a highly regarded physicist. The kind of mind that comes along once, maybe twice in a generation. You, the common man, tired from your labours as a stockbroker, or vacuum cleaner salesman, or bootblack. But deep down inside, apparently we’re just two peas in a pod. A regular pea, and the kind of pea that comes along once, maybe twice in a generation. Rain. Another great equalizer. Falling on the head of the brilliant and the unremarkable alike. Smarty-pants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 penny Oh, Mrs. Cooper, it smells so good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper You take notes, darlin’. The real way to get a man is with melted cheese and cream of mushroom soup. He’ll die at 50 but his love will be true.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon I need a tissue.This one got wet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 leonard Here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon Thank you. Yeah, I’ve learned something today. You and I, in so many ways, other than intelligence and what counts, we’re the same. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper Sweetheart, are you sick?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon I hope so, because if this is well, life isn’t worth living.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper Oh, sugarpie, you are burning up. We’ve got to get you to bed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper Don’t worry. Mama’s here to take care of her baby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon And just to be clear, only her baby and not these other people.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper Of course.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon Can I have tea with honey and toast with the crust cut off?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper You can have whatever you want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon Thanks, Mom.You’re the best.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper Boy, last time I put VapoRub on you, you didn’t have hair on your chest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon I know, it filled in last year. I didn’t get to spend a lot of time with you on this visit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper And whose fault was that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon Yours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper Shelly, you’re not eight years old any more. We have to have a different relationship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon No, we don’t. The one we have works great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper Sweetheart, you are a grown man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon Or maybe I’m part of a new species, that lives for hundreds of years, which means I’m still basically a toddler.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper Oh, I so should have taken you to Houston.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 sheldon Does this mean you’re not going to sing Soft Kitty?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 mrs_cooper No, I will always sing you Soft Kitty. Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode06 leonard Mrs. Cooper, were we supposed to take that pie.
