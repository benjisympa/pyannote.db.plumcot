TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon And reverse the spin on the antiproton, and gamma becomes alpha, multiplied by a matrix of negative I comma zero, and there we have it. Conclusive proof that I am absolutely worthless after nine o’clock.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 ghostly_voice Sheldon, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon Hmm. All right, all right. I see what’s going on. A little pre-Halloween hijinkery. A ghostly moan, a rattling of chains, a witch’s cackle. The trifecta of haunted house clichés. Instead of eek, I say yawn.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 ghostly_voice Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon Oh, the walls are dripping blood, which looks nothing like a phenolphthalein indicator exposed to a sodium carbonate solution. See you in hell Sheldon. The most frightening thing about that is the missing comma. Ah. Okay, all right. That one was clever. Skeleton with phosphorous on a zip line. Come on out, merry pranksters. Take a bow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 raj You should’ve seen your face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon Yes, there’s nothing quite like the slightly widened eyes of mildly startled.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 howard Come on, admit it. We got you, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon Please, fright depends on an element of surprise. The simple fact is, because I am much smarter than you, and able to anticipate your actions, it is highly unlikely that you two rubes could ever surprise me. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 raj He’s probably right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 howard We can’t beat him. He’s just too smart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon Gentlemen. .
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 howard Who had money on faints?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 raj I had pee his pants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard Hang on. Looks like everyone’s a winner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard Oh. Watch out, Sheldon. This little boy Casper is a g-g-g-ghost!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon Droll.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard That was pretty droll. With a hint of ammonia.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon Yes, enjoy your japes, gentlemen. You think you’ve poked fun at a milquetoast academic. Well, you’ve forgotten one thing. I am also a son of the Lone Star state. I’m Texas through and through. And we know how to settle scores down there. If you doubt me, ask Mexico.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 stuart Hot girl, nine o’clock. Don’t everybody look at once!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 raj What is she doing in a comic book store?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 stuart I don’t know, she might be lost. Doesn’t matter. Watch and learn. Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 hot_girl Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 stuart Um… it-it-it… Shut up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 hot_girl Are you getting this Next Men?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard Uh, yeah. It’s issue number 21. First appearance of Hellboy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 hot_girl I know. I’ve been looking for it for years.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard Sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 hot_girl Hey, if I pretended to hit on you, could I distract you enough to sneak it away?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard Yes, but you’d be using your superpowers for evil.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 hot_girl Damn, I’m forbidden by my Kryptonian father to do so. I am Alice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 alice You are very cute, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard Thanks. You, too. You know, go ahead and take it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 alice No, no. No, no, I, I, I did evil. Would you be open to a trade?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, I guess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 alice Okay. Here. This is my number, call me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard Sorry, palm’s a little sweaty. What’s that word?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 alice Alice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard Oh, right, your name. That makes more sense than penis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 alice Later.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 howard Did we just see you pick up a girl in a comic book store?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 stuart ‘Cause if you did, you get your picture up there on the Wall of Heroes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard No, I don’t think I picked her up. Besides, I have a girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 stuart Doesn’t matter. This is the closest anyone’s ever come. You’re going on the wall, my friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon Be sure to check the mail.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard How many times are you gonna tell me? What’s with you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon Nothing. It’s not suspicious that I’m fixating. It’s consistent with my personality.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard Right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny Hey, guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard More Halloween candy? Didn’t you just buy a bunch of it yesterday?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny Oh. Yeah. That’s gone. It’s a rough month when Halloween and PMS hit at the same time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon Leonard doesn’t have time to chat, he has to get the mail.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard Will you relax? I’ll get it in a minute. Hey, how was work?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon Open the mail!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard Excuse me. A couple of circulars, nothing important.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny What’s with him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard Hang on. You might be from Texas, but I’m from New Jersey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard Check it out. Jim Lee drew this of me two years ago at Comic Con.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 alice What are you wearing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard Well, you know, it’s Comic Con. I’m Lion-O from ThunderCats.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 alice Wow, you must have gotten so laid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard No. But Jessica Alba did rub my furry belly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 alice Want to see a comic I draw?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard You’re kidding. You have your own book?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 alice Yeah. It’s kinda based on my life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard Cool. Oh, look. That’s you having sex with a guy in the top half of a Chewbacca costume. Comic Con?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 alice You’d think, but no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard You’re very talented. This is really good. Did you do… 
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 alice So, can I trade you my comic for the Hellboy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard You can have my car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear, oh, dear. Oh, dear, oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Purell, Purell, Purell, Purell.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 raj Good morning, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon It is, isn’t it? Oh, bother. Isn’t that just always the way? You go to staple something, and you’re out of staples. Gosh, I wish I’d known that earlier today when I was at Staples.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 raj You have a thing of paper clips right there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon well, no, no, I need something more permanent to join these papers. Say, don’t you keep staples in your top desk drawer?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 raj I don’t know. Maybe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon Be a lamb and check.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 raj All right. Who do we have here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon It’s a snake. A terrifying snake.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 raj Oh, did some bad man put us in a drawer?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon Stop talking like that. You’ve been rendered speechless by fear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 raj Let’s go to the biology lab and find you some nice yummy mice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon I tried to scare an Indian with a snake. Come on, Cooper. You’re better than this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny It’s open.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard Hey, you got a minute?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny Yeah, sure, come on in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny Want some mac and cheese?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard No. Lactose. Gas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny Glass of wine?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard No. Sulfites. Migraines.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny Okay, well, I’d offer you Halloween candy, but that’s gone. So, what’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard Okay, we used to go out, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny Oh, my God, that’s where I know you from.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard I’m dealing with a situation and it’s kind of about my love life, so I know that might be weird for us to talk about, but in this area, as you know, all my other friends are just so stupid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny All right, what’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard So, you’re okay talking about this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard You’re sure it’s not weird.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny It’s okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard You know what, if you ever want to talk to me about a problem in your life with a guy, then I would be fine with that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny Okay, good, because there’s this one guy I used to date who’s about to be force-fed wine and cheese if he doesn’t get to the point.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard Okay, uh, here it is. Is it cheating if a guy has a girlfriend…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny Yeah, probably.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard Come on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny I’m sorry, go ahead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard I met this girl, and she’s great. We have a lot in common.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny Did you guys do it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard No. We just made out a little.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny Oh, look at you, you bad boy. Did you tell her about Priya?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard Well, I was gonna, but there were too many tongues in my mouth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny That’s gross.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard Here’s the thing, I, I’m not one of those guys who sneaks around and sleeps with more than one woman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny Well, good for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard The problem is, I want to be one of those guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny So sleep with the new girl and lie to Priya.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard Oh, that’s not who I am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny All right, then break it off with the new girl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard Now, let’s not do anything rash. She’s really hot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny If you like this girl so much, why don’t you just end things with Priya?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard Priya and I are in love. I think we could get married someday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny Leonard, you’re looking for a way to sleep with both women and have everybody be happy about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard Now we’re getting somewhere.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny What does your gut tell you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard Go ask Penny; she’ll know what to do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon Hello, Howard. I’ve realized that you scaring me was all in jest. Allow me to say, job well done. Perfect.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon Science. You wouldn’t understand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard Hey, well, see you. I’m going out. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon I thought you were leaving the apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard Yeah, me, too. I can’t make up my mind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon Are you concerned because the world is filled with big dogs and bullies?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard No. I’m having a moral crisis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon Well, if it’s of any help, I’ve read all the great moral philosophers, including Dr. Seuss.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard Oh, what the hell. I’m supposed to go see that girl from the comic book store, Alice, but I don’t know if I should, because I’m going out with Priya, but she’s in India.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon All right. So the topic at hand is sexual fidelity. Probably won’t be relying on Seuss here. Although One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish might be surprisingly applicable. Go on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard Well, they say at the end of your life, you regret the stuff you didn’t do more than the stuff that you did, and I’m pretty sure Alice is the stuff I want to do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon You know, the German philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche, believed that morality is just a fiction used by the herd of inferior human beings to hold back the few superior men.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard That actually does help.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon It’s worth noting that he died of syphilis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard Screw it, I’m going.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon On your way home, will you pick up some orange juice?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard Do you mind? I’m questioning a lot of things in my life right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon Is one of those things your fondness for orange juice?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon Great. Tropicana, no pulp.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 howard Hey, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 bernadette Who is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon It’s me, Sheldon, Mrs. Wolowitz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 howard That’s not my mom, it’s Bernadette.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon Really? That’s very unsettling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 bernadette Hi, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 howard What’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon It just occurred to me that I never formally congratulated you on your pending nuptials. So I hopped on the first bus and hightailed it down here to shake your hand. Put ‘er there, you old so-and-so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 howard Well, I, I’m gonna see you at work in 12 hours, don’t you think it could have waited until then?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon Holy smoke, why didn’t I think of that? You’re a better man than I, Howard Wolowitz. You put ‘er there, you son of a gun!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 howard Whatever. My… oh… it’s… 
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 bernadette Oh, my God, Howard! What did you do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon It was a harmless Halloween prank. Look.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 bernadette Howard has a heart condition! You know that!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon Well, I thought he made that up. Isn’t hypochondria a common idiosyncrasy of Jewish people?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 bernadette This is adrenaline, we’re gonna have to inject it into his heart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon We are?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 bernadette You are. I’m not strong enough to get it through his chest plate, and we’ve only got one shot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon Oh, no! I can’t!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 bernadette Hurry! We’re running out of time!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 bernadette Just do it!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon Oh, God! One, two, three!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 howard Trick or treat, bubbeleh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon What? No. You mean this was all a ruse? Oh, how could I be so stu… .
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard Damn it, I can’t. I can’t, I can’t do this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 alice Uh, is it my tongue stud? ‘Cause if that freaks you out, you’re in for a real surprise later on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard No, no, no. I, I can’t do this. Believe me, I really want to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 alice But?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard But I kind of have a girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 alice Are you kidding?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard You’re cool with you and me just being friends, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 alice I don’t believe this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard Wait, I don’t, which part?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 alice I’m so stupid. I thought for once I’d met a good guy, but you’re just another jackass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard Oh, no, no, you have it wrong. No. I, I was going to be a jackass, but I stopped myself. I stayed a good guy, so, I’m gonna pass on the sex. But you should know, that’s not a comment on your hotness but on my goodness. That’s kind of my superpower. I’m, like, Captain Good Guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard It’s okay. Did the right thing. You idiot!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard Hey, Priya.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 priya Hey, sweetheart. How’s it going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard Uh, not so good. We have to talk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 priya Oh, sounds serious. What’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard Okay, uh, here it is. I met this girl and I kissed her, and I feel terrible about it. But it’s done, it’s never gonna happen again. And I am so, so sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 priya Leonard, relax. It’s okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard It is?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 priya Yeah, these things happen. They happen to everybody.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard Oh, my God, you are amazing. I mean, I don’t deserve you. Wh, what do, what do you mean everybody?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 priya Leonard, I didn’t know if I should tell you, but I kind of cheated on you, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard Uh, kind of?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 priya A couple of weeks ago, I slept with my ex-boyfriend. So, I guess we both messed up a little.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard No, no, I messed up a little. You messed up a lot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 priya Well, it’s not a competition.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard Oh yeah, it is, and you won. I, I, I’m, I’m sorry, I have to go. I don’t believe this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon Bazinga, punk. Now we’re even.
