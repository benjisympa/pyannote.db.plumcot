TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon_cooper And reverse the spin on the antiproton, and gamma becomes alpha, multiplied by a matrix of negative I comma zero, and there we have it. Conclusive proof that I am absolutely worthless after nine o’clock.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 ghostly_voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 Sheldon, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Hmm. All right, all right. I see what’s going on. A little pre-Halloween hijinkery. A ghostly moan, a rattling of chains, a witch’s cackle. The trifecta of haunted house clichés. Instead of eek, I say yawn.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 ghostly_voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Oh, the walls are dripping blood, which looks nothing like a phenolphthalein indicator exposed to a sodium carbonate solution. See you in hell Sheldon. The most frightening thing about that is the missing comma. Ah. Okay, all right. That one was clever. Skeleton with phosphorous on a zip line. Come on out, merry pranksters. Take a bow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 raj_koothrappali You should’ve seen your face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Yes, there’s nothing quite like the slightly widened eyes of mildly startled.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Come on, admit it. We got you, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Please, fright depends on an element of surprise. The simple fact is, because I am much smarter than you, and able to anticipate your actions, it is highly unlikely that you two rubes could ever surprise me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 raj_koothrappali He’s probably right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 howard_wolowitz We can’t beat him. He’s just too smart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Gentlemen. .
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Who had money on faints?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 raj_koothrappali I had pee his pants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Hang on. Looks like everyone’s a winner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Oh. Watch out, Sheldon. This little boy Casper is a g-g-g-ghost!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Droll.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter That was pretty droll. With a hint of ammonia.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Yes, enjoy your japes, gentlemen. You think you’ve poked fun at a milquetoast academic. Well, you’ve forgotten one thing. I am also a son of the Lone Star state. I’m Texas through and through. And we know how to settle scores down there. If you doubt me, ask Mexico.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 stuart_bloom Hot girl, nine o’clock. Don’t everybody look at once!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 raj_koothrappali What is she doing in a comic book store?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 stuart_bloom I don’t know, she might be lost. Doesn’t matter. Watch and learn. Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 hot_girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 stuart_bloom Um… it-it-it… Shut up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 hot_girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 Are you getting this Next Men?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Uh, yeah. It’s issue number 21. First appearance of Hellboy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 hot_girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 I know. I’ve been looking for it for years.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 hot_girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 Hey, if I pretended to hit on you, could I distract you enough to sneak it away?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Yes, but you’d be using your superpowers for evil.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 hot_girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 Damn, I’m forbidden by my Kryptonian father to do so. I am Alice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 alice You are very cute, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Thanks. You, too. You know, go ahead and take it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 alice No, no. No, no, I, I, I did evil. Would you be open to a trade?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, I guess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 alice Okay. Here. This is my number, call me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Sorry, palm’s a little sweaty. What’s that word?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 alice Alice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Oh, right, your name. That makes more sense than penis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 alice Later.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Did we just see you pick up a girl in a comic book store?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 stuart_bloom ‘Cause if you did, you get your picture up there on the Wall of Heroes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter No, I don’t think I picked her up. Besides, I have a girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 stuart_bloom Doesn’t matter. This is the closest anyone’s ever come. You’re going on the wall, my friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Be sure to check the mail.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter How many times are you gonna tell me? What’s with you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Nothing. It’s not suspicious that I’m fixating. It’s consistent with my personality.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny Hey, guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter More Halloween candy? Didn’t you just buy a bunch of it yesterday?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny Oh. Yeah. That’s gone. It’s a rough month when Halloween and PMS hit at the same time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Leonard doesn’t have time to chat, he has to get the mail.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Will you relax? I’ll get it in a minute. Hey, how was work?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Open the mail!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Excuse me. A couple of circulars, nothing important.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny What’s with him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Hang on. You might be from Texas, but I’m from New Jersey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Check it out. Jim Lee drew this of me two years ago at Comic Con.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 alice What are you wearing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Well, you know, it’s Comic Con. I’m Lion-O from ThunderCats.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 alice Wow, you must have gotten so laid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter No. But Jessica Alba did rub my furry belly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 alice Want to see a comic I draw?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter You’re kidding. You have your own book?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 alice Yeah. It’s kinda based on my life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Cool. Oh, look. That’s you having sex with a guy in the top half of a Chewbacca costume. Comic Con?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 alice You’d think, but no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter You’re very talented. This is really good. Did you do…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 alice So, can I trade you my comic for the Hellboy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter You can have my car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear, oh, dear. Oh, dear, oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Purell, Purell, Purell, Purell.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Good morning, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon_cooper It is, isn’t it? Oh, bother. Isn’t that just always the way? You go to staple something, and you’re out of staples. Gosh, I wish I’d known that earlier today when I was at Staples.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 raj_koothrappali You have a thing of paper clips right there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon_cooper well, no, no, I need something more permanent to join these papers. Say, don’t you keep staples in your top desk drawer?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 raj_koothrappali I don’t know. Maybe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Be a lamb and check.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 raj_koothrappali All right. Who do we have here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon_cooper It’s a snake. A terrifying snake.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Oh, did some bad man put us in a drawer?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Stop talking like that. You’ve been rendered speechless by fear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Let’s go to the biology lab and find you some nice yummy mice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon_cooper I tried to scare an Indian with a snake. Come on, Cooper. You’re better than this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny It’s open.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Hey, you got a minute?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny Yeah, sure, come on in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny Want some mac and cheese?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter No. Lactose. Gas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny Glass of wine?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter No. Sulfites. Migraines.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny Okay, well, I’d offer you Halloween candy, but that’s gone. So, what’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Okay, we used to go out, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny Oh, my God, that’s where I know you from.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter I’m dealing with a situation and it’s kind of about my love life, so I know that might be weird for us to talk about, but in this area, as you know, all my other friends are just so stupid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny All right, what’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter So, you’re okay talking about this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter You’re sure it’s not weird.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny It’s okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter You know what, if you ever want to talk to me about a problem in your life with a guy, then I would be fine with that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny Okay, good, because there’s this one guy I used to date who’s about to be force-fed wine and cheese if he doesn’t get to the point.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Okay, uh, here it is. Is it cheating if a guy has a girlfriend…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny Yeah, probably.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Come on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny I’m sorry, go ahead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter I met this girl, and she’s great. We have a lot in common.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny Did you guys do it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter No. We just made out a little.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny Oh, look at you, you bad boy. Did you tell her about Priya?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Well, I was gonna, but there were too many tongues in my mouth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny That’s gross.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Here’s the thing, I, I’m not one of those guys who sneaks around and sleeps with more than one woman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny Well, good for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter The problem is, I want to be one of those guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny So sleep with the new girl and lie to Priya.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Oh, that’s not who I am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny All right, then break it off with the new girl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Now, let’s not do anything rash. She’s really hot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny If you like this girl so much, why don’t you just end things with Priya?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Priya and I are in love. I think we could get married someday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny Leonard, you’re looking for a way to sleep with both women and have everybody be happy about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Now we’re getting somewhere.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 penny What does your gut tell you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Go ask Penny; she’ll know what to do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Hello, Howard. I’ve realized that you scaring me was all in jest. Allow me to say, job well done. Perfect.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Science. You wouldn’t understand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Hey, well, see you. I’m going out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon_cooper I thought you were leaving the apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, me, too. I can’t make up my mind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Are you concerned because the world is filled with big dogs and bullies?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter No. I’m having a moral crisis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Well, if it’s of any help, I’ve read all the great moral philosophers, including Dr. Seuss.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Oh, what the hell. I’m supposed to go see that girl from the comic book store, Alice, but I don’t know if I should, because I’m going out with Priya, but she’s in India.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon_cooper All right. So the topic at hand is sexual fidelity. Probably won’t be relying on Seuss here. Although One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish might be surprisingly applicable. Go on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Well, they say at the end of your life, you regret the stuff you didn’t do more than the stuff that you did, and I’m pretty sure Alice is the stuff I want to do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon_cooper You know, the German philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche, believed that morality is just a fiction used by the herd of inferior human beings to hold back the few superior men.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter That actually does help.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon_cooper It’s worth noting that he died of syphilis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Screw it, I’m going.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon_cooper On your way home, will you pick up some orange juice?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Do you mind? I’m questioning a lot of things in my life right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Is one of those things your fondness for orange juice?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Great. Tropicana, no pulp.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Hey, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 bernadette_rostenkowski Who is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon_cooper It’s me, Sheldon, Mrs. Wolowitz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 howard_wolowitz That’s not my mom, it’s Bernadette.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Really? That’s very unsettling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 bernadette_rostenkowski Hi, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 howard_wolowitz What’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon_cooper It just occurred to me that I never formally congratulated you on your pending nuptials. So I hopped on the first bus and hightailed it down here to shake your hand. Put ‘er there, you old so-and-so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Well, I, I’m gonna see you at work in 12 hours, don’t you think it could have waited until then?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Holy smoke, why didn’t I think of that? You’re a better man than I, Howard Wolowitz. You put ‘er there, you son of a gun!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Whatever. My… oh… it’s…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, my God, Howard! What did you do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon_cooper It was a harmless Halloween prank. Look.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 bernadette_rostenkowski Howard has a heart condition! You know that!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Well, I thought he made that up. Isn’t hypochondria a common idiosyncrasy of Jewish people?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 bernadette_rostenkowski This is adrenaline, we’re gonna have to inject it into his heart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon_cooper We are?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 bernadette_rostenkowski You are. I’m not strong enough to get it through his chest plate, and we’ve only got one shot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Oh, no! I can’t!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 bernadette_rostenkowski Hurry! We’re running out of time!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 bernadette_rostenkowski Just do it!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Oh, God! One, two, three!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Trick or treat, bubbeleh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon_cooper What? No. You mean this was all a ruse? Oh, how could I be so stu… .
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Damn it, I can’t. I can’t, I can’t do this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 alice Uh, is it my tongue stud? ‘Cause if that freaks you out, you’re in for a real surprise later on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter No, no, no. I, I can’t do this. Believe me, I really want to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 alice But?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter But I kind of have a girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 alice Are you kidding?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter You’re cool with you and me just being friends, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 alice I don’t believe this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Wait, I don’t, which part?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 alice I’m so stupid. I thought for once I’d met a good guy, but you’re just another jackass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Oh, no, no, you have it wrong. No. I, I was going to be a jackass, but I stopped myself. I stayed a good guy, so, I’m gonna pass on the sex. But you should know, that’s not a comment on your hotness but on my goodness. That’s kind of my superpower. I’m, like, Captain Good Guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter It’s okay. Did the right thing. You idiot!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Hey, Priya.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 priya_koothrappali Hey, sweetheart. How’s it going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Uh, not so good. We have to talk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 priya_koothrappali Oh, sounds serious. What’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Okay, uh, here it is. I met this girl and I kissed her, and I feel terrible about it. But it’s done, it’s never gonna happen again. And I am so, so sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 priya_koothrappali Leonard, relax. It’s okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter It is?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 priya_koothrappali Yeah, these things happen. They happen to everybody.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Oh, my God, you are amazing. I mean, I don’t deserve you. Wh, what do, what do you mean everybody?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 priya_koothrappali Leonard, I didn’t know if I should tell you, but I kind of cheated on you, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Uh, kind of?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 priya_koothrappali A couple of weeks ago, I slept with my ex-boyfriend. So, I guess we both messed up a little.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter No, no, I messed up a little. You messed up a lot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 priya_koothrappali Well, it’s not a competition.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Oh yeah, it is, and you won. I, I, I’m, I’m sorry, I have to go. I don’t believe this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Bazinga, punk. Now we’re even.
