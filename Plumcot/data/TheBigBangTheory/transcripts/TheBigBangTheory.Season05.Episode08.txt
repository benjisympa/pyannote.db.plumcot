TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 penny So, Bernadette, how goes the hunt for bridesmaid dresses?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 bernadette_rostenkowski Well, if you don’t mind looking like an orange traffic cone, great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler Girlfriends, I have the answer to our dress problems.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 bernadette_rostenkowski Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler Twelve years ago, my cousin Irene and her entire family died in a horrific carbon monoxide accident the night before her wedding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 bernadette_rostenkowski That’s horrible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler Yes and no. All those bridesmaids dresses remain unused and available to us for free. So it seems that cloud of odourless deadly gas had a silver lining after all. Check it out, still in the bags. The gowns, not the bridesmaids.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t know. Dead people’s dresses?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 penny Yeah, and cap sleeves? U-u-uh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler Uh, I was hoping you wouldn’t notice. Irene was always a slave to a good bargain when it came to clothes, and sadly as it turned out, space heaters.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Ladies, please. These four walls once housed an intellectual salon where the mind received nourishment as well as the stomach. But through no one’s fault, Penny, the quality of dinner conversation in this apartment has declined. And again, I’m looking at no one in particular, Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Fine. What would you like to talk about, Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 howard_wolowitz What would you like to talk about, Sheldon? Why do you hate us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 sheldon_cooper I’ve prepared a number of topics that should appeal to both the advanced and novice conversationalists.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 penny Okay, that time you looked at me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler Who didn’t? Your skin is like alabaster. Do you even have pores?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Topic one. Faster-than-light particles at CERN, paradigm-shifting discovery or another Swiss export as full of holes as their cheese? And converse.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 penny All right, who wants to go to my apartment and look at bridal magazines?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 penny Through no one’s fault, Sheldon, we’re leaving.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler Wait for moi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 sheldon_cooper You’re leaving?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, sometimes you forget, I’m a lady. And with that comes an oestrogen fuelled need to page through thick glossy magazines that make me hate my body.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Ah. New topic. Women, delightfully mysterious or bat-crap crazy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Totally. What’s wrong with cap sleeves? If you have the right figure for it, they’re adorable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Hey, Amy, what brings you to our neck of the woods?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler Your neurology department loaned me a culture of prions for my research on bovine spongiform encephalopathy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 sheldon_cooper She popped by to borrow a cup of mad cow disease.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler It’s hard to make degenerative brain maladies hilarious, and yet somehow you do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 howard_wolowitz That’s fun to have in a lunchroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler The real fun starts when you get to pick the rat you’re going to feed it to, and maybe you choose the beady-eyed little mother who’s been biting you all week.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Please, we’re eating. Can we get that off the table and change the subject?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Can we? Stand back while I turn this conversation into a conver-sensation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter This time, it’s your fault.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 sheldon_cooper I have 100 alphabetized topics from artichoke, come on, people, it’s just a giant thistle, to zzz, the onamona-poetry of sleep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Amy, how long would it take for that mad cow disease to kill me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler I don’t know, four or five years.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter No, it’s not gonna do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Oy. Bernadette keeps texting me pictures of Penny in bridesmaid dresses.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler They’re out shopping right now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler Just the two of them?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 howard_wolowitz I guess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler That’s cool, that’s cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Why are they asking me about this stuff? What guy knows what a sweetheart neckline is?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Leonard’s coming down the home stretch! Come on, horsey, you can do this! Damn. Come on, thigh muscles, you can do this! Yes! First place. I would have been a great jockey if I weren’t too tall. And scared of horses. Sheldon, you’re up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 sheldon_cooper What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Come on, it’s your turn. We said we’d get more fresh air.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Sorry. I’m a little distracted. I can’t seem to get in touch with Amy. I tried e-mail, video chat, tweeting her, posting on her Facebook wall, texting her, nothing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Did you try calling her on the telephone?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 sheldon_cooper The telephone. You know, Leonard, in your own simple way, you may be the wisest of us all. Voice mail. Curiouser and curiouser.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter If you’re worried, we can go over there and see if she’s all right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Okay. You know, I heard in the news a bobcat has been spotted in her neighbourhood.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter I don’t think Amy was eaten by a bobcat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Who thinks Amy was eaten by a bobcat?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter You do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Leonard, I was just mentioning an interesting local news item. Now, thanks to you, I’m worried Amy’s been eaten by a bobcat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Forget about the bobcat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 sheldon_cooper How can I? You won’t stop talking about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler Everybody hurts, sometimes everybody cries. Everybody hurts, sometimes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 sheldon_cooper She sounds weepy. I don’t like weepy. Let’s go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Uh, she’s your friend. Step up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Amy. Amy. Amy. Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Where are you going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter I’m single, I don’t need this crap.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, what are you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 sheldon_cooper You didn’t respond to any of my electronic communications.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler I wanted to be alone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Would you like to talk about it? And keep in mind that no is a perfectly viable answer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, my world is crumbling around me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Point of order. As you’re in distress, it would be customary for me to offer you a hot beverage. But I’m a guest in your home, so it would be customary for you to offer me a beverage. How do you want to proceed vis-a-vis beverages?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler It doesn’t matter. Nothing matters.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 sheldon_cooper If you’d like to take your mind off what’s troubling you, uh, word on the street is a bobcat has been spotted.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler Penny and Bernadette went shopping for bridesmaids dresses without me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 sheldon_cooper And that made you feel sad?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 sheldon_cooper I knew it. Just keep going, I guess I’m good at this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler It’s just, I thought they liked hanging out with me, but I guess I was fooling myself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 sheldon_cooper When they were over here, did you fail to offer them a beverage? ‘Cause I can see how that could stick in someone’s craw.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, I’m going to ask you something, and I’d like you to keep an open mind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Always.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler At this moment, I find myself craving human intimacy and physical contact.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Oh, boy. You know ours is a relationship of the mind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler Proposal. One wild night of torrid lovemaking that soothes my soul and inflames my loins.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Counterproposal. I will gently stroke your head and repeat, aw, who’s a good Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler How about this? French kissing, seven minutes in heaven culminating in second base.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Neck massage, then you get me that beverage.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler We cuddle. Final offer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Very well. Oh, boy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler I’m just saying, second base is right there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Mm, I’m thinking about adopting some quirky affectation, like a pipe or a monocle or a handlebar moustache.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter For all those girls out there looking for the Indian Monopoly man?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 raj_koothrappali This is not a safe place. You can’t share anything here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 sheldon_cooper The two of you need to get your women in line!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 howard_wolowitz What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Last night I was strong-armed into an evening of harp music and spooning with an emotional Amy Farrah Fowler. This on a night that I had originally designated for solving the space-time geometry in higher-spin gravity and building my Lego Death Star. And why? Your gal pals, Penny and Bernadette, went out shopping for some wedding nonsense without Amy, an action they took with no thought or regard as to how it would affect me, the future of string theory or my Lego fun time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 howard_wolowitz What do you want us to do about it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 sheldon_cooper You clearly weren’t listening to my topic sentence, get your women in line! You make them apologize to Amy and set things right. I am a man of science, not someone’s snuggle bunny!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Why do I have to talk to Penny? She’s not my girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 sheldon_cooper You invited her to lunch four years ago. Everything about her is on you, you make it so!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Moo-shu is Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 penny Thank you. Where’s Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Oh, he was up late last night, so I gave him an early dinner and put him to bed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 bernadette_rostenkowski That’s so sweet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, but now he’s gonna be up at dawn and want to play.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 howard_wolowitz So, listen, guys, the reason he was up late is because he was taking care of Amy. She’s kind of upset.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 penny Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Her feelings got hurt because you guys went dress shopping without her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 bernadette_rostenkowski I told you that would happen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 penny Okay, look, this is her first time being a bridesmaid and she’s just getting a little crazy with it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 bernadette_rostenkowski She keeps on telling us stories about bridesmaid traditions in other cultures, and they’re all about getting naked and washing each other.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 penny Yeah, and she keeps trying to figure out if our cycles have synced up so we can call ourselves the Three Menstra-teers
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 bernadette_rostenkowski We thought it would be easier to look at dresses one time without her. I feel terrible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 penny I know. Me, too. We’ll talk to her. Hey, wait, how did she find out?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Raj did it. And he says he would do it again. Okay, I’m sorry. You sent me the picture, I wasn’t thinking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, Howie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Well, hey, I’m usually pretty good at not blabbing. You tell me tons of stuff about these guys, and I never repeat it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 penny What do you tell him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, you know, just pillow talk. You guys have nothing to worry about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Hold on, did you talk about us when we were dating?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 penny No. All your little secrets are fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 bernadette_rostenkowski Yes, absolutely fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 howard_wolowitz I’ll tell you later.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler Come on, tumour. Come on, tumour, Mama needs an aggressive little glioblastoma. Yay, brain tumour! Probably not the same reaction you had when you got the news.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 penny Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 bernadette_rostenkowski Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler What are you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 penny Well, look, we just wanted to apologize for not bringing you with us the other day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler That’s not necessary, it’s like Sesame Street says, one of these things is not like the other, one of these things should die alone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 penny Look, come on, Amy, look, let us make it up to you. We’ll have a girl’s night, we’ll do whatever you want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 bernadette_rostenkowski We can go down to the Korean baths and do that thing you were talking about where we wash each other.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 penny With-with loofah mitts, no hands.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler It’s okay. I’m glad this happened. I can stop pretending that some beautiful girl and her cute-in-
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 bernadette_rostenkowski Amy, we’re really sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 penny Yeah, we feel awful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler Don’t. I’ll be okay. You’re not the first girls I thought were friends with me who ended up shunning me. It’s like elementary school, junior high, high school, undergrad, grad school, and that semester abroad in Norway all over again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 penny Oh, come on, Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler You don’t get it. Look at this brain.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 penny I don’t really want to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler This is us. Bernadette, you are the analytical, scientific left hemisphere. Penny, you’re the creative, spontaneous right hemisphere. And where’s Amy? She’s right here, the sad little tumour no one wants to go dress shopping with.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 bernadette_rostenkowski Amy, you’re not a tumour. Penny, tell her she’s not a tumour. .
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Did you know that when Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone, he proposed answering it with ahoy? Ahoy. I like it. Amy? Is that you? Have you been drinking? I’m sorry, I bet my sweet what? Well, all right. We’re on our way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 sheldon_cooper It would seem Amy is drunk in a liquor store parking lot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Really? Amy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Leonard, be glad you can’t keep a woman. They are a handful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, look. It’s Sheldon and little Leonard. Hi, little Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Hi, Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler Hey, Cuddles.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Cuddles?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Yes, Cuddles. We cuddled. Grow up, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Amy, what are you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler Well, I came here to get a bottle of wine like Penny taught me to do when you’re sad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, but why didn’t you go back to your apartment?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler Didn’t you go to high school, Leonard? Parking lots are where all the cool kids hang out. Not that the rat bastards ever invited me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Maybe we should get you home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, hang on, hang on, hang on. Sheldon, what would it take for you to go into that liquor store, buy a bottle of hooch, take me across the street to that motel, and have your way with me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, Sheldon, what would it take?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 sheldon_cooper I’m begging both of you, please, let’s go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Okay. Come on. Upsy-daisy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler Whee! Ooh, finally someone found second base.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler I know how you feel. I got a knife slicing through my frontal lobe, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 penny Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler What do you want? Do you want me to give the friendship bracelet back?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 penny I never gave you a friendship bracelet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler When we first met, I made one and pretended you gave it to me. You can have it back if you want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 penny No, you made that for you, I want you to have it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 bernadette_rostenkowski We know you’re upset, and you have every right to be, but if it’s okay with you, we’d like a second chance to make things right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 penny We are really sorry, and we were trying to think of some way to show you how much we care about you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 bernadette_rostenkowski Which is why it would mean so much if you would agree to be the maid of honour at my wedding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler What? Wait, is this some kind of practical joke? Like in Norway, when my friends trapped me in a sauna with a horny otter?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 bernadette_rostenkowski No. I, I want you to be the maid of honour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, my gosh. No one’s every asked me to be the maid of honour before. Well, that’s not true. Once, but then they all died.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 bernadette_rostenkowski So is that a yes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler Yes. Yes. Oh, my gosh, I, I have so much to do. There’s the bridal shower and the bachelorette party. What should we do for the bachelorette party? Oh, I know, we’ll go to a Native American sweat lodge, we’ll take peyote, roll around in the mud, and paint fertility symbols on Bernadette’s naked body. So that’s happening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 penny Yeah, sure, sure. Vegas is fun, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler I feel like crying. Of course, I could just be hormonal. Oh, wait. Maybe our menses are finally syncing up. Bernadette? No? Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 penny Sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 penny Okay, yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler Yay!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler Maid of honour Amy Farrah Fowler’s amazing behind-the-scenes wedding video, take one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 bernadette_rostenkowski We’re just trying on dresses, do we really need to record this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler I’m sorry, are you the maid of honour?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 bernadette_rostenkowski I am the bride.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler So no. And action.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 penny What do you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 bernadette_rostenkowski I love it!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler What are you, a nun? Come on, bestie, let’s see some skin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, Amy! Looking sexy!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler You think they don’t have mirrors in there? I know how I look.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 penny Oh! Bernadette, you look beautiful!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler You do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 bernadette_rostenkowski Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler Not Penny beautiful, but beautiful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler Come on, bestie, you’re up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 penny Give me a minute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler What is taking you so long?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 penny Oh, Amy! Get the hell out of here!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler – Sorry, sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 penny Oh, God. Amy!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler Sorry.
