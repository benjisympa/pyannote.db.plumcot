TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard Oh, hey. You work the lunch shift?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny Yeah. I’ve got eight pounds of salmon that’s about to go bad. Do you know how to cook it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard Not really.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny Damn it. Should have liberated the iffy chicken. What are you and Professor Fussyface up to tonight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard Star Wars on Blu-ray.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny Haven’t you seen that movie, like, a thousand times?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard Not on Blu-ray. Only twice on Blu-ray.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny Oh, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard I know, it’s high-resolution sadness.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny Well, I’m going to take myself out to a movie tonight. You want to go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard Really? Do we do that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny What do you mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard You know, we haven’t spent time alone together since we broke up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny Oh, it’s not a date, Leonard. It’s just a man and a woman hanging out, and not having sex at the end of the night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard Sounds like most of my dates.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 sheldon Oh, dear Lord, get away from me, you monster!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny What is that about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard Well, he’s smart and crazy enough, he may have actually created a monster. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 sheldon Shoo, shoo! Be gone!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard What the hell is going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 sheldon There’s a bird outside the window, and he won’t go away. That is the hell that is going on. We have no worms or seeds here. Shoo, shoo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny Really? On top of everything else, you’re afraid of birds?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 sheldon It’s called ornithophobia. And someday it will be recognized as a true disability, and the landlord will be required by law to put a giant net over the building. Which is unfortunate, because I have a fear of nets.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny So movies, yes or no?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard Movies, yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny Great. I’ll see you later. And remember, he’s more afraid of you than you are of him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 sheldon That doesn’t help.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny No, I was talking to the bird.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 sheldon Go away, bird. Go away, bird. Go away, bird.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard Sheldon, just ignore him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 sheldon Good idea. Attention is what birds want. Oh, much better. All right. Now I’ll just get along with my life. Make a pot of tea, Leonard. It’s going to be a long night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard The bird’s still there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 sheldon Quick, what does a hawk sound like?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard I don’t know. Scree-scree.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 sheldon Please, that’s a seagull. If you’re not going to help, don’t help.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard Sorry. Do you think I’m overdressed?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 sheldon It depends on the activity. For a prostate exam, yes. If you’re playing Vegas, I’d add sequins.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard I’m going to the movies with Penny. I don’t want her to think that I think it’s a date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 sheldon Do you think it’s a date?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard No, but she might think I think it’s a date even though I don’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 sheldon Or you might think she thinks you think it’s a date even though she doesn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard Are we overthinking this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 sheldon Not at all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard You’re right. I’m fine. I’m wearing this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 sheldon Really? A blazer? All right. Yes, hello. This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I’m at 2311 North Robles Avenue. Yeah, I’d like to report a dangerous wild animal. A blue jay. I’m sorry, this is Animal Control. I don’t understand the laughter. No, the bird is not in my home. If he was in my home, I obviously would have called 911. Sir, I have no doubt that there are things that you’re frightened of. Being stuck in a dead-end public service job? Or your wife stepping out on you because you’re stuck in a dead-end public service job? Or spiders? Don’t you think I tried making cat noises?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard Too casual?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 sheldon For an audience with the queen, yes. For an evening of passing a bottle of fortified wine around a flaming trash can, you look great. What am I thinking? Whiskers!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny Oh, hey, if we hurry, we can make the new Jennifer Aniston movie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard Oh, yeah, sure. There’s also an amazing documentary about building a dam on river in South America.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny Okay, but the Jennifer Aniston movie has Jennifer Aniston, and she’s not building a dam.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard Can’t argue with that. I’ll get the tickets.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard Actually, you know what? I think it’s about time I pick a movie we see.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny You pick plenty of movies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard No. You always picked, and it was always the same. An hour and a half of beach houses in the rain until the woman turns around and realizes love was here all along.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny But come on, that is a great movie, and it starts in ten minutes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard I hate those movies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny No, you don’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard Yes, I do. The only reason I went is because you wanted to see them, and I wanted to have sex. To this day, I can’t see a Sandra Bullock movie poster without getting both bored and aroused.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny Okay, so while we were going out, how often would you pretend to like things just to have sex with me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard All the time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny You’re kidding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard Does this sound familiar? I’d love to go shoe shopping with you. Hiking? It’s great. It’s two a.m., of course I want to go to Korea Town and sing karaoke with your friends. Who wouldn’t?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny Okay, we were going out. You were going to get sex anyway.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard Really? You would have slept with me after a three-hour documentary on dams?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny No. No woman would.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard See? Now, that’s the great thing. We’re out as friends. This is not a date. Sex is off the table. So, let’s go learn why hydroelectric power might not be the environmental bargain you think it is. Sorry. Spoiler alert.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny All right, fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard Thanks. Tickets are eleven bucks. Not a date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 raj Come on, Sheldon, Star Wars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 howard I’m pushing play.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 sheldon A minute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 howard If we don’t start soon, George Lucas is going to change it again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 sheldon This would go a lot faster if you put your trade school diploma to work and helped me set up this high frequency tone generator.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 howard I have a Masters degree from M.I.T.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 sheldon Yeah, but you’ve got a can-do attitude and that’s what’s important.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 raj I really don’t get your problem with birds.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 sheldon The question you should be asking is what is their problem with me? My first memory, a hummingbird dive-bombing my stroller to get at the apple juice in my sippy cup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 raj Hummingbirds are pretty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 sheldon Hummingbirds are the vampires of the flower world.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 raj Still my first choice for an ankle tattoo. Or a dolphin, I go back and forth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 sheldon Age seven, a blood-thirsty chicken chases me up a tree. Age twelve, a magpie tries to steal the retainer out of my mouth. Age sixteen, a parrot in a pet store called me fat ass. Need I go on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 raj Yes, please. This is way better than the movie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 howard All right, Sheldon, your bird death ray is ready.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 sheldon It’s not a death ray. It’s just a little ultrasonic blast to scare him off. Trust me, if I had a death ray, I wouldn’t be living here. I’d be in my lair enjoying the money the people of Earth gave me for not using my death ray. All right, and in three, two, one. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 raj That is one tough birdie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard Come on, you enjoyed the movie. I saw you tearing up when the village got flooded, and everyone had to relocate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny No, I was thinking how come they get to leave and I can’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard I’m going to get some fries. You want anything?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny Uh, no, thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard Are you sure? Because you always say no, and then you eat half my fries.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny I just eat the little crispy ones you don’t like.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard No, I love them. I save them for the end, but they’re gone because you ate them. And why did I let you eat them?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny To get sex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard Exactly. But this is not a date. So I ask again, would you like anything?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny All right, I’d like an order of fries.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard Great. That’ll be five dollars. I am having the best time. I’m so glad you suggested we do this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny Oh, sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 man No problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny What you writing there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 man A screenplay. Its about a guy whose roommate is having sex and tells him go to a bar and work on his screenplay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 man It’s a working title.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 man I’m Kevin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny Oh. Penny. Nice to meet you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 kevin I’ll let you get back to your date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny Oh, no, no. This isn’t a date, no. Right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard Uh, right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny So have you written anything I might have seen?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 kevin That depends. How much time do you spend on Yelp?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 sheldon This is ridiculous. I’m a grown man from Texas. This isn’t a terrifying bird like a swan or a goose. It’s just a blue jay. That’s a pretty big blue jay. One, two, three. Go! Shoo! Am-scray, ird-bay! Bird in the apartment! Bird in the apartment! No!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny So it is an amazing documentary. They need the electricity from the dam, but at the same time they want to preserve the environment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard You’re kidding me. Uh, can I see you for a sec over here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny Oh, yeah. Sure. Just one sec?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 kevin No problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny What’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard I know what you’re doing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny What am I doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard You’re going out of your way to talk to that guy because I said we weren’t on a date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny No, I’m talking to him because he’s cute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard Come on, he’s not that cute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny Yes, he is. With his dorky T-shirt and his little hipster glasses.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard I wear dorky T-shirts and glasses.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny Yes, but when you’re tall and have great cheekbones, you’re doing it ironically.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard If that’s so, what if I start talking to a girl?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny You should.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard I’m serious. I’ll do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny Good! Go! There are some girls right over there. What are you waiting for?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard They’re in a group. I’m scared.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 amy Sheldon, what do you expect us to do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 sheldon You’re biologists. Biology is the study of living things. That’s a living thing, get cracking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 bernadette I specialize in microorganisms, and Amy studies brains.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 amy Yeah, neither of us minored in bird-shooing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 sheldon Oh, come now. Your undergraduate work must have included a varmints and critters class.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 bernadette Come back in, Sheldon, he’s not going to hurt you. He looks friendly. I think he might be someone’s pet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 sheldon No, Bernadette, don’t be a hero!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 bernadette Oh, he’s a sweetie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 sheldon Yes. It’s very sweet. Now, slowly and carefully, flush him down the toilet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 amy Sheldon, the only way to get past this fear is to interact with it. Just like you did with the mailman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 sheldon Every year tens of people around the world are killed by birds. I’m not going to be another statistic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 bernadette Look how sweet he is. Come over and say hi. Come on. You can do it. Don’t be scared. Come on. Oh, just pet the bird, you big baby!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 sheldon I did it! I actually did it. Okay, now flush him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 woman So, Leonard, what do you do for fun?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard Um, let’s see. Hiking. Karaoke in Koreatown. Any Jennifer Aniston movie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny Hey. Sorry I ditched you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard No, it’s fine. You can ditch away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny Oh, no, no. We said we were going to hang out, let’s hang out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard It’s cool. Go back to Kevin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny Oh, he had to leave.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard Interesting. So now that he’s gone, you want to hang out with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 woman This must be Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard Yep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 woman I totally get it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny Huh? I’m sorry, get what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard Don’t worry about it. You know, there’s some guys over there. You should go talk to them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny No, no. I want to know what you told her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard That’s kind of between me and…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 woman Laura.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard Laura.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny Oh. Okay, I see. So while he was telling you things, did he mention he owns not one, but two Star Trek uniforms?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 laura Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny Yeah. Wears them. Not just for Halloween.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard Hey, pal. You didn’t see me telling Kevin that you thought cold wars were only fought in winter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny Okay. Then I’ll return the favour, and I won’t tell…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 laura Laura.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny Laura that half the dirty movies you own are animated.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard When you were telling Kevin about your acting career, did you mention your long-running role as Waitress in a local production of The Cheesecake Factory?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny Did you tell her about your lucky asthma inhaler?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard Oh, yeah? Spell asthma.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny A… S… Take me home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard Maybe I’m not done hanging out with… You’re right, it’s getting late.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 sheldon It’s remarkable. All that time spent in fear. And for what? He’s magnificent. Oh, dear. I just realized I haven’t offered you a beverage.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 bernadette Oh, it’s just like my grandma with her parrot. And after she lost her marbles with her remote control.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 sheldon My phone’s on the desk over there. Take a picture of us together. Make it good enough to go on a mug, a mouse pad, and a calendar. If you were a dove, I’d call you Lovey-Dovey. Oh. Who am I kidding? This isn’t a moment for strict adherence to the literal. You’re just my little Lovey-Dovey, aren’t you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 amy Guess you gotta have hollow bones to get some sugar around here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 bernadette I still think he looks like someone’s pet. Maybe we should put up posters.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 sheldon Yes. It should have a big picture of him, and the words, is this your bird? Not anymore. We’re going to have so much fun together. You can carry messages to all my enemies. I can tie a string to your leg and fly you like a kite.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 amy If you’re keeping him, I’ve got a cage you can borrow. One of the test monkeys slipped on a banana peel and broke his neck. It was both tragic and hysterical.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 sheldon Nonsense. No. Lovey-Dovey doesn’t sleep in a cage. No. Lovey-Dovey sleeps in his very own nest, which I’m going to get off the windowsill and put in my room. Isn’t that right, LD? No. Where are you going? Come back, Lovey-Dovey! This is your home now! I already ordered 20 pounds of bird feed off of Amazon! He’s gone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 amy I’m sorry, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 sheldon How could he do this to me? Get back here, you stupid bird, so I can love you!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard Okay. So, we went out, saw a movie, met some nice people, said horrible things about each other in public, all in all, a pretty magical night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny Okay, I’m not innocent in all this, but you basically called me stupid, you asthmatic dumbass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard I know, I, I, I crossed a line. And I’m sorry. No, no, no, hang on. I really mean it. And it’s not like when we were going out, I’d just apologize for everything so we could end up in bed. This is a 100% sex-is-off-the-table I’m sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny All right. Thank you. I’m sorry, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard Just to be clear, sex is off the table, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny Way off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard Maybe we’re not ready to hang out as friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny I don’t know. Up until the last part, I was kind of enjoying take-charge Leonard with a little backbone. Picking the movie, knowing what he wants, a little cocky.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard Well, then, I’m putting sex back on the table. What do you think about that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny Ooh. Maybe I like it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard You do? Because if that’s what you like, I can be that guy. I swear, I’ll be anything you want me to be.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 penny Good night, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 leonard I am such an asthmatic dumbass. I had a weird night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode09 sheldon Mine was great. I’m going to be a mommy.
