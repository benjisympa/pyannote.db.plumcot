TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 howard It’s amazing people keep coming to comic book stores instead of just downloading comics digitally.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 leonard It’s probably for the best. For a lot of these guys, the weekly trip here is the only chance their mom has to go down to the basement and change their sheets.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 howard Oh, that reminds me, I get fresh sheets tonight. Yay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon Well? What do you think of New Comic Book Night? Magic, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 amy Sheldon, I’m disappointed. As a brilliant man, you’re entitled to a vice. I could understand frequenting an opium den or hunting your fellow man for sport. But this? Lame-o.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon Well, A, comic books employ storytelling through sequential art, a medium that dates back 17,000 years to the cave paintings of Lascaux, and B, you play the harp. Like that’s cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 stuart Can I help you find anything?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 amy A comic that depicts a woman whose bosom can’t be used as a floatation device.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 stuart Sorry. Most of the guys who come in here like big boobs. Couple of them have big boobs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 raj Hey, look, the new Warlords of Ka’a expansion pack is out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 howard A new one? Unbelievable. They just keep making up more cheesy monsters, slapping them on cards and selling them at 25 bucks a pop. It’s like a secret tax on guys who can’t get laid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 raj They’re not even trying. Remember the Satanimals pack with the Hellephant? Why, absurd. What was he, a bad elephant who died and went to hell? What could an elephant possibly do that would cause him eternal damnation?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 howard Wild West and Witches? What kind of loser cares about a showdown between Billy the Kid and the White Wizard of the North?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 raj A total loser. Obviously a guy with a six-shooter beats an old man with a magic wand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 leonard Well, ho-hold on. What if the wizard casts a Helmet of Confusion spell on Billy the Kid’s cowboy hat?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 howard What? Please! This is Billy the Kid we’re talking about. I mean, the wizard would get shot between the eyes before he could ever get out the words, what the hell is Billy the Kid doing in the mystic realm of Ka’a?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 stuart Leonard, what’s the deal with Sheldon’s friend Amy? Are they a couple?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 leonard Couple of weirdos. Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 howard You interested in Amy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 stuart Well, I mean, she didn’t look through me with soul-sucking, ball-shriveling hatred and contempt. I like that in a woman. Could you run it by Sheldon if I could ask her out?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 leonard Sure. I guess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 raj Stuart, settle an argument for us. Who would win, Billy the Kid or the White Wizard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 stuart If I tell you that, I’m robbing you of the hours of fun you could have for the magical, rootin’ tootin’ low price of $24.95.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 raj I’ll take one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 howard Mmm, make it two.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 leonard I hate all of you and myself. Three.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 stuart I’ll ring it up. Like shooting nerds in a barrel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 leonard Hey, can I talk to you about something? It’s a little awkward.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon I know what this is about. Given the professional standstill you’re at, you’re wondering if this is the appropriate time to abandon your research and focus on teaching. Yes. And if I may suggest, consider changing disciplines. Yeah, to the humanities, perhaps history. One of the advantages of teaching history is that you don’t have to create things, you know, you just have to remember stuff that happened and then parrot it back. You could have fun with that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 leonard Yeah, that’s not it. Stuart’s kind of interested in Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon Oh, of course he is. She’s very interesting. Did you know, when she was 14, she severed the webbing between her own toes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 leonard No. He wanted me to find out if you’d have a problem with him asking her out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon I’m not sure how to respond, Leonard. I don’t own Amy. Can’t own a person. At least not since? 1863. President Lincoln freed the? Slaves! Come on Leonard, if you’re going to teach history, these are the kind of facts you’ll have to know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 leonard You know what? Never mind. I’m going to tell him it’s okay to ask her out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon The question is moot. There is no way that Stuart, an impoverished peddler of picture books, would be at all appealing to Amy Farrah Fowler, a noted neurobiologist capable of performing surgery on her own feet with nothing but nitrous oxide from cans of whipped cream as anesthesia.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 leonard All right, but just for the record, I checked in with you to see how you’d feel about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon Fine. The record shall so reflect. Now, getting back to the problem at hand, what to do with a washed-up experimental physicist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 leonard I am not washed-up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon Oh, Leonard. Lots of people love you and want to help you, but they can’t until you admit the problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 penny Well, ladies, we killed the bottle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 amy I had half a glass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 bernadette I didn’t have any.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 penny Okay, don’t judge me. So, what do you want to do, go to the movies, go dancing, lay down for a little bit?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 amy Or we play Travel Twister.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 bernadette Amy, really? Twister?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 amy Excuse me. I’ve passed many an enjoyable evening playing this game. And I’m sure it’s a lot more exciting when you play with other people. What do you say, bestie? We can do shirts and skins. I’m shirts. Called it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 bernadette I’m too small for Twister. And roller coasters. And sitting with my feet on the floor. Hope you enjoyed the prenatal cigarettes, Mom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 penny Hey, you know, my mom smoked pot when she was pregnant with me, and I turned out just fine. Hey, look, I have peach schnapps. Thank God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 amy Guys, something happened.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 penny What’s wrong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 amy I think a boy likes me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 bernadette Hi. It’s Stuart. We met at the comic book store. I was wondering if you’d like to get coffee sometime. It’s okay if you say no. It might be the kick in the pants I need to start taking Zoloft.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 penny Amy, little vixen. Just working it under all those layers of wool and polyester.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 bernadette What are you going to do? Doesn’t he know you have a boyfriend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 penny Oh, she doesn’t have a boyfriend, she has a Sheldon. So do you like Stuart?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 amy I don’t know. He’s nice. He’s funny. He has the sallow, drawn countenance associated with an overactive thyroid gland. That’s kind of hot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 penny Okay, look, sweetie, we all love Sheldon, but you’ve been with him over a year now. If it’s not going anywhere, what does it hurt to look around?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 bernadette Well, yeah, I guess they’re not engaged like me and Howie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 penny Yeah, for what it’s worth, engaged people can look around, too. Lot of options out there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon Where’s Stuart?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 speccy_guy_behind_counter Out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon Who are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 speccy_guy I’m Dale. He left me in charge.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 leonard Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 dale Yeah. I don’t get it, either.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 leonard I want to return this Wild West and Witches Ka’a expansion pack.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 dale Sorry. I don’t do returns. They’re hard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 leonard Sure, sure. Uh, when will Stuart be back?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 dale I don’t know. He went out for coffee. With a girl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon Oh, I guess I was wrong.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 leonard You okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon Am I okay? Leonard, I’m on a lifelong trajectory that includes a Nobel Prize and cities named after me, all four wisdom teeth fit comfortably in my mouth without need of extraction, and my bowel movements run like a German train schedule. Am I okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 dale I’m okay, too!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 raj Wild Bill Witchcock.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 leonard A tribe of Abra-Comanches.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon Flaming Spittoon. And for the record, I’m very disappointed in you cowpokes. We’re playing our inaugural round of Wild West and Witches, and I’m the only one who bothered to dress for the occasion. Patooie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 howard We’re not wearing cowboy hats, Sheldon. It looks ridiculous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon And I suppose my boots and spurs are ridiculous, too?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 leonard Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 howard Very.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 raj Incredibly so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon Did it look ridiculous when we got the Satanimals pack and I dressed up as a Beelzebobcat?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 leonard Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 howard Very.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 raj Incredibly so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon All right, fine. Let’s just play.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 leonard We should go easy on him. Amy’s out with Stuart tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 howard Wait a minute. Are you telling me that Sheldon’s patented blend of condescension and no sex isn’t enough to hold on to a woman?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon Cluck, cluck, cluck. What are we, ladies at a quilting bee? Or are we men playing a fantasy card game set in a magical frontier town?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 howard Sorry. Creepy Tepee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 raj Annie Ogly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 leonard Hocus Pocus Pocahontas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon And may I point out it is the three of you who are obsessed with Stuart and Amy, not me. I think you need to ask yourselves who’s really being ridiculous here. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 leonard It’s you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 howard You are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 raj Totally you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 raj Hey, guys, check it out. The deluxe limited edition Wild West and Witches expansion pack in the signed and numbered collector’s tin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 leonard Oh come on, no! We just bought the regular pack.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 howard Ooh, a sheriff’s badge.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 raj Yeah, it’s also a wand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 leonard With a hologram? Nice. Hey, do you see this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon I’m in the matrix, Leonard, I see everything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 leonard You’ve got to be kidding me. You friended Stuart on Facebook?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 howard I thought you didn’t like Facebook anymore.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon Don’t be silly. I’m a fan of anything that tries to replace actual human contact.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 raj Please. You’re looking at Facebook to find out how their date went.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon Really? You think I care if a man, what, shared a pumpkin latte with a dynamite lady?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 raj You’re so full of it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon You are free to believe whatever you like. And unfriend Rajesh Koothrappali.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 raj You unfriended me? Seriously?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 howard Oh, yeah. Now he’s gonna miss all those great updates like, I can’t believe I waited this long to make my own potpourri.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 leonard Sheldon, why don’t you just acknowledge that you have feelings for Amy and you don’t want her going out with other men?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon And unfriend Leonard Hofstadter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 howard Here’s a radical thought. Go old-school, challenge Stuart to a fight. I mean, nothing makes the ladies hotter than two skinny white guys swatting at each other with their eyes closed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon And unfriend Howard Wolowitz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 leonard That’s all of us. Can I use the laptop?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 leonard I have to buy that stupid collector’s tin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 penny Who do we love?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon Penny. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 penny Who do we love?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon Penny. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 penny Who do we love?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 penny Hello, Sheldon. Come on in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 penny What’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon I came to ask if you would like to go on a date with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 penny I’m sorry, what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon A date. You and me. Dining, dancing, perhaps you’d like to take in a prizefight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 penny God, are you trying to make Amy jealous?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon No. Why is everyone so obsessed with Amy and Stuart? And whether or not they may be having more pumpkin lattes or intercourse tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 penny Okay, listen to me. Playing games is not gonna help get Amy back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon I am not trying to get her back. But, out of curiosity, what is a way?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 penny All right, honey, let me tell you a story. There was a guy I liked, and I never told him how I felt. Eventually, he started going out with someone else, and I always regretted it. Do you see where I’m going with this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon I believe I do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 penny Mm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon I’m the guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 penny You’re not the guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon Are you sure? That would explain so much. Your constant presence in my apartment, that baffling dalliance with Leonard just to be near me, the way you call me sweetie all the time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 penny I call everyone sweetie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon You tramp.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 penny Look, Sheldon, all I’m saying is strap on a pair and go talk to Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon Strap on a pair? Of what, skates?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 penny Oh, sweetie, you are so not the guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 stuart If you’re bored, you can go. I understand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 amy No, I’m having a nice time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 stuart Don’t patronize me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon me. Pardon me. Excuse me. Hi, Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 stuart Hi, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon Pardon me. Excuse me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 amy Sheldon, what are you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon The thought of you sitting in a darkened theatre with a character like Stuart is repellent. No offence, Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 stuart None taken. Although repellent is kind of a, kind of a strong word.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 amy I’m sorry this causes you discomfort, but based on the currently established parameters of our relationship, I can put myself in any repellent situation I want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 stuart Um, again…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon Stuart, please. You’re being rude.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 amy Anything else?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon I believe I would like to alter the paradigm of our relationship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 amy I’m listening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon With the understanding that nothing changes whatsoever, physical or otherwise, I would not object to us no longer characterizing you as not my girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 amy Interesting. Now try it without the quadruple negative.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon You’re being impossible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 amy Hi, Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon Fine. Amy, will you be my girlfriend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 amy Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon Well, that’s enough of that. Sorry to interrupt. You two enjoy your date. Here’s a dollar for your troubles. Get yourself some Sour Patch Kids.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 stuart So, other than you taking your relationship to the next level with another guy, this was nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 amy Yes, well, thanks for seeing me to my door.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 stuart Oh, you’re welcome.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon Amy. Amy. Amy. Let’s wrap things up out there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 amy Um, good night, Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 stuart Good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon Take the hint, Stuart. The lady said good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 amy How did you get into my apartment?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon Wow. Is that the kind of nagging I can expect now that you’re my girlfriend? Good thing I drew this up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 amy What’s that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon I present to you the relationship agreement. A binding covenant that, in its 31 pages, enumerates, iterates and codifies the rights and responsibilities of Sheldon Lee Cooper, here and after known as the boyfriend, and Amy Farrah Fowler, here and after known as the girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 amy It’s so romantic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon Mutual indemnification always is. Why don’t you start perusing while I set up my notary stamp.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon Feel free to retain a lawyer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 amy Penny, I said right hand red.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 penny Yeah, I heard you. I got red.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 amy Bernadette, left foot yellow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 bernadette We should play limbo next. No one beats me at limbo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon Penny. Amy. Bernadette.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 amy That’s my boyfriend. It’s open!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon I got a splinter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 amy What do you want me to do about it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 sheldon Relationship agreement Section 4, Boo-boos and Ouchies. You have to take care of it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 amy I should’ve gotten a lawyer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 bernadette Looks like it’s just us playing. Penny? Penny, we’re out of wine!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode10 penny You should probably drive.
