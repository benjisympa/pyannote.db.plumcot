TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 penny Hi. Did Sheldon change the Wi-Fi password again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, it’s “Penny already eats our food, she can pay for Wi-Fi.” No spaces.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 penny Okay. If you can’t get me to stop eating your food, what makes you think you can get me to stop using your Wi-Fi?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper I believe that you’re capable of great change. Like when I finally got you to stop saying Valentimes Day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter You want to hear something weird?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 penny Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper In the year 2000, Pope John Paul II was named an honorary Harlem Globetrotter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter What are you talking about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper You asked Penny if she wanted to hear something weird.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, because I have something weird to tell her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Oh. I thought it was a game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 penny What’s yours?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter There’s this guy, Jimmy Speckerman, who used to torment me in high school. He sent me a message through Facebook. He’s in town and wants to have drinks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Okay, Penny, if it were a game, here are your choices. An e-mail from an old acquaintance, or the head of one of the largest religious institutions in the world slam dunking to Sweet Georgia Brown. Pick.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Just do it, ’cause he’s not gonna let it go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 penny Basketball Pope.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper And that’s how it’s done.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 penny What are you gonna do about your bully? Are you gonna see him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter I don’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Is this the fellow who peed in your Hawaiian Punch?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter No, that was a different guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Was he the one who wedgied you so hard, your testicle reascended, and you spent your whole Christmas break waiting for it to come back down?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter No, that was a different, different guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Was he the one who used your head to open a nut?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Oh, oh, oh. Was he the one who made you eat your arm hair?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter No, but, actually, that was this guy’s sister.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 penny All right, well, what do you think he wants?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter I don’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper You know, the holidays are just around the corner. Maybe he wants to see if he can lodge the other testicle up there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter I told you. That was a different guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 penny Hmm. That’s too bad. We could have spent New Year’s Eve waiting for the ball to drop.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter It’s two a.m. What are you doing up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Nobel Prize acceptance ceremony streaming live from Stockholm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Sure. You want to see what all the scientists are wearing this year.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Look at these men. They’ve managed to win the top science prize in the world with no more understanding of the quantum underpinnings of the expansion of the early universe than God gave a goose. You should pay attention, Leonard. Someday this could be you up there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper So, what’s got you up? Did you have a bad clam?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter I didn’t have clams.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper I don’t watch you 24 hours a day. I don’t know what you do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter It’s this Jimmy Speckerman thing. I can’t decide if I should agree to see him or not. Of course that might be because the last time I ran into him, he made me floss with my own shoelaces.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Wear loafers. Look at Dr. Saul Perlmutter up there, clutching that Nobel Prize. What’s the matter, Saul? You afraid someone’s going to steal it? Like you stole Einstein’s cosmological constant?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter You know what? I am tired of living in fear of this guy. I’m gonna go see him and finally say all the things I should have said in high school. You know, pick on someone your own size, you did not have sex with my mother, and yes, I do know why I’m hitting myself.”
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Oh, now Perlmutter’s shaking the King’s hand. Yeah, check for your watch, Gustaf. He might have lifted it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 bernadette_rostenkowski I love this dress. How come I never see you wear it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 penny ‘Cause when I wear it, it’s a shirt. So, what’s Howard doing tonight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, they all went with Leonard to confront his childhood bully.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 penny Oh, terrific. High school quarterback against four mathletes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 amy_farrah_fowler When Leonard gets back, I’d love to check his serotonin levels. Do you think he’d let me draw a syringe full of his blood?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 penny Hmm, he’s not crazy about needles, but if you get him to go jogging, it’ll just pour out of his nose.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t think I can meet the girl who was always mean to me. Tammy Bodnick. One time while I was in gym class, she stole all my clothes and left an elf costume in my locker.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 penny Oh, that’s awful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 bernadette_rostenkowski Worst part was, it was too big.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 amy_farrah_fowler That’s nothing. In ninth grade, the girls put Rogaine in my hand lotion. Within six months, the nicknames began to fly. I think the one that hurt the most was Gorilla Fingers Fowler.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 penny Wow. You poor thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 bernadette_rostenkowski What about you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 penny Oh. I don’t know. I guess my school was a nice place. We didn’t really have bullies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 amy_farrah_fowler Come on, no one ever gave anyone mean nicknames or picked on them or put gum in their hairy knuckles so the school nurse had to use peanut butter to get it out?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 penny No, we weren’t really like that. I mean, look, we played pranks on each other, but it was never mean. Like, okay, this one girl, Kathy Geiger, got really good grades, so we blindfolded her, tied her up and left her in a cornfield overnight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, my God, that’s awful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 penny No, it was funny. Everyone laughed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 amy_farrah_fowler Did Kathy Geiger laugh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 penny Uh, probably. It’s hard to say. She kind of had an ear of corn in her mouth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 amy_farrah_fowler Who would have thought Fuzzy Fingers Fowler is best friends with a bully?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 penny What? I was not a bully.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 bernadette_rostenkowski Kind of sounds like you were. And maybe a felon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 amy_farrah_fowler Shh. That’s how you wind up in a cornfield.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 raj_koothrappali Is that him over there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 raj_koothrappali How about that guy? He looks like he’d hate you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter You know, I can really do this by myself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Hey, we’re here to support you, buddy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter No, you’re not. You’re here to see if I get my underwear pulled over my head.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 howard_wolowitz You wore underwear? You fool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 raj_koothrappali So, have you figured out what you’re going to say to him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter You bet. I am going to make him apologize for all the crap he pulled on me in school.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 howard_wolowitz That’s quite a list. I can’t read your handwriting, what’s that word?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Scrotum.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 raj_koothrappali What’s that one?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Uh, stapled.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Oh, hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 Holy crap, man, it’s good to see you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Yeah. You, too. Uh, Jimmy, this is Sheldon and Raj and Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 Hi. Fellas. Hey, can I get a beer? Wow. Look at you. Little Leonard Hofstadter. I hear you’re a big-time scientist now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper And there’s the first zinger. Ouch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter I’m doing okay, I guess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 Okay? Come on, I read online you’re a physicist at a university, you won some medal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter The Newcomb medal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 Yeah, congratulations.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Congratulations? The Newcomb medal? Oh, please. That’s the scientific equivalent of a smiley face sticker on your homework.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 From what I read, it sounded like a big deal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Oh, good Lord, are we going to stand here and listen to him tear Leonard apart like this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 raj_koothrappali Hey, I won a Newcomb medal, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper My point.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 You should have seen this guy back in the day. Huh? He was so little, he could fit in just about anywhere. Lockers, trash cans. Oh, man, how did you get inside that backpack?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Oh, I can’t take all the credit. You helped a lot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 Yeah. We were practically a comedy team.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Like the Black Death and Europe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Jimmy, I’m kind of curious why you wanted to see me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 Okay, here it is. I have this great money-making idea. I just need a gear head to get it to the finish line.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Technically, Howard’s the gear head. Leonard’s just a dime store laser jockey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter What’s the idea?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 This is just between us, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 Okay. What do you think about a pair of glasses that makes any movie you want into 3D?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 raj_koothrappali That sounds amazing. First movie I’m watching, Annie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 howard_wolowitz How exactly would these glasses work?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 How the hell should I know? That’s why I need a nerd.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter I don’t think something like that’s even possible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 Aw, come on, you can figure it out. You’re like the smartest guy I’ve ever known.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper The smartest? All right, you know, I may not have a firm grasp on sarcasm, but even I know that was a doozy. Leonard, you can’t live in fear of this man forever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, I got this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper You clearly don’t. What my spineless friend lacks the courage to say is you’re a terrible person who took advantage of his tiny size, his uncoordinated nature and his congenital lack of masculinity.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Leonard, I platonically love you, man, but face it, you’re a mess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 I don’t understand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter I think what he’s trying to say is that maybe in high school you picked on me a little bit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper A little bit? The man Super Glued Hershey’s Kisses to your nipples.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 raj_koothrappali That’s funny because those aren’t the kind of kisses you want on your nipples.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 What is that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper This is a list of your heinous acts against Leonard. One of which is certainly the cause of him wetting his bed well into his teens.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter 14 is not, oh , yeah, never mind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 What’s this word?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Nancy. You called me Nancy for three years.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper You really need to work on your penmanship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 Oh, man, I, I don’t know what to say. I always thought we were just having some fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter It wasn’t fun for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper You’re being too kind, Leonard. You ruined him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Come on, guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 raj_koothrappali That was pretty badass, dude.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper I help the weak. It’s yet another way I’m exactly like Batman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Hey, for the record, Jimmy wasn’t the reason I wet the bed. That one has my mother written all over it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 penny Anyway, I’m really sorry I made fun of your stutter in high school.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 bernadette_rostenkowski You’re doing great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 penny Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Oh, God, just finish the sentence. Okay, well, I’m sorry you feel that way. Bye. No one wants to hear my apologies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 amy_farrah_fowler I think your mistake is doing it over the phone. If they could look into your eyes, they’d melt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 bernadette_rostenkowski Penny, it doesn’t matter what you did in the past. You’re a good person now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 penny That’s easy for you to say. You weren’t just called a b-b-b-b-bitch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 amy_farrah_fowler Perhaps you could assuage your guilt through altruism. Which word’s tripping you up? Assuage or altruism?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 penny Both.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 bernadette_rostenkowski You’ll feel better by doing something nice for someone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 penny I actually knew that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 amy_farrah_fowler I never doubted you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 bernadette_rostenkowski Every other week I serve at a soup kitchen downtown.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 penny Ooh, I can’t do that. If I stand over a steaming pot, my hair just goes boing! What else could I do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 amy_farrah_fowler There’s Habitat for Humanity, building houses for the poor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 penny Okay, come on, I don’t even have my own house, I’m going to build one for someone else?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 amy_farrah_fowler How about donating some of your clothes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 penny Oh, my God, that’s perfect. ‘Cause I have so many clothes I don’t wear, and they’re just taking up space, and I go shopping to buy more stuff and I have no place to put it. This will totally fix that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 bernadette_rostenkowski What about helping people?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 penny And helping people.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Here’s your cocoa.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Oh, half and half instead of whole milk?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Heated to precisely 183 degrees?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Seven little marshmallows, no more no less?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter You got one for good luck. I’ll get it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper One for good luck. Must be the kind of math they do at Princeton.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter What are you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 I want to apologize for stapling your balls and throwing you naked in the girls’ locker room, stuffing that parrot down your pants. What’s this word?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Laxative.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 Oh, right. Junior prom. That was not cool, man. I am so, so sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 Yeah. I just hope you can forgive me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Uh, yeah. Sure, I guess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 You’re a beautiful guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Well, yeah, thanks, Jimmy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 Okay, I got to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Are you okay to drive?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 Yeah, yeah, yeah. I drive better drunk. You know, it makes you pay attention.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter No, no, no, come on in. I’ll make you a cup of coffee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 I wouldn’t be imposing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, we can’t let him drive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Then take away his keys and make him wander the streets with the other drunks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter You remember Sheldon and Raj and Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 Not really, no. It’s funny, huh, Leonard? Back in school, I was the winner and you were the loser. And now we’re reversed. You’re the winner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper You’d think a winner could make a decent cup of cocoa.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 You mind if I use your bathroom?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, just back there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 howard_wolowitz How about that? After all these years, your big bad high school bully finally apologizes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Yeah. It kind of rekindles your faith in the basic goodness of people.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper You know what would be nice?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 raj_koothrappali What’s that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper As a symbolic gesture to all the bullies who’ve tormented us for years, we open our home to Jimmy and once he’s asleep we kill him. I said it would be nice, I didn’t say we should do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 penny Ah, I feel just like Mother Teresa. Except for the virgin part. That ship sailed a long time ago.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 bernadette_rostenkowski I think Mother Teresa would have washed the clothes first.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 penny Yeah, well, I bet her laundry room wasn’t down five flights of stairs. You know, giving really is better than receiving. I used to think it was such a cliche, but it seems to be the… oh, look at these cute jeans someone just threw away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 bernadette_rostenkowski Donated.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 penny Yes, to a poor waitress who loves a boot cut.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 bernadette_rostenkowski Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 penny Come on, they would be so cute on me, and, ah, they go great with this sweater!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 amy_farrah_fowler I don’t think Mother Teresa… Oh, that is adorable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper In case it comes up again, this right here is an imposition.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter What was I supposed to do? He needed a place to sleep it off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper You’re soft. This world’s going to chew you up and spit you out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 When did I have tacos?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Morning, Jimmy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Oh, there it is, tacos.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 Man, I tied one on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, you did. So, uh, listen, it was great to see you again. And , and, and thanks for the apology.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 What apology?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter For all the crappy stuff you did to me in high school.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 Geez, you’re still harping on that? What a puss.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter That’s my French toast.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 It’s good. You really know your way around a kitchen, Nancy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper I’m not going to say I told you so, but we could have killed him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter I might kill him right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper The Dark Knight has your back. He’s scared, but he has your back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Okay, Jimmy, it’s time for you to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 Yeah, all right, let me just finish this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter No, you’re done. I want you out of my apartment right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Well said, Boy Wonder.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 jimmy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 Or what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Don’t answer that. It’s a trick question. I speak from experience.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter I’m not afraid of you any more, Jimmy. Now get out! Uh-oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper You did it, Leonard, you stood up to your bully.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I feel pretty good about myself. You think we can outrun him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode11 sheldon_cooper I don’t need to outrun him, I just need to outrun you.
