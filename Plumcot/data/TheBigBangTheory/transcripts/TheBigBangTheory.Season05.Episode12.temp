TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 howard Completely empty box. If you’d like to examine it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 leonard Mm-hmm. Yep. I see nothing in this box but a wasted childhood.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 howard Little snarky there, cello lessons. And we have this completely ordinary cylinder. If you’d like to examine it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 raj Ordinary, yet I sense it is dripping with magical potential.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 sheldon Oh, dear Lord. A man pops out for a moment to evacuate his bowels and catch up on the adventures of the Caped Crusader, only to emerge and discover his apartment has been transformed into a cabaret.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 leonard Sheldon, he’s just practising for his cousin’s birthday party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 howard As I was saying, empty box, empty cylinder, and, ooh, voila. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 raj I’m telling you, dude, there’s a seat on the Hogwarts Express with your name on it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 sheldon This is how you’re going to entertain your little cousin and his friends? By lying to them?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 howard How is this lying?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 sheldon A magic show is an inherently deceitful proposition. This is an ordinary top hat. You’ve chosen that card freely. I do not have a set of lock picks lodged in my keister.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 raj Can’t you just enjoy the wonder, Sheldon? Why must you peek behind the curtain? Or up the butt?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 sheldon If we poison the critical thinking faculties of children by telling them that rabbits come out of hats, then we create adults who believe in astrology and homeopathy and that Ryan Reynolds was a better choice for Green Lantern than lovable rogue Nathan Fillion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 leonard Sheldon, he’s just gonna do a few magic tricks for some kids. I really don’t think they’re gonna end up liking the Green Lantern movie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 howard Don’t be so hard on him. It’s natural to be a little cranky when you have a quarter in your ear!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 sheldon Coins lodged in body parts is not a source of amusement. When I was five, Billy Sparks put a Mexican peso up my nose.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 howard How is that not amusing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 sheldon It’s still there. Takes me 45 minutes to get through airport security. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 howard Look, I made Sheldon disappear. Ta-da.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 leonard Next time, you should open with that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 penny Ooh, look who’s out on a date. Pasadena’s favourite power couple, Shamy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 sheldon And that is the answer to the question, what is wrong with eating at The Cheesecake Factory?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 penny So, are we celebrating anything special tonight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 amy Oh, yes. Our relationship agreement specifies that the second Thursday of every month, or the third Thursday in a month with five Thursdays, is date night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 penny That is so hot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 sheldon All right, without objection, the minutes of the previous date are considered read and agreed to. Any new business?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 amy How was your day?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 sheldon Superb. This morning I made a palindrome with my Alpha-Bits. Nice hat, Bob Tahecin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 amy Sounds like you hit the ground running. I have a bit of good news myself. My most recent paper on how a cooperative long-term potentiation can map memory sequences in dendritic branches made the cover of Neuron.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 sheldon Ooh! Speaking of good news, somebody just hit 100 Twitter followers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 amy That’s nice. Anyway, I’ve been dreaming of this day for a long time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 sheldon Yeah, me, too. Triple digits, I’m not gonna lie, feels pretty good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 amy Sheldon, I’m the sole author on a paper being published in a distinguished journal that may change the course of my field.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 sheldon Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Ooh, 101! Air’s getting a bit thin up here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 penny So, are we ready to order?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 amy Give me a minute. I’m gonna go wash up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 sheldon Well, that’s odd. We both washed up when we came in. It’s probably a euphemism for urination.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 penny Sheldon, what is wrong with you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 sheldon Not much. Although, I can be faulted for being overly fond of koala bears. I don’t know what it is, when they smart munching on eucalyptus, I just melt inside.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 penny Okay, Amy just told you some exciting news, and you acted like it was no big deal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 sheldon Oh, I see why you’re confused. No, her news sounded important, but what you’re forgetting is, it was an achievement in the field of biology. That’s all about yucky, squishy things.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 penny Honey, she’s upset. You’re her boyfriend. You have to at least try to be excited by the things she’s excited by.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 sheldon What if they simply don’t excite me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 penny Well, just smile and think about koalas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 sheldon She’d see right through that. We go to the zoo all the time. She knows my koala face. And for future reference, it’s this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 bernadette Oh, you have a lot of magic stuff.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 howard Yeah. I started when I was a teenager. I thought I could show a girl a few tricks and invite her up to my bedroom to see the rest of the act.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 bernadette Did it work?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 howard Ah, let’s just say the only wand that ever saw any action was this one. Oh, look what my mom made us for the act.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 bernadette Ooh. I like the fabric. Where’d she get it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 howard Well, she cut up one of her old bathing suits. She made these two vests and half a dozen napkins.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 mrs_wolowitz Has she tried on the vest yet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 howard I just gave it to her!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 mrs_wolowitz I hope it fits, she has a tricky figure! She’s short and stacked, like me!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 howard She’s not stacked like you, Ma! She never steps on hers!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 bernadette Listen, Howie, maybe I’m not the best choice to be a magician’s assistant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 howard You’ll do fine. Hand me those rings? See? You nailed it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 bernadette You know, i-it’s just that I’m not that comfortable with little kids.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 howard Well, that’s because you haven’t been around them much. This is good practice. I mean, you are gonna be a mom someday, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 bernadette Mmm, yeah, sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 howard Oh-ho-ho! I haven’t seen this trick in years. It’s called the dove pan. You let everyone see the pan is empty, but there’s a secret compartment in the lid. And then you open it and produce a live… Don’t look in there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 leonard Oh, a little Red Dead Redemption, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 sheldon Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 leonard How come you’re not doing a mission? You’re just wandering around.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 sheldon Had a rough night. I thought I’d go for a walk and clear my head.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 leonard Some people go outside and do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 sheldon It’s after nine o’clock, at this hour the streets of Pasadena are teeming with drunken sailors and alley cats.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 leonard You want to talk about it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 sheldon No. I think I’ll just go in this saloon and drink my troubles away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 leonard You know digital alcohol is never a solution. What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 sheldon Hard as this may be to believe, it’s possible that I’m not boyfriend material.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 leonard Glad I was sitting down for that. Did you and Amy get in a fight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 sheldon Amy had a fight. I was being perfectly reasonable. I’m gonna have a whiskey. Do you want anything?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 leonard No, I can’t. I’m playing Grand Theft Auto later. Look, I’m no expert in women.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 sheldon I’ll say.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 leonard That’s not necessary when someone’s trying to help you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 sheldon I’m sorry. It’s the alcohol talking. Go on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 leonard Sometimes with women you want to listen to what upsets them and then show them that you can grow and change.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 sheldon Nuts to that. What else you got?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 leonard I don’t know what to tell you. Buy her something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 sheldon How does that work?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 leonard Well, you skip over any attempt to repair your emotional connection and you win back her affection with an empty financial gesture.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 sheldon Well, that approach has Sheldon Cooper written all over it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 leonard Glad I could help.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 sheldon It’s appreciated. And if you ever manage to find a woman again, I’ll be glad to return the favour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 howard And now, all the rings are magically linked together. My fiancee’s wearing a magic ring, too. It made all my money disappear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 bernadette Oh, ah, right. And now, the great Howdini’s next miraculous illusion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 child When are we gonna have cake?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 bernadette After you’ve been thoroughly amazed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 child But we want cake now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 bernadette Well, you’re not getting cake right now, capisce?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 howard Okay. Okay. Now, my lovely assistant is going to bring me an ordinary pitcher of milk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 second_child I know how you do that trick.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 bernadette Do you know how to pipe down?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 howard Okay, we’re going to roll up this newspaper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 second_child It’s a fake pitcher.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 bernadette You got wax in your ears? The man said it’s an ordinary pitcher. Howdini.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 howard Okay, we’re going to stick this in here and then I’m going to pour in the milk. I hope this works, because I didn’t bring a change of pants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 second_child Look, I Googled it. It’s a fake pitcher.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 bernadette That’s it. No cake for you. Anyone else want to join the No Cake Club?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 howard She’s just kidding, boys and girls. Everyone gets cake.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 bernadette Not him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 howard Just give me the pitcher. Behold! Wrong pitcher.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 bernadette I told you I’m not good with kids.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 howard Yes, you did. Oh, I think my crotch is starting to curdle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 bernadette The thing is, my mother worked full-time. I had to take care of my brothers and sisters.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 howard Yeah, so?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 bernadette Ugh, it was horrible. With their snotty noses and their poopy diapers and their little shrieky voices, always complaining. I don’t want to get dressed. Joey keeps spitting in my mouth. This isn’t the way Mom makes waffles. Well, okay, put your hand in here. Let’s see how you like this waffle!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 howard All right, settle down. Red light. Red light, red light! Okay, we’re fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 bernadette I’m sorry. I know it makes me sound like a bad person, but I just don’t like children.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 howard Yeah, no, we all got that. But don’t you think it’ll be different when the child is ours?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 bernadette Right, when it’s our kid that’s ruined my body and kept me up all night and I’ve got no career and no future and nothing to be happy about for the next 20 years, sure, that’ll be completely different.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 howard Well, yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 sheldon I don’t think there’s anything in this jewellery store that Amy would appreciate more than the humidifier we were just looking at at Sears.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 penny Oh, my God, now I know what I sound like to you when I say stupid stuff.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 sheldon Ooh, a pocket watch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 penny Okay, I don’t think Amy wants a pocket watch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 sheldon No, but maybe she wants a man with a pocket watch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 penny Still saying stupid stuff. Ooh, does she like bracelets?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 sheldon Well, she’s very fond of her silver one that says allergic to penicillin. Maybe they have a dressier version of that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 assistant Well, how are we doing this afternoon? Are we looking for anything special? Perhaps a ring for the lady?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 penny Trust me, we are not a couple.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 sheldon Excuse me. I don’t see why you get to snort derisively and point that out. You’d be lucky to land a fella like me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 penny Fine, go ahead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 sheldon Trust me, we are not a couple.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 assistant My apologies. How can I help you today?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 penny He’s in trouble with his girlfriend and needs to buy her a present.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 assistant Great, trouble with girlfriends is what’s putting my daughter through USC.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 penny Ooh, are these real diamonds?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 assistant Yes. Channel set baguettes, 20 points total weight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 sheldon Remarkable. Diamonds, crystallized carbon. Every day, people go to the grocery store and come home with sacks full of carbon in the form of charcoal briquettes that they toss in their barbeques and set on fire. But just because you’ve got some carbon with the atoms stacked neatly, you expect me to plunk down thousands of dollars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 assistant Actually, that’s only 750. Everything’s on sale.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 sheldon Really. Talk to me about that pocket watch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 howard I’m still trying to wrap my mind around it. I always thought I’d be a dad someday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 raj Oh, me, too. You’re so caring. I’ve often pictured you guiding a young boy into manhood.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 leonard There you go, Howard. Sounds like Raj’ll have your babies, problem solved.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 raj Hey, just because a man shows caring for another man doesn’t mean he’s displaying the love that dare not speak its name. Did she definitely say she didn’t want kids?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 howard Yeah, she doesn’t like them. And from what I saw, the feeling was mutual.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 leonard What are you gonna do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 howard I don’t know. I can’t see a life where I don’t have kids. I mean, people have kids. I mean, even Donkey Kong had Donkey Kong Jr. So he could teach someone how to kidnap princesses and throw barrels at Italian plumbers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 leonard You know, there’s no guarantee even if you have kids that you’re going to like them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 raj Wow, that’s rough. Where’d you get that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 leonard It’s right off the dust jacket of my mom’s last book.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 howard Maybe me and Bernadette aren’t right for each other.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 leonard Look, Howard, I’d say there’s a lot of fish in the sea, but I watched you dangle your hook in the water for years. Do not throw her back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 howard I don’t want to, but this is kind of a deal breaker.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 raj What’s your mom going to say if you call off the wedding?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 howard Huh, it’ll kill her. On the other hand, if I don’t give her grandchildren, that’ll kill her, too. So, either way, on the Mom front, I’m golden.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 sheldon What time did you tell Amy to be here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 penny Eight o’clock. Sheldon, that pocket watch is ridiculous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 sheldon Nonsense. I look like a train conductor. Under what pretext did you lure her here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 penny I said, hey, want to come over and hang out?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 sheldon Good, good, if you had said something clever, she might’ve gotten suspicious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 amy Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 penny Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 amy What’s he doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 penny Okay, he wants to talk to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 amy Well, I don’t want to talk to him. And I’m pretty disappointed in you, too. Although we both know that won’t last.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 penny Sheldon, you’re up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 sheldon Thank you. Amy, I’d like to apologize. Your accomplishment was impressive. And I’m proud of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 amy We both know that’s your koala face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 sheldon I told you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 penny Okay, look, he bought you this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 amy Jewellery? Seriously? Sheldon, you are the most shallow, self-centred person I have ever met. Do you really think another transparently manip..oh! It’s a tiara! A tiara! I have a tiara! Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 penny You look beautiful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 amy Of course I do, I’m a princess, and this is my tiara!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 sheldon You’re right, the tiara was too much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 mrs_wolowitz Howard! Bernadette’s… Oh, she slipped right by me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 bernadette Here’s your vest back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 howard You should keep it. You could wear it again sometime.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 bernadette Where?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 howard I don’t know, hunting?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 mrs_wolowitz Don’t forget to talk to her about this mishegas where I don’t get grandkids!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 howard Don’t worry, Ma. I will, as soon as I can figure out a way to bring up such a sensitive issue!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 bernadette I guess you talked to your mom, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 howard I was upset. My mom can be a pretty good shoulder to cry on, if the smell of Bengay doesn’t burn your eyes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 bernadette Look, it’s obvious having kids is really important to you, and I think I came up with a solution.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 howard Really? That’s great. What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 bernadette Well, seeing as how I make way more money than you anyway, what if I work and you stay home with the kids?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 howard Me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 bernadette Yeah. You know, you’ll watch Barney and pull Cheerios out of their noses and go on play dates, and I’ll work and have conversations with people my own age and enjoy my life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 howard Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 bernadette Yay, so we’re good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 howard Yeah, we’re good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 bernadette You know, I don’t know if this counted as a fight, but how about some make-up sex?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode12 howard I would love that. But what is that behind your ear? Oh, look, it’s a condom.
