TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard You feel like trying something new for dinner? Maybe Indian, Tex-Mex?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 sheldon You ever wonder how humans would be different if they evolved from lizards instead of mammals?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Okay, let’s talk about that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 sheldon As you know, lizards, cold-blooded animals, lack the ability to sense temperature. But they do move more sluggishly when it’s cold. So, lizard weathermen would say things like, bring a sweater, it’s slow outside. I love my mind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard We all do. Now, how about dinner?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 sheldon Oh, I would assume we’d enjoy insects or smaller lizards. We could also pull each other’s tails off and grill them, they’ll just grow back. Oh! My life-size cardboard Mr. Spock is here! I know he wouldn’t care for an outburst of human emotion, but, oh goodie, oh goodie, oh goodie. Commander Spock requesting permission to be unfolded.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Excuse me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 sheldon Permission granted, Commander.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 amy Which is why the more intelligent the monkey, the more faeces they fling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Excuse me, Amy. Penny, do you have plans for dinner tonight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny Why, you guys going somewhere?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard No, I mean just you and me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny You mean, like a date?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Not like a date, a date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 amy Ooh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 bernadette Ooh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny Um, o-okay. Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 amy Ooh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 bernadette Ooh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 sheldon Oh, no! They sent the wrong Spock! Live long and suck it, Zachary Quinto.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 bernadette This is so exciting. If Leonard and Penny get back together, Howard and I can go on double dates with them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 amy How come you never invite Sheldon and me on a double date?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 bernadette Mm, uh… How’s it going in there, Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny Just a sec. Too much?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 bernadette Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 amy No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny Okay, just hang on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 amy You just can’t handle her raw sexuality, can you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 bernadette When did you and Leonard break up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny Uh, about two years ago.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 bernadette Why do you think he asked you out again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny I don’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 amy Maybe he’s dying. That would be so romantic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny He’s not dying.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 amy Too bad. If he were, she could just throw him in bed and ride him right up until he flatlines.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny How about this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 bernadette Maybe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 amy Come on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny Yeah, okay, no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 bernadette Do you think you’ll sleep with him tonight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny Absolutely not. Look, we’re just gonna have dinner and, you know, see how it goes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 amy If he were dying, would you sleep with him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 amy Assuming he were dying of something that couldn’t be sexually transmitted. You know, like a spear wound to the head.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny Okay, he is not dying.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 amy How do you know? Are you a doctor?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 bernadette You can make-believe, though. Sometimes Howard and I pretend that his arrhythmia is acting up and I’m a sexy cardiologist. And the naughty part is I’m not in his HMO network.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny Screw it. I’m not gonna make a big deal out of this. It’s just dinner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 amy With a dead man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny Amy, stop it. Oh, God, I’m so nervous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 bernadette Relax. You know Leonard’s always been crazy about you. It’s gonna be great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny I know, but we’ve finally gotten to a place where we can hang out without it being weird. And what if something goes wrong? Then what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 amy Guess it’ll just be Sheldon and me going on a double date with Howard and Bernadette.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 bernadette Sure, we’d love that. Change your clothes, we got a lot riding on this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 sheldon Mm. I want to build a road, but I need wood. Do either of you fellows have wood? I don’t understand the laughter. The object of Settlers of Catan is to build roads and settlements. To do so requires wood. Now, I have sheep; I need wood. Who has wood for my sheep?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Okay, how do I look?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 howard Well, more to the point, why are you doing this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard What are you talking about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 raj Did you forget what Penny did to you? It took you two years and defiling my sister to turn that frown upside down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard I didn’t defile your sister, we had a relationship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 raj I heard you call her Brown Sugar. In my book, that’s defilement.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 sheldon You want to know my opinion?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Oh, boy, do I?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 sheldon Sarcasm?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 howard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 sheldon All right, then. The reason you’re fixated on a good-natured simpleton like Penny is that she’s the exact opposite of your first romantic attachment, your brilliant yet intimidating mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Where on earth did you get that from?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 sheldon It’s in her book, Needy Baby, Greedy Baby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard That doesn’t make it true.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 sheldon It’s called non-fiction for a reason, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard See you later.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 raj If they ever make a movie version of that book, you know who should play Leonard’s mother? Sandra Bullock.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 howard Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 raj Because she’s great in everything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 sheldon Now, where were we? Oh, yes. Does anyone have any wood? Oh, come on! I just want wood. Why are you making it so hard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard So, do they have a name for a first date with someone you used to go out with?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny Oh, that’s a good question. How about awkward?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Yeah, that sounds right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny Yeah?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Hey, how about if we pretend we’re actually on a first date? See how that goes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard So, Polly, tell me about yourself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny It’s Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Oh, sorry, yeah. Awkward.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny Okay, uh, let’s see. I’m from Nebraska, and ever since I was a little girl, I dreamed of moving to L.A. and becoming a movie star. Anyway, after four years of acting lessons and waiting tables, I’ve done a haemorrhoid commercial and a production of Anne Frank above a bowling alley. So, you know, dreams do come true. Your turn.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Uh, let’s see. Uh, I am an experimental physicist at Cal-Tech, most of my research is with high-powered lasers, and, oh, I’ve just gotten a big government grant to see if they can be used to knock out incoming ballistic missiles.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny Wow. Can they?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Oh, God, no. The money’s pretty good. And I used the equipment to make my own Bat-signal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny Bat-signal? What are you, some kind of nerd?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Not some kind of nerd, I am the king of the nerds.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny What does that mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Uh, it means if anyone displeases me, I don’t help them set up their printer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny You are so funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Good. Remember that when I take my shirt off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny Leonard, this is nice. I’m so glad we did this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Me, too. So what do you think? Are we gonna get back together?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny Whoa. Not so fast.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard I’m sorry, what did I say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny Leonard, you know I will always have feelings for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Oh, God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard You said always. You’ll always have feelings for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny So?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard So, that sounds more like something you’d say if you didn’t want a relationship with someone. This isn’t working out, but I’ll always have feelings for you. I’m sorry I slept with your best friend, but I’ll always have feelings for you. Here’s the thing, Lisa, I’m into dudes now, but I’ll always have feelings for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny How would you say it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard I have feelings for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny It’s the same thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard No, it’s not. Always made it worse.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny You’re overthinking this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard No, I’m not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny Yes, you are. You always overthink things.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Ah now th-th-there you go. Always made it worse.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny See, this is where everything goes wrong, when we talk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Well, I don’t know how you have a relationship without talking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny Hey, I went out with this guy TJ for eight months, we never talked. To this day, I don’t even know what TJ stands for.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Wait, if you guys didn’t talk, what did you… never mind, stupid question.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 sheldon And now that I have some wood, I’m going to begin the erection of my settlement.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 raj He’s got to be doing this on purpose.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 howard Ooh, eight thirty. You and Penny decide to go out and paint the town beige?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard You’re thirty years old and you live with your mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 raj I guess it didn’t go well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 sheldon We don’t know that. Not to a certainty. All we know is that Leonard is home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 howard How about now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 sheldon Again, not enough evidence. For all we know, he’s being murdered. Now, back to our game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 raj You were in the middle of an erection.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 sheldon Oh, of course. It’s right here in my hand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard What does she want from me now? What’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny Do not overthink this. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard I don’t understand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Okay, but earlier it seemed like…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny No talking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Even during? ‘Cause sometimes I have questions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny Well, that was fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Yeah, except for when I got the foot cramp.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny You hung in there, though.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Well, there was a lot at stake.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny So what do you want to do now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Well, I want to go get my asthma inhaler, but it might ruin the moment. Just, just help me out here. How does a miserable date end in sex?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny I don’t know, it’s complicated.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Well, I’m a pretty smart guy, and right now my brain has dibs on the blood supply, so give it a go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny Okay, it’s just, at the restaurant when you said you wanted us to be together again, it got very real very fast and I panicked.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Why? What are you afraid of?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny Well, what if we do go out and I do something stupid and dump you again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard What if I dump you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny Come on, be serious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Well, how about if we don’t think about this as a relationship? It could be more like a new version of software. Penny and Leonard 2.0. We can test it internally, shake out the bugs, and if we both feel it’s solid, then we’ll roll it out to the public.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny So we don’t tell people we’re back together?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Exactly. We pretend like our date went badly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny Well, we don’t really have to pretend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard And we let them think that we decided to just be friends and that everything’s cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny Okay, great. Hey, I just remembered. I still got one of your inhalers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard I can’t believe you kept this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny Yeah, I was gonna throw it away, but I just couldn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard That is so sweet. In 25 to 30 minutes I’m gonna show you how much this means to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 sheldon Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Yeah, hi, hi. How’s it going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 sheldon Uh, can’t complain. Thanks for asking. Well, what were you doing out at three o’clock in the morning?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Well, uh, uh, what are you doing up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 sheldon I was using the bathroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Yeah, well, so was I.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 sheldon Really? I didn’t see you in there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Obviously, when I saw that you were in ours, I went and used another one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 sheldon Where?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard The, the gas station across the street.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 sheldon In your pyjamas?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 sheldon Without shoes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 sheldon On a cold winter’s night?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 sheldon Seems unlikely. Did you bring your asthma inhaler?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Uh, uh, uh, yes, I did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 sheldon Well, then, I guess it’s plausible. Hang on a second, mister.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 sheldon After you used the facilities at the gas station, did you make a purchase?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 sheldon It’s customary, when using the rest room at a retail establishment, to make a small purchase. Did you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 sheldon Here’s two dollars. Go buy some beef jerky.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard I don’t want beef jerky.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 sheldon It’s not about you. It’s about a poor immigrant from Pakistan trying to make his way in America by working the graveyard shift at the Colorado Boulevard Chevron.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 sheldon Needy Baby, Greedy Baby indeed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 sheldon Leonard will be here in a moment. He’s looking for a different parking space.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 howard Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 sheldon We were next to a car with an ask me about my grandchildren bumper sticker, and I was afraid if we ran into them on the way out, I’d be obligated to do so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 bernadette I’m so disappointed it didn’t work with him and Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 amy Me, too. Out of deference to them, let’s not flaunt our happy relationship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 sheldon You have a keen insight into the human heart, Amy Farrah Fowler.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard We are next to a Suburu with a Gore/Lieberman bumper sticker.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 sheldon Well, I doubt they’d want to talk about that, so we’re fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 howard I’m surprised to see you here after it went so badly with Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Well, hey, we’re grown-ups. We can still be friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 bernadette Boy, I don’t know if I could be friends with Howie if we broke up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 howard Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 bernadette I’m a very vengeful person.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 howard Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 bernadette With access to weaponised smallpox.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny Here you go, guys, let me get you going with some water. You need menus or you know what you want?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 howard Leonard knows what he wants, but it looks like he’s not gonna get it from you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 bernadette Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny No, that’s okay, Bernadette. Sometimes these things just don’t work out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Yeah, it’s all good. We-We’ll always have feelings for each other.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 bernadette Oh, that’s nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard See, she knew what always meant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny Wow, you’re like a dog with a bone, aren’t you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard I’m just making a point.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny Is the point that you don’t know when to let something go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 sheldon People, people, please, before you say something you both regret, I’d like to place my order.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny Yeah, just hang on, Sheldon. You know why we can’t be together? Because you always have to be right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Oh, that is not true.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 sheldon I’ve got to go with Leonard on this. He is wrong more than anyone I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny You know what? I just realized I’m on a break. I’ll get someone else.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Well…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 sheldon Leonard, promise me that when our new waitress comes over, you will not start a complicated on-again, off-again relationship with her, because I am very, very hungry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Unbelievable. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny Mind explaining to me why you were being such a jerk at the restaurant?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Well, I was trying to act like we weren’t seeing each other. That was the plan, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny No, the plan was to tell people we decided to stay friends. That’s a little hard to do when you’re always being such a tool bag.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard You know what? I don’t have to stand here and take this crap. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny The hell do you think you’re going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Isn’t sex after fighting kind of what we do now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny Yeah, kind of, yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard What are we doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny What do you mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Every scenario I play out for you and me ends badly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny That’s because you overthink everything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 sheldons_voice Leonard, are you listening to me? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard What? Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 sheldon This is a disaster. I distinctly ordered the Leonard Nimoy Mr. Spock cardboard standee. Why would I feel safer with Zachary Quinto at the foot of my bed?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard I don’t know, he was pretty badass on Heroes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 sheldon You’re right, I’ll give him a shot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Hang on. Penny, do you have plans for dinner?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny Why, you guys going somewhere?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard No, I mean just you and me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 amy Ooh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 bernadette Ooh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny Uh, have you thought this through?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 leonard Yes, and I think we should go anyway.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 sheldon No, can’t do it. Sorry, Quinto, you’re going back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 amy If you and Leonard get back together, Sheldon and I will finally have someone to go on double dates with.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 bernadette What about me and Howard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 amy Fine, we can double with you, too. So insecure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 bernadette Where are you guys going to eat?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 amy Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 minister Do you, Penny, take Leonard to be your lawful wedded husband?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny Well, it’s a little late for me to start saying no, isn’t it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 amy Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode13 penny Sorry, just remembered I’ve got to stop by the drugstore.
