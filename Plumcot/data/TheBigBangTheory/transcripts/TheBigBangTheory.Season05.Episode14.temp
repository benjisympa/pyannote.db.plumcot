TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 sheldon Hello. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to the premiere episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Over the next 52 weeks, you and I are going to explore the dynamic world of vexillology.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 amy Hang on, Dr. C. What’s vexillology?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 sheldon Vexillology is the study of flags.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 amy Cool. I think I just learned something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 sheldon Did you have fun doing it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 amy I’ll say.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 sheldon Fun and information are two sides to this video podcast, not unlike the only two-sided state flag, Oregon. Oh, look. Hello, Mr. Beaver. In future episodes, we’ll answer some burning questions. What’s the only non-rectangular flag? What animal appears most often on flags? What animal appears second most often on flags? And more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 amy Sweet!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 sheldon Why are you waving a white flag?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 amy I’m surrendering to fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 leonard Excuse me, sorry, excuse me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 sheldon Cut. Did you not see we are rolling?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 leonard Sorry. I’m having dinner with Penny. I have to get out of here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 sheldon And I have flag knowledge that I have to get out of here!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 amy You okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 sheldon No, I’m a little rattled. But like the flag over Fort Sumter, I’m still here. And, take two. Hello. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to the premiere episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Over the next 52 weeks, you and I are going to explore the dynamic world of vexillology.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 amy Hang on, Dr. Cooper. What’s vexillology?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 sheldon Vexillology is… why is there a face on that flag?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 amy It’s Ferdinand T. Flag. I thought he might help bring in some younger viewers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 sheldon Confound it! You’re right, it’s brilliant. Let’s take it from the top.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 penny That was a really nice dinner. I’m glad you asked me out again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 leonard Me, too, I missed you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 penny You see me all the time. You sure you just don’t miss the sex?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 leonard Well, yeah, sex with you is pretty great. Have you ever tried it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 penny I have. You are not wrong. I just think if we’re gonna try dating again, we should take things slow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 leonard Oh, I can take it slow. Did I ever tell you about my first girlfriend in high school, Karen Berberick? To this day she doesn’t know we were going out. Made it easier on her when I broke things off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 penny Okay, well, maybe not that slow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 leonard How about this, are you familiar with the typical development for computer software?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 penny You know, just for fun, let’s say I’m not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 leonard Before an application is released, they give it a trial run. W-We could do that. And if we hit a rough spot, instead of getting mad, just say, hey, we found a bug, and we report it so it can be fixed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 penny You mean like a beta test?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 leonard Well, technically, this would be an alpha test. A beta test requires people that weren’t involved in the development of the appli…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 penny Seriously, do I not get credit for knowing beta test?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 leonard No, you should. Absolutely. That was me being pedantic. That’s our first bug. You reported it. I can fix that. See? This is good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 penny All right. Let’s give it a shot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 leonard Great. You keep a list, I’ll keep a list. At some point, we’ll exchange.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 penny Okay. Good night, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 leonard Night. Attaboy, Hofstadter. Nothing gets the ladies hotter than software development analogies. Hey, I’m back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 sheldon Cut! Take 47.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 sheldon Here’s an interesting fact about flags.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 raj I will take that action.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 sheldon The flags of Liechtenstein and Haiti were identical by coincidence, a fact that wasn’t discovered until they competed against each other at the 1936 Olympics. And thankfully, their embarrassment was overshadowed by the rise of Fascism.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 howard Let’s see the new phone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 raj I stopped on the way to work. Hey, do you want to peel the plastic off with me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 howard Really? Me? That’s, like, the best part.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 raj Grab a corner. Whoa, what’s your hurry, cowboy? Savour the moment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 howard Oh, yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 sheldon Speaking of cowboys, do you know what country has not one but two cows on its flag? The tiny landlocked nation of Andorra. Oh, the next classic episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags is writing itself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 howard Oh, let me try the voice recognition.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 raj Hey, I let you peel the plastic, don’t get greedy. Hello?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 phone Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 raj What’s your name?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 phone My name is Siri.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 howard Look at that. There’s finally a woman in your life you can talk to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 raj Are you single?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 siri I don’t have a marital status, if that’s what you’re asking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 raj Yeah, you’re right, that’s too personal. We hardly know each other. How about a cup of coffee?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 siri I’ve found six coffee shops. Three of them are fairly close to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 raj I will see you gentlemen later.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 howard She is gonna break his heart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 amy For someone who has a machine that can travel anywhere in time and space, Doctor Who sure does have a thing for modern-day London.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 sheldon Careful, it’s that kind of sass that can get a person uninvited to this year’s Who Con.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 penny Uh, we’re not counting this as a date, are we?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 leonard Um, I’m not sure, but I think the right answer here is no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 leonard Even Doctor Who?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 penny Even Doctor Who.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 sheldon All right, that’s it. Who Con, you’re out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 leonard Okay, bug report taken. Next time I will have a better plan for our evening’s activity.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 penny Well, thank you. I’ll see you tomorrow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 leonard Oh, wait, here, almost forgot. Here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 penny What’s this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 leonard My bug report to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 penny Well, that’s quite a list you got there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 leonard It’s colour coded.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 penny Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 leonard Uh, red means fix right away. Yellow is eh, whenever you get a chance. And green is I could probably learn to live with it. There’s a key down here at the bottom. It’s neat, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 penny Yep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 leonard So, have a good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 penny Yep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 leonard Look at that. Some day, we will tell future generations that dating used to be hard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 amy What’s baffling me is what you could’ve possibly put on the list. Hair too golden? Laugh too musical? World too much a better place for her mere presence in it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 sheldon How about constantly talks with food in her mouth?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 amy Her heart’s full of love, no one cares what’s in her mouth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 raj So, Siri, what’s happening? How are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 siri I am well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 raj What are you doing right now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 siri What am I doing? I’m talking with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 raj You have a beautiful voice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 siri Thank you, it’s nice to be appreciated.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 raj I bet it is. Why don’t women like me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 siri Let me check on that. How about a Web search for why don’t women like me?”
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 raj No need. I’ve already done that. Siri, do you have a last name?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 siri My name is Siri.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 raj Ah, one name. Like, uh, Cher, Madonna, Adele. All the women who rock me. My name is Rajesh, but you can call me Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 siri Would you like me to call you Raj?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 raj I’d like you to call me sexy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 siri From now on, I’ll call you sexy. Okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 raj Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 siri I found ten restaurants whose reviews mention gelato. Seven of them are fairly close to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 raj Thank you, darling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 siri You are most certainly welcome, sexy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 sheldon Well done, Dr. Koothrappali.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 raj I’m sorry?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 sheldon You’ve taken a great evolutionary leap by abandoning human interaction and allowing yourself to romantically bond with a soulless machine. Kudos.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 raj I haven’t bonded with it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 sheldon Oh, no, of course. I understand. You’re afraid the world isn’t ready for your taboo love. Your secret’s safe with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 raj It’s just a phone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 barry_kripke Cooper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 sheldon Kripke.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 barry Heads up. Pwofessor Wothman urinated in the particle physics wab again, so we’re going to move up his wetirement party. Fwiday, five o’cwock, pot wuck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 raj Thanks, Barry. Siri, remind me Friday morning to make my famous popovers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 siri All right, I’ll remind you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 barry You got Siwi, huh? Voice wecognition on that thing is tewible. Wook. Siwi, can you wecommend a westauwant?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 barrys_siri I’m sorry, Bawwy. I don’t understand wecommend a westauwant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 barry Wisten to me. Not westauwant, westauwant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 barrys_siri I don’t know what you mean by not westauwant, westauwant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 barry See? Total cwap. You suck, Siwi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 raj Hey, don’t talk to her like that. She’s a lady.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 barry Well, that wady took high-wes pictures of my junk wast night for Cwaigswist. Waiter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 penny It’s open.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 leonard Hey. You ready to go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 penny Yeah, hang on. Let me just finish this chapter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 leonard Can you finish it later?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 penny No, I can’t. Reading books is a big part of my life now because, you know, we’d have more fun things to talk about if I read more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 leonard Great. Good. Great. What are you reading?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 penny Two Weeks to Rock Hard Abs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 leonard They kind of spoil the ending right in the name of that, don’t they? All right. Look, just remember how this works. We don’t get mad about these things. Uh, speaking of which, I’ve addressed your bug report on my date planning. Got a really fun evening for you. It’s kind of a surprise.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 penny All right. Terrific. Well, let me just go find a pair of shoes that aren’t so tall. We wouldn’t want you to feel like you were out for a walk with your mommy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 leonard Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 penny Yeah. Oh. Here’s my list for you, right there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 leonard All right, fair enough. I certainly can be quieter when we kiss. I thought it was an expression of passion, but if it’s coming across as juicy and weird, who wants that? Uh, uh, I’m sorry, can you be more specific on how my eyebrows are stupid? Nah, never mind, it’s right here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 raj Good timing. Dinner’s almost ready.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 howard Great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 bernadette Oh, smells amazing in here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 howard Yeah, what are we eating?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 raj Oh, an exotic little treat. I was just talking to Siri about Peking duck, and she said she knew about four Chinese grocers, two of which were fairly close to me. Her spontaneity is contagious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 bernadette Who’s Siri? Is he dating somebody new?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 howard Yes. His phone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 bernadette Oh. Is that cute or creepy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 howard Uh-huh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 raj Can I pour you some wine? I think you’ll enjoy it. The traditional choice with Peking duck is a Sauvignon Blanc, but Siri suggested an off-dry Riesling. I wasn’t sure, but I didn’t want to have an argument with her in the middle of Trader Joe’s. Now, what should we put Siri in for dinner? Leopard, sparkles, or to paraphrase Coco Chanel, you can never go wrong with a little black case. Siri, play some smooth jazz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 siri Playing smooth jazz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 raj Oh, my God, Kenny G? This woman can read me like a book. I can’t believe I bought my soul mate at Glendale Galleria.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 bernadette I don’t know if I want to stay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 penny This is amazing. How did you even get this idea?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 leonard I called your dad. I asked him what things you liked to do when you were a kid. This seemed easier than getting a cow out here so you could tip it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 penny Okay, you’re kind of really great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 leonard You mean for a person whose neck massages feel like an eagle is trying to carry you to its nest?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 penny Okay, bug report. I just complimented you. You should take it and shut up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 leonard Right. Sorry, sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 penny And stop apologizing all the time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 leonard Right. Sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 penny All right, let’s shoot stuff. You want me to show you what to do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 leonard I play a lot of Grand Theft Auto. I think I know how to handle a gat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 penny Wow. You are cute when you get all gangsta. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 leonard So, I’ve got a gunshot wound. That’s pretty badass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 penny No, you’ve got a Reebok with a gunshot wound and an ouchie on your pinkie toe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 leonard Hello? They gave me a Band-Aid. Hospitals do not issue Band-Aids unless it is medically necessary. That is the law.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 penny Well, thank you for a really cool evening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 leonard Thank you for hiding my Star Wars socks at the emergency room. Is it a good time to evaluate the beta test and see where we stand?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 penny Things are looking good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 leonard So, are we still taking things slow? Because a gunshot wound today, last week, I slammed my thumb in the kitchen drawer. We don’t know how much time I have.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 penny Good night, you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 sheldon Guten Tag, das YouTube. Ich bin ein Bavarian.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 amy Und ich bin eine pretzel!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 sheldon Und dis is Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 amy Mit…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 sheldon Flags.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 receptionist First door on the left.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 raj Thank you. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 siri Dave, I found six vacuum cleaner repair shops in your area. Four are fairly close to you. Hello, sexy. What can I help you with? If you’d like to make love to me, just tell me. I’m sorry. I don’t understand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode14 raj No!
