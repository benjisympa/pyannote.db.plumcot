TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard Aaargh. What the hell?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon Emergency preparedness drill.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard Oh, no, come on!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon Yeah, you know how it works. Once a quarter, keep our readiness up. Now, rise and shine, sleepy head. Half the town is probably dead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard I have to get a lock for my door.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon I think you’ll like the drill tonight. I’ve tried to make it fun. Each of these cards contains a detailed scenario of a possible apocalyptic event. Everything from wild fires to a surprise invasion by Canada. Pick a catastrophe, any catastrophe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard Sheldon, Canada is not going to invade California.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon Yeah, really? You think those hippies in Washington and Oregon can stop them?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard Fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon All righty! An 8.2 magnitude earthquake devastates Pasadena, reducing mighty edifices to dust, engulfing the city in flames. The streets flow with blood and echo with the cries of the wounded. Oh, excellent choice. Now, put on your hard hat and safety vest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard Oh, fun. I get to spend another night in front of our apartment dressed like one of the Village People.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon You make that joke every three months. I still don’t get it. Leonard, wait. What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard I don’t know, what am I doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon Look around you, there’s hypothetical broken glass everywhere. Really? You’re going to face Armageddon without your orthotics? All right, your choice. Uh-oh, hypothetical aftershock!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard Aah!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon And that’s why we wear hard hats.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 howard Check it out, press release from NASA.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 raj Um, Expedition 31 will launch this spring to the International Space Station. Crew members will include Commander Tom ‘Tombo’ Johnson, astronaut Mike ‘Supernova’ Novacelik and Payload Specialist Howard Wolowitz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 howard This is going right into my synagogue’s newsletter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 raj Dude, if you’re going to be an astronaut, you need to pick a cool nickname.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 howard I don’t get to pick it. The other guys have to give it to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 raj Oh. If I had one, it would be Brown Dynamite.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 howard Are you not listening to me? The other astronauts have to give you your nickname.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 raj Are you not looking at me? I am Brown Dynamite. Why do you put six sugars in your coffee?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard Because the cafeteria doesn’t offer little packets of methamphetamine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 howard Emergency drill night last night, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard Uh-huh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 raj How’d you do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard You know what, I’m so tired I can’t even think straight. I’m going home. Will one of you guys give this nutbag a ride back later?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon You can’t go home. You have to take me to the dentist at four o’clock.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard Oh, can’t you take the bus to the dentist?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon Of course I can. It’s coming back under the residual effects of the anaesthesia, that’s the problem. Two years ago after a deep gum cleaning, I thought I got on a bus but somehow wound up on a booze cruise to Mexico.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 raj They put you under for a cleaning?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon Yeah, they have to, I’m a biter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard Whatever, Sheldon. I’m exhausted. I’m not taking you to the dentist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon Wrong, sir. Wrong. Under section 37B of the roommate agreement, miscellaneous duties, you are obligated to take me to the dentist. See? It’s right here after providing a confirmation sniff on questionable dairy products.”
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard You know what, I am sick of the roommate agreement. It’s ridiculous. I’m your roommate, not your chauffeur. You know, I had better things to do yesterday than drive you all the way to the good model train store in Garden Grove because the one in Pasadena has gotten too big for its britches.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon Well, it has. Ask anybody.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard I don’t care. I’m done.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon Hold on. Are you saying that you want to invoke Clause 209?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard I don’t know what that is, but if it means I can go home and sleep, then yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon Think carefully here. Clause 209 suspends our friendship, and strips down the roommate agreement to its bare essentials. Our responsibilities toward each other would only be rent, utilities and a perfunctory chin jut of recognition as we pass in the hall. ‘Sup?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard Where do I sign?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon Right here. Use your finger.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard There. Done.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon All right. That’s it. We are now no longer companions, boon or otherwise. We are now merely acquaintances. To amend the words of Toy Story, you have not got a friend in me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard I’m gonna go home and take a nap.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon Yeah, well, tell it to someone who cares.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 howard I got pretty exciting NASA news today. Next week I fly to Houston for orientation and zero-gravity elimination drills.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 penny What does that mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 bernadette He’s gonna learn to poop in space.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 howard Open the pod bay doors, HAL.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 raj Maybe your nickname should be Brown Dynamite.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon Hello, dear friends. And Dr. Hofstadter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard ‘Sup?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon ‘Sup? My apologies. I would’ve been here sooner, but the bus kept stopping for other people to get on it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 amy I saved you a dumpling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon Oh, your concern for me is touching. It will serve you well when you take me to the dentist tomorrow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 amy I’m sorry, Sheldon, I’m busy. I’m right in the middle of my addiction study. I’ve got a lab full of alcoholic monkeys, and tomorrow’s the day we switch them to O’Doul’s.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon You’re my girlfriend and you’re not going to cater to my every need? Oh, where’d the magic go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 penny Sheldon, that’s not what girlfriends are for. Although, you don’t use them for what they’re for, so what do I know?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 bernadette Howard doesn’t make me do his shopping, or take him to the dentist, or pick up his dry cleaning, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 howard Absolutely. But when Ma’s hips give out, you’re up, kid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon Well, if Amy’s too busy, that gives the rest of you an opportunity to make my life easier, thus assuring yourselves a footnote in my memoirs, tentatively entitled You’re Welcome, Mankind. All right, then, just shout when you hear the task you want to undertake. Uh, dentist. Okay, we can circle back to that one. Um, well, who wants to take me Wednesday morning to get new heels put on my dress shoes? Anyone? Oh. That one had hoot written all over it. Um, all right, uh, dermatologist? Allergist? Podiatrist? Supercuts? Okay, okay, here’s a fun one. Um, I need a new picture frame and I have a hankering for Swedish meatballs. Who wants to spend the day with me at IKEA?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 raj Their meatballs are pretty good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon What’s that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 raj Nothing, nothing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon Hello, Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 stuart Oh, hey, Sheldon. Can I help you find something today?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon No, no. I was just sitting at home thinking about how it might be nice to catch up with my ninth favourite person.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 stuart Ninth?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon You moved up one. My pen pal in Somalia was kidnapped by pirates. So, uh, how are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 stuart Uh, not so good. My shrink just killed himself and blamed me in the note.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon Great. Great. So, what’s new with your family? How’s your mother? Is she alive?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 stuart Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon And your father? Alive?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 stuart Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon How about your grandparents, they alive?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 stuart No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon Oh, I’m so sorry for your loss. On a cheerier note, I have a teeth-cleaning appointment this afternoon. What do you say you take me over there, buddy boy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 stuart I’m sorry, you want me to take you to the dentist?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon Yes. And now, I can’t make any promises, but that’s the sort of thing that gets a fella on the short list for the number eight friend slot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 stuart Sheldon, I’m working. I can’t take you to the dentist. Also, and I can’t stress this enough, I don’t want to take you to the dentist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon Can’t help a friend out in a time of need, huh? I see where your therapist was coming from.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 raj Ooh, ooh! What about we make your astronaut nickname Howard “Buzz” Wolowitz?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 howard You can’t do Buzz. Buzz is taken.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 raj Buzz Lightyear is not real.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 howard No, that’s not what I’m talking about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 raj Well, are you talking about when he thought he was real?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 howard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 raj Okay, um, how about Crash”? Howard “Crash” Wolowitz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 howard Yeah, terrific. The other astronauts would love to go hurtling through space with a guy named Crash.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 raj All right, um, how about, oh, how about Rocket Man?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard That’s not bad, Howard “Rocket Man” Wolowitz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 howard Yeah, it’s great, but I told you, I don’t get to pick my nickname. It has to come from the other astronauts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 raj Maybe there’s a way to get them to come up with it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 howard Like how?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard Once I tried carrying around a Duncan yo-yo, hoping the other kids would start calling me Duncan.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 howard Did it work?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard No, they ended up calling me Sock Mouth. Because they took away my yo-yo and stuffed their socks in my mouth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 raj Okay, uh, what if we make Rocket Man your ringtone, and the next time you talk to those guys, I’ll call you and they’ll hear it. Plant the seed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 howard That’s actually not a terrible plan.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 raj They don’t call me Brown Dynamite for nothing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard ‘Sup?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon ‘Sup?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard Hey, did you ever make it to the dentist?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon Not necessary. No. I found a service that’ll send a van to your house for a teeth cleaning. Mostly they cater to dogs, but the fellow on the phone seemed to have an open mind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard All right, Sheldon, if you need me to take you to the dentist, I will take you to the dentist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon Are you suggesting that you’ve come to your senses and wish to re-establish the mutual benefits that stem from full participation in the roommate agreement?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard Absolutely. If you admit that you’re a 30-year-old man who’s incapable of functioning on his own.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 raj Ooh, Sock Mouth’s got him on the ropes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon I will admit nothing of the sort. And now if you’ll excuse me, I have to call my dentist and see if I can also get my hair shampooed and my nails clipped.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 penny Oh, good, your power’s out, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard Why is that good?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 penny Because last month, I sent the electric company a Starbucks gift card, an apology note, and a few snapshots of me in a bra.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon Power failure. Implementing power-failure protocol.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard What happened to all your glow-in-the-dark-emergency-exit stuff you had painted on the floor?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon Oh, that was wildly carcinogenic. Anyway, it’s too bad you’re no longer entitled to the full benefits of my friendship, because I happen to be extremely prepared for such an emergency. Please try not to see anything by this light. It’s not for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard It’s just a blackout, I’m sure the power will be back on soon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon And I’m sure some fool in the Donner party said the snow would stop any day now. I like to think they ate him first.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 penny You know, I got some candles in my apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon But candles? During a blackout? Are you mad? That’s a fire hazard. No, Pasadena Water and Power recommends the far safer glow stick.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard You call that a glow stick? That is a glow stick. Come on, let’s go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon Before you go, consider this. Not only do I have a deep-cycle marine battery power source which is more than capable of running our entertainment system, I also have all 61 episodes of the BBC series Red Dwarf and Fiddle-Faddle. All yours if you’re willing to reinstate the roommate agreement.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 penny I’ve got wine at my place and some bubble wrap we could pop.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon Oh, he’ll be back. Wine and a girl in the dark, he’s gonna be bored out of his mind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard To wine and bubble wrap. And to not having to watch Sheldon demonstrate his reverse osmosis machine that converts urine into drinking water.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 penny You know, in Girl Scouts, Tammie Dinisha said you could do that with panty hose. Boy, was she wrong. Anyway, you want to make out?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard I thought because our relationship’s in a beta test, you wanted to take things slow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 penny Okay. Do you want to make out slow?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard I can go so slow it’ll be like there’s a snail in your mouth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 penny Ugh. Well, lucky for you, there’s nothing else to do right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon Excuse me, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard Since when don’t you knock? It’s like the only good thing about you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon Social niceties have been suspended, Leonard. We’re in a state of a emergency. The world has descended into darkened turmoil. Lawlessness and savagery are the order of the day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard Fine, what is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon I’m making s’mores. I wanted to alert you in case you smelled caramelizing marshmallows and thought a nearby candy factory was on fire.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard S’mores, huh? Good for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon Yes, or good for us if you sign here and reinstate the full roommate agreement.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard No, thanks. I’m good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon Really? Huh! Okay. In that case, I will have a s’more by myself. And then I’m gonna have s’more. By myself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 penny Aw.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard No, don’t aw him. He brought this all on himself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 penny But he’s sad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard No, he’s crazy. Sometimes crazy looks like sad so it’ll suck you back in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 penny I think he misses his little buddy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard Fine. But mark my words, this frustrating, bogus teenage make-out session is not over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard I thought you said candles were dangerous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon This is a Bunsen burner. I’m a scientist, I know what I’m doing. Oh, drat. Aw. It took me a gallon of urine to make that water.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard Listen, Sheldon, this is stupid. I don’t see why we can’t be friends. And I’m willing to drive you around and help you out with stuff. I just don’t want to do it because of some silly roommate agreement.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon What are you proposing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard That we go back to the way things were. But when I do something for you, you show a little appreciation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon And how would I do that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard You say thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon Every time?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard It’s not crazy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon Counter-proposal. We reinstate the full roommate agreement with the following addendum, in the spirit of Mother’s Day or Father’s Day, once a year, we set aside day to celebrate all your contributions to my life, both actual and imagined by you. We could call it Leonard’s Day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard I kind of like the sound of that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon Of course you do. It’s about you, like everything else. Oh, thank goodness. I don’t think I had it in me to make another glass of water.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard So, do I get breakfast in bed on Leonard’s Day?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard Can I sit in your spot?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard Can I control the thermostat?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard Do I get a card?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon Of course you get a card. It’s Leonard’s Day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 penny Hey, guys, the building manager said the reason the power went out is someone went down into the basement and just pulled the main breaker switch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 leonard Really. Who do you think did that, Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon Oh, I don’t know. But whoever that mystery man was, you should be eternally grateful, for without him, there would be no Leonard’s Day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 penny Leonard’s Day?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 sheldon Oh, no pressure. Just get him a crummy card, you’re good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 howard All right, test my ring tone. That really is a good song.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 raj Oh, yeah. There’s a reason he’s Sir Elton John. They don’t make you a knight for writing Wake Me Up Before You Go Go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 mrs_wolowitz Howard, are you coming down for breakfast?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 howard Ma, I told you I have a video conference with NASA. I said don’t bother me!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 mrs_wolowitz Oh! Listen to Mr. Big Shot Astronaut.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 howard Yes, please listen to Mr. Big Shot Astronaut. Hey, good morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 nasa_guy Hey, Howard, thanks for getting up so early.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 howard No problem, Dr. Massimino.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 dr_massimino The guys here call me Mass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 howard Mass. That’s a cool nickname. ‘Cause force equals mass times acceleration.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 mass Yeah. It’s just short for Massimino. Anyway, the plan for this morning is to go over the…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 howard Sorry. My phone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 mass What is that? Is that Rocket Man?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 howard Yeah, my ring tone. Kind of my favourite song, Rocket Man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 mrs_wolowitz Howard, your Fruit Loops are getting soggy!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 howard Not now!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 mass Who’s that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 howard My mom. Sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode15 howard No problem, Fruit Loops.
