TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Gentlemen, I think I’ve come up with a fun way to get young people interested in science. Physics Mad-Libs. Now, give me a number.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Five.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Uh-huh. And an irrational constant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 howard_wolowitz E.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper And a funny Greek letter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 raj_koothrappali Gamma.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper I said funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 raj_koothrappali Upsilon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Good one. And an electrical charge.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Positive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Ha. Perfect. Okay. Get this. Professor Jones told the symposium he had a new method for calculating the mass of a muon. Five times the limit of E to the upsilon as in a . Okay. No, no. I’ll start over. Professor
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 howard_wolowitz I haven’t seen him laugh that hard since the day Leonard made that multiplication error.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Oh, Oh, Lord, that multiplication error! He thought he carried the one. But he didn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter It’s not funny. That mistake got published.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Stop! I’m going to wet myself!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 raj_koothrappali Hey, guys, guys, President Siebert is headed this way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 howard_wolowitz I wonder what he wants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Doesn’t look happy, so I’m guessing he wants to talk to Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 president_siebert Dr. Cooper?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Told ya.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Oh, President Siebert, I assume you’d like to respond to one of the suggestions I put in the box by your office.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 president_siebert No, and stop installing suggestion boxes everywhere.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper You don’t like written suggestions. You don’t like when I give them to you while we’re urinating in the men’s room. If I didn’t know any better, I’d say that you’re one of those stubborn people who are not open to suggestions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 president_siebert Dr. Cooper, the physics department chair tells me you’re refusing to take your vacation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper I don’t need a vacation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 president_siebert You’re obligated to take one. And I’d also like you to know the most-often received suggestion in my suggestion box you installed without asking me is can Dr. Cooper take a vacation? Okay, settled, then. I’ll see you all on Monday, except for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper But if I don’t come into work, what am I supposed to do with myself?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 president_siebert Read, rest, travel. I hear Afghanistan is nice this time of year.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Sarcasm?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 howard_wolowitz No. You should go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter That tonight’s gonna be a good night, and tonight’s gonna be a good night, and tonight’s gonna be a good, good night! Tonight’s the night, uh, uh, let’s live it up, uh, I got my money, let’s spend it up…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Good Lord! Would you stop that caterwauling!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter What the hell are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Bleeding from my ears.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter What are you doing hiding back there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper I’m sneaking into work. Now, if the guard at the university asks what’s under the blanket, you tell him it’s some lobster traps.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Lobster traps?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Yes. That’s how Velma and Scooby smuggled Shaggy into the old lighthouse.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter What are you going to do when you get to the university? People are going to recognize you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Will they, Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Fine. Just get back under your blanket, and I’ll drive you there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper And no more singing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper I have GPS on my phone. I know you turned around.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 penny I’m so glad you talked Howard out of having your wedding invitations in Klingon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski Turn it over. I’m hoping my relatives think it’s Hebrew.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler This is really happening. I’m gonna be a maid of honour. I’m gonna wear a beautiful dress and walk down that aisle and, finally, I will have my special day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski You mean my special day?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler They’re gonna need an extra-large veil for somebody’s head.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski If I ever actually ever get married.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 penny Why wouldn’t you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski My dad. Because I make a lot more money than Howie, he’s putting a lot of pressure on me to get a pre-nup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 penny Ouch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah. Howie’s gonna freak out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler Parental pressure can be daunting. I remember the battle with my mother about shaving my legs. Last year, I finally gave in and let her do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski I just don’t know how I’m gonna break it to him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 penny You know, I’m a big believer in breaking bad news to a guy when you’re in bed with him. That’s how I told my high school boyfriend I slept with his brother. That’s how I told his brother the same thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t know, I don’t want to manipulate him with sex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 penny Oh, sweetie, that’s what sex is for.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler You know, the connection between marriage and money is nothing new. In fact, the term wed referred to the money and livestock that the groom paid the bride’s father. For example, you’re adorable, intelligent and a good earner. I could conservatively see you going for at least two oxen and a goose. You would fetch a unicorn.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, there are a million great vacations you could take. What about Hawaii?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Hawaii is a former leper colony on top of an active volcano where the disappointing ending to Lost was filmed. Mahalo for nothing, Hawaii.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 howard_wolowitz How about Florida? They’ve got Cape Canaveral, they’ve got Disney, they’ve got my Aunt Ida and the world’s largest collection of diabetic candy. Plus, if you get sweaty enough, her plastic-covered furniture is like a flume ride.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper My family took a trip to Florida when I was a child. A seagull stole a hot dog from me on the beach. I got the message.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 raj_koothrappali You know, if I had a week off, I’d go back to the Two Bunch Palms Resort and Spa in the desert. I tell you, an hour on the massage table with Trevor, and you’ll feel like you were born without bones.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 howard_wolowitz I don’t think I could ever let a guy give me a massage.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 raj_koothrappali Really? What was I doing to your neck last night while you were playing X-Box?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper It’s like I’m living in a dictatorship. You must take a vacation, you must have fun, you must enjoy life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 howard_wolowitz I don’t think you have a good handle on dictatorships.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, everybody takes vacations.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper One time they tried to make Richard Feynman take a vacation, but he chose instead to expand his mind and learn something new. He went to work in his friend’s biology lab. Richard Feynman was a famous American physicist, part of the Manhattan Project.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Everyone in the world of science knows who Richard Feynman was.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Now you do, too. Oh! I have a brilliant idea. Amy’s a biologist. I’ll go work in her lab.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Isn’t that just Feynman’s idea?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Ten seconds ago, you never heard of him. Now you’re an expert.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 penny Hey, you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Is that your laundry? You only have, like, six things in there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 penny Yeah, I didn’t have any quarters, so I’ve been sneaking stuff into other people’s loads all day. Hey, if I tell you something, will you promise not to tell anybody?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter It doesn’t matter what I say, you’re gonna tell me anyway.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 penny What? That is not true. Bernadette wants a pre-nup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Wow. That’s rough.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 penny So you’re saying if I became a famous movie star, we got married, you wouldn’t sign a pre-nup?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Absolutely not. If I’m gonna be stuck at home with the kids while you’re on location cheating on me with Ryan Gosling, then Leonard gots to get paid. So, you think about us getting married?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 penny I think about a lot of things. I think about us getting married, I think about us breaking up. Once in a while, I think about how I didn’t leave a note on that Mercedes I dinged in the parking lot last month, but then I have a glass of wine and it passes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Joke all you want, but you think about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 penny Well, tell you one thing, if I ever do get married, no Klingon invitations.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Good luck catching a man with that attitude.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Boy, oh, boy. This vacation is off to a wonderful start. The smell of formaldehyde, the whir of the centrifuge, the distant chatter of lab animals being dispatched for dissection. Mm, I can already feel my cares just melting away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler I’m excited to work with my boyfriend. It’s gonna be romantic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Way to kill the mood.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler Come on, Sheldon. We can be like Marie Curie and her husband, Pierre, who spent their days working side by side, bathed in the glow of their love and the radium that ultimately killed her. Screw Beauty and the Beast, that’s the love story Disney should tell.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Okay, what do we start with? Maybe splicing some genes, clone a sheep, perhaps grow a human ear on a mouse’s back? Ha-ha, I’m a freak!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, I’m gonna be doing some brain stem histology while you put yourself on the business end of a sponge and wash those beakers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Wash those bea… Oh, I get it, a little hazing for the new fella. Yeah, I’d better keep and eye out for, what, shoe polish on the microscope, or mad cow disease in my grilled cheese sandwich?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler No, I just need those beakers washed. Hippity-hop, quick like a bunny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper What? Excuse me, you have Dr. Sheldon Cooper in your lab. You’re gonna make him do the dishes? That’s like asking the Incredible Hulk to open a pickle jar.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, you’ve never worked in a lab like this before. You have no experience in the field of biology.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper I have plenty of experience in biology. I bought a Tamagotchi in 1998. And it’s still alive. Let’s do this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Where’s Howard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 raj_koothrappali No hi, Raj? No how are you, Raj? Just straight to where’s the other white guy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter I’m sorry. So, listen, I heard something about him. Can you keep it between us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 raj_koothrappali Ooh, gossip. When I first got here, I thought you Americans really gossiped around the water cooler. So I hung out there for, like, a month, but the only gossip I ever heard was about some creepy guy hanging out by the water cooler.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Bernadette wants to get a pre-nup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 raj_koothrappali Oh, that’s a shame, he’s gonna be devastated.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter I never know what to do in these situations. Should I give him a heads-up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 raj_koothrappali Hmm. I’m gonna give you the same advice I yell at the TV when the Bachelor’s handing out roses. Follow your heart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Check it out. Look at the size of that Rice Krispie Treat. Same price.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Hey, Howard, I need to tell you something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 howard_wolowitz I know, it’s not on my wedding diet. I don’t care.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Uh, listen, I heard that Bernadette’s thinking about asking you for a pre-nup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 howard_wolowitz A pre-nup? Wow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter What are you gonna do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 howard_wolowitz I don’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 raj_koothrappali Follow your heart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 howard_wolowitz You know what, it’s not a big deal. She makes more money than me. She wants to protect her financial interests. It’s completely reasonable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Yeah, actually, it’s good for both of us. I have assets to protect, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 raj_koothrappali Like what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 howard_wolowitz I’ve got some rare comic books. The Vespa’s almost paid off. And Ma and I have a primo double cemetery plot at Mt. Sinai right near the guy who played Mr. Roper on Three’s Company.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 raj_koothrappali Mr. Roper’s dead? You can’t just spring that on a guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Here you go. This is now the only lab with glassware washed by a man with two doctorates and a restraining order signed by Carl Sagan.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler Soap spots. Wash ’em again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Y-you’re being ridiculous. Those are perfectly clean.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, this beaker used to contain cerebral spinal fluid from an elephant that died of syphilis. If it’s, in fact, perfectly clean, drink from it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Biologists are mean.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler All right, perhaps this task will be a little bit more up your alley. I need you to count the bacteria spores on these petri dishes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper There was something wrong with that detergent. That was way too bubbly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler I’m sure it was.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper I intend to write that soap company a strongly worded letter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler Yeah, good for you. Now, start counting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper You know what this place needs? A suggestion box.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper 366… 367…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler How’s it going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper How’s counting going? When I was in kindergarten, I recited pi to a thousand places for the school talent show. I think I got this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler Great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Aw, nuts! One…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper This is preposterous. I think you’re giving me these tasks because you’re afraid if you give me anything meaningful to do, I’ll show you up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler Really? Is that what you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Yes, that’s what I think. And I’m super smart, so it’s probably true.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler Hey, I’ve been training in the field of neurobiology for 12 years. You’ve been here for three hours, and you’ve spent one of them in the bathroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper I’m sorry. It takes me a while to get things going on an unfamiliar toilet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, I’ve given you the simplest things to do, and you haven’t done one of them right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Maybe that’s because I’m not being challenged. It’s the same reason Einstein failed math.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler Maybe the math was too bubbly for him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper You think you’re doing science by cutting up that brain? They could do the same thing at any Quiznos. And they’d offer to toast it for me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler Okay, smart guy. I’m about to remove the locus coeruleus, which is incredibly delicate work. Have at it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper All right. I’m no stranger to a little gray matter. Locus coeruleus. Locus coeruleus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler You’re getting warmer, it is, indeed, in the brain. Hope your hands are steady. It’s the width of a single hair. But this is just biology, so I’m sure it’s no problem for a genius like you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper It’s not. I’ll have you know, in the field of physics, we work with particles so small, they make fat jokes about the locus coeruleus, i.e., when your locus coeruleus sits around the house, it sits around the house.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, are we nervous, Dr. Cooper?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper No. What you see is a man trembling with confidence. Does a locus coeruleus normally bleed that much?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler No. But your thumb does.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Oh, dear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler Yeah, you’re a biologist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 howard_wolowitz What are you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper I’m on vacation. Social convention dictates that I let my hair down at a local watering hole. Social convention is stupid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 howard_wolowitz What happened to your thumb?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper You know, I have ten fingers and ten toes. If I tell you a story about each one of them, we’ll be here all day, let’s just move on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 barman#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 What can I get you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Ah, seeing as I’m on vacation, a pina colada seems appropriate. Extra pineapple slices, extra whipped cream, extra cherries, extra umbrellas, and, uh, hold the rum. Don’t let me have too many of those.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 penny Hey, what are you guys doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 howard_wolowitz We’re grown men, we drink at bars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 penny No and no. Everything okay with you and Bernadette?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Oh, yeah, sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 penny You and Amy? Good?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Oh, better than good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 penny You know those girls text me every detail of their lives as it happens.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 howard_wolowitz I’m not signing a pre-nup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 penny All right, Howard Wolowitz, listen up. You sign anything she puts in front of you, because you are the luckiest man alive. If you let her go, there is no way you can find anyone else. Speaking on behalf of all women, it is not gonna happen, we had a meeting. And you, a grown man fainting at the sight of a little blood.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Excuse me, this is a fairly substantial wound.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Amy? Amy? Amy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler What do you want?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper I was kind of hoping I could continue vacationing in your laboratory. After all, I did book the whole week.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler Do you honestly think you can just waltz back in here after the way you behaved yesterday?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper I was not myself. I had lost a lot of thumb blood.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler That’s not an apology.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper That is your opinion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler I want a real apology.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper I’m sorry that you weren’t able to…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper That my genius…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper That the soap was…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Fine. Sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler You’re forgiven. Now, if you want to stay, get started on those beakers. They’re still dirty from yesterday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Next year I’m going to Epcot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski Are you mad at me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 howard_wolowitz No. I’m not mad at you. I just wish you would have come to me, so I didn’t have to hear it through the nerd-vine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski So, what are we gonna do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 howard_wolowitz You really want me to sign a pre-nup?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t know. My dad’s pretty insistent on it, though.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Why don’t I talk to your dad, man-to-man?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski Really? Oh, that’d be so great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Done.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski I should probably give you a heads-up about a couple of things. Even though he’s retired from the police force, he still carries his gun. But don’t worry, he won’t shoot it. It’s more of a fashion statement.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski And just to be safe, when you talk to him, don’t bring up Jimmy Carter, gardeners, foreign people, homosexuals, Sean Penn, Vatican II, gun control, organic food, the designated hitter rule, recycling or the fact that you’re Jewish.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Got it, got it. Will you e-mail me that list?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski So the thing to watch for, if he’s shouting at you, you’re okay, but if he starts to get real quiet, leave as quickly as you can without making eye contact. Not in a straight line, throw some zigs and zigs in there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 howard_wolowitz You know, this isn’t that pressing. Why don’t I talk to him about it in May.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski In May you’re gonna be on the International Space Station.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode16 howard_wolowitz They’ve got a phone.
