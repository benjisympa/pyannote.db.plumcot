TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 raj_koothrappali It was a nice retirement party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 howard_wolowitz I guess. Still, it’s a shame Professor Rothman was forced to step down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter What choice did the university have? He snapped. It happens to theoretical physicists all the time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 howard_wolowitz I wonder how long Sheldon’s got.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper These shrimp are all the same size. There’s no the logical order to eat them in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Can’t be very long.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Hey, look, there’s Rothman’s empty office. Sad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Mm, indeed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 howard_wolowitz So sad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Dibs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 barry_kripke What’s up, fewwas?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper What are you doing here, Kripke?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 barry_kripke Ah, measuwing my new office for dwapes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper This is not your office. It hasn’t been assigned yet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 barry_kripke Well, I called dibs at the Chwistmas party when Pwofessor Wothman twied to have intercourse with the toys for tots cowwection box.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Dibs? This is a university, not a playground. Offices are not assigned because someone called dibs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter You just called dibs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Shut it. Offices are assigned by seniority. I arrived at the university first.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 barry_kripke I awwived at the office first. I’m the pwoverbial earwy bird.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 professor_rothman Gentlemen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 all@ Professor Rothman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 professor_rothman Good evening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 all@ Good evening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 raj_koothrappali I’m glad that men are wearing hats again. They’re so distinguished.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler I got you a little something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 penny A little something? Oh, it… what, this is huge.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler What’s huge is what you’ve done for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 penny Oh, no, Amy, I haven’t done anything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler No, no, before I met you, I was a mousy wallflower. But look at me now. I’m like some kind of downtown hipster party girl. With a posse, a boyfriend and a new lace bra that hooks in the front, of all things. Open it. Open it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 penny Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler I wanted to get you something you didn’t have.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 penny Wow. I-I don’t know what to s… Wow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Do you like it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 penny Do I like it? Wow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler So, uh, where are you gonna hang it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 penny Oh, my God. Hang it. Wow. Um, you know, I’d have to go get a hook and nails and a hammer and…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler No problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 penny Oh, look. You, huh, you just, you got it all right there. Wow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper I found him. He’s in the bathroom. President Siebert?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 president_siebert Can’t this wait?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper I’m sorry. We just need a word.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 president_siebert Now? You realize I’m your boss, and I am holding my penis?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 barry_kripke Sheldon, give the man some pwivacy. I’m sowwy. This guy’s got no wespect for boundawies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 president_siebert What do you want?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 barry_kripke Will you tell this wunatic that Pwofessor Wothman’s office is wightfully mine?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 president_siebert Can’t you take this up with your department chairman?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper We tried. His assistant said he was on sabbatical. Although we distinctly heard his office window open and shut.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 president_siebert Gentlemen, there’s a task I’m trying to accomplish here, and I’m having trouble doing it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Oh, my. President Siebert, I don’t mean to be an alarmist, but difficulty initiating a urine stream could be a symptom of benign prostatic hyperplasia. If you’re interested, I can send you a link to a YouTube video that’ll show you how to perform your own rectal exam. Yeah, uh, helpful hint, trim your nails first.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 barry_kripke Ignore him, Pwesident Siebert. I’m sure a young man such as yourself has a perfectwy healthy pwostate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Oh, he’s just trying to butter you up. And for the record, butter is an excellent lubricant for your rectal exam.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 president_siebert Gentlemen, I’m going to allow the two of you to work this out because A, you’re both brilliant scientists, and B, as far as who gets Rothman’s office, I couldn’t give the furry crack of a rat’s behind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 barry_kripke Well, as wong as we’re here, I might as well take a weak.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Kripke?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 barry_kripke Yes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper You’re in my spot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 bernadette_rostenkowski That is big.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 penny So big.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 bernadette_rostenkowski And ugly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 penny So ugly. What am I gonna do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t know. You can’t take it down. You’ll break her heart. Look at that face. That enormous, unsettling, crazy face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 penny Is there any chance I’ll learn to love it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 bernadette_rostenkowski That depends. Do you like pictures of yourself where you look like a man?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 penny All right, it’s got to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 bernadette_rostenkowski What will you tell Amy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 penny How about I tell her the painting makes you feel jealous because you’re not in it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 bernadette_rostenkowski Nuh-uh. What if she gets me one? I already have a picture of me and Howard’s mom getting our hair cornrowed in Venice Beach. I’ve suffered enough.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 penny Well, I guess I could take it down and put it up when she comes over, but it’s kind of heavy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 bernadette_rostenkowski Mmm, too bad you’re not as strong as the dude in the painting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Would you look at this? I paid twenty five dollars to some kid on eBay for a handcrafted Harry Potter wand. He sent me a stick. He went into his backyard, he picked up a stick.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 howard_wolowitz It’s numbered.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Ooh, limited edition. Nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Oh, that’ll be Kripke.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter What’s he doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper We’re going to work this office situation out like gentlemen. And if that doesn’t work, I’m going to poison his tea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 barry_kripke Cooper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Kripke. Come in. I’m making tea. Would you like a cup?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 barry_kripke Am I weawing a summer fwock? No, I don’t want tea. Wet’s get down to bwass tacks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Fine. In the interest of preserving our friendship…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 barry_kripke We’re not fwiends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Well, that’s a little hard to hear, but all right. As you know, the essence of diplomacy is compromise. With that in mind, I propose the following. I will take Rothman’s office, and you will find a way to be okay with that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 barry_kripke How about I take Wothman’s office, and you go suck a wemon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper You sure I can’t get you that cup of tea?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 raj_koothrappali How about you decide this with Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 barry_kripke What the fwig is that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock was created by Internet pioneer Sam Kass as an improvement on the classic game Rock-Paper-Scissors. All hail Sam Kass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 all@ Hail.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 barry_kripke How does it work?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Oh, it’s very simple. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 barry_kripke I’m sowwy. Can you wepeat that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Well, of course. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 barry_kripke Almost got it. One more time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Surely. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Sheldon, stop. He’s screwing with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Is he? Well, then, it seems we have reached an impasse. I see no other option than to challenge you to a duel. I’d smack you with a glove, but just last week I packed away my winter things.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 howard_wolowitz It’s the 21st century. You can’t have a duel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter H-h-h-hang on, Howard. Barry, how good of a shot are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 barry_kripke You have a compwete advantage in twivia. You have an eidetic memowy. Pwus, I haven’t watched Star Twek since I discovered the stwip cwub near my apartment has a fwee buffet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter It’s gonna be hard to find something you’re both equally good at.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Is there anything you’re both equally bad at?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 both#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 Sports.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter All right, this is one-on-one. First person to five wins the office. Any questions? Yes, Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Five what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Balls in the basket.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Ew!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 barry_kripke It’s out, wight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 barry_kripke Time. Wan out of woom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter You know all those terrible things bullies used to do to us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter I get it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Hey! He did that on purpose,
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter No, he didn’t. Nothing that’s happening here is being done on purpose. Okay, uh, forget one-on-one. Let’s try a free throw contest. First person who makes a basket wins the office.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 barry_kripke Making it too easy there, Hofstadter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter No. No, I’m not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Use the force, Sheldon. Use the force. I’m gonna need more force.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 barry_kripke Aw wight, Cooper, pwepare to have your heart bwoken. Do I get points for that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter All right, we gave it 45 minutes. It’s no longer funny. Let’s try something else.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper What do you propose?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Uh, on the count of three, both of you bounce the balls as hard as you can. The highest bounce wins the office.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 barry_kripke Oh, you are going down, Cooper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper I don’t think so, Kripke. I’ve bounced many a rubber ball in my day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter All right, that’s enough trash talk. One, two, three.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Sheldon was higher.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Congratulations, Sheldon. You win office.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Who’s unsatisfactory in P.E. now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, what a great movie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 penny I cannot believe you’ve never seen Grease.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler My mother didn’t allow me to watch it. She was afraid it might encourage me to join a gang.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 bernadette_rostenkowski I’ve got to go. I’ve got to get up early. My company’s testing a new steroid that supposedly doesn’t shrink testicles, and the last one there has to do the measuring.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler I guess I should get going, too. Good night, painting Penny. Good night, real Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 penny Good night, real Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler You don’t have to say good night to painting Amy, ’cause she’s never leaving.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 bernadette_rostenkowski Good night, real Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 penny Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 bernadette_rostenkowski Good night, transvestite Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 penny Ah, okay. Let us take you off the wall. Out of sight, out of mind. I wish.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler You know, can I borrow that movie? Those singing hooligans really got my motor running.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 penny Sure, sure. Enjoy. I mean, get it back to me when you can, or, you know what, actually, you keep it. It’s just going to be my gift to you. Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Thank you. Wait. Where’d the painting go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 penny It’s right over there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 penny I have no idea. That is weird.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler You hate it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 penny No. No, no. It’s just, it’s a little big.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler I feel like an idiot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 penny No, come on, you’re not an idiot. Look, just help me put it back up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Why? So you can just take it down when I leave? I don’t need your pity.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 penny Oh, Amy, come on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler I’m just glad I didn’t go for the sculpture.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Ah, the spoils. I see why victors love them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 raj_koothrappali I’m happy for you, Sheldon. But I have to admit I’m going to miss sharing an office with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Oh, of course you are. Feel free to drop by any time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Yeah. Call first.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 professor_rothman Oh. Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Professor Rothman. This isn’t your office any more. You’re retired.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 professor_rothman I think the word you’re looking for is invisible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 penny I came to say I’m sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Don’t bother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 penny Oh, Amy, please.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler I’m so humiliated. I sat there the whole time that we were watching Grease, thinking you liked the painting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 penny I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler I was a fool from Summer Lovin’ to the very last rama lama lama ke ding a de dinga a dong.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 penny You’re right. You’re absolutely right. I should have been honest with you and told you the gift was too much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Yes, too much. Because our friendship is fundamentally asymmetrical. I clearly like you more than you like me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 penny I don’t think you can put a number on how much one person likes another.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler I bought you a painting that’s 12 square feet in area. There’s a number.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 penny Amy, come on…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler If you don’t like feet, you can try dollars. The painting set me back three grand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 penny Three gr… Oh, my God! Look, look, Amy, all you need to know is, you are my friend and I don’t want to lose you out of my life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler I’m sorry, I’m just having trouble believing you right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 penny Grab your hammer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler No. Damage is done.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 penny Okay, look, I didn’t want to say this, but the real reason I took the painting down was because it made Bernadette very jealous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, my goodness, how could I have not seen that? The painting is a constant reminder that of the three of us, she is the least cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 penny Yeah, th-th-th-that’s what it is, so…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler You have such a good heart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 penny Huh, I try.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Come on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 penny Well where are we going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler We’re going to go put this painting back up in your apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 penny Well, what about Bernadette?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, screw her. She’s just lucky we let her hang out with us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper I’m trying to raise the temperature in here before my nipples tear through my shirt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Why don’t you just turn up the thermostat?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Aha! Good question. It turns out the thermostat for my new office isn’t in my new office. No. It’s next door, in Professor Davenport’s office, who is currently enjoying the hot flashes associated with menopause.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Why is there a hole here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Well, at least you finally got a window that opens. That’s nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Is it? Listen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 raj_koothrappali What, you don’t like wind chimes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper No, I hate them, but it gets worse. There it is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 howard_wolowitz The bird?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Yeah, It’s completely out of tune with the wind chimes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 raj_koothrappali So?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper You don’t get it, do you? That’s a mockingbird. Mockingbirds can change their song, which means he’s out of tune on purpose. He’s mocking me. Oh dear. There it is again. Do you feel it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 howard_wolowitz The growing realization that you are one wacky bastard? Yep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper No. The vibration. We are directly underneath the geology lab, and they’re running their confounded sieve shakers again. Hey, gravel monkeys, if you need to shake rocks, try jiggling your heads around!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, relax.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper How can I relax? My nervous system is being stretched out like the strings of a harp and plucked by holes and birds and wind and the low-hanging scrotum of the difficult-to-evict Professor Rothman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter If you’re not happy, why don’t you just let Kripke have the office?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper What, and let him win? Do I look crazy to you? We’re trying to think down here, you geode-loving feldspar jockeys! And you, the notes are C, D, E, G and A. You pick one or I am chopping down that tree!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 penny How’s that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Little higher on the right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 penny Now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Little more. No. That’s got it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 penny Yeah, okay. That’s, uh, that’s good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler I’ll let you in on a little secret.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 penny Mm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Originally we were painted nude. But I had him add clothes, ’cause I thought it was an unnecessary challenge to our heterosexuality.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 penny Yeah, good call.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler But if you ever change your mind, all it would take is some warm, soapy water and a couple of sponges.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 penny You’re talking about the painting, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Help! Somebody help!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter What happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper I was trying to see what was in here and my head got stuck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Why would you do that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 sheldon_cooper It’s called scientific curiosity. Now go get butter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Hang in there. I’ll be right back.
