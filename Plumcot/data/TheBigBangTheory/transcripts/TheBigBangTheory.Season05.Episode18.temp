TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 leonard I’m just gonna run to the store and get a few things. I’ll pick you up when you’re done.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon Okay. I like it a little better when you stay, but all right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 barber Hey, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon Hello. I’m here for my haircut with Mr. D’Onofrio.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 barber I’m sorry, Uncle Tony’s in the hospital. He’s pretty sick.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon Oh, dear, Mr. D’Onofrio’s in the hospital. Why do these things always happen to me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 barber I can cut it for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon You’re not Mr. D’Onofrio. I get my hair cut by Mr. D’Onofrio. You believe this guy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 leonard Excuse us for a second. Sheldon, it’s okay, he can do it. He’s a barber.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon He’s not a barber, he’s the nephew. He’s an example of the kind of nepotism that runs rampant in the barbering industry. Besides, Mr. D’Onofrio knows exactly how I like my hair done because he has all my haircut records from my barber in Texas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 leonard What are you talking about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon When I first moved here I was nervous about finding a new barber, so my mother had all my haircut records sent here to Mr. D’Onofrio.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 leonard There’s no such thing as haircut records.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon Yes, there are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 leonard Have you ever seen them?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon No, but my mother assured me they were sent here, and I’ll bet you dollars to doughnuts that this one doesn’t have them. Uh, excuse me. Do you have access to my haircut records?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 barber Your what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon To paraphrase T.S. Eliot, this is the way the world ends, not with a bang but with a nephew.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 leonard Sheldon, you’re a grown man, he’s a professional, and your haircut is number three on that poster from 1946. Just sit down and let him do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon Fine, but if I come out of this looking like a dork, it’s on you. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 barber So my kid said the funniest thing today.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon Nope. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 leonard When you tell this story later, the word we usually use is quirky.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon Can you pass the Parmesan cheese?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 leonard Sure. What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon I’m trying to get the hair out of my eyes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 leonard Sheldon, you are one day late for your haircut.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon Thank you for captioning my nightmare.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 howard Lookie here, I got my travel orders.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 raj Payload Specialist Howard Wolowitz is requested to report to the NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, for astronaut training Monday eight a.m.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 howard Yeah, but it’s from NASA, so it’s oh eight hundred.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 raj But it says eight a.m.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 howard You read it as oh eight hundred.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 raj It doesn’t have an oh in front of it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 howard You know what does have an oh in front of it? Oh, my God, I’m an astronaut, and you’re dying of jealousy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 leonard So, what kind of things are they… will you stop that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon I can’t help it, I feel like a teen heartthrob.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 penny You know, Sheldon, I used to cut my brother’s hair. I could do it for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon Penny, I know you mean well, offering the skills of the hill folk, but, um, here in town we don’t churn our own butter, we don’t, uh, make dresses out of gunny sacks, and, uh, we sure as shootin’ don’t get our hair cut by bottle-blonde…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 leonard Sheldon, be nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon I’m sorry, it’s the bad boy attitude that comes with this hair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 raj You could go to my guy. He’s at Juan-Juan in Beverly Hills. They bring you a cup of tea, they’ll massage your scalp. It’s about two hundred dollars, but sometimes you look in the next chair and you see a superstar like Tony Danza.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 howard Quick question here, have we actually changed the conversation from I’m going
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 raj Now who’s dying of jealousy? Oh, it’s you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 amy I’m a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride. I’m wanted… I’m wanted… wanted, dead or alive. Sheldon, you’re ruining girlfriend-boyfriend sing-along night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon I’m sorry. I’m looking for a barber and I’m running out of time. My hair is growing at the rate of 4.6 yoctometers per femtosecond. I mean, if you’re quiet, you can hear it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 amy What about Supercuts?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon I tried once. They do men’s and women’s hair in the same room at the same time. It’s like Sodom and Gomorrah with mousse.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 amy Well, this isn’t a crisis. Why don’t you just let your hair grow out a little?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon Why don’t I let my hair grow out? Um, why don’t I start wearing Birkenstocks and, uh, uh, seeking validation of my opinions by asking can you dig it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 amy Well, I don’t know. I think you might look sexy with long hair. The kind that flows down to your shoulders and blows back while riding on a horse, bareback and bare-chested. I’m gonna go brush my teeth, it might take a while.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 howard Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 bernadette Hi, sweetie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 howard I miss you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 bernadette I miss you, too. So tell me all about your first day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 howard Oh, wow, where do I even start? I got to experience zero gravity.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 bernadette Cool. How do they do that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 howard It’s pretty neat. You get in this plane that goes almost straight up for, like, 20 seconds, and then straight back down like it’s going to crash, and they do it over and over again, you know, no matter how many times you throw up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 bernadette You threw up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 howard Yeah, and the craziest part is, because there’s no gravity, the throw-up kind of floats there, in a little ball, and if your mouth is open because you’re screaming, sometimes it just floats right back in. Boy, does everyone laugh at you when that happens.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 bernadette That sounds mean.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 howard No. Yeah, I would have laughed, too, but I didn’t want the vomit to come back out. Anyway, oh, could you do me a favour and overnight me some more underwear?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 bernadette Sure, why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 howard I got a look at the centrifuge they’re going to spin me around in tomorrow, and I have a hunch I packed a little light.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon Mr. D’Onofrio? It’s Sheldon. They didn’t have anything barber-themed in the gift shop, so I got you this. I don’t know if you can read his little T-shirt. It says, um, get well bear-y soon. Trust me, if you were even a little conscious right now, you’d be laughing. Anyway, there’s new studies that show, people in comas are aware of everything going on around them. With that in mind, if you can hear me, move away from the light and toward the sound of these scissors.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 nurse Can I help you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon Yes. Do you have something I could use as a cape?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 nurse Oh, dear, did we spit out our pills, slip out of the ninth floor, and go on a little adventure?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon Oh, no, no, I’m just here to get my hair cut.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 nurse I-I see. J-Jus-Just wait here one moment. Security!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon I got to run. But not with scissors, that would be unsafe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 penny So, if I move my horsey here, isn’t that checkmate and I win?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 leonard Hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 penny Well, is it or isn’t it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 leonard You know, I think this is a good stopping point. Uh, it’s your first real game. I threw a lot of information at you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 penny Well, no, I mean, your king is trapped. He can’t go here because of my lighthouse, and he can’t go here because of my pointy-head guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 leonard Like I said, complicated game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 penny So did I win or not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 leonard Did you have fun? Because if you had fun, then you are, you are a winner. Now that’s, that-that’s what chess is all about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 leonard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 penny Oh, hey. Sorry, Sheldon, I’ll move.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon Eh, why? My spot, your spot, what difference does it make?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 penny Okay, what just happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 leonard I don’t know. Between you playing chess like Bobby Fischer and Sheldon being okay with you in his spot, I’m guessing someone went back in time, stepped on a bug, and changed the course of human events.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 penny Uh, sweetie, are you all right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon No, I’m not all right. It’s been six days since I was supposed to get a haircut and nothing horrible has happened.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 penny Okay, I’m sorry, I don’t understand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon Leonard, explain it to her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 leonard Oh, uh, he’s crazy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon I have spent my whole life trying to bring order to the universe by carefully planning every moment of every day. But all my efforts, our dinner schedule, my pyjama rotation, my bowel movement spreadsheet, it’s clear now, I’ve been wasting my time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 leonard Good. I’m taking that disgusting chart off the fridge.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 penny You know, Sh-Sheldon, sometimes it’s nice not knowing what’s coming. I mean, look at me and Leonard. We went out, we broke up, now we’re trying again. We don’t know what’s gonna happen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon Oh, please, everyone knows what’s going to happen. But I see your point.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 leonard I think this could be good for you. Maybe it’s time for you to shake things up a bit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon You’re right. I should embrace the chaos.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 leonard Great. What are you going to do first?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon I don’t know. I could do anything. All bets are off. The world is my oyster. I got it. I’m going to put on my Tuesday pyjamas tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 leonard I got to tell you, I’m a little worried about him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 penny If I were you, I’d be worried that a girl who’s never played chess in her life just kicked your ass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 howard Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 bernadette Howie, what happened to you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 howard We did overnight survival training in the wilderness. Big fun. Big, big fun. I was gonna freshen up for you but I blacked out a little on the way to the bathroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 bernadette Survival training? Is that like camping?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 howard Uh-huh. Except you don’t have food or water, and they don’t have a sunset Sabbath service like they do at Camp Hess-Kramer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 bernadette Do you sleep in tents?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 howard No. I slept in a hole I dug in the ground with my bare hands. And at some point during the night, an armadillo crawled in and spooned me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 bernadette Poor baby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 howard But I did it. I survived. I wasn’t sure I was going to when the sandstorm hit. I just pulled my turtleneck up over my head and waited for death. But somehow as I sat there, wrapped in a cocoon of my own neck-sweat, I found that primal part of the human spirit that just wants to keep on living, no matter what the cost.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 bernadette You’re so brave. I’m proud of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 howard I ate a butterfly. It was so small and beautiful, but I was so hungry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 bernadette Are you crying?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 howard No, I don’t think it’s possible. I’m severely dehydrated. My pee is like toothpaste.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 bernadette Howie, if you’re not able to do this, come home. It won’t change how I feel about you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 howard Thanks, honey, but I can’t quit. If I do, I’ll just be a guy who had a chance to be an astronaut and gave it up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 bernadette Well, is there anything I could do to help?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 howard No. Wait. Send more underwear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 leonard Don’t let this be Sheldon playing bongos. Please don’t let this be Sheldon playing bongos.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon Hello, Leonard, do you like my bongos? Bet you didn’t know that I had bongos.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 leonard Sheldon, it’s three o’clock in the morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon Three in the morning is a good time for bongos.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 leonard I was sleeping.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon Leonard sleeps while I play bongos.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 leonard No, he doesn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon Leonard no sleep while I play bongos. Bongo solo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 leonard Stop! Stop it! Stop! Stop! Stop it!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 penny What the hell?!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 leonard Oh, hi, Penny, guess what? Sheldon got bongos.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 penny Why did you get bongos?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon Richard Feynman played the bongos. I thought I’d give that a try.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 leonard Richard Feynman was a famous physicist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 penny Oh, Leonard, it’s three o’clock in the morning. I don’t care if Richard Feynman was a purple leprechaun who lived in my butt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon Penny meant if he were a purple leprechaun. Penny forgot to use the subjunctive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 leonard Sheldon, go to bed. You have work in the morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon Maybe, maybe not. Maybe tomorrow I start a bongo band and tour the world.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 leonard W-w-wuh, no, no, hang on,uh, uh, roommate agreement. No hootenannies, sing-a-longs, or barbershop quartets after ten p.m.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon Roommate agreement? Are you kidding? We are living in a world of chaos. Roommate agreement.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 penny Where are you going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon Wherever the music takes me, kitten. I play bongos walking down the stairs. Oh! Oh! Never play bongos walking down the stairs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 bernadette Surprise.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 howard What are you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 bernadette I’m here to help you get through this. You can’t do it on your own, you need someone to take care of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 howard Oh, I love you so much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 bernadette Oh, I love you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 mrs_wolowitz Howard, your bath is getting cold!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 howard Don’t worry, once she falls asleep, I’ll spoon you like an armadillo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 amy He showed up in the middle of the night with his bongos. I foolishly thought it was some sort of musical booty call.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 leonard Poor guy. He must have been exhausted. Sheldon like to sleep while Leonard play the bongo!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 amy That was kind of uncalled for.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 leonard No, it was called for.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 penny All right, Sheldon, this craziness has gone on long enough. Please come home so I can cut your hair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon Penny, you’re not trained. You’re not licensed. Most importantly, you don’t have access to my haircut records.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 penny All right, honey, look, we’ve known each other for a long time now, right? I’ve taken you to Disneyland, I kicked a bully in the nuts for you, I sing you Soft Kitty when you’re sick, you’ve even saw me naked once.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 leonard I’m sorry, duh, what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 penny It was a long story. Anyway, Sheldon, I promise I know what I’m doing. Please let me cut your hair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon Amy, what do you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 amy There’s not a hair on my body I wouldn’t let this woman trim.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon Fine, let’s go. Thank you for letting me sleep on your couch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 amy There’s only so many times a woman can say how about the bed?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 leonard What’s this about Sheldon seeing you naked?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon Oh, relax. It was just her bottom and her breasts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 penny Almost done.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon At the end of the haircut, Mr. D’Onofrio would tell me a dirty joke.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 penny Well, sorry, I don’t know any dirty jokes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon That’s okay, I never understood them anyway.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 penny Okay, what do you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon Hmm, well, it’s a little Hollywood. But I think I can pull it off. Well done, Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 penny Ha, told you. Okay, I’m just gonna clean up your neck a little and then you are good to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sheldon Fun time. Hah. Sorry, sometimes the clippers tickle me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 penny Okay. Okay, yep, we’re all done now. It’s just, it’s good. Let me just take that away from you. Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 sgeldon Thank you very much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode18 penny You are welcome. Yeah, I’m gonna have to move.
