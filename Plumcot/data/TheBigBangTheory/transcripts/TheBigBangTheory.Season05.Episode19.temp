TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 raj Hey, want to spend some time playing the new Star Wars game this weekend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 leonard Oh, I don’t know. I kind of promised myself I’d get off the computer, be more physically active. Get some exercise.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 howard You’re about to walk up three flights of stairs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 leonard Good point, I’m in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 raj You know what would be great? Let’s do it like the old days.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 leonard You mean, are you talking gaming marathon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 raj Yeah. Start Saturday morning, go 48 hours, sleeping bags, junk food.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 howard Turn off our phones so our moms can’t call.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 leonard It would be like our World Of Warcraft a few years ago when the neighbours called the cops on us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 howard They called the cops because of the smell. They thought we were dead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 raj We were badass back in the day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 leonard All right, let’s do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 howard 48 hours of Star Wars gaming.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 raj It’s on like Alderaan.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 leonard Hey, Sheldon, clear your weekend. Starting Saturday morning, Star Wars< marathon
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 raj Woo-hoo!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 sheldon Movies or video games? Or board game? Or trading card games? Or Lego’s? Or dress up? Or comic books? Or dramatic readings of novelizations? Yes to all!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 leonard We are going to play the online game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 sheldon The online game? Bully!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 amy Gentlemen, as much as I’m sure Sheldon would enjoy playing intergalactic make-believe, he and I have other plans. We are attending my Aunt Flora’s 93rd birthday party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 sheldon Just tell her I can’t come.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 amy She’ll be disappointed if we don’t show up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 sheldon She’s 93. She won’t be disappointed for very long.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 amy No, hang on. I followed all the protocols set forth by you in the relationship agreement. I made a written record request 72 hours in advance. I checked the tyre pressure on the car. I even contacted the Centres For Disease Control to find out what shots they recommend for travel to Orange County. FYI, it’s none.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 sheldon Amy, the relationship agreement was not designed for either one of us to get our way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 amy You use it to get your way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 sheldon I use it to get the right way. The fact that the right way is also my way is a happy coincidence.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 amy You gave me your word. You’re coming with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 leonard We’ll miss you, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 sheldon Yeah, well, who wants to spend the whole weekend, running around a bunch of pretend planets battling made up monsters. That’s for babies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 howard Yeah, but it’s got lightsabres.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 sheldon Yeah, please, Amy! It’s got lightsabres!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 sheldon Hello Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 stuart Hey Sheldon. Help you with anything?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 sheldon Yes. I’m attending a party this weekend, for a 93-year-old woman. Can you recommend a gift?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 stuart Uh, I don’t know. Could put a tennis ball on the end of Excalibur. Make a pretty badass cane.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 sheldon Do you supply the the tennis ball?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 stuart No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 sheldon Then no. What else?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 stuart Hmm. Oh, have this collectors edition Batman utility belt. Maybe she can use it as a wearable pill caddy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 sheldon Well, she’d just look silly wearing that without the rest of the costume.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 stuart I’m sorry Sheldon, that’s it. That’s all I got.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 sheldon Oh, it’s not your fault. I’ve been to the model train store. I’ve been to Radio Shack. This woman is impossible to shop for.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 leonard I’d make fun of Sheldon for having girl problems if I wasn’t in shock that Sheldon has girl problems.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 sheldon No, Leonard, go ahead and mock. Like my daddy always said, Shelly, women aren’t anything but flippin’ pains in the bottom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 leonard That’s what your father used to say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 sheldon Well, I took out the bad words and the yeehaw, but you get the gist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 howard Look, if you don’t want to go to the party, just don’t go. You’re a grown man. Act like one. Tell Amy you want to spend the weekend having a sleepover and playing video games with your friends. Maybe she’ll dig it. Women like a firm hand on the tiller.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 raj I can never find the tiller. I got a book; it didn’t help.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 sheldon Yeah, I always thought if I were ever enslaved, it would be by an advanced species from another planet, not some hotsy-totsy from Glendale.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 howard Now, I downloaded an app that might be helpful in this situation. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 sheldon You’re right. I’m smart as a whip. I should be able to figure this out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 leonard Hey, listen, I kind of made plans with the guys this weekend, but then I wondered, because we’re in this relationship-beta-test, if I should have asked you first. Then I thought if I did check with you first, you’d think that I was taking things to seriously. And then, then I got a nosebleed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 penny You don’t have to check with me. Do whatever you want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 leonard Oh. I guess I was hoping for a different reaction, but okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 penny Really, what were you hoping for?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 leonard I don’t know, maybe that you’d be a little upset, and then you’d realize that I’m a stallion that has to run free. And that would turn you on a little.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 penny Okay, I’m an actress. Ask me again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 leonard Do you mind if I spend the weekend playing video games with the guys?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 penny Whu… the entire weekend? You mean I wouldn’t see you at all? But I ju… No, no, I knew what I was getting into. You can’t put a saddle on Leonard Hofstadter. Oh, my, is it getting hot in here? Ay, papi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 leonard Ay papi? What is that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 penny An acting choice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 leonard Oh. So you chose that when you become turned on, you turn into Speedy Gonzalez?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 penny Choo got a problem with that, papi?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 leonard Uh-uh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 sheldon Penny! Penny! Penny!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 penny Sorry, Stallion. Your weird friend Giraffe is here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 sheldon Hello, Penny. I just stopped by to bring you this gift.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 penny Gummy bears? Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 sheldon Now that you’re in my debt, please manipulate Amy into releasing me from my commitment to attend her aunt’s tedious birthday party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 penny Not a chance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 sheldon All right. I thought the candy might not be enough so let me up the ante. These are Cooper Coupons. These are for various things I can do for you. Um, oh, this one is for one free grammar check. Uh, you could use it for emails, letters, tattoos, what have you. Um, oh, this is fun one. This is an afternoon with me at the California Science Center, where I point out their mistakes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 leonard Keep an eye on those expiration dates, I’ve been burned more than once.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 penny All right, sweetie, I’m not going to get involved in your relationship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 sheldon Oh, come on. It’s just a simple favour. Now, when’s the last time I asked you to do something for me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 penny Yesterday. You made me look in your ear to see if there was a ladybug in it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 sheldon When is the last time I asked you to do something that wasn’t a medical emergency?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 penny Yesterday. You made me look in your ear to see if there was a ladybug in it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 sheldon All right, then, I have no choice but to go on to plan B.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 penny What’s that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 sheldon I’m going to run around outside with a wet head and try to catch a cold.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 amy Good morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 sheldon Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 amy I think you’re really going to enjoy yourself today. Not only do you get to meet my relatives, but since my aunt’s nursing home is catering the party, all of the food is incredibly soft. It’s like a vacation for your teeth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 sheldon All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 amy You sure you’re okay with this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 sheldon Yes. I decided to find a way that I could have this experience and enjoy it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 amy Thank you. That means a lot to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 sheldon Oh, don’t thank me. Thank wireless technology. I realized, I can go to your aunt’s awful party and still spend the whole day gaming with my friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 amy Sheldon, my relatives are going to want to talk to you, and you’re going to be sitting there playing a game? Isn’t that a little rude?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 sheldon Oh, I got that covered. Headset. I won’t hear a word the old geezers are saying.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 amy You know, if playing that game is more important to you than honouring your commitment to me, and you don’t mind me showing up at a party all by myself after I’ve already told everybody I’ll be bringing somebody, then, fine. Go home and play your game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 sheldon Thanks. Ooh, listen, I wouldn’t mind a piece of birthday cake, provided the old gal’s candle blow is clean and dry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 raj Here you go. I’ve got everything we’ll need for the big game. Low fat turkey jerky, low-carb beer, 100-calorie snack packs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 leonard You pick up a Y chromosome while you were there? You might be short one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 raj Hey, I plan on levelling up in the game, not my swimsuit size, thank you very much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 sheldon Gentlemen, the game offers us a choice between playing for the Republic and the light side, or the Sith Empire and the dark side.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 leonard Well, we’re always the good guys. In D&D, we’re lawful good, in City Of Heroes, we’re the heroes, in Grand Theft Auto, we pay the prostitutes promptly and never hit them with a bat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 sheldon Those women are prostitutes? You said they were raising money for stem cell research.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 howard Hey, guys, I got a surprise.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 leonard Uh, if it’s yoghurt that helps ladies poop, I think Raj beat you to it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 howard No. Bernadette’s going to be playing with us. So, that’s pretty cool, huh? Right? Sure it is, yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 raj What, you invited your girlfriend? This is supposed to be our weekend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 howard I had no choice. Last night, she said, why don’t we go out for brunch tomorrow and then maybe the Arboretum. And I said, well, no, I promised the guys I was going to play a video game with them all weekend. And she said, that sounds like fun, can I come, too? And then I didn’t answer for a second, and then she said, well, do you not want me to come? And then I bought her a new laptop and the game, and she’s parking the car right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 sheldon Is the whip sound app contextually appropriate here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 leonard Uh, it is, but I think you might’ve waited too long for it to be funny. I was wrong, it’s still funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 sheldon Oh, good. Hah-hah!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 penny Amy, what’s wrong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 amy My boyfriend’s a jerk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 penny Well, I know he didn’t cheat on you, so what happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 amy I had to go to my aunt’s party all by myself, and everybody was like, where’s this boyfriend you’re always talking about? Is he real, or did you make him up like Armin the miniature horse breeder?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 penny Who’s Armin the miniature horse breeder?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 amy The pretend boyfriend I invented to get my family off my back. It unravelled quickly when I couldn’t answer the question how’d you two meet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 penny I would have thought at a miniature horse show.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 amy Oh, that’s good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 penny Mm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 amy I panicked and said Woodstock. I just wanted to show Sheldon off to my family.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 penny Sure, I get that. I mean, he’s your first boyfriend and all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 amy Not just my first boyfriend, he’s the best boyfriend. I mean, think about it. I’m dating Sheldon Cooper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 penny Yes. On purpose.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 amy He’s handsome, he’s lanky, he’s brilliant, and his skin has that pale, waxy quality.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 penny Well, sickly is the new sexy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 amy Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 penny Mm. You know, Amy, sometimes when you’re in a relationship with someone you really care about, the sucky part is, it leaves you open to getting hurt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 amy Do you ever worry about Leonard doing that to you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 penny That’s hilarious. No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 bernadette Get that guy! Get that guy! Pew! Pew! Pew! Pew!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 sheldon Dr. Rostenkowski, it may interest you to know that saying pew, pew, pew isn’t as effective as pressing your blaster key. In the same way that saying whee doesn’t make the land speeder go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 bernadette Pew!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 leonard Raj, Imperial Troopers on your tail.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 raj Got him. When Gandhi advocated his philosophy of non-violence, I bet he didn’t know how much fun it was killing stuff.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 leonard All right, I think we got them all. Let’s divide up the loot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 bernadette Ooh, look at this pretty purple robe I just got. You should put on yours and then we’ll match.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 howard But I worked hard to get this armour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 bernadette Sorry, I just thought it’d be nice if people knew we were a couple.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 howard Fine, I’ll change. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 sheldon Hah-hah!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 amy I don’t think I want to play a game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 penny Oh, come on. They’re playing one across the hall, we should, too. Okay, we are gonna take turns bouncing a quarter off the table, and if it goes into this cup, the other person has to drink. Then you get to go again…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 amy Like that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 penny Wow. Yeah, b-beginner’s luck. So, now I will drink this entire cup of beer, and you will go again and we can… uh… all right. So, yeah, okay, now I’m gonna drink this entire cup and then I’m going to drink another one… Okay, seriously, stop. What the hell?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 amy Spent a lot of my childhood throwing coins into wishing wells hoping for friends. At a certain point, you start doing trick shots just to keep things interesting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 penny Whoa, whoa, give me a second to catch up here. Hold on. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 amy That’d be my boyfriend. Happier playing his dopey Star Trek game with his friends than hanging out with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 penny Wars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 amy What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 penny Star Wars. They get all cranky when you mix the two up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 amy What’s the difference?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 penny There’s absolutely no difference.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 amy How do I get him to treat me better?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 penny All right. Let me give you a little girlfriend 101. Usually the first move out of the gate is you withhold sex, but that will work better after Sheldon hits puberty. So, I’d say give him the silent treatment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 amy No, he loves that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 penny Hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 amy Our record for sitting in a room together and not speaking to each other is six-and-a half hours. He said it was a magical evening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 penny All right, then we’re gonna have to go with an oldie but goodie, making a scene.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 amy I don’t think I’d be good at that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 penny That’s why you’re lucky to have me. Back in Omaha, there are two different restaurants I’m not allowed into. Both Chili’s.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 raj Bernadette, remember, your character’s the healer in our group. You’re in charge of healing all of us, not just Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 bernadette I can’t help it. My Howie Wowie has an owie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 sheldon That is the most sickeningly sweet thing I have ever experienced. And I am sipping Kool-Aid through a Red Vine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 amy Sheldon Cooper, I’ve got a bone to pick with you, and I’m about to do it in front of all your friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 penny Yeah, you pick that bone. You pick that bone clean!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 amy I’m gonna publicly shame you, and then sit back as societal pressure compels you to modify your behaviour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 penny Ooh, burn!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 amy And if you don’t start treating me better, I’m leaving you for a miniature horse breeder named Armin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 sheldon Armin who?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 amy Armin… damn it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 penny Sheldon, she wanted to show you off to her family, and you stood her up, okay? Look at this adorable, smushy face. Smush, smush, smush, smush.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 amy You’re hurting me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 penny No, Sheldon hurt you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 amy Before; now it’s you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 penny Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 sheldon I think I understand. You’re the one person who can say Sheldon Cooper is your boyfriend, but that rings hollow if you can’t lord him over others in the flesh. I forget what I bring to the party and what I take away when I leave. Please accept these valuable Cooper Coupons as restitution.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 penny Sheldon, she doesn’t want your stupid…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 amy Ooh, Science Center. Redeeming. Let’s go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 sheldon Well played, Amy Farrah Fowler. Let me get my coat. Oh, grow up, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 raj But e-excuse me, I have something to say. None of you may realize it, but I was very much looking forward to this weekend. It was gonna be like the old days, the four of us hanging out playing video games before you guys all got girlfriends. Do you have any idea what it’s like to be the only one without a girlfriend? Even if I get one someday, I’ll still be the guy who got a girl after Sheldon Cooper!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 penny And that’s how a girl makes a scene. I’m sorry, sweetie. You’re right. You deserve your weekend. Come on, Amy, let’s go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 amy What about the Science Center?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 penny I’ll let you hold my hair while I throw up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 amy Rain check.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 bernadette I’m gonna go, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 howard I’ll miss you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 bernadette I’ll miss you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 howard I’ll miss you more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 bernadette No, I’ll…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 raj Just leave! Okay, now. This is the way it’s supposed to be. Men together, fighting the forces of evil.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 all Hear! Hear!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 raj I can’t believe this is only 64 calories.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 mrs_wolowitz Howard Joel Wolowitz! I’ve been worried sick for two days, and I know you turned off your phone! You open up this door right now because I’ve had it up to here! I have been to the morgue and the hospital, and I spent the last half hour walking up these ferkakta stairs!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode19 howard That’s my ride, got to go.
