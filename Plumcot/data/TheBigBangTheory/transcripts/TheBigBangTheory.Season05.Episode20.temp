TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 penny Oh my God, I love this chicken.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon Oh, you know what they say, the best things in life are free.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 penny Okay, you’re right, I eat your food a lot. How about this, you can raid my fridge any time you want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon Oh, that’s very kind of you. Next time I have a hankering to wash down a D cell battery with a jar of old pickle juice, I’ll come a-knocking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 howard Hey, Raj, you didn’t send your RSVP in. I’m supposed to ask you if you’re bringing someone to the wedding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 raj I’ll let you know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 howard Well, can you make it soon. There’s a battle royale going on over the seating charts. In one corner, Bernadette mom, and the other three, mine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon Yeah, I hate wedding receptions. I wish the bride and groom would take a cue from Bilbo Baggins, slip on the ring, disappear and everyone goes home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 leonard Mmm, you liked Professor Guyster’s wedding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon They had a make your own sundae bar. Ooh, that was a night to remember. Do you know, on the one trip, I just had a bowl of nuts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 howard Anyway, you gotta let me know if you have a plus one, because if not my mom’s trying to sneak in the doctor who sucked the fat out of her neck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 raj Alright, uh, fine, I’m coming and I’m bringing somebody. Uh, Koothrappali plus one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 leonard Who you bringing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 raj Who are you bringing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 penny He’s bringing me. Who are you bringing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 raj Wow, what a bunch of Nosey O’Donnells.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 howard Come on, who is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 raj I’m not telling. I’m from Asia. I’m mysterious. Deal with it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon Howard, are you having a make your own sundae bar?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 howard No, uh, I don’t think so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon Well you should. 50% of marriages end in divorce, but 100% of make your own sundae bars end in happiness.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 raj Hello Mummy, Daddy, how are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 mrs_koothrappali Pretty good, can’t complain.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 dr_koothrappali Oh I’m sure you can. Just give it a minute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 raj Listen, uh, there’s something I want to talk to you about. I, I wasn’t ready until now, but I think it’s time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 dr_koothrappali It’s finally happening. You’re coming out of the closet, aren’t you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 mrs_koothrappali We love you, and we accept your alternate lifestyle. Just keep it to yourself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 raj No, I’m not gay. If anything, I’m metrosexual.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 dr_koothrappali What’s that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 raj It means I like women as well as their skincare products.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 dr_koothrappali Well, if you’re not coming out, why did you call us during the cricket semi-finals?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 raj ‘Cause I, I’m tired of trying to meet someone and, I think I’d like you to help me find uh, a wife.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 mrs_koothrappali And just to clarify, a female wife?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 raj Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 dr_koothrappali Matchmaking, very smart move son. Much better than marrying for love.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 mrs_koothrappali We married for love.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 dr_koothrappali And it’s been wonderful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon Quantum physics makes me so happy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 leonard Yeah, I’m glad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon It’s like looking at the universe naked. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 penny Hi, you guys got a minute?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 leonard Sure, what’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 penny Well, I was thinking about Sheldon’s little joke the other night about me eating all your food.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon Oh, that was no joke. But I understand your confusion as I am our group’s resident cut-up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 leonard I’m sorry, you are our resident cut-up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 leonard Prove it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon Knock, knock.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 leonard Who’s there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon Interrupting physicist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 leonard Interrupting physi…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon MUON!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 penny Anyway, I got a little residual cheque from my commercial and I thought, hey, how about I get the guys a little thankyou to pay them back. So, Sheldon, ta-da!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon Ah! A vintage, mint in box, 1975 Mego Star Trek transporter with real transporter action. Hot-darn!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 leonard Where did you get that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 penny Uh, from Stuart at the comic-book store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 leonard You went to the comic-book store by yourself?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 penny Yeah, it was fun, I walked in and two different guys got asthma attacks. Felt pretty good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon Well this calls for an expression of gratitude.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 penny Ooh, am I about to get a rare Sheldon Cooper hug?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon Not this time. Then they wouldn’t be special. Thanks Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 penny You’re welcome. Don’t worry, I didn’t forget about you. Leonard, I got you a label maker.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 leonard Wow. No, it’s great. Also, uh, mint in box.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 penny Mmm. And, I got you a transporter too!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 leonard Awesome!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon Look, it was actually designed for my vintage Mr Spock action figure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 penny Oh, that’s great. Let’s open it up and put him in there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 leonard Ah!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon Oh dear Lord. No!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 penny Why, they’re just toys?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon They’re mint in box.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 leonard They’re Collectables.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 penny C’mon can’t we just open one up and take a…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 together No!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 leonard Once you open the box it loses its value.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 penny Yeah, yeah, my mom gave me the same lecture about my virginity. Gotta tell you, it was a lot more fun taking it out and playing with it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 bernadette Are you sure you want us here when you meet this woman?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 raj Oh yes. In my culture it’s expected to have a chaparone to oversee a first date. Plus I want to make a good impression and, no offence, but with you guys here I look like six two.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 bernadette The nuns always chaparoned the dances at my high school. They used to make us leave room between us for the holy spirit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 howard Hindus do the same thing. Except they leave room for a cow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 raj Listen, I love your charming racist humour, but any chance you could not knock my religion while she’s here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 howard Yesterday you made fun of me for eating lox.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 raj It’s different. You’re people don’t worship lox.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 howard Well clearly you’ve never been to brunch with my cousins.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 bernadette So, arranged marriages. The parents just decide, and then you have to get married?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 raj Oh, no, no, I get a say in it. But I’m sure whoever shows up will be better company than a threesome I’ve been having with Aunt Jemima and Mrs Butterworth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 girl Excuse me, are you Rajesh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 raj Oh, yes. You must be Lakshmi. Uh, nice to meet you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 lakshmi Nice to meet you too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 raj Oh, uh, these are my, my friends. This is Bernadette.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 bernadette Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 raj And this is Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 howard Nice to meet you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 lakshmi You too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 raj Please have a seat. I’m thinking double wedding!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 voice_of_spock Dr Cooper. Dr Cooper?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon Is someone there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 spock Down here, on your desk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon Spock?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 spock I need to speak with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon Fascinating. The only logical explanation is that this is a dream.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 spock It is not the only logical explanation. For example, you could be hallucinating after being hit on the head by, say, a coconut.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon Was I hit on the head by a coconut.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 spock I’m not going to dignify that with a response. Now, to the matter at hand. You need to play with the transporter toy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon But it’s mint in box.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 spock Yes, and to open it would destroy it’s value. But remember, like me, you also have a human half.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon Well, I’m not going to dignify that with a response.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 spock Consider this. What is the purpose of a toy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon To be played with.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 spock Therefore? To not play with it would be?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon Illogical. Oh, damn it Spock, you’re right. I’ll do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 spock Sheldon, wait. You have to wake up first.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon Oh, of course. Set phasers to dumb, right? Goody, goody, goody. This is wrong. This is wrong. I’m so excited, but this is wrong. I’m gonna do it. I’m doing it. I did it. Oh, that’s what I always thought 1975 smelled like. One to beam down Mr Scott. Aye, aye, Mr Spock. Energise. . Energise. Don’t be broken. Please don’t be broken. What did you make me do? Okay, okay, think. It’s only logical.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 lakshmi My goodness, that was delicious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 raj Well, I hope you saved room for chocolate lava cake.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 lakshmi Impressive. What goes into making something like that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 raj Well, you start off by trying to make chocolate souffle, and when it falls you panic, quickly change the name, and voila! Lava cake.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 lakshmi I bet our parents are dying to know how things are going here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 raj Well, let’s see. Yup, three missed calls.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 lakshmi Four missed calls, two text messages, and a failed video chat. I win. So, what are we going to tell them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 raj I’d like to tell them things are going well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 lakshmi Me too. But before we get their hopes up we should probably make sure we’re on the same page.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 raj Okay, what page are you on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 lakshmi I’m on the one where I’m on a lot of pressure from my parents to get married and settle down, and have a family, and I’m going to do it so they don’t find out I’m gay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 raj Say again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 lakshmi I’m gay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 raj Like, dude on dude, but with women?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 lakshmi I know a fake marriage isn’t an honest way to live, but you of all people must know how difficult it is to come out in our culture.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 raj Why me, of all people?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 lakshmi Well, there is a rumour back in New Delhi that you’re, how shall we say, comfortable in a sari.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 raj I’m not gay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 lakshmi Really? The chocolate lava cake? The little soaps in the bathroom? And I’m sorry, but you’re wearing more perfume than I am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 raj That’s Unbreakable by Khloe and Lamar. And for your information, it’s unisex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 lakshmi Fill in the blank. I love the nightlife?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 raj I like to boogie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 lakshmi Got you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 raj W-w-with women. I like to boogie with women.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 lakshmi That’s disappointing. You were exactly the kind of phoney-baloney husband I was looking for.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 raj Thankyou. And once again, my baloney likes girls. Wait-wait. You don’t want to put a bit of that in your mouth without trying my homemade chantilly cream. Yeah, okay, that time I heard it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon Oh dear. Two suns and no sunscreen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 spock Hello again, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon What is it now, tiny Spock?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 spock I am very disappointed in you. You broke your toy and switched it with Leonard’s. You should be ashamed of yourself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon You’re the one who told me to play with it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 spock If I told you to jump off the bridge of the Enterprise, would you do it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon No. If I got on the bridge of the Enterprise, I would never, ever leave.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 spock Trust me, it gets old after a while. You must right your wrong, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon Why? I got away with it. Leonard has his toy, and he’s never going to open it, so he won’t know it’s broken. And I have a toy that isn’t broken. Everybody’s happy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 spock Well I am unhappy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon I thought where you come from they don’t have emotions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 spock I come from a factory in Taiwan. Now do the right thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon You know what you are? Well, you’re a green blooded buzzkill. Perhaps it’s time you beam on out of here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 spock Fine. I will just use the transporter. Oh, right. You broke it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon Very well. Cooper to Enterprise, one to beam up. Energise. Ah. Tiny Spock. Help.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 raj Ready for lunch?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 howard Yep, one sec. Ah, good. Ma would have killed me if she’d found out I’d broke my retainer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 raj Hey, uh, can I run something by you? It’s about Lakshmi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 howard Yeah. Sure. How are things going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 raj We hit a couple of bumps. She lives over on Manhattan Beach, so it takes over an hour to get there. And she’s a lesbian.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 howard What do you mean, she’s a lesbian?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 raj Well, you know whenever you and I would try to hit on women in bars, and they’d blow us off, and then we’d tell each other they were probably gay. It’s like that. Except this time it’s true.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 howard Then why did she even go out with you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 raj She was looking for a husband so she can appear to be straight. And you know, it sounded crazy to me at first, but I’m actually thinking about doing it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 howard Okay, well, so the reason that might sound crazy, is ’cause it’s crazy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 raj Look, Howard, you’re in a relationship. You know you have to make compromises.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 howard Well, yes. But my compromises are about which bedspread to buy, or whose turn it is to do the laundry, Bernadette’s or my mom’s.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 raj It’s a great deal. We both get our parents off our backs. I don’t have to come home to an empty apartment every night, plus, once I’m married, I can finally eat carbs again and let myself go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 howard Why don’t you tell your parents you want to try and find someone else, you know, maybe one who hasn’t slept with more women than you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 raj Because this one wants to marry me. I might never find another one who does.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 howard So you’re seriously thinking about marrying someone you’re never going to have sex with.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 raj I can’t believe your attitude. I thought you were in favour of gay people getting married.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 howard Yes, to other gay people.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 raj Do you hear how homophobic you sound?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon Oh, I don’t want a broken toy. Nothing!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon Nothing. I said nothing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 penny That was weird.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 leonard Really? I don’t even notice any more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 penny I cannot believe you guys aren’t going to play with these.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 leonard Well I told you, you don’t, it’s mint in box.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 penny I dunno. I just think it’s a waste. Relax. I’m just looking at the box.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon Perhaps you should look with your eyes, and not your muscular Nebraska man-hands.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 penny What is your problem?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon My problem is that I don’t want you to break Leonard’s toy, which you probably did by shaking it. She shook it. We all saw her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 penny Leonard, I bought you this because I wanted you to have fun with it. I don’t want it to just sit in this box.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 leonard You know, you’re right. I mean, it’s from you, I’m never going to sell it. I’m opening it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 penny Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon Mmmmm!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 leonard It’s broken.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon Oh, nice job, man-hands.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 penny I didn’t break it. I, I guess Stuart sold it to me like this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon Yes. Yes, he did, that is a perfectly satisfying and plausible explanation. Yeah, let’s all be mad at Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 penny You know, I paid a lot for this. Let’s take it over there and show him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 leonard Absolutely.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon Wait. It was me. I opened your toy, discovered it was broken and didn’t tell you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 leonard Why would you open mine?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon I didn’t. That was a lie. I opened my own toy. And it was already broken so I switched them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 leonard Well, you should talk to Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon I can’t because that was a lie. Yours was broken in an earthquake. And that’s a lie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 penny What is the truth?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon My Mr Spock doll came to me in a dream and forced me to open it. And when the toy broke I switched it for yours. Later he encouraged me to do the right thing and I defied him. And then I was attacked by a Gorn.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 leonard Okay, that I believe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 penny Mmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon Leonard, Penny, I just, I want you both to know that I regret my actions toward the two of you. That’s a lie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 leonard So, is that one mine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 leonard Well, hand it over so I can open it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon Okay. Leonard, even though I don’t have one any more, I hope you have fun playing with it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 leonard And that’s a lie, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 sheldon Big fat whopper. I hope it breaks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 raj This is a treat, what brings you guys by?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 bernadette Raj, Howie told me what’s going on with you and Lakshmi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 raj What, you told her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 howard I told everybody.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 bernadette We believe there’s someone out there who’ll love you for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 howard Well, actually we kind of agreed to disagree on that one, but we both think you shouldn’t marry this woman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 raj So, while I’m waiting for this mysterious perfect match, who may or may not exist, I’m supposed to just be alone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 bernadette Not necessarily. I think we’ve found someone for you to cuddle with. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 raj Oh, my goodness. Aren’t you the cutest little Yorkie ever? You got him for me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 howard Her. We thought you two would hit it off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 raj I think we already have. Thank you guys so much. Let’s see if you fit in my man purse.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode20 bernadette Metrosexual my ass.
