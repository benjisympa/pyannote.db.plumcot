TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz So, I got the craziest e-mail this morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 raj_koothrappali I don’t mean to burst your bubble, dude, but those penile enlargement pills do not work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz Believe me, I know. The e-mail I got was from the office of Stephen Hawking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 leonard_hofstadter You’re kidding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 raj_koothrappali Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz He’s coming to the university for a couple weeks to lecture, and he’s looking for an engineer to help maintain the equipment on his wheelchair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 leonard_hofstadter That’s amazing. You’ll be like his pit crew. A word of caution, I would not do your Stephen Hawking impression in front of him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz You’re right. I suppose that could be considered offensive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 raj_koothrappali Oh, boy, Sheldon’s going to freak out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, he worships Hawking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz I was actually thinking about bringing him along when I go over there so he can meet the great man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 raj_koothrappali That’s really nice of you, Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz Hm, it’s no big deal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 leonard_hofstadter Boy, a restraining order from Stephen Hawking. It’ll look so nice next to the ones he’s already got from Leonard Nimoy, Carl Sagan and Stan Lee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Leonard, do you recall when I said that I was going to revolutionize humanity’s understanding of the Higgs boson particle, and you said, Sheldon, it’s two a.m., get out of my bedroom?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 leonard_hofstadter Like it was ten hours ago. What about it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Well, I believe I’ve done it. And I’m only saying believe to sound modest, because, sweet Sam Houston, I did it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 leonard_hofstadter Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 raj_koothrappali That’s incredible. Oh, here, break out the math.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Oh, okay, let me see this. All right, so this particle here is the boson moving forward in time. Now, I was thinking… Howard, you go ahead and eat. This isn’t going to make any sense to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz Sheldon, I have a working understanding of physics.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Yeah, good for you, and don’t stop working on it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 raj_koothrappali Are you still going to tell him about you-know-who?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz Yep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 leonard_hofstadter Still going to introduce him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz Not on your life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Please, please, please let me meet Hawking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz I told you, no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper But I said I’m sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz No, you said, would it help if I said I’m sorry?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper And you never answered me. So who owes whom an apology now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz Sheldon, you’re a condescending jerk. Why on earth would I want to do something nice for you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Um, to go to Jewish heaven?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz Jews don’t have heaven.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Then to avoid Jewish hell?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz Have you met my mother? I live in Jewish hell.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Howard, please. This is Stephen Hawking. Perhaps my only intellectual equal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz Oh, you can’t be serious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Try to put yourself in my place. Imagine you’re the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but dogs. And then it turns out there’s another human being.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz Hang on. Are you saying the rest of us are dogs?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Yeah, okay, I can see you’re going to take this the wrong way. Let me try again. Imagine you’re the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but chimps.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz Get out of my lab.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Oh, now they’re so much smarter than dogs. Have you seen them on those little bicycles?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz Get out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper How about dolphins?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz Out!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 leonard_hofstadter So, come on, how was the first day with Hawking?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz It was great. We talked about movies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Oh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz I showed him some card tricks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Oh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz He even let me read a couple pages from his new book.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Oh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz Something got you down there, bunky?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Howard, please, I’m begging you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 leonard_hofstadter Raj, you’re our group historian. Has Sheldon ever begged before?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 raj_koothrappali Three times. He begged the Fox network not to cancel Firefly. He begged the TNT network to cancel Babylon 5. And when he got food poisoning at the Rose Bowl Parade, he begged a deity he doesn’t believe in to end his life quickly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Do you understand how important Hawking is to me? When I was six years old, I dressed up as him for Halloween.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz You’re kidding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper No, sir, no, I took my dad’s desk chair, attached a Speak & Spell to it and made my sister push me up and down the block to trick or treat. Granted most people thought I was R2-D2, but still, I got a lot of candy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz You don’t seem to be understanding the English word no. Maybe a different language will help. Russian, nyet. Chinese, bu. Japanese, iie. Klingon, qo. Binary coded Ascii, 0110111001101111.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper It’s actually 01100111.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz No!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper I’m not asking for me, I’m asking for Hawking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz Let me try gansta, hells no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Okay, look, how about this? Just give him my paper on the Higgs boson. If he sees the incredible breakthrough I’ve made, he’ll reach out to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 leonard_hofstadter What if he doesn’t?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper He will, he’s really smart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz That’s an interesting idea. Why don’t you give me a minute to talk it over with my friends?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper How do I do that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz You walk away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Walking away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 leonard_hofstadter You do realize you own his ass right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz I do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 raj_koothrappali You can make him do anything you want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz Yeah, I know, I’m just trying to figure out how much I want to punish him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 raj_koothrappali Well, don’t be too mean.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Hey, fellas, I’m thinking about making some freshly brewed iced tea if anyone would like some.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 raj_koothrappali I wouldn’t mind a glass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper I wasn’t talking to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 raj_koothrappali Bring him to his bony knees.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz Sheldon, come on back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Yes, yes. What did you decide?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz I’ll give your paper to Professor Hawking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Great, thank you. Oh, that’s terrific.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz But in exchange, I’d like you to do a few things for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper What kinds of things?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz Are you familiar with the 12 labours of Hercules?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Of course.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz You should be so lucky.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper All right. What would you like me to do first?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz Well, I thought I’d start you off by polishing my belt buckles.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Oh. By all means. When I was a boy, I would polish my Mee-Maw’s silver. And she would entertain me with stories about growing up in Oklahoma. Interesting woman. You know, she once killed a prairie dog with a gravy boat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz That’s nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper That’s a lot of belt buckles.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz Funny thing is, I only have one belt. Anyway, I’ll let you get started. Oh, by the way, the little marks, uh, that look like water spots, I tend to stand too close to the urinal, so what you’re seeing there is splash back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper You make sissy on your belt buckles? Mee-Maw’s forks never had that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz Here is a black light to check them. And for your own peace of mind, you might not want to shine that around the rest of the room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz Sheldon, these look great. They’re like magnificent little crowns to hang over my magnificent little jewels. How’d you get them so shiny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Oh, I-I buffed them with Turtle Wax. The man down at Pep Boys says from now on, the urine should just bead up and roll right off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz Way to go the extra mile. Your Mee-Maw would be proud.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper My Mee-Maw must never know of this. Now will you give Professor Hawking my paper?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz Oh, my dear boy, no. Okay. Next, this is a sexy French maid costume I bought for Bernadette. I thought it might spice things up and get her to dust my room at the same time, but I was wrong and really wrong.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper And you want me to return it for you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz No, no, no, mon petit cherie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper What are you all staring at? Didn’t you ever see a man try to get a meeting with Stephen Hawking before?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 penny Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 penny It’s not Saturday night. Why are you doing your laundry?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper This is not my laundry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 penny Wow, are these Amy’s? Kind of trashy, good for her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Those are Howard’s.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 penny Ugh. Why are you washing Howard’s man panties?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Because if I don’t, he won’t give my paper to Stephen Hawking. He’s a famous physicist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 penny Yeah, yeah, I know, he’s the wheelchair dude who invented time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper That’s close enough.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 penny I don’t understand, why doesn’t Howard just introduce you to the guy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Because he’s punishing me for being a, quote, condescending jerk. You don’t think I’m condescending, do you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 penny Well…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Oh, I’m sorry, condescending means…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 penny I know what it means. And yes, you love correcting people and putting them down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Au contraire. When I correct people I am raising them up. You should know, I do it for you more than anyone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 penny Come on, you do it to feel superior. I see that twinkle in your eye when someone says who instead of whom or thinks the moon is a planet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Or Don Quixote is a book about a donkey named Hotay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 penny See, there it is, there’s that twinkle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Well, I can’t help it. That’s an involuntary twinkle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 penny What do you want me to tell you, Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper I want you to tell me that Howard is being mean to me for no reason.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 penny Fine, Howard is being mean to you for no reason.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper I knew it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz What’s the matter?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 bernadette_rostenkowski Every time I spend the night, your mom slaps me on the behind and says, go get ‘im.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz It’s not her fault. She’s getting hormone replacement therapy. Makes her crazy horny. Check this out, I got Sheldon to wear the French maid’s costume.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, my God, that’s terrible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz Hey, I gave you first crack at it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 bernadette_rostenkowski Why are you doing that? You’re being mean to him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz He’s mean to me all the time. You’ve heard him tease me about not having a doctorate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 bernadette_rostenkowski If you don’t want to get teased about that, get a doctorate. I have one, they’re great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz Oh, come on, the man torments me. I’m just letting him have a little taste of his own medicine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 bernadette_rostenkowski It’s not the same thing. Sheldon doesn’t know when he’s being mean because the part of his brain that should know is getting a wedgie from the rest of his brain.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz Fine, I’ll just make him do a couple more things, then I’ll stop.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 bernadette_rostenkowski No, you have to stop now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 debbie_wolowitz Bernadette, I want to remind you, you promised to take me dress shopping tomorrow!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, damn. I’m sorry, I can’t make it, but Sheldon’s going to go with you! And that’s the last thing you do to him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 debbie_wolowitz Sheldon! I need your help!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper What is it now, Mrs. Wolowitz?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 debbie_wolowitz It’s this dress. When I put my front in, my back pops out. When I put my back in, my front pops out. It’s like trying to keep two dogs in a bathtub!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper What do you want me to do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 debbie_wolowitz We’re gonna have to work as a team. Get in here, grab a handful, and start stuffing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper I’m not sure how to do this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 debbie_wolowitz It’s easy, just pretend you’re putting away a sleeping bag.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Sleeping bags don’t usually sweat this much, but okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 debbie_wolowitz Now zip me up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Oh, if we squeeze you any tighter, you may turn into a diamond.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 debbie_wolowitz You’re right, who am I kidding? You should have seen me when I was young, Sheldon. The fellas used to line up and bring me boxes of candy. Why did I eat it all? Would you hold me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Oh, no, you know, I’m not really the holding kind of… Oh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz Oh, guys, I just remembered. I got you some Hawking souvenirs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 leonard_hofstadter What are these?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz Gears and springs from his wheelchair. Pretty cool, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 raj_koothrappali Wow, that’s amazing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz Yeah, I made an adjustment on the motor drive and when I was putting it back together I could not for the life of me figure out where they went.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper I did it. Had to go to three clothing stores, but we finally found a dress that could envelop your mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz I should have sent you to the custom car cover place in Altadena. They have her pattern on file.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Humorous. Now will you please present my paper to Professor Hawking?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz I don’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Oh, for heaven’s sake. I did your laundry, I pee-pee-proofed your belt buckles, I, I even sprained my wrist helping your mother lift her bosom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz All right, Sheldon, there’s only one thing left I want you to do. Don’t worry, it’s an easy one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz Give me a compliment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Fine. You have very tiny hands.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz No, about my job. I want you to tell me I’m good at what I do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper You’re obviously good at what you do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz Well, then why are you always ripping on me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Oh, I understand the confusion. I have never said that you are not good at what you do. It’s just that what you do is not worth doing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 leonard_hofstadter It’s nicer than anything he’s ever said to me. I’d take it and run.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz Thank you, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Now will you give my paper to Hawking?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz Sorry, I can’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper What, why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 howard_wolowitz I gave it to him three days ago. He was really impressed. He wants to meet you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper All right, then. Thank you, Howard. Please let Professor Hawking know that I’m available at his earliest convenience.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 raj_koothrappali I thought he might be a little more excited.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 leonard_hofstadter Give it a second.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Professor Hawking, it’s an honour and a privilege to meet you, sir.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 stephen_hawking I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper I want to thank you for taking time to see me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 stephen_hawking My pleasure. I enjoyed reading your paper very much. You clearly have a brilliant mind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 stephen_hawking Your thesis that the Higgs boson is a black hole accelerating backwards through time is fascinating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Thank you. It just, it came to me one morning in the shower.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 stephen_hawking That’s nice. Too bad it’s wrong.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper What do you mean wrong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 stephen_hawking You made an arithmetic mistake on page two. It was quite the boner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper No, no, th-th-th-that can’t be right. I-I don’t make arithmetic mistakes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 stephen_hawking Are you saying I do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 sheldon_cooper Oh, no, no, no, of course not. It’s just, I was thinking… Oh, gosh, golly, I made a boo-boo, and I gave it to Stephen Hawking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode21 stephen_hawking Great, another fainter.
