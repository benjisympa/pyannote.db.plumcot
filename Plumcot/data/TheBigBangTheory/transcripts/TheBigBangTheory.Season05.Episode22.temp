TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 sheldon I wish you could all be inside my head. The conversation is sparkling. Fine, I’ll tell you. A lichen is an organism made up of two separate species, fungi and algae. If you could merge with another species, what species would you pick and why? Hint, there is a right answer. None of you will get it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 raj Okay, uh, I’d pick swan because, uh, the resulting hybrid would have the advanced industrial civilization of a human and the long graceful neck I’ve always dreamed of having.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 sheldon Wrong. Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 leonard Horse, but mostly just for the height. A little bit for the genital girth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 sheldon Wrong, and let’s keep it clean, shall we?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 howard Kangaroo, uh, I’d be a Kanga-Jew. The first of my people to dunk a basketball.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 leonard Also instead of just living in your mother’s house, you could actually live inside her body.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 sheldon Clever, but also wrong. No, the best organism for human beings to merge with is the lichen itself. That way, you’d be human, fungus, and algae. Triple threat. Like three-bean salad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 leonard Give me one circumstance in which that would be useful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 sheldon All right, picture this, a beautiful outdoor concert. Now, as a human, I appreciate Beethoven. As a fungus, I have a terrific view, growing out of a towering maple tree. And no thank you, expensive concessions. Because as an algae, I’ll just snack on this sunlight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 raj He got us again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 leonard No, he didn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 raj Anyway, if it’s okay with you, we should talk about Howard’s bachelor party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 sheldon Well, seems like a bit of a let down after our lichen conversation, but, what do you know, you’re half swan.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 raj I’ve been doing some research on strippers. One agency I spoke to, said I could get us a great price if we’re flexible on age range and number of limbs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 howard Sounds like loads of fun, but I promised Bernadette no strippers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 raj You don’t want strippers? You’re the king of strippers. The one club in North Hollywood named a pole after you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 howard What can I tell ya, I’m not into that stuff any more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 leonard Good for you, Howard. I’m proud of you. And still, you’re the first one of us to get married. We have to do something special.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 sheldon You know Germans have an interesting pre-wedding custom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 howard Well, it’s probably not for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 raj Maybe we can go up to Napa Valley. They’ve got that wine train.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 sheldon Boo, wine! But yay, trains. I’m in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 raj Anyway, it’s a beautiful time of year. Uh, you travel through the vineyards. There’s a tasting on board. And all the wild flowers are in bloom. It’s magic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 leonard Look at that, in 30 seconds, we went from hiring women to being them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 penny So, I hear you and the lost boys are having a bachelor party tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 leonard Yeah, just going to a restaurant, get some steaks and scotch. Nothing to worry about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 penny Why should I worry?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 leonard Well, I don’t know. It’s a bachelor party. There could be strippers. Wouldn’t that make you a little jealous?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 penny Oh, come on Leonard, it’s you. What’s going to happen? I mean, even if there was a stripper, all you’d do is avoid eye-contact and maybe offer to help her kid with his homework.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 leonard Hey, I am a young man in his sexual prime. Under the right conditions, I-I-I am capable of just, really crazy stuff.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 penny Really? What is the craziest thing you’ve ever done with a woman? And the time you and I had sex in the ocean does not count.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 leonard Oh, come on, that’s got to count. There was a really strong undertow, we could have died.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 penny Well, have fun tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 leonard Oh, I will. There is no telling what might happen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 penny Yeah, there is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 leonard You know, there’s nothing wrong helping some woman’s kid get through their S.A.T.’s.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 leonard Hey, I got to hand it to Raj, he found a really nice spot to have a bachelor party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 sheldon It’s not bad. Unless you compare it to a train; then it stinks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 leonard Are you drinking whisky?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 sheldon Indeed. If I’m to participate in the social convention that is the stag night, then I must embrace all its components, including tobacco, swear words, and yes, alcohol. Jeepers! That’s yucky.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 leonard Whoa, it’s a little early to start dropping J-bombs, don’t you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 wil_wheaton Hey, you guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 leonard Oh, hey, Wil. Nice of you to make it out tonight for Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 wil Well, it was either this or another hot tub party at George Takei’s house.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 sheldon I’m confused. I thought since our reconciliation, I was your friend in this group.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 wil Oh, I’m friends with Howard too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 sheldon Oh. I guess you’re just friends with anybody. Aagh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 stuart Hey, uh, Leonard, things are a little tight at the comic book store. I might need some help covering my share of the check.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 leonard Oh, yeah, no worries.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 stuart And maybe a few bucks for the valet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 leonard Oh, all right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 stuart And gas money to get home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 leonard Yeah, sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 stuart Great. You know what? This is my grandfather’s watch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 leonard Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 stuart 18-carat gold, got it in Europe during the war.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 leonard Wow, that’s very nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 stuart Mm-hmm. A hundred bucks and it’s yours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 raj Hey, everybody! The bachelor boy has arrived! For he’s a jolly good fellow…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 all For he’s a jolly good fellow, for he’s a jolly good fellow, which nobody can deny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 kripke Yes, yes, yes. He’s a jowwy good fewwow. What time do the stwippers awwive?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 howard Actually, Barry, we’re not going to have strippers tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 kripke Ah, then what the fwig did I get two hundwed dowwaws in singles out for?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 stuart You want to buy a watch?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 amy This is Maid of Honour Amy Farrah Fowler, bringing you the wedding activities just weeks out from the big day. Let’s check in with a beautiful, radiant young woman, and her friend who’s about to get married. Ladies, can you tell us what you’re doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 bernadette Um, these are gift bags we’re going to put in the hotel rooms of our out-of-town guests. This is a map of Pasadena. This is a list of local restaurants. And then, for Howie’s relatives, we have antihistamines, antacids, and medicine for diarrhoea and constipation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 penny Yeah, we labeled them stop and go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 amy All right, pivoting to the big question. Bernadette, on your wedding night you’ll be consummating your marriage. What do you think your first sexual position will be as husband and wife?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 bernadette Amy, please.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 amy Keeping in mind that whoever’s on top may set the tone for the marriage.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 penny Okay, show’s over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 amy Hey, they may conceive a child on their wedding night. Don’t you think the kid might get a kick out of knowing how it happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 penny I don’t care. Ask her things like are you going to take Howard’s name? Not who’s going to sit on who?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 penny Nice. You know, you should totally get BernadetteMaryAnnRostenkowskiWolowitz.com before someone snaps it up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 bernadette Howard already took care of it. Plus, he set up our beautiful wedding website with cute little facts about our family histories. Do you know, for a while in Poland, my family and his family were neighbours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 penny Oh, that’s cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 amy No, it’s not. I’ll explain it to you later.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 raj May I have your attention, please? We are hear tonight to celebrate the upcoming nuptials of my best friend Howard Wolowitz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 all Hear! Hear!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 sheldon And, apparently, Wil Wheaton’s best friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 wil Sheldon…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 sheldon Talk to the hand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 raj Does anyone have any words they’d like to say about our man of the evening?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 sheldon Yeah, I do. . As is the tradition, I have prepared a series of disrespectful jokes which generate humour at Howard’s expense. Prepare to have your ribs tickled. Howard, I always thought you’d be the last one of us to ever get married, because you are so short and unappealing. Am I right? Let’s see here. Oh, seriously though, Howard, you’re actually one of the most intelligent people I know. And that’s a zinger, because you’re not. I’ve always thought that you’d make someone a fine husband someday. Assuming you’d be able to get the parts, and develop the engineering skills to assemble them, which I don’t see as likely. Hacha! Okay, let me see here. Okay, kidding aside, Howard, you are a good friend. And I wish you nothing but happiness. Bazinga, I don’t!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 leonard Sheldon…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 sheldon Doubleazinga! I do! Good luck following that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 leonard So, Howard Wolowitz tying the knot. Leaving his crazy bachelor days behind. He was a wild one. Well, I guess we all kind of were. I remember this one time, I was with this girl at the beach. We were in the ocean and we started making out. I know, it was crazy. I wasn’t even wearing my Aquasocks. Then…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 kripke Nobody cares, Hofstadter. Wwap it up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 leonard Right. To Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 all To Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 leonard I totally had sex in the ocean.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 stuart Okay, I’ll go. Howard, when I think about you and Bernadette starting this wonderful life together, I can’t help but get a little choked up. I mean, look at you. You have everything. Look at me. I’m 37. I sleep in the back of a comic book store, and I have the bone density of an 80-year-old man. To Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 raj Yeah, to Howard. Um, uh, who’s next?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 kripke I’ll go. Howard, I’m gonna say something to you that evewybody’s thinking but no one has the couwage to say out woud. When you invite a man to a bachewor pawty, the impwication is, there will be stwippews. Maybe not compwetewy nude, but at weast pasties and G-stwings. That’s not unweasonable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 raj Hear, hear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 all Hear, hear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 raj Okay, uh, anybody else? Huh? No? Okay, it all comes down to me, the best man. Ooh! This grasshopper is kicking my ass-hopper. Okay, when I first came to this country, I-I didn’t know how to behave or how to dress, or what was cool, I was pretty lonely. But then I met Howard, and suddenly, my life changed, because we could be lonely together. This man became my whole world.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 kripke Yeah, nice speech, Fwancine. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 raj I’m not done, but thank you. I think back to all the good times we had, like, uh, when we went camping and spent that night telling each other all our secrets. I told him I’m addicted to pedicures and he told me he lost his virginity to his cousin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 howard She was my second cousin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 sheldon And the first woman you ever disappointed sexually. Ba-da-bazinga!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 raj Oh, oh, yeah, and then there was the time when Leonard and I took Howard to Las Vegas and paid a hooker to pretend she was Jewish and that she wanted his little kosher pickle. Of all the Howard humping hookers stories, that one’s my favourite!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 howard Okay, buddy, that’s it. Sit down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 raj Oh, oh, what about that tubby girl in the Sailor Moon costume at Comic-con?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 howard Don’t remember. Please sit down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 raj The only threesome I’ve ever had in my life, and I’m proud to say it was with this man right here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 howard Oh, please shut up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 raj Oh, oh, don’t get me wrong, nothing happened with me and Howard. There was about 200 pounds of Sailor Moon between us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 wil Oh, Internet, this is so going all over you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 sheldon Jeepers, I’m drunk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 howard Thank you for picking us up. There’s a warning, right there, on the scotch bottle. You cannot be operatin’ heavy machinery after you had a snootful of this, laddie!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 bernadette Funny. You boys have a nice time?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 howard Yeah, it was great. And low-key, like I promised. No hanky-panky, no strippers. Just the guys telling jokes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 bernadette That’s nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 howard How about you? Did you have a fun night? Yeah, we, uh, made gift bags, had wine, and then went online and saw this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 rajs_voice Of all the Howard humping hookers stories, that one’s my favourite.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 raj You know, we’re not that far from my apartment. If you stop the car, I can walk from here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 bernadette You ain’t goin’ anywhere, Threeway.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 howard Bernadette, listen…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 bernadette You lied to me. You said you told me about all the girls you’ve been with, but you never mentioned your cousin, the prostitute or Raj!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 raj Seriously, you don’t even have to stop the car. Anything under ten miles an hour and I can combat-roll into the street.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 howard Okay, just to set the record straight, I didn’t hire the prostitute, she was a gift from him. Shame on you, Raj. That is not how we treat women in this country.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 bernadette Don’t you try and blame this on him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 raj Thank you, Bernadette.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 bernadette Zip it, pervert!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 bernadette I don’t know what I’m going to do. I’m supposed to marry Howard in a couple of weeks and I’m not sure I even know who the man is any more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 amy I’m curious what’s bothering you most, the borderline incest, the prostitute or group sex with the girl dressed as the children’s cartoon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 penny Amy, remember when we went over things that would be helpful and things that wouldn’t?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 amy Right. And that was…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 penny Not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 bernadette When I first met Howard, he seemed so innocent to me, just a sweet little guy who lives with his mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 penny Well, if that’s what you like, I’ll take you to the comic book store, the place is full of ’em.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 bernadette Wait a minute. You set me up with Howard. Did you know about all the creepy stuff he was into?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 penny Well, a little. You hear stuff.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 bernadette Why didn’t you tell me
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 penny Well, I was gonna, but I didn’t think it would go past the first date. Then, when it did, I thought for sure it wouldn’t go past you meeting his mother. Definitely not past the two of you sleeping together. I mean, the warning signs were there, this is really on you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 bernadette My God! I thought you were my friend. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 amy I don’t think that was helpful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 howard Hi, Bernie, it’s me again. Please call me back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 raj Dude, I am so sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 howard It’s not your fault, it’s mine. I did all that stuff, not you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 leonard Actually, you did do one of them together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 sheldon Here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 howard What is this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 sheldon You’re upset. The convention is to bring an upset person a hot beverage.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 howard No, but what is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 sheldon Chicken broth. It seemed culturally appropriate. Also, there was a single cube of chicken bouillon in the cupboard when I moved in and it’s been bothering me for the last eight years. So, as they say, two birds.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 howard I don’t know what my next move is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 leonard Well, Howard, I don’t know much about women.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 howard Yeah?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 leonard No, uh, that, that’s it. I don’t know much about women. Raj, you got anything?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 raj I’ve got the phone number of the tubby girl from Comic-Con.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 howard I’m not calling the girl from Comic-con.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 raj All right. More Sailor Moon for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 sheldon I just threw up the bachelor party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 penny Please come out, Bernadette. Let’s talk through this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 bernadette No, leave me alone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 amy Perhaps you should give him a taste of his own medicine. Do you have a cousin who you find attractive?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 penny Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 amy Hey, you introduced him to the sleazebag. I’m just trying to clean up your mess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 howard Oh, hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 penny Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 howard I need to talk to Bernadette.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 penny Well, I don’t think she wants to talk to anyone right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 howard All right, well, could you at least give her a message?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 penny Yeah, sure, I guess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 howard Tell her I’m really sorry, and if she doesn’t want to marry me, I get it. But what I really want her to know is the guy that she’s disgusted by, is the guy that I’m disgusted by, too. But that guy doesn’t exist any more, he’s gone, and the reason is because of her. So, if this relationship is over, let her know that she made me a better man, and tell her thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 penny Oh, my God, Howard. That’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever heard. And it came out of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 bernadette Howie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 howard Penny has a message for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 bernadette I heard. Your voice, not unlike your mother’s, travels through walls.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 howard Do you want me to go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 bernadette No. Come here. I’m still really mad at you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 howard I get that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 bernadette Is there anything else about your past I should know?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 howard Couple things, but, you know, most of them happened overseas. I’ll tell you later.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 bernadette Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 howard So, is the wedding still on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 bernadette Yeah, the wedding’s still on. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 amy Oh, thank God. I’m still a maid of honour. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 penny Oh, what the hell. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 amy This is kind of hot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 leonard Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 penny What’s with the robe?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 leonard I’m gonna have sex with you right here, right now, on that washing machine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 penny No, you’re not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 leonard Come on, please.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 penny If you want to do something, you can help me fold this sheet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode22 leonard Folding a sheet in my underwear, still pretty crazy.
