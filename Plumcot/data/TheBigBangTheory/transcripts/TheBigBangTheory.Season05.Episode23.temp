TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 howard Howard Wolowitz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 voice Hey, Howard. Dave Roeger here at NASA. We need to talk about your upcoming mission.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 howard Yes, yes, I’ve been doing my push-ups. I’m still stuck at nine, but that’s going all the way down with no one holding me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 roeger That’s great, uh, but that’s not why I called. We’ve run into a bit of a snafu. Your Soyuz capsule failed the pressurization test, so bottom line, mission’s been scrubbed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 howard You’re kidding. So what does that mean? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Boy, I got to tell you, I’m really disappointed. This was my dream ever since I was a little kid. Okay, well, uh, thanks for the call. Yep, you, too. Yes! Thank you! Oh! Oh! I’m not gonna die in space! I’m gonna die the way God intended, in my late 50s, with a heart full of pastrami.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 sheldon I’m going to need a larger shirt. This one’s a little tight under the arms.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 assistant Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 leonard Do you think maybe it’s tight because you’re wearing long underwear?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 sheldon Yes, of course that’s why it’s tight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 leonard All right, let me rephrase the question. Why are you wearing long underwear?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 sheldon You’re kidding. Shouldn’t the question be why aren’t you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 sheldon Leonard, these rental tuxedos have been worn by hundreds of sweaty strangers. I don’t like my own sweat touching my skin, how do you think I feel about theirs?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 assistant Why don’t you slip this on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 sheldon Said the hangman offering a noose.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 raj Well, that wasn’t as entertaining as when he rents bowling shoes, but it was right up there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 howard Well, that’s it. My orders have been rescinded. I am officially no go to space.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 leonard I’m sorry, Howard, but I got to tell you, I’m a little relieved you’re not going.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 howard Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 leonard Come on, you were gonna go up in a rocket designed in the 1960s by the Russians.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 howard Yeah, so?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 leonard When was the last time you were at Best Buy and you heard someone say, ooh, check out this Blu-ray player, it must be good, it was built in Russia”?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 howard Well, their technology isn’t that bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 raj When you come back to Earth in a Soyuz capsule, you free-fall from space at 500 miles per hour, and the only thing that slows you down is a little parachute that pops out right before you crash into the ground. And the whole thing was designed by the same brilliant minds who were unable to capture Rocky and Bullwinkle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 howard All right, well, whatever. I wasn’t worried.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 raj You weren’t?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 howard Let me explain the difference between you and me. You watch Star Trek. I live it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 raj Oh, please. I don’t remember the episode of Star Trek where the guy never goes to space and brags about it in a tuxedo store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 howard Make all the jokes you want, but there’s only one of us here brave enough to almost do what I almost did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 sheldon Ah, much better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 leonard You must be burning up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 sheldon A little. But not more than your urethras will be after whatever’s in those pants swims up them. Well, I cut quite the dashing, yet hygienic figure, don’t I? I look like the Flash about to get married. Oh! A tissue! A tissue! Oh, good Lord!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 assistant Uh, where’s he going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 leonard He keeps emergency Purell in the car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 sheldon Keys! Keys! Keys!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 penny Hey, you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 leonard Before I come in, you should know, I have gas. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 penny For the record, not your worst opening line.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 leonard Check it out. It’s the gas I use in my free-electron laser to support high voltages. But it also has an interesting secondary use. Here. Breathe this in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 penny B-Before I do it, if you’re a cop you have tell me, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 leonard Just try it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 penny Okay. What’s it supposed to… Oh, my God, this is so freaky!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 leonard You’re a mean one Mr. Grinch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 penny Okay. Me, me, me. Ready? Leonard, I am your father.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 leonard I have never been more attracted to a woman who sounds like a man in my life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 penny Oh, Mm. Hey, you know how we’ve been taking things slow?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 leonard Mm-hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 penny Well, I’ve been thinking, and maybe I’m ready to take things a little faster.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 leonard Oh, great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 penny Mm-hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 leonard And I promise, after waiting four months, fast is what you’re gonna get.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 penny You know, just-just one thing. Look, we’re in a really great place right now, and I don’t want to do anything that will make stuff all weird again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 leonard So we won’t let it get weird.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 penny Okay. Oh, and just a heads-up, mm, since the last time you saw me naked, I got a Cookie Monster tattoo. The acceptable responses when you see it are awesome or nothing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 leonard What about Cookies!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 sheldon Amy? Amy? Amy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 amy Seven o’clock, right on time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 sheldon It’s not an accident. I waited outside your door for twenty minutes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 amy Well, dinner’s almost ready.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 sheldon I must say, I was surprised you chose to spend our date night in your apartment. As I mentioned, the Pasadena City Council is debating longer crosswalk times, and later, the LEGO store is having a midnight madness sale. You ask anyone, that’s a hot date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 amy Tempting choices, but I have something special planned for tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 sheldon What can be more special than having an adequate amount of time to cross the street on your way to buy a tiny LEGO Indiana Jones?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 amy With our friends moving forward in their relationships, I’ve decided that we should make progress in ours as well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 sheldon Oh, dear Lord. Two years ago, we didn’t even know each other, and now I’m in your apartment after dark. How much faster can this thing go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 amy I had a feeling you’d be reluctant, which is why I’m going to dip into my neurobiological bag of tricks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 sheldon Oh, you brain monkeys kill me. Dip away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 amy I have devised an experiment that I believe will increase your feelings for me in an accelerated time frame.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 sheldon And how do you propose to do that? Uh, hope you’re not thinking about some sort of LSD thought control. Because there’s only one mind-expanding drug that this man enjoys, and that’s called school.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 amy Human beings form emotional attachments as they grow up. In your case, to your mother, superheroes, et cetera. I’m going to attempt an experiment that will get you to transfer those feelings to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 sheldon Well, seems what’s on the menu tonight is malarkey with a big side of poppycock.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 amy We’ll see. Let’s start with a little romantic dinner music, shall we?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 sheldon Super Mario Bros. theme?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 amy Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 sheldon I see what you’re doing. You’re attempting to build on the work of Ebbinghaus by triggering an involuntary memory of me playing that game, admittedly the happiest 600 hours of my childhood, but it won’t work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 amy Fine. There’s no reason we still can’t have a lovely dinner. Why don’t you have a seat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 sheldon Da-da-da da-da dum, boink, boink.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 amy May I offer you something to drink?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 sheldon You know I don’t drink.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 amy Not even strawberry Quik?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 sheldon I love strawberry Quik. It’s my favourite pink fluid, narrowly beating out Pepto-Bismol.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 amy Oh, I know. I think it will go nicely with what I have prepared for dinner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 sheldon Spaghetti with little pieces of hot dog cut up in it!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 amy Just like your mommy used to make.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 sheldon Oh yummy, yummy! We should do this more often. Uh-oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 leonard I’m sorry. I did, I crossed a line. I didn’t mean to!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 penny Who says something like that right in the middle of sex?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 leonard I don’t know, it just came out. People say weird things during sex all the time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 penny Okay, well, they sure as hell don’t say that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 leonard It was the heat of the moment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 penny No, the heat of the moment is, ooh, yeah, just like that, not will you marry me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 leonard I’m sorry. Just, just give me another chance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 penny Why, so you can crawl under the covers and go, hey, baby, want to go look for houses in neighbourhoods with good schools?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 leonard Again, I’m sorry. You know, with Howard and Bernadette getting married, I got caught up in a little wedding fever. I take it back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 penny You can’t take something like that back. I mean, what are we even supposed to do now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 leonard Okay, at some point, we’ll look back and this is going to be a funny story. Why don’t we just start doing that now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 penny You’re kidding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 leonard No. Hey, do you remember that time when I proposed to you in bed? And you were all, like, what are you doing? That was so funny. So funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 penny It’s not funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 leonard Give it a minute. Is that a little smile I see there? I should go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 howard Hey, I was thinking. For our first dance at the wedding, what if we learn the final number from Dirty Dancing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 bernadette You’re kidding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 howard No, come on. How cool would that be? Me running into your arms, you lifting me up into the air.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 bernadette Oh, you’re in a good mood.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 howard Yeah, well, why wouldn’t I be? You know, I’m marrying the girl of my dreams, and I finally got my mother to agree not to come on our honeymoon. Oh, hang on. Oh, it’s NASA. Wolowitz. Oh! Hi, Dave. What’s up? No kidding. Really? Well, that’s great news. Great, great news. All right, I’ll watch my e-mail for the details. Okay, talk soon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 bernadette What’s so great?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 howard It looks like I’m going into space after all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 bernadette Oh, Howie, that’s wonderful!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 howard Uh-huh, wonderful. Yay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 bernadette What happened? I thought they cancelled your mission.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 howard Th-They did. But NASA really wants my telescope up on the space station, so they’re putting me on an earlier launch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 bernadette When?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 howard A week from Friday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 bernadette What? We’re getting married that Sunday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 howard You’re right. I, I can’t go to space. I have to get married, and no one can say that’s not a good reason. I’ll call him back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 bernadette Wait. I don’t want to be the one who stands in your way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 howard Well, too bad, you already did. It’s a done deal. Oh, well. But I forgive you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 bernadette No. That’s not how I want to start our marriage, killing your dream. We’ll have the wedding when you get back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 howard But what about all the plans and the guests?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 bernadette We’ll call them. Although my dad’s gonna go a little nutso over losing his deposits.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 howard You’re right, he is! Your dad’s gonna be furious. There’s no way he’s gonna let us postpone this wedding. Well, we tried.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 bernadette I’ll talk to him. He won’t say no to his little girl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 howard No. I, uh, I should talk to him, man to man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 bernadette But, Howie, my dad can be a bully. He’s gonna make you cancel your space flight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 howard We can only hope… that he doesn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 sheldon Bishop to queen four, level two. Check.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 leonard Sheldon, knight takes bishop. You all right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 sheldon I’m fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 leonard Are you? You left your queen exposed from above, you trapped your knight in the corner, and you keep sighing and saying, why me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 sheldon Very well. Can I ask you a question about women?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 leonard We got you that book last year. Wasn’t everything in there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 sheldon No, I’m having a relationship problem with Amy. And by the way, that book gave me nightmares.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 leonard Well, if it makes you feel any better, I screwed things up pretty good with Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 sheldon Look at us, Leonard, engaging in the social convention of men bellyaching about their ol’ ladies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 leonard I guess we are. So, what’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 sheldon Believe it or not, Amy has embarked on a campaign to increase my feelings for her by making me happy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 leonard I’m sorry, that must be very difficult for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 sheldon It’s awful. This morning, she arranged for me to be an Amtrak junior conductor for the day. It, it’s usually only open to children. She got them to make an exception.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 leonard Shame on her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 sheldon They let me blow the whistle, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 leonard She’s good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 sheldon I know. And it gets worse. Her efforts are causing me to have affectionate feelings for her at inappropriate times.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 leonard You mean, like in bed or in the shower?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 sheldon No! Would you please stop referencing that infernal book? For example, this morning, I was calculating the random motion of virtual particles in a vacuum, when suddenly the particles morphed into an image of Amy’s dandruff gently cascading down onto her pale, slightly hunched shoulders. Oh, what has that vixen done to me, Leonard? And how do I make it stop?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 leonard Well, if you had a physical relationship, I’d say propose during sex. Turns out that’s a real mood killer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 sheldon I assume we’re talking about you now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 leonard Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 sheldon So, that’s how this works? I complain, and then you complain, and no one offers any solutions?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 leonard Pretty much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 sheldon Well, no wonder the women are winning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 howard Mr. Rostenkowski, are you busy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 mr_rostenkowski I’m just looking at some old pictures. Come on in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 howard Family pictures, or… holy crap, that’s a dead person.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 mr_rostenkowski Last murder case before I retired. How many bodies do you see there? Careful, it’s a trick question.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 howard I’m not sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 mr_rostenkowski Nah, you’ll never get it. It’s a fraction.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 howard How about that. Anyway, sir, I need to talk to you about something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 mr_rostenkowski Walnut?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 howard No, thank you. I’m allergic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 mr_rostenkowski Oh, sure. My partner used to have that. He’s dead now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 howard From nuts?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 mr_rostenkowski Nah, his wife shot him. But she was nuts, so in a way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 howard Nice story. Anyway, the reason I wanted to talk to you is NASA has moved up my launch to the International Space Station.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 mr_rostenkowski Yeah, so?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 howard So, the date is going to conflict with me marrying your daughter. Now, I know what you’re going to say, I made a commitment to Bernadette and to your family and I’ve got a hell of a lot of nerve coming in here and demanding that we postpone this thing. Well, message heard and understood. Mission cancelled. Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 mr_rostenkowski Where are you going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 howard I’m sorry. May I be excused?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 mr_rostenkowski No, you may not. Let me tell you something. When I first met you… You just gonna stand there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 howard I’m sorry, I didn’t know, is this going to… Well, I should sit… May I be seat… Well, I’ll just sit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 mr_rostenkowski When I first met you, I didn’t like you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 howard I’m aware of that, sir.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 mr_rostenkowski But then you and I had some time together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 howard Uh-huh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 mr_rostenkowski It did not get better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 howard Right, right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 mr_rostenkowski That silly Beatle haircut and you riding around on a red Vespa, and you still living at home with your mother. To be honest, I thought Bernadette chose you to punish me. But then I heard about your astronaut thing, and I realized I judged you too fast. Maybe you are the right guy for my little girl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 howard Oh, I am. And just so you know, I’d still be an astronaut, even if I didn’t go to space. I’ve got an I.D. Card and a NASA golf shirt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 mr_rostenkowski No, no, you got to go. You can’t turn down an opportunity like this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 howard But what about the wedding and all the money you put down for the reception?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 mr_rostenkowski You let me worry about that. You go up to that space station, and you make me proud.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 howard Um, okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 mr_rostenkowski You got a problem with that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 howard All right, look, I’m gonna level with you. I’m terrified about going into space. What if I don’t make it back?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 mr_rostenkowski It’s gonna be okay, son.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 howard You really think so?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 mr_rostenkowski Of course. A pretty girl like Bernadette, she’ll find a new guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 penny Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 leonard Hey. Off to work?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 penny Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 leonard Have a nice night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 penny Okay, you, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 leonard Penny, just, wait. I’ve been thinking about what I said when we were in bed the other night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 penny Yeah, I’ve been thinking about it, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 leonard I noticed you never answered me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 penny You’re right. No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 leonard Uh, follow-up. Are we still dating?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 penny Yep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 leonard Is it still weird ’cause I proposed?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 penny Yep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 leonard I have a couple more quick questions. Do you want to call me from the car?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 penny No!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 leonard I played that pretty well. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 amy Hello, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 leonard What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 amy We’re playing doctor. Star Trek style.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode23 sheldon I’m in hell, Leonard. Don’t stop.
