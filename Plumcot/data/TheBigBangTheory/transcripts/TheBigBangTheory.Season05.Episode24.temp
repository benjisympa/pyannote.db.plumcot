TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 mission_control Launch step twelve reading okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 cosmonaut Launch step twelve acknowledged.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard Hey Mike?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 mike_massimino Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard I changed my mind. I don’t want to do this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 mike Good one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard Yeah, I’m a funny guy. I also have a hysterical bit planned for later where I pretend to cry through the whole launch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 leonard Sheldon, what channel is NASA TV?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 sheldon 289, right between the Game Show Network at 288 and the East coast feed of the Disney Channel on 290.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 amy I love his eidetic memory, it’s so sexy. Sheldon, what are the ingredients in Pringles?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 sheldon Dried potatoes, vegetable oil, corn flower, wheat starch, maltodextrin, salt, and my favourite ingredient of all, uniformity.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 amy The uterus quivers, does it not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 leonard There’s Howard’s rocket, live from Kazakhstan.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 bernadette Oh, God, I’m so nervous. I don’t think I can watch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 raj You’re nervous? I’ve been stress-eating for four days. Look at me. I’m wearing my fat pants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 sheldon Remarkable. In just under a half hour, 200 metric tons of fuel will ignite in a controlled explosion right beneath Howard’s keister. And all from a country whose entire contribution to the global economy, has been Tetris and mail-order brides.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 bernadette Give me those damn Pringles.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 cosmonaut Are all of the systems of the ship ready?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 mission_control Da.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 mike Okay, we’re in the final countdown. How you doing over there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard Good! Good! Oh, quick question, I missed it in the briefing. How much urine do these suits hold?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 mike Hey, Froot Loops, want to hit your fan switch?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard Check.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 cosmonaut He calls you Froot Loops because of your very gay haircut?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard No, it’s ’cause I live with my mom and she makes me Froot Loops.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 cosmonaut Go with gay story, people are more accepting of that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 mike Actually, Froot Loops just got married to a girl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 cosmonaut Congratulations.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard Thanks, we decided to do it before the launch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 cosmonaut You and Mrs. Loops have a big wedding?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard Not exactly. Listen, if you don’t mind, I’m not really up for chatting. I’m just going to sit here quietly and let my life flash before my eyes. That went really quick. Let me try it again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard Close your eyes. Put out your hand. I got you something special.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 bernadette Come on, Howard. I’m not falling for that again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard No, here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 bernadette Oh, Howie. A little star, it’s beautiful. Put it on me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard Okay, but I’m going to have to get it back from you so I can take it to the International Space Station. That way, when I come home, you will have a star that was actually in space.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 bernadette Oh, my God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard Take that, every guy who’s ever bought you anything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 bernadette This is the most amazing gift I’ve ever gotten.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard Really? Well, if you like it that much, then close your eyes and put out your hand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 mrs_wolowitz ‘m going to the supermarket to buy snacks for your trip. Do you want me to get those little boxes of Froot Loops you like?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard No! When I eat Froot Loops, the other astronauts make fun of me!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 bernadette Howard, I don’t want to wait until you’re back to get married.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 bernadette I want to be married to you before you get in that rocket.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard But I’m leaving in two days.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 mrs_wolowitz What about Apple Jacks?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard I don’t need to take cereal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 mrs_wolowitz What kind of breakfast do you think they’re going to give you in Russia?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard They invented blintzes. I’ll be fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 mrs_wolowitz They invented the lightbulb in New Jersey. It doesn’t mean they hand them out to you when you go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 bernadette We’ll have a quick little ceremony with just our friends, and we’ll still have the big reception with everyone when you get back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard Wow. Okay. Let’s get married.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 mrs_wolowitz You know what, I’ll buy you All-Bran in case you get stopped up in outer space.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 bernadette So anyway, we decided to go down to City Hall this afternoon get married, and then have the reception when Howard gets back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 leonard That’s so great. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard I mean, we know it’s short notice, but we’d love you all to come with us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 amy No, no, no, this is not the wedding I wanted! I want to wear my maid of honour dress and walk down the aisle with a hundred eyes on me, while a string quartet plays The Way You Look Tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 bernadette That wasn’t going to be our processional music.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 amy Well, it was going to be mine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 sheldon Thank you for the invitation, but I have to decline because it doesn’t sound like something I’ll enjoy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 leonard Come on, Sheldon, it’ll be fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 sheldon That’s what you said about The Green Lantern movie. You were 114 minutes of wrong.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 bernadette So, what do you say, Amy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 amy Can I wear my maid of honour dress?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 bernadette Seriously? You’re going to wear that thing to City Hall?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 amy It’s all I have left. You’re going to take that from me, too?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 penny Amy, you look great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 amy I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 leonard Where’d you get a beer?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 raj From that happy young couple over there with all the tattoos. Beautiful story, they’re in rival drug gangs, and they’re getting married. Shh, no one can know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 amy Look at all these people in love. It kind of gets you thinking, doesn’t it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 sheldon It does, indeed. Leonard, is it awkward being here with Penny given that you recently proposed to her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard You proposed to Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 leonard I don’t want to talk about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 raj Where did he pop the question? What did you say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 leonard She said no, can we drop it now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 penny It wasn’t a real proposal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 bernadette Why wasn’t it a real proposal?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 sheldon He asked her during coitus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard Did you get down on one knee or were you already there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 bernadette Howard, don’t talk like that on your wedding day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard I’m sorry, Ma… Bernadette. Ma… Burna… You’re ma Bernadette.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 penny Good move telling Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 leonard What, I can’t propose? I can’t talk to my friends? Is there anything else I’m not allowed to do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 amy All right, that’s enough. Today is not about you two. Today is about Howard and Bernadette and me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 registrar Folks, can I have your attention. It’s five o’clock, we’re going to be able to take three more couples. The rest of you will have to come back on Monday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 bernadette Oh, no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard I got this. Excuse me, but is there any way you could squeeze us in? See, I’m an astronaut and I’m leaving for Russia on Sunday so I can take a Soyuz rocket to the International Space Station.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 registrar Yeah, me, too. I’ll see you there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 bernadette I can’t believe we’re not going to get married.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 amy Excuse me, I’m going to go see if the couple at the front of the line needs a maid of honour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 cosmonaut So, I tell my wife, get a dog, don’t get a dog, I’m not walking it, I’m not feeding it, I’m not picking up after it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 mike You know you’re going to wind up walking it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 cosmonaut I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard Uh, shouldn’t you guys be talking about space stuff instead of dogs?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 mike Dimitri, Froot Loops would be more comfortable if we talked about space stuff.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 dimitri Okay, I’m going into space, and when I come back, I have to pick up a poodle crap.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 mike Is that better?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard You know, we could always drive to Vegas and get married.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 bernadette No, isn’t that kind of tacky?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 penny Hey, I know tons of people who got married in Vegas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 bernadette Are any of them still married?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 penny Yeah, I mean, not to the same people but…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 bernadette There’s got to be some place special we could do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 sheldon Leonard, where did you envision marrying Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 leonard Will you shut up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 raj Well, I know how to make it special.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard I told you we are not recreating the wedding from The Sound of Music.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 raj Yes, you made that brutally clear to me. What I was going to suggest is if that you’re willing to wait until Sunday morning, the Google satellite will be over Pasadena. You can have a wedding photograph from space.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 all Oh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 leonard That’s so cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard Oh, wait to go, Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 raj I keep telling you, if I wasn’t an astrophysicist, I would have been a party planner. It was always a coin flip.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard Okay, so we know we’re going to do it Sunday morning. Now we need to find a good place for the satellite to see us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 leonard How about our roof?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 bernadette Oh, I like that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard That’s great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 amy Oh, my gosh. I can’t believe my maid of honour dress is going to be on Google Earth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard So, we have the where and the when, but we still need to figure out who’s going to do the ceremony.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 penny Well, that’s easy. Anyone can go online and get ordained as a minister. I know a piercing parlour where, for a hundred bucks they’ll marry you and stick a wedding ring through any body part you want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 bernadette Great, well, who’s it going to be?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 sheldon I’ll do it, provided I can perform the ceremony in Klingon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 bernadette No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 sheldon What do you see in her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 dimitri Mission Control, say again, how fast is it leaking?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard Leaking? What’s leaking?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 dimitri Fuel. Shh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 mission_control Not bad. We feel okay to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 dimitri Okay, thanks Mission Control.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard There’s fuel leaking and we’re still going to go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 mike Don’t lose your Froot Loops, Froot Loops.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 dimitri This happens a lot. Nine times out of ten, no problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard What happens on the tenth time?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 dimitri Problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard Hey, guys, before I forget, I got you a little groomsman present.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 raj Oh, thanks, man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 sheldon You didn’t have to do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard Fantastic Four, annual number three from 1965, in mint condition. The one where Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Girl get married.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 leonard Oh, wow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 sheldon Oh, dear. I was afraid of this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 sheldon While a thoughtful gift, this comic book in this condition is worth at least a hundred dollars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard Yeah, so?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 sheldon I bought you and Bernadette a gravy boat worth eighty-eight dollars. Which places me in your debt and I can’t be in your debt because someday you might ask me to help you move, or to kill a man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 leonard I doubt he’ll ask you to kill a man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 sheldon Well, what if it’s his only way out? I can’t risk it. Here is twelve dollars. Now, we’re even. Wait, wait, wait, I bought a card. Give me two dollars. And for the record, this is why I hate gift-giving.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 amy Who is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard It’s the groom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 amy Can’t come in. Bad luck to see the bride.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard Okay, uh, fine. Bernie, I have to go pick up my mother. I’ll be right back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 bernadette Why can’t she drive herself?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard She doesn’t want to sit in her dress and wrinkle it so I’m going to lay her down in the back of my neighbour’s van.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 bernadette All right, just hurry!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard Okay, I’ll see you later, Ma… uh… lovely bride-to-be. I really got to watch that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 leonard Come on, Raj, we’re ready to start.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 raj What, we’re ready when I say we’re ready. Uh-du-du-du, ooh, okay, now we’re ready.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard Ma, you want to move your chair over here so you can see?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 mrs_wolowitz I’m fine where I am. I don’t want to fall off the roof.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard You’ll fall through the roof before you fall off it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 raj Penny. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 mr_rostenkowski Your new mother-in-law’s a piece of work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 bernadette Not now, Dad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 mr_rostenkowski She’s got a bigger mustache than me. Here you go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 bernadette Here you go? What am I, a football?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 mr_rostenkowski Like that guy could catch a football.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 raj Howard and Bernadette, the five of us stand before you as your friends and newly ordained ministers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 mrs_wolowitz Louder!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 bernadette They all got ordained, they’re all marrying us, it’s adorable, if you want to hear come closer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 raj Guys, when I look at the two of you starting your lives together, it fills my heart, It fills my, heart, okay, I’m going to need a minute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 penny Okay, I’ll, I’ll go. Howard and Bernadette, I know you two planned on getting married in a big fancy wedding, but when you’re in love, it doesn’t matter where or how these things happen. It just matters that you have each other.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 leonard Hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 penny Problem?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 leonard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 sheldon I think the Reverend Hofstadter is making an ironic connection between your statement about love and your rejection of his proposal in the bedroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 penny Oh, grow up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 leonard Hey, I didn’t say it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 amy All right, that’s enough from the both of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 penny Well, he started it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 amy Well, I’m ending it. Bernadette, I want to thank you for allowing me to be your maid of honour. I also want you to know, that I will be happy to do it again if this marriage craps out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 leonard Thank you, Amy. Very touching. Howard and Bernadette, you are lucky enough to be best friends who love each other. And that’s the strongest kind of love because at its core, it has kindness, patience, and respect. Qualities that are hard to find in people these days.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 sheldon Would you like some aloe vera? You just got burned. All right, my turn. Howard, Bernadette. Daq tu’ taH Daq yIn tlhej ghajtaH.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 bernadette Sheldon! I told you no Klingon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 sheldon Fine, I’ll do it in English, but it loses something. The need to find another human being to share one’s life with has always puzzled me. Maybe because I’m so interesting all by myself. With that being said, may you find as much happiness with each other as I find on my own. The Klingon would have made you cry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 raj I believe you two have prepared vows?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 bernadette Howard Joel Wolowitz, like you, this is going to be short and sweet. I love you with all my heart and soul and promise to be with you forever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 mrs_wolowitz Speak up!
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard Hey, from now on, she’s the only women who can yell at me! Until I met you, I couldn’t imagine spending my life with just one person. And now I can’t imagine spending one day of it without you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 all By the power vested in us, by the state of California…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 sheldon And the Klingon High Council…
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 all We now pronounce you husband and wife.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 mike That’s ignition. I love this part.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 dimitri Me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard I have strongly mixed feelings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 bernadette Oh, my God, it’s happening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 penny Did I miss it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 leonard No, come on in. Hurry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 bernadette I love that man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 raj Me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 penny I can’t believe it. This whole time, a small part of me thought he was lying.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 leonard This is it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 sheldon Boldly go, Howard Wolowitz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season05.Episode24 howard Oy vay!
