TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 stuart_bloom So, Howard’s really in space, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Mm-hmm, International Space Station. 250 miles that way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Right now, Howard’s staring down at our planet like a tiny Jewish Greek god. Zeusowitz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 sheldon_cooper I must admit, I can’t help but feel a twinge of envy. He can look out the window and see the majesty of the universe unfolding before his eyes. His dim, uncomprehending eyes. It’s like a cat in an airport carrying case.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter You know, it’s not exactly glamorous up there. The water that the astronauts drink is made from each other’s recycled urine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 stuart_bloom Must be nice. Nobody wants anything that comes out of me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali I wonder what he’s doing right this very second.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Mm, conducting experiments in zero gravity.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Peering through his telescope at the birth of the cosmos.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Whatever it is, we know his life will never be the same.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 debbie_wolowitz Howard. Can you hear me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 howard_wolowitz I can hear you without the phone,
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 debbie_wolowitz Don’t be snippy. I’m just excited to talk to my baby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 howard_wolowitz I’m excited to talk to you, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 debbie_wolowitz So, what’s this mishegas about you moving out to go live with the little Polish girl?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 howard_wolowitz How about calling her my wife?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 debbie_wolowitz Wives don’t take boys from their mothers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 howard_wolowitz They do. That’s why we marry them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 debbie_wolowitz I just hope I’m not dead from a broken heart before you get back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Ma, please. Everyone from NASA is listening to this phone call.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 debbie_wolowitz Good. They should know what a horrible son you are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Okay, Ma, great talking to you. Gotta go. Well, space is ruined.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 amy_farrah_fowler This is so exciting. Soon, my upper lip will be the same fake blonde as my beautiful best friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 penny Hey, this is my natural hair colour. Now. So, does Sheldon have anything special planned for you tomorrow night?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, yes. According to the Relationship Agreement, on the anniversary of our first date, he must take me to a nice dinner, ask about my day and engage in casual physical contact that a disinterested onlooker might mistake for intimacy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 penny That’s hot. You kids better use protection.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 amy_farrah_fowler How long does this stay on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 penny Just a couple of minutes. You’ve really never done this before?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 amy_farrah_fowler Once in high school, but I dozed off and woke up with second-degree chemical burns on my face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 penny Oh, my gosh, that’s awful. The other kids make fun of you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 amy_farrah_fowler No, I had a cover story, I told everyone it was herpes. So, how’s everything going with you and Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 penny Uh, I don’t know, it’s still kind of weird. We haven’t really recovered since he proposed to me in the middle of sex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, boo-hoo. If Sheldon proposed to me during sex, my ovaries would grab on to him and never let go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Leonard, where do you stand on the anthropic principle?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Interesting question. On the one hand, I always thought…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 sheldon_cooper You don’t even know what it is, do you? The anthropic principle states that if we wish to explain why our universe exists the way it does, the answer is that it must have qualities that allow intelligent creatures to arise who are capable of asking the question. As I am doing so eloquently right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter I know what the anthropic principle is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Of course. I just explained it to you. Now, where do you stand on it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Where do you stand on it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Strongly pro.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Then I believe that God created the world in six days, and on the seventh he made you to annoy me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Hey, guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Yeah, wait, Raj, where do you stand on the anthropic principle?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali I’m all for it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Attaboy!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Well, hang on. Why do you believe that he knows what it is and I don’t?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Oh, Leonard. Let’s not take a saw to the branch we’re sitting on, shall we?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Hey, uh, if you guys are free tonight, I heard about a spa where you soak your feet n a pool full of little fish that eat all the dead skin right off them. I don’t need to tell you in Los Angeles, sandal season is year round.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Actually, I’m hanging out with Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Oh, okay. Sounds like it’s me and you, Sheldon. How about we sic some guppies on those puppies?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 sheldon_cooper As I’ve stated before on numerous occasions, the only sea creature I would even consider being eaten by is the Kraken, because the last words I would hear are “Release the Kraken.” That never gets old. “Release the Kraken!” Oh, chills. Besides, I’m having dinner with Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Oh, okay. I’ll just go home and be alone. Which is cool. I eat alone, I sleep alone, I cry alone, so, cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Darn. If you weren’t busy, I’d ask you to join us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Really? I can come? Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, are you sure you want to be bringing Raj on your date night with Amy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Oh, absolutely. I have a contractual obligation to provide Amy with conversation and casual physical contact, but nowhere is it specified that I can’t outsource that to an Indian.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 bernadette_rostenkowski Howie? Howie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Hey, there’s my beautiful bride. Can you see me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 bernadette_rostenkowski I can. How are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 howard_wolowitz I’m amazing. I mean, this is even better than I dreamed. I look out the window, and it’s all so unbelievable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 bernadette_rostenkowski Good for you. I just had a seemingly endless dinner with your mom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Oh, yeah? That’s nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 bernadette_rostenkowski It was. Until I found out you never told her we’re not gonna live with her. Let’s talk about that for a minute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Hey, look, this pen is floating. How crazy is that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 bernadette_rostenkowski You said you told her, but you never did!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Okay, okay, I know you’re upset, but let me share something I’ve learned since I got here. You realize how small your problems are when you’re looking down on them from space. Now, come on, that’s got to make you feel better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 bernadette_rostenkowski How clear is the image of me on that screen?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Pretty clear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 bernadette_rostenkowski Do I look like I feel better?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 howard_wolowitz I mean, it’s not, like, HD quality.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 bernadette_rostenkowski Listen, mister, you’re gonna talk to your mother and you’re gonna fix this, or that thing I said I was gonna do to you the minute you got home, you can do to yourself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 dimitri Like he’s been doing since he got here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, this place is so romantic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Oh, I’m glad you like it. Raj picked it out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 amy_farrah_fowler Well, when you see him, tell him I say thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Tell him yourself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Yoo-hoo! Over here!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 amy_farrah_fowler I don’t understand. What’s he doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 sheldon_cooper I invited him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 amy_farrah_fowler On our date? Sheldon, that’s not okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Yes, it is. There’s a loophole in the Relationship Agreement.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 amy_farrah_fowler You found a loophole?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Sorry I started without you. I’m a little nervous. It’s been a long time since I’ve been on a date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 amy_farrah_fowler I can’t believe I bleached my moustache for this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali You should go to my girl. She’ll knock out those sideburns for free.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali You know, Amy, I don’t even think you and I have had a real conversation. Let’s use tonight to get to know each other a little better. You start.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 amy_farrah_fowler Go home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali I don’t understand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, how could you do this? It’s our second anniversary.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali It’s your anniversary? Oh, my God, I had no idea. Amy, please, let me make this right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 amy_farrah_fowler Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali My pleasure. Waiter? A bottle of champagne and three glasses. Oh, boy, isn’t this romantic?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Oh, I hope that’s a rhetorical question, because I have no clue.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 penny This is great. What’s the occasion?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter No occasion. You know, things have been a little weird between us, so I wanted to throw together a fun night just for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 penny That is so sweet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter I got all your favourites. Beer, wings, sliders. We can watch the football game. I even painted my stomach.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 penny Go Sports?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Well, in case you were in the mood for baseball, I didn’t want to look ridiculous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 penny This is awesome. I love it!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Good, I’m glad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 penny Gosh, I worked my ass off today. This is exactly what I needed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Great. Just relax and enjoy. Tonight is all about you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 penny Ah, thank you!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter So, where exactly are we in this relationship?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 penny Oh, come on. I just told you I had a hard day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter You’re right, I’m sorry. Let’s watch the game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 penny Great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter I just know the longer we wait to talk about it, the weirder it gets.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 penny Sweetie, can I just be the girl tonight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Absolutely. You’re the girl, I’m the guy. Now, you watch your football game while I make you a little plate here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 penny Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Oh, I’ll get it. Go sports.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Hello-lo-lo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter What are you doing here? I thought you were out with Sheldon and Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali I was, but it’s their anniversary and I didn’t want to be a third wheel, so I figured I’d come over here and hang out with you and Penny on your date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Well, it’s not really a great time. Penny and I have some things we need to talk about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 penny No, we don’t! Come on in!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Sweet!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter I can’t believe I shaved my stomach for this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 dimitri Hey, Froot Loops. You got a phone call.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Who is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 dimitri A woman who says she’s your mother but sounds like your father.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Hey, Ma. You know, we could see each other if you turn on the computer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 debbie_wolowitz I’m not going near that fakakta thing. I’ll catch a computer virus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 howard_wolowitz You can’t catch a computer virus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 debbie_wolowitz Oh, so now you’re an astronaut and a doctor?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 howard_wolowitz What do you want, Ma?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 debbie_wolowitz Your wife says you have something important to tell me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Okay, here it is. Bernadette and I are starting a life together and…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 debbie_wolowitz Oh, God! You are gonna leave me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Ma…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 debbie_wolowitz It’s okay. Your father left me, you left me, I guess I’m just the kind of person people like to leave.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 howard_wolowitz It’s not definite. I’ll talk to Bernadette.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 debbie_wolowitz Don’t bother. I’ll just go sit in a hole in the ground so I’m no trouble when I die.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Stop it, Ma. I’m sure I can get Bernie to come around.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 debbie_wolowitz I knew it. I knew she was behind this. You listen to me, if you want to be a man you can’t let a woman tell you what to do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Okay, okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 dimitri Oy. I can’t believe these people won the Cold War.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Now, can we please change the subject?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 debbie_wolowitz Fine. Explain why you’ve been gone so long and I haven’t gotten a single letter. Not even a lousy postcard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali You know, I’m growing to like American football.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 penny Yeah, it’s fun, isn’t it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Well, it’s not the balls-to-the-wall action of badminton or cricket, but hey, what is?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 penny All right, who’s ready for another beer?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter I’m good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali No, thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 penny Girls.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Oh, I’m having the nicest time. You guys are like family to me. You know that, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter That’s great. Get out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali What? Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Penny and I have some issues we need to talk about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Oh pish on your issues. You guys are fine. Yes, you hit some bumps along the way. I mean, Penny, you’ve always known how this man has felt about you, but you made him grovel for affection.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 penny Okay, hold on…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Now, don’t blame yourself. He was a groveller from way back. But the point is, the two of you got past it. And, Leonard, you go and propose to this poor girl in the middle of sex? That was some weak tea, dude.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Some people might say it was romantic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Yeah, no. But yet, here you two are, still together. And that’s even after you and I had our crazy naked night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 penny That’s enough.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali I’m just saying that after everything you’ve been through, you get to look into each other’s eyes and say “I love you.” And that’s beautiful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Actually, to this day, she’s never really said it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Oh, Penny. That’s ridiculous. You know you love him. You, you look him in the eyes and you say it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 penny Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Oh come on, you know you want to say it. Say it. Say you love him. Say it!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali I really thought she would say it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 amy_farrah_fowler Have I ever told you you’re like a sexy praying mantis?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Every time you drink alcohol.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 amy_farrah_fowler You know what’s wonderful about the praying mantis? They devour their mate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Your point being?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 amy_farrah_fowler Dessert is served.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 sheldon_cooper I just had cobbler.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 amy_farrah_fowler You know what? I’m done with this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 sheldon_cooper W-Where are you going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 amy_farrah_fowler I’m leaving.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 sheldon_cooper You can’t leave. I need you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 amy_farrah_fowler You do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Yes. You’re my ride.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, you either say something meaningful and from the heart, or you and I are done.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 sheldon_cooper All right. Please. Amy, when I look in your eyes and you’re looking back in mine, everything feels not quite normal, because I feel stronger and weaker at the same time. I feel excited and, at the same time, terrified. The truth is, I don’t know what I feel, except I know what kind of man I want to be.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, that was beautiful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 sheldon_cooper I should hope so. That’s from the first Spider-Man movie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 amy_farrah_fowler I’ll take it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Good. Now, I assume we’re splitting the cheque?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Hey, Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 stuart_bloom Oh, hey. I was actually just about to close up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Oh, I’m sorry. I’ll leave.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 stuart_bloom No, no. It’s okay. Hang out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali You sure?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 stuart_bloom Yeah, you’re my first customer today.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali All right. Great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 stuart_bloom I’m, uh, having a nightcap. You want to join me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali What are you drinking?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 stuart_bloom Coffee liqueur in a Chewbacca mug. I call it a sad-tini.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Perfect for the night I’m having. Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 stuart_bloom Hmm. Nice not to drink alone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Amen to that. Sometimes I pour a little chardonnay into my dog’s water bowl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 stuart_bloom You’re kidding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali She’s kind of a mean drunk, but what are you gonna do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 stuart_bloom Cheers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Cheers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 stuart_bloom A little music?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Sure. Mmm. Bossa nova. You listen to that with your hips as well as your ears.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 stuart_bloom Mmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Oh. Something about latin music just makes me feel like I’m on a white sand beach in Rio.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 stuart_bloom Yeah. The sun, the waves, the beautiful bodies, tanned and glistening with sweat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali I should go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 stuart_bloom Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Uh, thank you for the drink.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 stuart_bloom No problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Hey, Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 stuart_bloom Yeah?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Do you want to hang out tomorrow night, maybe grab a bite to eat or catch a late movie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 stuart_bloom Yeah, I-I’d like to, but I’m a little tight on funds.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali No problem. My treat. I’ll swing by after work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 stuart_bloom Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 stuart_bloom I could do worse.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 bernadette_rostenkowski Aw, that’s such good news, Howie. Thank you for telling her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Hey, I’m a grown man. I’m gonna live with my wife. My mother’s just gonna have to learn to make do on her own.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 bernadette_rostenkowski Was she upset?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Who can tell? She yells everything. She might have been upset. She might have been hungry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 bernadette_rostenkowski Thanks for fixing it. I love you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 howard_wolowitz I love you, too. Sweet dreams. I’ll talk to you tomorrow?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 bernadette_rostenkowski Good night, Rocket Man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 howard_wolowitz To infinity and beyond, baby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 dimitri Loops. You realize you just lied your ass off to your wife and your mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 howard_wolowitz I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 dimitri What are you gonna do when you get back to Earth?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Oh, I’m never going back.
