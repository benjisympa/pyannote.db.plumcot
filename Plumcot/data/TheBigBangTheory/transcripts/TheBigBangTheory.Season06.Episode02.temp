TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 bernadette And the next wedding gift is a gravy boat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 penny Ooh, one gravy boat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 amy That’s from Sheldon. He told me he had it engraved.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 bernadette In the event of a divorce, please return to Sheldon Cooper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 penny One inappropriate, yet I wish I thought of that gravy boat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 amy When I get married I’m going to register at the UCLA Cadaver Lab.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 penny Ew, why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 amy ‘Cause I’ve always wanted a whole human skeleton and they are really spendy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 bernadette So, you actually see you and Sheldon getting married someday?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 amy Not just someday. In exactly four years. But don’t tell Sheldon. He’s still a flight risk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 bernadette What about you, Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 penny What about me what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 bernadette Do you think you and Leonard might ever get married?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 penny Oh, well, you know, Leonard is great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 bernadette But do you think you’ll ever get married?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 penny He’s a sweetie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 amy You’re not answering the question. Do you love him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 penny Yeah, sure, of course I love him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 bernadette It doesn’t sound like it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 penny Well, I do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 bernadette Do you tell him that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 penny No, he’d just take it the wrong way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 amy What does that mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 penny It means he is special and smart and nice and…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 bernadette Are you gonna break up with him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 penny No. Maybe. I don’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 bernadette I had no idea you were unhappy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 penny That’s the thing, I’m not. I’m not unhappy at all. It’s just, I don’t know, I, I’ve been in love before, but it felt different. But maybe this is a new, better, boring kind of love. Do you ever feel that way about Howard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 bernadette Oh, that’s not really a fair comparison. I’m basically married to a sexy Buzz Lightyear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 penny Amy, you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 amy Can’t help ya, kid. Whenever I’m around Sheldon, I feel like my loins are on fire. In the good way. Not the urinary tract infection way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 raj Hey, buddy, how’s it going up there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 howard You don’t have to shout, Raj. It’s not like I’m an astronaut floating around in outer space. Oh, wait, I am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 leonard So, is it everything you hoped it would be?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 howard It’s better. I wake up every morning and I just can’t believe I’m on this incredible adventure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 dimitri Hey, Froot Loops, did you clean the space toilet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 howard Excuse me. I’m talking to my friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 mike You know the rules, new guy scrubs the toilet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 dimitri If you do good job, next time we give you brush.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 howard Funny. We’re always giving each other a hard time up here. It’s kind of like being in a frat. You know, joking, kidding around, hurting feelings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon Okay, my turn. Let me talk to him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 leonard Go ahead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon 2311 North Los Robles Avenue, Pasadena, California to International Space Station. Can you read me? Over. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 howard Yes, I read you, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon Copy that. Over. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 leonard What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon I am talking to a man in space. If you don’t have the then he might as well be at the Coffee Bean over on Lake Street.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 howard You’re out of your mind,Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon That’s a negative. My mother had me tested. Over. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 mike Come on, scrub it up, Loops.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 howard All right, all right. I gotta go. There’s a meteor shower.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 mike You want to see a meteor shower? Take a look at what Dimitri just left you in the toilet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 howard Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon Over and out. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 raj Bye, buddy!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 stuart Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 raj Hey, Stuart, come on in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon What are you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 stuart Um, Raj invited me to go to the movies with you guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon Excuse me. I didn’t authorize this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 leonard Sheldon, you are not in charge.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon That’s mighty sassy for a man with a roommate performance review around the corner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 raj What’s the big deal? You guys are bringing your girlfriends. I didn’t want to sit by myself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon The big deal is I was expecting us to be an intimate group of five. Now, we’re going to be a faceless mass of six.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 leonard It’ll be fine. Just, uh, pretend he’s Wolowitz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon Hmm. Do you like Raisinets?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 stuart I can take them or leave them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon At the movies, Wolowitz always eats Raisinets.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 stuart Would you feel more comfortable if I ate Raisinets?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon Well, it’s hardly my business what you eat, as long as it doesn’t crunch during the film and it’s Raisinets.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 stuart Okay. Should we go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon Yuh-uh, one more question, if you’re going to replace Wolowitz, I need to know a little more about you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 stuart All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon Wolowitz went to MIT. What’s your educational background?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 stuart I went to art school.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon Equally ridiculous. Let’s go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon This insistence on hand-holding is preposterous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 amy Well, I like it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon Yeah, of course you do. You’re a girl. You like all kinds of hippy-dippy things.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 amy Just watch the movie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon It’s not fair. Penny isn’t making Leonard hold hands.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 amy There might be a reason for that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon Sweaty? Unhygienic? Looks dumb? Take your pick.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 amy Penny said she’s not sure she wants to be Leonard’s girlfriend anymore.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon Wrong. She just took a sip from his Diet Dr. Pepper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 amy So?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon So, if she wants to end her pair-bond with Leonard, why on earth would she guzzle a witches’ brew of his soda and spit?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 amy It’s complicated.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon String theory is complicated. That’s just yucky. Don’t get any ideas. All right, for the sake of argument, let’s say that’s true. Why doesn’t Penny just end the relationship?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 amy She’s not sure how she feels.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon How can she not be sure how she feels? You know, when I have a feeling, I know it. Trains? Love them. Swordfish? I love them, too. They’re fish with a sword for a nose.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 amy Regardless, don’t say anything to Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon Now you’re asking me to keep a secret from my best friend, colleague, and roommate?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 amy Yes, please, Penny will kill me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon Uh, fine. FYI, secret-keeping? Hate it. Hand-holding? Not a fan. Hammerhead shark? I love that thing. Yeah, it’s another fish with a tool on its head.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 stuart Raisinet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon Shh, we’re trying to watch the movie. This is not working out with him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 leonard What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon I think I might have tartar buildup. My tongue won’t go as far forward as it used to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 leonard Maybe your tongue is shrinking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon Nope. Oh, you have no idea how annoying this is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 leonard I’m starting to get a sense of it. Don’t worry. I’ll take you to the dentist tomorrow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon Thank you. I appreciate that. You’re good people, Leonard. There’s something I need to tell you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 leonard Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon I can’t tell you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 leonard Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon I can’t tell you why I can’t tell you. So I guess there’s two things I can’t tell you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 leonard I wish there were more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon Good night. I’m sorry. This is really important.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 leonard What is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon I like The Transformers. Do you like The Transformers?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 leonard Where exactly did your mother have you tested?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon Leonard, the Transformers teach us that things are not always what they appear to be. You know, like, uh, a semi truck might be an alien robot, or, uh, someone in a romantic relationship, uh, might feel differently than they appear to. Or a conversation about The Transformers might actually be about someone in this room. I’m going to pause to let that sink in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 leonard Okay, I think I understand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon You do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 leonard The guy who seems like an emotionless robot is you, but your relationship with Amy is causing you to transform into a red-blooded man with sexual desires.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon That is literally the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon Leonard? Leonard? Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon Are you sleeping?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 leonard I was. Now I’m having a nightmare. What do you want?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon Never mind. I still can’t tell you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon Penny? Penny? Penny? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 penny Oh, my God. Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon You frightened me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 penny What are you doing in my bedroom?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon Yeah, well, I knocked on the front door, but you didn’t hear it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 penny How did you even get in, you weirdo?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon Yeah, really? I’ve seen strange men traipsing in and out of here for years, but when I do it, it’s weird?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 penny What do you want, Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon Oh, I was having a little trouble sleeping and I just thought, uh, seeing as you’re up, we could talk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 penny Talk about what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon Oh, I don’t know, uh, weather, uh, fish you could do carpentry with, why Leonard is such an attractive and desirable boyfriend. Yeah, pick one, your choice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 penny Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon Did you know that Leonard has a perfect driving record and enjoys the insurance discounts that go along with that? Hubba-hubba.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 penny Okay, go home, crazy man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon Yeah. Did you know that while Leonard is not considered a tall fellow in our country, in today’s North Korea, he’s downright average. Hey, talk about a keeper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 penny Okay, what did Amy tell you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon Oh, very well. I can’t keep up this clever charade any longer. She told me that you were thinking of ending it with Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 penny Okay, you listen to me. I think it’s really sweet you’re trying to protect your friend, but this is none of your business. Got it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon Excuse me. This is not about protecting my friend. I’m a big fan of homeostasis. Do you know what that is?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 penny Of course not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon Homeostasis refers to a system’s ability to regulate its internal environment and maintain a constant condition of properties like temperature or pH.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 penny Worst bedtime story ever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon My point is I don’t like when things change. So, regardless of your feelings, I would like you to continue dating Leonard. And also, while we’re on the subject, you recently changed your shampoo. I’m not comfortable with the new scent. Please stop this madness and go back to green apple.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 penny Okay, honey, I have a lot to figure out, and until I do, you are not to say a word to Leonard. Do you understand?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon I do. You clear on the shampoo issue?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 penny Get out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon Please don’t hurt my friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 penny That is the last thing I want to do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon Thank you. Coconut? What were you thinking? Are you a hula girl?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 penny Get out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 amy Hello?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 penny What the hell is wrong with you? You told Sheldon? Do you know what a terrible position this puts me in? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 amy Hang on, please. Hello?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 amy I know. She’s yelling at me right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon All right then, so we’re all on the same page. Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 howard Hey, Bernie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 bernadette There’s my hubby. How’s everything going up there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 howard Oh, it’s okay. Space is beautiful. Earth is beautiful. Same old, same old.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 bernadette What’s wrong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 howard Nothing. Everything’s fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 bernadette Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 howard The other astronauts are being mean to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 bernadette No, what are they doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 howard Well, like for instance, the other day when I was asleep, one of the guys went on a space walk and glued a big-eyed rubber alien mask to the outside of my window. When I woke up, I screamed for like nine minutes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 bernadette Oh, Howie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 howard You can see it if you want. It’s on YouTube. Google astronaut screams for nine minutes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 bernadette Why don’t you stand up to them?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 howard What am I supposed to say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 bernadette I don’t know. Say, being mean is lame, what’s cool is being nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 howard Great, I’ll do that when I want to be the first guy in space to get a wedgie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 bernadette Do you want me to call somebody at NASA?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 howard No. My mom already tried that. It only made things worse.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 leonard Gelatinous Sphere.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 raj Focused Locust.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 stuart Temple of Yip.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon I’m sorry. Wolowitz would never play that card.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 stuart All right, Lesser Demon Turtle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon Fairy God Monster, I win. Your desperate need for friendship makes you weak.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 raj So, what are you guys doing later? Stuart and I were thinking of going out for a drink.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 stuart We’re gonna try to meet some girls.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 raj ‘Cause that’s what we do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 stuart Watch out, ladies, a little coffee and cream coming your way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 raj In case you didn’t follow that, I’m the coffee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon Leonard? Maybe you’d like to go with them to meet girls.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 leonard Why would I be interested? I have Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon Yeah, for now. But that woman has a death wish, Leonard. She talks to strangers, she pets unfamiliar dogs, and it is ridiculously easy to break into her apartment. If I were you, I’d get a back-up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 leonard You can’t just replace someone you care about with some other random person.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 stuart No, please don’t ruin this for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon Do you remember how upset I was when they replaced Edward Norton as the Hulk?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 leonard Yes, you walked around for a week saying, Sheldon unhappy with casting choice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon But, then Mark Ruffalo was the Hulk in The Avengers, and he was even better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 leonard What’s your point?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon Call me a romantic. I like to think that your Mark Ruffalo is still out there somewhere.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 leonard This is ridiculous. Are we gonna play cards or not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 stuart I like Mark Ruffalo, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 sheldon Yeah, settle down there, fake Wolowitz. No one likes a kiss-up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 leonard So, I had to take Sheldon to the dentist this morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 penny Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 leonard Yup. I told him if he didn’t bite the hygienist, I’d take him for ice cream.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 penny Mmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 leonard I didn’t have to take him for ice cream.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 penny Uh-huh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 leonard You okay? You seem a little distracted.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 penny Look, there’s something I need to tell you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 leonard Oh. Yeah, okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 penny I don’t really know how to say this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 leonard Just say it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 penny Okay. Here goes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 leonard Mm-hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 amy You slept with him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 penny I didn’t know what else to do. He had those big, sad eyes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 bernadette Oh, sure, you had no choice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 penny He looked at me like this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 amy Well, if that’s all it takes, it’s a good thing you don’t have a dog.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 bernadette Don’t worry. You’ll have plenty of chances to break up with him. Your wedding day, your honeymoon, your 50th anniversary.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 penny Look, it’s fine. We’re not getting married, okay? We’re keeping things, you know, homeostasis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 amy It’s so cute when she tries.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 penny It’s from Leonard. Last night was amazing. You’re amazing. I’m so lucky to have you in my life. Okay, stop it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 howard Hey, Bernie, guess what? I stood up to the other astronauts like you said and I got to tell you, last night was the first time in a week I got a good night’s sleep. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 bernadette Oh, Howie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 howard What’s wrong? You look upset.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode02 bernadette Nope, this is my proud face.
