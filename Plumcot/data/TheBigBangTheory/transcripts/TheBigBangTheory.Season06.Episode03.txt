TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Hey, Bernie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Hey, how’s my little astronautie hottie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Okay, I guess. It’s just, being cooped up in this tin can for weeks on end is starting to get to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Well, hang in there. You just have a couple more days to go, and then you’ll be home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 howard_wolowitz I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski I got to get back to work. I love you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Love you too. Hey, Bernie? Before you go, can you do something for me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski What do you want me to do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Okay, here it is. I really miss gravity. Can you drop something so I can watch it fall?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Really, you’re serious? Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Oh, baby, you’re killing me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 penny Ugh. Hey, Sheldon? Hi. This came for you today. It’s from your mom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Oh, thank you, Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 penny M-hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Yeah, wait, here. For your troubles.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 penny Oh, boy, a whole dollar. Now, I can quit my paper route. So, what’s in it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Mmm, doesn’t matter. Half the time, he just ends up playing with the box.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Yeah, it’s journals and research papers I wrote as a child.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 penny Aw, how cute. Is this like a diary?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 sheldon_cooper No, that’s my potty training journal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 penny Really, your potty training journal?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Yeah. And forgive my crude penmanship. I didn’t start typing until I was six.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 penny August 7, 8:42 a.m. This is humiliating. What was wrong with diapers?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 sheldon_cooper There are some charts in the back where I kept track of shape, colour and consistency.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 penny Oh, disgusting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter No, what’s disgusting is he’s still keeping track.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 penny Why do you need all this stuff?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter No, no, no, no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 penny Sorry!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 sheldon_cooper I am glad you asked. Are you familiar with the Higgs boson?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 penny Of course, it is, it’s been in the news. And it’s a very famous boson.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Nice try. Now, in 1964, Dr. Peter Higgs, accomplished self-promoter and physicist, he wrote a paper postulating the existence of a subatomic particle called the Higgs boson. Now, initially the paper was rejected, but recently, he was proven right, and now he’s on the fast track to win a Nobel prize.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 penny Yeah, that’s basically what I said.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Yeah, the point is Higgs is being celebrated for work he did 50 years ago, so that got me thinking, perhaps I’ve already hit upon the idea that will win me my Nobel prize.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter I didn’t know they gave Nobel prizes for making boom-boom in the potty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 penny You really think there’s some kind of scientific discovery in here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Well, this box only covers my work through nursery school. There’s a good deal more to come. I didn’t really hit my academic stride until I cut out that time-suck known as playing outdoors.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter So, you’re going to spend hours and hours combing through all this stuff?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 sheldon_cooper That’s a good point. My time is much too valuable. You know, perhaps I should find someone to do it for me. You know, someone with a rudimentary understanding of science, but whose real talents lie in menial labour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Not gonna happen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Well, if I didn’t think you could handle it, I wouldn’t be asking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter If you want help, just hire a grad student.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 penny Maybe I could do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 sheldon_cooper You, really? You can assess the quality of my work? Okay, um, here. I wrote this when I was five years old.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 penny A proof that algebraic topology can never have a non self-contradictory set of abelion groups. I’m just a blonde monkey to you, aren’t I?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 sheldon_cooper You said it, not me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 sheldon_cooper All right, Ms. Jenson. Uh, before we begin, may I offer you a refreshment? Water, coffee, tea, a marijuana cigarette?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 ms_jenson#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 No, thanks. I’m fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Now, are you sure? Everyone’s smoking them. I think they’re the best.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 ms_jenson#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 I don’t do drugs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Excellent, yeah. That was a ruse. They’re not the best. Physics is the best. And by the way, coffee was also an unacceptable choice. All right, so I see here you’re from Des Moines, Iowa. Uh, you’re summa cum laude in theoretical physics from Stanford University. Oh, and two years ago, you had a persistent ear infection. I hope that didn’t cause any hearing loss.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 ms_jenson#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 No, of course not. How did you know about that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 sheldon_cooper I did a comprehensive background check. Medical records, credit reports, criminal history. I trust you paid off those parking tickets.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 ms_jenson#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 Yes, I did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Hearing unimpaired, good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 ms_jenson#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 Look, Dr. Cooper, I really want this position. It would be an incredible honour to work for a man of your brilliance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Flattery will not get you this job, Ms. Jenson.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 ms_jenson#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 It’s not flattery if it’s the truth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Oh, well, thank you. Welcome aboard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter You talk to Howard lately?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Uh, yeah, last night. He kept making me drop pencils for him. I got uncomfortable. Hey, Sheldon, hope you’re hungry, they’re serving macaroni and… che-ee-ee-ese.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Smooth. Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 ms_jenson#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, aren’t you going to introduce us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 sheldon_cooper No. I have people for that now. You’re up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 ms_jenson#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 I’m Alex, Dr. Cooper’s new assistant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Ah, congratulations and may God have mercy on your soul. I’m Leonard. This is Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 alex_jensen It’s nice to meet you. I’m so excited to be working with Dr…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Yeah, please reserve chitchat for your breaks, Ms. Jenson. FYI, there will be no breaks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 alex_jensen I should probably get to work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter She seems nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Hey, you already got a girlfriend. I call dibs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter All I said was she seems nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Yeah, well, I love her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Hey, I wasn’t expecting to hear from you today. Everything okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Uh, no, not really.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski What’s wrong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Well, remember the Soyuz capsule they were sending to bring us home?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Uh-huh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 howard_wolowitz It’s delayed. We’re gonna be here at least another week. Maybe ten days. It’s the Russians, so you don’t know. They left dogs up here in the sixties.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Come on, Howard. No one’s leaving you up there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 howard_wolowitz I don’t know how much longer I can take this. I can’t sleep, and zero gravity is giving me crazy acid reflux. I’m down to my last three Tums.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski You’re going to be fine. You survived that Weight Watchers cruise with your mom. And they ran out of low-fat ice cream on day two. Just calm down and take a few deep breaths.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Okay, okay. What am I doing? I’m using up all the oxygen. If I die, promise you’ll never have sex with another man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, yeah. I’m a man-eater now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 penny Okay, for the final touch, this is an eyelash curler. You just place it on your lashes and squeeze it closed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, I don’t know. Looks like something used by Tinkerbell’s gynecologist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 penny Who I hope for her sake is not Captain Hook, so… who are you calling?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler I’m going to video-chat Sheldon. If my new look leads to phone sex, I’m going to have to ask you to leave the room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 alex_jensen Dr. Cooper’s office.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, hello. Who are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 alex_jensen I’m Alex, Dr. Cooper’s assistant. Can I help you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler I’d like to speak to Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 alex_jensen I’m sorry. He’s asked me to hold all calls unless you’re Stephen Hawking, his mother or himself from the future.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler All right. Well, tell him Amy called.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 alex_jensen Last name?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler He knows my last name. I’m his girlfriend. We have a contract and everything. I’ll send you a PDF.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 alex_jensen All right, I will tell him you called.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Hmm, that’s weird.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon told me he had a new assistant named Alex. He didn’t mention that Alex was a girl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 penny Maybe he didn’t notice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler You’re right. I don’t have to worry about Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 penny No, you do not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler It’s her I have to worry about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 penny Oh, Amy, really? She is not going to come on to Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, really? Look at this face How can any woman spend eight hours a day alone with this face and not fall in love with it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 penny Well, for starters, at some point, that face starts talking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 penny Amy, this is crazy. You have nothing to be suspicious about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler I’m not suspicious. I just want to stop in, say hi to my boyfriend and meet his new assistant. Aha!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 penny Can we go now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Hang on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 penny What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Isn’t it obvious? I’m spreading my scent to mark my territory.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 penny Come on, Amy. That is not gonna work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Really? Because just before you became my best friend, I did this all over your apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Has your, uh, assistant said anything about me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Oh, in fact, she has. Uh, her exact words were, what is that guy’s problem?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 raj_koothrappali I’m in her head. Let the dance begin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 alex_jensen Here’s your frozen yoghurt, Dr. Cooper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter This should be fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Half chocolate, half vanilla, side by side, not swirled?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 alex_jensen Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Half a teaspoon of sprinkles?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 alex_jensen Rainbow, not chocolate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Two cherries?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 alex_jensen One on top, one on the bottom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Stems removed?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 alex_jensen Um, top one, yes. I didn’t check the one on the bottom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Oh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 alex_jensen I’m so sorry, Dr. Cooper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 sheldon_cooper It’s all right, Alex. I’m not mad at you, I’m just disappointed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Wait, Alex. Do you want to join us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 alex_jensen Um…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Uh, Alex, a moment. I need a word with Dr. Hofstadter. Do you think it’s appropriate for her to sit with us, given her station?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Given her what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 sheldon_cooper If I’ve learned anything from British television shows on PBS, it’s that servants dine downstairs with their own kind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 sheldon_cooper It’s a kindness, Leonard. Otherwise, you’re cruelly tempting them with a glimpse of a world that’s just beyond their soot-stained fingertips.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Oh, sure. Please join us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 alex_jensen Oh, okay. Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter So, Alex, what’s the topic of your dissertation?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 alex_jensen I’m looking for Trojan asteroids at Earth’s L-Five Lagrange point.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Oh, that happens to be Dr. Koothrappali’s field of expertise. You two have a lot to talk about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 alex_jensen Is that true? Is he all right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter No. But compared to your boss, he’s the poster boy for sanity.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 alex_jensen It’s okay, I’ve been around scientists all my life. My dad’s an astronomer at SETI.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Oh, SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. You should introduce him to Sheldon. The search is over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 alex_jensen So, what kind of research are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter High-energy lasers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 alex_jensen Ooh. Military?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Not yet, but I can remove unwanted hair from two miles away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler You were right. I had nothing to worry about. That skank’s your problem, not mine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 alex_jensen You’re very funny, Dr. Hofstadter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Cherry stem! Cherry stem!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski How you doing, Howie? You feeling a little better?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Oh, a lot better, thanks. One sec. Listen close, I don’t have a lot of time. I need you to go to my house. In my bedroom, you’ll find a model rocket. I want you to take it and bring it back to your place.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Step two, build a version roughly fourteen stories high. Fill it full of rocket fuel and come get me. I’ll leave the door unlocked.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Howie, honey, maybe you should talk to someone, let them know you’re having a little anxiety.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 howard_wolowitz No, no, I’m fine. No anxiety. We should probably talk in code. From now on, frog is me, sandwich means you and lemon means rocket. So, come on, sandwich, build me a lemon ’cause froggy wants to come home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Look at you, putting on a brave face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 penny There’s nothing to be brave about. Everything’s fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Really? I don’t know how much you know about primate behaviour, but Sheldon’s assistant was clearly courting Leonard. Were she a mandrill, she would have bent over and displayed her brightly coloured hindquarters like a big red welcome mat. By the way, you try that at the junior prom, you get kicked out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 penny Okay, maybe she was flirting with him, but who cares? Look, I don’t even know where my relationship is with Leonard is right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler So says your prefrontal cortex. But meanwhile, the limbic system of your brain is calculating that if another woman is attracted to Leonard, it must be because he’s desirable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 penny Well, of course he’s desirable. I mean, he’s great. He’s smart, he’s sweet, and, ooh, in the bedroom, whew, let me tell you, he really tries.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler So it does bother you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 penny Fine, it bothers me a little. No. You know what? This is stupid. It doesn’t bother me. Okay, it bothers me. But only because she wouldn’t stop laughing. Leonard is not that funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler And there you have it, prefrontal cortex reasoning versus limbic lust. If this were a boxing match, they might call it the thrilla adjacent to the amygdala. If you were a brain scientist, you would be busting a gut right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 penny So, how was work today?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Ah, it was all right, I guess. Got to Heimlich a cherry stem out of Sheldon. Caught Raj right in the eye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 penny Oh! You’re kidding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter No, Raj had to go to the nurse.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 penny Wow. Anything else?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Mmm, the nurse is a woman, so he couldn’t talk to her. She had to bring him a Grover puppet so he could point at what hurt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 penny Oh, is that it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Isn’t that enough? It had the weaponised fruit and a puppet. What more do you want?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Oh, good, Leonard, you’re here. Science news. This will interest you. And, Penny, feel free to paint your nails.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter What do you got?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 sheldon_cooper I believe Alex may have unearthed the grade school science project that could be my ticket to the Nobel Prize. Behold.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 sheldon_cooper The original title was “A Rederivation of Maxwell’s Equations Regarding Electromagnetism”” I dumbed it down because some of the more religious people in town were starting to say I was a witch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 alex_jensen Sheldon thinks the approach in this paper might change the way we calculate ferromagnetic hysteresis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 penny Oh, it’s about time. I hated the old way. Hi. I’m Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 alex_jensen Alex. Uh, do you work with Dr. Hofstadter?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 penny In a way. We’ve kind of been involved in a five-year experiment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 alex_jensen Oh. Well, you’re lucky. He seems very talented. And I’m sure a lot of people want to work with him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 penny Well, a lot of people can’t. Uh, hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Where are we going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 penny My limbic system wants to take your pants off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 alex_jensen She seems nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Notice people on your own time. We’re working.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Hey, Howie, how you feeling?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Better. Much better. The other astronauts held me down, gave me a shot. Oooh. Attention, people of Earth. Tonight, there will be two moons in the sky.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Howie, stop that. NASA’s watching this! Put your pants back on!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Whee! Whee!
