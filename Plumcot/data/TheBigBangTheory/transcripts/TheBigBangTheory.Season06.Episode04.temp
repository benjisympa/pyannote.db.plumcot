TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 raj Howard’s capsule should be re-entering the atmosphere any minute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 leonard It’ll be good to have him back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 raj The Fantastic Four reunited.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 sheldon Yeah, you had a good run, Fake Wolowitz. We’ll remember you with nostalgic fondness, the way we do the dial-up modem, the VHS tape, or, or Leonard’s gym membership.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 raj We’re not kicking him out. Stuart and I have become good friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 sheldon Okay, one vote for, one vote against. Leonard, you’re the tiebreaker.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 leonard I don’t have a problem with Stuart. Besides, he gives us a twenty percent discount at his comic book store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 sheldon Well, I don’t sell my friendship that cheaply.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 stuart I can go thirty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 sheldon Welcome aboard, old chum.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 raj Okay, the NASA Web site says Howard’s final descent has begun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 sheldon He left a boy, he returns a boy-sized hero.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 dimitri Loops, calm down!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 howard Baruch atah, Adonai, Eloheinu. Melech haolam, hamotzi. Lechem min haaretz
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 mike What’s that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 howard The Jewish prayer for eating bread! We don’t have one for falling out of space! We did it! We’re on the ground! We survived!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 mike That was just the parachute. We still have another six miles to go. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 bernadette Waiting for my husband.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 man_in_suit That’s nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 bernadette He’s coming back from outer space.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 man_in_suit I think this flight’s coming from Houston.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 bernadette No, I mean, he… Never mind. There he is! Howie!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 various_others Howie! Howie!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 howard Whoa, thank you. Great to be back on Earth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 howie_mandel Uh, I think they’re here for me, Ringo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 man_in_suit Mr. Mandel, I’m your driver.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 howie_mandel Oh, thanks. That nut job was telling everybody on the plane he’s an astronaut.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 bernadette I missed you so much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 howard I missed you, too. Where are the guys?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 bernadette Oh, it’s just me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 howard Oh, I get it. They’re waiting back home with a big surprise party. Don’t worry, I can act surprised. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 bernadette No, I told them they could have you tomorrow night. Tonight, you belong to me. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 howard Gesundheit. You okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 bernadette I am now that you’re back. Come on, let’s go home so I can tear off those little pants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 howard Great. Just keep in mind astronauts lose a lot of muscle tone in space, so you might have to do most of the heavy lifting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 sheldon You know, I am very disappointed that I won’t be able to celebrate Howard’s accomplishment tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 amy Me, too. But we’ll see him tomorrow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 sheldon Yes, it’s just that in all the years I’ve known him, he’s never had the opportunity to receive my admiration. I was excited to see the look on his face when it finally happened.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 penny You’re unbelievable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 sheldon I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 leonard All right, Pictionary. What are the teams?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 penny How about boys versus girls?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 sheldon Oh, that hardly seems fair. But I guess any team that I’m not on has a decided disadvantage.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 penny Once again, unbelievable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 sheldon Yeah, once again, I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 penny All right, round one. Here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 sheldon Got it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 penny Okay. Ready, set, go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 amy Uh, box? Uh, window?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 leonard Batman. Batman and Robin. Uh, Wonder Twins plus the monkey. Wonder Twins plus the monkey and Batman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 amy Uh, gift? Uh, Present!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 penny Present! Yeah!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 sheldon Oh, Leonard. Now, how can you not get that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 leonard In what universe is that a present?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 sheldon It’s not a present, it’s the present. Look. There’s you and me. There’s Penny and Amy. We’re playing Pictionary. In the present.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 penny Oh, my God, we’re gonna kill them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 sheldon It’s a quark-gluon plasma.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 leonard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 sheldon It’s asymptotically free partons inside a quark-gluon plasma.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 leonard Nothing with quarks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 sheldon It’s an observational rebuttal of the Lambda-CDM model of the universe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 leonard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 penny It’s a chocolate chip cookie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 amy Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 leonard How could you miss that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 sheldon Hey, if you want someone to guess chocolate chip cookie, you draw a glass of milk next to it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 leonard Penny got it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 sheldon Yeah, only after I eliminated all the obvious answers. You’re welcome.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 leonard Oh, uh, uh, uh, sausage. Uh, uh, uh, uh, bratwurst? Oh, oh, a hot dog.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 amy Penny, aren’t you gonna draw something?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 penny Relax, we got time, this is so fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 sheldon There.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 leonard A solar system. Uh, uh, uh, uh, um, unidentified flying liverwurst? I don’t…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 amy Now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 penny Soon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 sheldon Come on, Leonard, I am spoon-feeding this to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 leonard I don’t know, uh, Casper the alcoholic ghost?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 penny All right, that’s enough. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 amy Uh, hand. Uh, nail, polish?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 penny Yep!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 sheldon Wait, no, no. No. The word is Polish. See, look. Polish sausage. And the, the model of the solar system developed by Nicolaus Copernicus, a Polish astronomer. And then, finally, if that wasn’t enough, which it should have been, this is Madame Curie killing herself by discovering radium, who, although she was a naturalized French citizen, was Polish by birth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 penny Excuse me, the word is polish. See? Small P.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 sheldon Ah. So it is. I guess we both share blame on this one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 howard Bernie, you okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 bernadette Yeah, I’ll be right there. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 howard Did you get a sea lion while I was gone?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 bernadette It’s just allergies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 howard Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 bernadette Took some Benadryl. I’ll be fine. So, did you miss me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 howard Oh. Are you kidding? Every minute of every…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 bernadette Ew. Excuse me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 howard Sweetie, we don’t have to do this now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 bernadette Yes, we do. You left right after we got married. This is like our honeymoon. Now, hold on to your hat. Oh. Uh-oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 howard You okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 bernadette A little dizzy. Must be the Benadryl. Switch places with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 howard Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 bernadette Now, kiss me. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 howard Bernadette? Bernie? Bernie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 bernadette That was amazing. You made me feel things I never… 
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 howard Well, that was quick, and a little gross. Now, I know how she feels.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 penny Hey, Sheldon, you’re always full of fun little facts. Where did the expression got your ass handed to you come from?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 sheldon Don’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 penny I wonder if it’s from, like, ancient Rome where they’d actually chop somebody’s ass off and then go, here. You know, to appease Loseroneous, the god of losers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 sheldon I am not a loser. Pictionary is not a true test of any real intelligence or skill.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 leonard Mmm, in all fairness, Pictionary has verbal skills, visual skills. It’s a pretty well-rounded game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 sheldon Lot of big talk from a man who can’t draw a chocolate chip cookie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 penny All right, fine, pick another game. Amy and I will beat you at anything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 sheldon All right. Let’s play Physics Fiesta.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 penny Oh, come on, what is that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 sheldon It’s a game that I just invented, in which the participants answer physics questions in remedial Spanish. Um, ¿Dónde está el boson de Higgs?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 leonard En el acelerador de particulares.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 sheldon Bueno, mi amigo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 penny No, no, we’re not playing some dumb made-up game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 sheldon All games are made up. They’re not found in nature. You don’t just dig in the ground, come across a rich vein of Rock’em Sock’em Robots.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 leonard Just pick another game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 amy Why don’t we do something athletic like go over to the university pool and play water polo?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 leonard No good, Sheldon doesn’t float.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 sheldon That is true. I have a higher than normal body density. If I run too deep a bath, I drown.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 amy All right, let’s keep it simple. How about darts?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 sheldon No, that’s not fair either.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 penny Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 sheldon Darts is a bar game. You’ve been frequenting drinking establishments since you were of legal age.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 leonard Yeah, that’s when it started.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 sheldon Well, regardless, she has a distinct advantage in all tavern-based competitions. Pool, beer pong, wet T-shirt contests, they’re all out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 penny Okay. Just for the record, I have never entered a wet T-shirt contest. I’ve won a few, but that’s just because I spill when I’m drunk, so…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 amy We could go to the cadaver lab at UCLA and play real-life Operation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 sheldon No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 leonard Uh-uh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 penny I don’t think so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 amy Are you sure? I mean, the nose doesn’t light up, but if the corpse is fresh enough, sometimes you can get the leg to jerk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 howard Hey, Ma, twinkle, twinkle, your little star is home. Ma, the chain’s on the door.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 mrs_wolowitz Howard? I thought I wasn’t going to see you till tomorrow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 howard Yeah, well, Bernie’s not feeling well, so I thought I’d stop by, tell you about the greatest adventure of my life, see if you can make me feel bad about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 mrs_wolowitz Uh, uh, okay, hold on, I’m not decent.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 howard All right. Woman hasn’t tied her robe in 20 years. Suddenly she’s not decent?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 mans_voice You want me to hide in the closet or go out the back?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 mrs_wolowitz Shh, you need to whisper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 howard Ma, who is in there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 mrs_wolowitz Uh, nobody. The TV is on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 mans_voice I only got one sock. Where’s my other sock?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 howard Who is that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 mrs_wolowitz I told you, it’s the TV. Jay Leno lost a sock, it’s hilarious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 howard If you’re busy, I can come back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 mrs_wolowitz Just give me a second. Go, go, go, go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 howard Dr. Schneider?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 dr_schneider Oh, hello, Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 howard What are you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 dr_schneider Um, house call.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 howard You’re a dentist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 dr_schneider Yes, yes, I am. I think he’s on to us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 penny Okay, glasses off. Find Waldo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 sheldon Hurry up, find him, find him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 leonard I’m trying. Don’t yell at me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 sheldon For goodness’ sake, he’s wearing a hat, glasses, and a red striped shirt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 leonard I know what he looks like.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 amy Oh, there he is, I got him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 penny Yes, we win again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 sheldon How could you not find him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 leonard Because he’s hard to find. If he was easy to find, the books would be called There’s Waldo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 leonard 57, 58, 59, that’s one minute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 amy Long division, long division. Go, go, go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 leonard Remember, show your work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 sheldon I’m okay. I’m okay. I’m not okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 leonard Get up, we can’t lose at math.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 penny 37.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 amy Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 amy Ready, set, wrestle. One, two, three, pin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 penny Mwah!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 sheldon Stop that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 penny Mwah!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 sheldon Amy, do something. Amy, help. Amy, stop that. Amy, Penny, both of you, stop it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 howard One to beam aboard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 raj Oh, my God, you’re back. Oh, look at you. You, you look like you grew.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 howard Yeah. The lack of gravity did decompress my spine, so I’m like an inch and a half taller. I’m going to the DMV tomorrow to get my license changed before I shrink back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 raj Oh, uh, come in, come in. Oh, I, uh, I didn’t think I was going to get to see you until tomorrow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 howard Yeah, well, Bernadette’s a little under the weather and my mom’s kind of under my dentist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 raj Wait, your, your mother is sleeping with your dentist?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 howard Former dentist. I need a new one now that I know where his hands have been.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 raj So you’re wandering all around by yourself? That’s not the kind of hero’s welcome an astronaut should come home to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 howard It’s okay, you know, we space cowboys don’t do what we do for glory and fame. We leave that to your rock stars and your athletes and your Howie Mandels.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 stuart Oh, hey, man, welcome back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 howard Oh, Stuart, thanks. What are you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 stuart I, I kind of live here now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 raj Just until he gets back on his feet, which are looking pretty good in the boots I bought him for his birthday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 stuart Ah, he’s spoiling me and I love it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 howard Wow, so you guys are like buds now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 raj Oh, yeah, we hang out all the time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 stuart Plus, he doesn’t have a girlfriend, I don’t have a girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 raj It’s like we both had these holes in our lives, but now we fill each other’s holes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 stuart Uh, that sounds a little funny to an American ear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 raj Which part?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 stuart Just all of it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 howard Okay, so what do you guys got going on tonight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 stuart Raj is taking me to the Sound of Music sing-along.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 howard Sound of Music sing-along? That used to be our thing, but that’s cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 raj Oh, Howard, it’s still our thing. Come with us, we’ll, we’ll get you a scalped ticket.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 howard So I’d be sitting by myself?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 raj We’ll switch. You’ll come sit with me after intermission.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 stuart So I, I, I’d be sitting by myself during Edelweiss?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 howard No, no, you guys go. Have fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 raj Okay, uh, will I get to see you tomorrow?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 howard Absolutely. See you, Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 stuart Yeah, yeah. Is he taller?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 howard At least my mother made her boyfriend climb out the window.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 penny All right, standard state fair pie-eating contest rules are, no hands, first one to clean the pan wins.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 amy On the count of three. One, two…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 sheldon Wait. I’m a little concerned. Blueberries are rich in antioxidants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 leonard So?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 sheldon So, with all those antioxidants, what if I run out of oxidants?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 leonard Sheldon, we haven’t won a game all night. Now, you either stick your face in that pie or I’m gonna stick that pie in your face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 sheldon That’s rude.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 amy One, two, three, eat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 howard Hey, guys, guess who’s back from space.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 all Not now!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 sheldon Oh, ow, blueberry in my nose, blueberry in my nose!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 leonard Snort it down and keep eating!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 waitress You look familiar.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 howard I don’t think so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 waitress Yeah, I just saw you on the news. You’re an astronaut.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 howard Yes. Yes, I am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 waitress Good for you. How about a piece of cheesecake on the house?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 howard Oh, thank you so much. I’ve been having the worst night. I just got back, and my friends don’t care, my wife’s sick, I went to my mom…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 waitress You want the cheesecake or not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode04 howard Yes, please. And I think it’s gonna be long, long time till touchdown brings me ’round again to find I’m not the man they think I am at home, oh, no, oh, no, I’m a rocket man. Perfect.
