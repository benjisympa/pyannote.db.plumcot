TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 howard Oh, hey, Stuart, I got you a little souvenir from my trip to space.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 stuart Well, Howard, that’s very nice of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 leonard Yeah, maybe. Open it first.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 howard It’s my official NASA portrait.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 stuart To Stuart, your comic book store is out of this world. Just like the guy in this picture was.”
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 sheldon For the record, he also thinks the Walgreens and the dry cleaners are out of this world.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 howard That’s not true. At the Walgreens I was over the moon for their store-brand antacids.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 raj Hey, Stuart, I see you’re getting ready for your Halloween party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 stuart Yeah, it’s my annual attempt to meet women. Ninth time’s the charm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 raj Would you like me to help? I do have a certain je ne sais quois when it comes to soirees.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 stuart Thanks, but I can’t afford je ne sais quois. How much for just quois?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 raj You know, you don’t worry about money. I’ll take care of everything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 stuart Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 raj Yeah, you’ll love it. Ain’t no party like a Koothra-party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 howard But you know what wasn’t a party? That hotel in Kazakhstan they put you up in before the launch. I mean, it’s your last night on Earth. You’d think you’d get one porn channel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 leonard Have you noticed that Howard can take any topic and use it to remind you that he went to space?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 sheldon Interesting hypothesis. Let’s apply the scientific method, perform an experiment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 leonard Okay. Hey, Howard, any thoughts on where we should get dinner?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 howard Anywhere but the Space Station. On a good day, dinner was a bag full of meat loaf. But, hey, you don’t go there for the food, you go there for the view.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 sheldon It’s fascinating. Let me see if I can duplicate the result. Howard, I’ve always thought the lemon was an underrated fruit. Care to weigh in?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 howard Not really.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 sheldon Oh, well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 howard You know, people say the Soyuz capsule was a lemon. But, hey, that baby got me to space and back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 amy Ladies night at the Cheesecake Factory. Does it get any better than this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 penny I hope so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 amy Question. Do you think your husband’s fondness for turtlenecks is an expression of longing for his missing foreskin?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 penny It’s not getting any better. Ugh. It’s Leonard. He wants to go costume shopping later.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 bernadette I thought you liked Halloween.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 penny I do, it’s just he wants to go to that party at the comic book store. A lot of the guys that hang out there are kind of creepy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 bernadette Like my husband?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 amy And my boyfriend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 penny I’m, I’m sorry, Amy. You were saying something about Howard’s foreskin?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 bernadette Nice try, but you have to go to that party because we’re going.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 penny Yeah, I’m gonna go. It’s just not my idea of a good time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 bernadette Leonard does thing he doesn’t like to make you happy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 penny Well, yeah, he’s my boyfriend. Isn’t that, like, his job?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 amy Then what’s your job?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 penny Letting him make me happy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 bernadette I just think in relationships you get back what you put into them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 amy That’s not always true. Last night I gave Sheldon my best come-hither look, and he responded by explaining how wheat came to be cultivated.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 penny I guess I could probably try a little harder.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 bernadette You could start by taking an interest in his work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 penny Yeah, that’s kind of a problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 amy Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 penny Not really clear on what he does.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 bernadette He’s an experimental physicist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 penny Yeah, I’m not really clear on what that means.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 amy He takes hypotheses and designs protocols to determine their accuracy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 penny Yeah, you’re really just making it worse.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 sheldon What kind of tea would you like?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 amy I think I’m gonna try green tea mixed with lemon zinger.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 sheldon Two tea bags in one cup? You’re not at a rave.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 amy So, listen, Sheldon, I was thinking, since this is gonna be our first Halloween party as boyfriend and girlfriend, I thought it might be fun for us to go in a couples costume.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 sheldon I couldn’t agree more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 amy Really? I find that inconsistent with everything I know about you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 sheldon Oh, oh, on the contrary. Couples costumes are one of the few benefits of being in a relationship. Now imagine this, you and I entering Stuart’s party and all eyes turn to see America’s most beloved and glamorous couple.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 amy Yeah?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 sheldon R2-D2 and C-3PO. Dibs on Threepio.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 amy Sheldon, when I said couples costume, I meant like Romeo and Juliet or Cinderella and Prince Charming, not two robots from some silly movie I don’t even like.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 sheldon Okay, I’m gonna let that slide because I know you’re hopped up on tea bags.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 amy I make compromises for you all the time. Just this once, can’t we find something that we’re both happy with?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 sheldon Fine. How about one of the most beguiling and influential couples of the 20th century? Hewlett and Packard. Dibs on Hewlett. What? You want to be Hewlett?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 penny Anybody home?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 leonard Hey, what are you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 penny I just thought I’d stop by and say hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 leonard Oh, what a nice surprise. I don’t think you’ve ever seen my lab before.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 penny No, I know. It’s long overdue. So, what ya doing? Better not be building a robot girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 leonard No. Although Howard was making some real strides in that area until he met Bernadette.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 penny You’re kidding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 leonard Nope. Now the Lisatronic 3000 just sits in a box waiting for the phone to ring.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 penny Ooh! What’s going on in here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 leonard Oh, no, no, no, don’t look in there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 penny What, is it secret?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 leonard No, it’s a nitrogen laser. It’ll cook your eyeball like a soft-boiled egg.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 penny Oh. You might want to put a sign on it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 leonard Sign right there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 penny Ah. Danger. Sure, sure. Yeah. What’s, what’s that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 leonard Uh, that is an integrated ion trap and time-of-flight mass spectrometer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 penny Wow. High-techie-techie. What’s this little box?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 leonard That is a pencil sharpener.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 penny Ooh, low-techie-techie. So, what are you working on right now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 leonard It’s actually pretty neat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 penny Yeah?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 leonard Yeah. It’s a front-projected holographic display combined with laser-based finger tracking. Here, I’ll show you. We’ll just put this pencil over here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 penny Sharp. Thanks to the machine we saw earlier.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 leonard Very good. And then a laser will map the reflective surface, and voila. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 penny Wow. That is amazing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 leonard You know, there’s a foundational idea in string theory that the whole universe may be a hologram.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 penny What do you mean? . Oh! Wow!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 leonard Uh-huh. Well, the holographic principle suggests that what we all experience every day in three dimensions may really just be information on a surface located at the farthest reaches of our cosmos. So it’s possible that our lives are really just acting out a painting on the largest canvas in the universe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 penny Hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 penny Sometimes I forget how smart you are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 leonard You should visit more often. What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 penny Take off your clothes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 leonard What? Here? Now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 penny Yeah. You got a problem with that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 leonard No, no. It’s kind of crazy. I’ve never fooled around in the lab before.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 penny Really? Never?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 leonard No. I did have a shot with the Lisatronic, but the extension cord wasn’t long enough.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 raj Before I forget, I’d like your opinion on the menus I’ve prepared for the Halloween party. The theme is food that goes bump in the night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 howard Creature from the Black Forest Ham Lagoon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 raj On Sesame seed Bunzillas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 sheldon Night of the Living Garlic Bread?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 raj It’s funny because bread sounds like dead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 sheldon I’m sorry, but these are just ordinary foods with the names bent into tortured puns. The dishes themselves are in no way Halloweenie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 raj Ooh, Hallow-weenies! That’s a good one. They’ll pair nicely with my Draculoni and Cheese. How do I do it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 howard That reminds me, I was thinking about wearing my NASA jumpsuit as a costume. But then I realized everyone would be, like, where’s your costume? Why are you wearing your work clothes, you nut?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 leonard Hello, boys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 sheldon What are you smiling at?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 leonard Nothing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 howard You know where’s there’s a lot of nothing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 all Space.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 howard Boy, it’s nice to sleep in a bed with gravity again. Did I tell you about the night my retainer floated out of my mouth and into the air lock?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 bernadette Yeah, you mentioned it once or twice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 howard So, here we are, just a couple of young newlyweds. What to do? What to do to you? Astronaut Wolowitz, reporting for booty. Preparing thrusters. We have liftoff. Are we clear to jettison that nightgown?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 bernadette Okay, we need to talk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 howard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 bernadette Howie, I know you went to space. I’m incredibly proud of you. But you might want to try and not bring it up every minute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 howard I don’t talk about it every minute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 bernadette Tonight at dinner you went on bout it for an hour straight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 howard What was I supposed to talk about? We were eating at Johnny Rockets.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 bernadette I’m just saying, people are getting a little tired of it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 howard So, I did this amazing thing and I’m never allowed to mention it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 bernadette Of course you can. But maybe a good rule would be to wait for people to bring it up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 howard Okay, no problem. It won’t happen again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 bernadette I love you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 howard I love you, too. I can’t tell you how many times I dreamed I was in bed here with you when I was… you know. What, I can’t even point?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 leonard So, basically, this is what’s called mag-lev technology. It uses very powerful electromagnets to create a force strong enough to overcome gravity. Here, you hold this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 penny Whoa! That’s heavy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 leonard Yeah. Oh, uh, you don’t have on any jewellery, do you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 penny No. Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 leonard A grad student forgot to take out one of his piercings. Now he’s on a transplant list waiting for a nipple his size. Now watch this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 penny Whoa! That is very cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 leonard Sometimes I like to turn this on and pretend I’m the super villain Magneto.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 penny Getting a little less cool, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 leonard But what I really am is a very smart scientist who understands the mechanics of the universe and is wearing the sexy black underwear you bought him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 penny There we go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 raj So, I thought the photo booth for the party could either be creepy like a mummy’s tomb, or they also have the Tardis from Doctor Who.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 sheldon A Tardis makes no sense. It’s a time machine from a science-fiction show. It has nothing to do with Halloween. That being said, if you don’t get a Tardis, you stink and your party stinks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 raj Do you have a preference?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 howard I don’t care. Get the Tardis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 sheldon Yes! This party just became a major rager.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 raj Oh, by the way, can I borrow your bullwhip and fedora?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 howard Yeah, sure, whatever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 raj I was thinking of dressing up as Indiana Jones’ mocha-skinned love child. Indian Jones.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 howard Clever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 raj What’s wrong with you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 howard Nothing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 raj Oh, Howard, I’ve got a party to plan. Don’t make me pull it out of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 howard Okay, here it is. Bernadette said you guys are all sick of me talking about my trip to space. Is that true?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 sheldon Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 raj No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 sheldon We seem to have different approaches here. I was going for helpful honesty. I have no idea what you’re doing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 raj It’s called being nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 sheldon Okay. If you think being nice will get him to shut up, I’ll try it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 howard You know what, guys? Never mind. I just won’t talk about the greatest achievement of my life ever again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 sheldon Look at that, the problem solved itself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 leonard Hello, boys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 sheldon What if we were to go as dinner table favourites salt and pepper?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 amy You know salt makes me retain water and my cousin William was ground to death in a pepper factory accident. How about Raggedy Ann and Andy? I loved them growing up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 sheldon No, I don’t think so. Those dolls represent three things I do not care for, clowns, children and raggediness. I think it’s a lost cause.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 amy No. There are certain things that say to the world, I have a boyfriend, and he’s not made up. Matching costumes, hickeys and sex tapes. Pick one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 sheldon What’s a hickey?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 bernadette How do I look?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 howard Fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 bernadette Uh-oh, is someone a little blue? Come on, Howie, that’s like the funniest thing I’ve ever said in my life. What do you say? You ready to go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 howard To tell you the truth, I’m not really in the mood.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 bernadette What are you talking about? It’ll be fun. All your friends’ll be there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 howard Yeah, some friends. They all think I’m boring. Maybe you should go without me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 bernadette No, if I’m there alone, people might think I’m just a really short person from Avatar.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 howard I’m sorry. I just don’t want to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 bernadette Hey, I just spent the last three hours colouring myself blue. I’m gonna be washing paint out of my Smurf for a month.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 howard Fine. Two weeks ago I was an astronaut.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 bernadette Yeah, well, now you’re a Smurf. Keep walking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 penny Oh, my God, you guys look adorable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 bernadette Thanks, so do you. Slutty cop?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 penny No, sexy cop. Slutty cop only came with a skirt and two badges.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 bernadette And Albert Einstein?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 leonard Ja, und later she’s going to arrest me for goink fashter zen da shpeed of light.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 penny I thought we said in the car, no accents?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 leonard Sorry, Officer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 girl_dressed_as_a_witch Hello. It’s a great party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 stuart Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 witch The monster foods, they’re really fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 stuart Oh, yes, thank you. I like to think of fun things like that because I’m fun. I’m not clinically depressed at all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 amy Sheldon, get in here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 sheldon I should’ve picked hickey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 stuart Hey, hey, look at you guys!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 amy I’m Raggedy Ann, and he’s Raggedy C-3PO.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 sheldon It was a compromise. I lost.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 raj Can you believe Stuart’s walking around taking credit for this party?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 howard Who cares?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 raj What do you mean who cares? Look at what I pulled off here. The DJ’s on fire, there’s a Tardis photo booth in the back room, and, oh, my God, the food. Stuart wanted Kraft Draculoni and cheese.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 howard You’re right, the party’s fantastic. Please, tell me more. I haven’t heard enough about it all week because hearing about that never gets old.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 raj Is this about the space thing again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 howard Well, I’m not allowed to talk about it, but since you brought it up, I went to space! Space, space! Space! Space, space! Space!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 bernadette Whoa, Drinky Smurf. Can I talk to you for a second?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 howard Great, now I’m in trouble. You happy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 bernadette You, out! You are being very rude.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 howard No, I’m not. They’re all being rude. And you’re being rude.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 bernadette Me? What did I do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 howard Oh, Howie, stop talking about space so much. Nobody likes it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 bernadette I don’t sound like that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 howard You’re my wife. You’re supposed to be on my side.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 bernadette I’m always on your side.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 howard Then why are you trying to take this away from me? Being an astronaut is the coolest thing I’m ever gonna do. If I stop talking about it, then I’m just…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 bernadette Just what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 howard Just plain old Howard Wolowitz again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 bernadette Plain old Howard Wolowitz is the best guy I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 howard You’re just saying that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 bernadette No, I’m not. I married him. On purpose. Come here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 howard I love you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 bernadette I love you, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 penny Nothing to see here. Just sexy police business.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 leonard Just explaining the theory of relativity. Twice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 bernadette Hey, what you watching?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 howard I don’t know. Raj sent me some video of Buzz Aldrin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 buzz Here you go. It’s a Milky Way. The Milky Way’s a galaxy in space. I’ve been in space. Here’s a Mars bar. I’m an astronaut. And this one’s a Moon Pie. I walked on the Moon. What have you done?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode05 howard Okay, I get it.
