TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 raj Try to keep up, Howard, I’m killing it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 howard Yeah, I wish we looked as cool dancing in clubs as we do right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 leonard Don’t worry, this is exactly how you look when you’re dancing in clubs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 raj You’re welcome, ladies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon Paradigm-shifting news, gentlemen. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 raj Dude! I was about to Bollywood this bitch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon Earlier today, I invited Professor Stephen Hawking to join me in the popular online game Words with Friends. Moments ago, he accepted my request. Do you understand what that means?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 howard That somewhere right now Stephen Hawking is saying, damn it, I meant to click no.”
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon I’ll walk you through it. The game is not called Words with Strangers. No, it’s not even called Words with Acquaintances. It is called Words with…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 raj I’m not finishing your sentence. You pulled the plug on my funk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon Friends! It’s Words with Friends! Which Stephen Hawking and I officially are. Now all I need is a bunk bed with a slide, I’ll have everything I’ve ever wanted since I was six years old.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 leonard That’s really nice, Sheldon, I’m happy for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon And I’m happy for you, too. You are now friends with someone who is officially friends with Stephen Hawking. Enjoy it, boys. You may have peaked.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 howard Sheldon, I know Stephen Hawking. I worked with him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon And if they ever come out with a game called Words with People You Once Worked With, you’ll be off to the races.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 leonard Sheldon, I don’t think this actually means…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon Hold that thought! Professor Hawking has made a move. Boy, oh, boy. Oh, it’s only a matter of time before we’re coming up with fun nicknames for each other. I’ll be Coop. He’ll be Wheels. If he’s okay with that. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 raj All right. Crank up the AC, boys, it’s gonna get hot in here!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 bernadette So, I was taking a shower this morning, and when I got out, I started to dry off with what I thought was a towel but turned out to be Howard’s mom’s underwear. I had to take another shower. It wasn’t enough. Nothing will ever be enough.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 amy I once looked in Sheldon’s underwear drawer. He yelled at me. But now I know what it looks like and he can never take that away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 bernadette There’s a book under here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 penny Oh, I’ll get that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 bernadette I got it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 penny No, no, it’s…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 bernadette I got it. Why do you have a history textbook?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 penny No, it’s not a big deal. Just taking a class at the Pasadena Community College.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 bernadette That’s great. I didn’t know you wanted to go back to school.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 penny It’s just one history class. Look, I didn’t finish college, so I thought I would give it a try.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 amy Not to mention, your acting career is going south like Sherman. Read about it in your book.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 bernadette Why would you be embarrassed to tell us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 penny No, I’m not embarrassed. I just didn’t want anyone to know because I haven’t told Leonard yet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 amy Why wouldn’t you tell Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 penny Because it’s me going back to school, and he’s gonna be all “you can do it,” and “how can I help?” and “I’m so proud of you.” Ugh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 bernadette I just can’t believe you could keep something like that from him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 amy You guys have got to be the weirdest couple I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 penny Really? You can’t think of anyone weirder?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 amy I can, but she’s sitting right there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon Yes. I play the word quiver with a triple letter and a double word score for 72 points. That ought to let the air out of your tyres, Hawking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 amy Wow, my boyfriend is friends with Stephen Hawking and my new dandruff shampoo doesn’t smell like tar. Everything really is coming up Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon It is glorious. One of the greatest intellects of our time has agreed to engage with me in a gentlemanly battle of wits. And I’m spanking him so hard his grad students won’t be able to sit down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 amy You know, when one male dominates another, his testosterone level rises.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon What’s your point?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 amy It’s exciting to think you might be getting a testosterone level.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon Ooh, my friend Stephen just played the word act for 18 points. That’s right, I call him Stephen now, because I checked, and he was not okay with Wheels.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 amy Oh, you could turn his act into extract , and it would be for double points.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon Amy. Why would you give me a word? Now, if I play extract it would be cheating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 amy Sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon Although, I could play the completely unrelated and better word extract . Ethical conundrum avoided. Thanks, brain.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 penny Spaghetti okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 leonard It’s crunchy. Just the way I like it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 penny Yeah, I don’t think the water was really boiling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 leonard It’s great. I love it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 penny Okay, listen, there’s something I need to tell you. I’ve been thinking about going back to school for a while now. So a couple months ago, I started taking a history class at the community college.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 leonard Oh. That’s great. Great, great, great. Why wait so long to tell me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 penny I don’t want you to make a big deal out of it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 leonard Why do you think I’d be like that? I get it, you’re taking one class. It’s nice. Maybe if it goes well, you take another, you enrol full-time. Ooh, be sure to keep an eye on which credits transfer to a four-year college.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 penny You’re making it a big deal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 leonard Sorry. Whatever. It’s all good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 penny Anyway, that’s it. I just thought you should know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 leonard Am I allowed to ask how the class is going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 penny It’s really good. We’ve been talking about the origins of slavery. Turn in my first paper tomorrow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 leonard Great topic. I can help with that. There are lots of different perspectives you can take, economic, sociological, political.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 penny Hey hey hey, this is my paper. And my perspective is that slavery is bad. Oh, and my professor’s black, so I’m pretty sure that’s the right answer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 leonard Can I take a look?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 penny No, Leonard, this is my thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 leonard Okay, I get it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 penny Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 leonard It’s like when I started doing chin-ups, I didn’t want you to see until I could do one. FYI, really close.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 penny Thank you. Now behave yourself and eat your dinner. Maybe later, if you’re lucky, you get to sleep with a college girl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 leonard Really? ‘Cause I went to four years of college and five years of grad school, that never happened once.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 raj I think the next time I have to speak to a call centre in India, I’m going to try using an American accent.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 howard Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 raj Because when I use my regular voice, I feel like I’m making fun of them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 howard That’s ridiculous. Not to mention, your American accent is terrible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 raj Dude, my accent is brilliant. Hey, my snow-white American friends, let’s put some cow meat on the barbecue and eat it until we’re all obese.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 howard This is what you sound like. I think I’m talking in an American accent, but it really sounds like I’m wearing a set of giant dentures.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 raj Sheldon, do I really sound like that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 howard Tell him he sounds like that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 raj Sheldon, you okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon It’s been three days. Why hasn’t Stephen Hawking played a word?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 raj The guy’s a genius. Maybe you weren’t challenging enough for him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon Not challenging? I was humiliating the man. I was thinking of writing a book called A Brief History of the Time I Made Stephen Hawking Cry Like a Little Girl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 howard There’s the problem. You can’t beat Hawking like that. He hates to lose. Everyone knows the guy’s a big baby. I mean, forget the wheelchair, he should be in a stroller.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 howard One time when I was working with him, he said that Johnny Depp was in The Matrix. I told him he was wrong, but he kept insisting. So I looked it up online and showed him. Well, the next day, he had a pizza party, and everyone got invited but me. And then he was all, your invitation must have gotten lost in the matrix.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon Good Lord, what have I done?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 raj Good Lord, what have I done?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 howard Terrible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 raj All right, hotshot, let’s hear your Indian.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 howard I can’t sit on that elephant, my ass is on fire from eating all this curry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 raj Okay, yeah, that’s pretty good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 leonard Please be good. Please be good. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay. She writes like she cooks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon Play. Play. Play. Play. Play.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 leonard What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon Trying to use a Jedi mind trick to control Stephen Hawking. Play. Play. Ugh! He must be wearing a tinfoil hat or something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 leonard I did a bad thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon Does it affect me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 leonard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon Then suffer in silence. Play. Play. Play. Stephen Hawking. Stephen Hawking. Stephen Hawking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 leonard Penny started taking a class. She wrote a paper, she didn’t want me to read it, I went behind her back and I read it anyway.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon Stephen Hawking hates me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 leonard I don’t know what to do. I mean, the paper’s terrible. But if I tell her, she’ll know that I read it and she’ll get really mad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon I was beating him so bad, he doesn’t want to be friends anymore. Why does everyone love me except Stephen Hawking?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 leonard Is it possible we’re having two different conversations?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon How would I know? I’m not listening to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 leonard Hang on. Okay, here’s what we’re gonna do. Chess clock. We each get five minutes to talk about our problems. We’ll take turns. Each turn will consist of a statement and a helpful response from the friend. Begin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon I humiliated Stephen Hawking in a game of Words with Friends. He stopped playing, and now we’re not friends anymore.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 leonard He’s probably busy. You’re worried about nothing. Give it a couple more days. I’m sure he’ll play, and you’ll see that everything’s fine. My turn. I can’t let Penny hand in a bad paper, but how do I tell her it’s bad without letting her know that I read it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon Hmm. Beats me. Now, I know Hawking’s not busy because I can see he’s playing other people right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 leonard Maybe since you’re so good, he’s taking his time to meet the challenge. I want Penny to enjoy school…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon Wolowitz told me he’s a big baby. But I didn’t know that, and I played extract for 82 points. It’s all Amy’s fault. She told me to play it. I have got to cut her loose.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 leonard Sheldon, I wasn’t done talking. She hands in the paper tomorrow. I know I could help her. And she’s my girlfriend. I, I should be allowed to help her. Why aren’t I allowed to help her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon Yeah, I hear you, brother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 leonard No. You need to give me some advice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon Fine. Women, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 leonard No, specific to my situation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon Blonde women, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 leonard Empathetic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon It sucks to be you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 leonard I quit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon Leonard, wait. No. I listened to your dumb thing. Leonard, come back. Leonard, come back. Leonard, come back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon Oh, of course, it only works on the weak-minded.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 leonard Good morning, sunshine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 penny Leonard. It’s eight a.m. It’s like the middle of the night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 leonard I know, but I have to go to work, and I made you breakfast.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 penny Oh, wow, that’s so sweet. Hey, what’s this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 leonard Uh, before you open that, um, are you familiar with the story of The Shoemaker and the Elves?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 penny Elves? Come on, Leonard. It’s too early for Lord of the Rings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 leonard No, no. Listen, um, once upon a time, there was this shoemaker and when he went to bed at night, elves would sneak in and they would make all these amazing shoes for him. And when the shoemaker woke up in the morning, he, he would be super happy, not mad at the elves at all. Open it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 penny Okay. An examination of the economic, cultural, and political roots of slavery in the Old South, 1619 to 1865. What the hell is this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 leonard Don’t ask me. A little elf did it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 penny So let me get this straight. You just assumed my paper would be bad so you wrote one for me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 leonard No, I assumed it would be good. Then I read it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 leonard No, I, I mean, it was good. There were just a few things that needed a little polishing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 penny You changed every word.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 leonard That’s not true. Uh, slavery. 1619. Your name at the top. That’s all you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 penny You are such an ass. This is exactly why I didn’t want to tell you I was taking a class in the first place.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 leonard Please don’t be upset. I just, I didn’t want you ending up with a bad grade and get discouraged and give up on the idea of going back to school.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 penny Right, because me being in school is so important to you. That way, you wouldn’t have to be dating someone who’s only a waitress.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 leonard Oh, come on, you know that’s not true.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 penny Do I? Listen to me. I need to do this on my own. If I fail, I fail. If I pass, I pass. Do you get it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 leonard I’m sorry. I was just trying to help.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 penny Yeah, well, next time don’t. Oh, and since you like stories so much, this is not The Shoemaker
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 howard You ever hear back from Hawking?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon No. It would appear as if I’ve lost him. Stupid brain.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 raj It’ll be okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon How can it be okay? Stephen Hawking’s a genius and he talks like a robot. It’s everything I’ve ever wanted in a friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 raj Yeah, but if he’s a sore loser, maybe you’re better off without him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon You’re right. I guess I just have to make lemonade out of the two of you. He played! He played! Coop and Rolling Thunder are together again. He was okay with that nickname.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 howard So, now all you have to do is let him win.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon Yeah, way ahead of you. I will play the word at for two measly points, throwing the game and thus securing my friendship with the smartest man in the world.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 howard What are you waiting for? Hit send.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon I can’t. Losing on purpose is intellectually dishonest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 raj So don’t do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon Oh, but I want to be Hawking’s friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 howard So do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon Oh, but if I do, I’ll be a phony, a sellout, a Hollywood poser.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 raj Then don’t do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon I won’t. This feels right. My mother always said, to thine own self be true.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 howard Good for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon ‘Course she also told me that every animal in the world got on one boat, so what does she know? And send.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 leonard Oh, hey. Haven’t heard from you in a couple days. You still mad at me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 penny Nope. I have no reason to… “B” mad at you. Minus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 leonard Wow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 penny That’s right. On my paper. Not yours, mine, you punk-ass elf.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 leonard I don’t know what to say.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 penny Hmm, how about, gee, Penny, you’re smarter than I thought. You may be the one in school, but I’m the one who learned a lesson. I’m so stupid, Penny. Duh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon She sounds exactly like you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 amy How’d it go with Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 penny I don’t think he’ll be making that mistake again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 bernadette Good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 penny So, I know this goes without saying, but if either of you tell Leonard you helped me rewrite this paper, I will beat you both with a bag of oranges.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 amy Understood.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 bernadette Got it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 penny Now, ladies, we got a B-minus on this paper. I think if we put our heads together, on the next one we could get an A.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 bernadette Uh, but we got you a B-minus on purpose to make it believable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 penny Believable? You saying I’m not smart?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 bernadette No, no!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 amy You’re smart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 penny That’s better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 amy I feel like I’m in high school again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 bernadette Yeah, doing the prom queen’s homework so she’ll like us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 amy I know. It’s finally working.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon It’s Stephen Hawking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 leonard Well answer it. I want to hear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon Professor Hawking, how nice of you to call.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 stephen_hawking Hello. I really enjoyed our game, Dr. Cooper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon Oh, me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 stephen_hawking Or should I say Dr. Loser? Ha, ha, ha.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon Yes, congratulations. You won fair and square. Uh, very impressive, sir.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 stephen_hawking Do you like brain teasers?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 sheldon Oh, I love brain teasers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode06 stephen_hawking What does Sheldon Cooper and a black hole have in common? They both suck. Neener neener.
