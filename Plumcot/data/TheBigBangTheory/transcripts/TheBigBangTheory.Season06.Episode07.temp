TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 wil Hi, Sheldon. Thanks for having me. I’m happy to be here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 amy Cut.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon What’s wrong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 amy Sorry, Sheldon, you were brilliant as always. Wil, that was a little wooden.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 wil Wooden?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 amy Don’t worry, it wasn’t terrible. Just, this time, try to say it the way people sound. And action.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon My friend, Wil Wheaton.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 wil Hi, Sheldon. Thanks for having me. I’m excited to be here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon So, Wil, what do you have for us first?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 wil Well, this is an exciting one. This is the flag of the United Federation of Planets. Now what’s interesting about this flag…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 amy Cut.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 wil What was wrong with that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 amy It’s called Fun with Flags. They’re not at half-mast, nobody died. Let’s try and keep it upbeat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 wil Um, no offence, but I’ve been acting since I was a kid. I think I can handle a Web show without a lot of direction.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon It’s true. In 1982, Wil played the voice of Martin the mouse in The Secret of NIMH. You moved me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 amy You’ll have to forgive me. This is my first time directing, I just want it to be good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 wil So do I.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 amy Great. So, this time let’s try more real boy, less Pinocchio. And action.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 wil And cut. You realize that I’m doing this for free, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 amy Yes. And so far, we’re still not getting our money’s worth. Let’s try it again. Everybody’s having fun. And action.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon So, Wil, what do you have for us first?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 wil Well, this is an exciting one. This is the flag of the United Federation of Planets.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 amy Cut.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 wil Problem, first-time director?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon Oh, none that I could see. I saw a man who loved flags almost as much as I do. I got goose bumps.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 amy He was overacting on purpose.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon Really? He reminded me of a young William Shatner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 wil Listen, Sheldon, I’m really happy to do this for you, but not if she’s gonna be a huge pain in the ass the whole time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 amy You gonna let him speak to me like that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon Well, you’re my girlfriend and I don’t want you to be upset. Then again, Wil Wheaton’s my friend and I don’t want him to be upset. Hmm, this is a sticky wicket. What do you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 amy Can I speak to you for a second?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon I’ll be right back. Feel free to play with yourself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 amy I don’t care for your friend, he’s being rude to me. You need to ask him to leave.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon Amy, I can’t just ask Wil Wheaton to leave. He’s a minor celebrity. Once you explain who he is, many people recognize him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 amy Fine. Then maybe I should go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon Could you? That would solve everything. You are the best. I’ll see you at dinner tonight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 amy You sure you wouldn’t rather have dinner with your friend Wil Wheaton?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon Come to think of it, I would! You, little lady, are on fire.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 bernadette Every time we eat dinner here, your mother refuses to let me help with the dishes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 howard Don’t take it personally. She likes doing them by herself so she can lick the plates with no one looking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 bernadette You ready to go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 howard Yeah, let me just grab a couple of fresh turtlenecks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 bernadette I don’t understand why you keep your stuff here when there’s plenty of room at home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 howard What are you talking about? All I have here is a few sweaters, books, bank stuff, computers, mail, collectibles, medicine and my electric body groomer. Ooh, there’s my plaid dickie. Oh, got this at the Goodwill store for 50 cents. Can you believe it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 bernadette 50 cents sounds right. Let’s go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 howard You know, it’s kinda late. Why don’t we just spend the night here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 bernadette Because we don’t live here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 howard I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 bernadette Do you? You said when you got back from space you were gonna move into my apartment, but half the time we stay here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 howard That’s not true.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 mrs_wolowitz Howard, I’m doing laundry. You want me to put anything in for you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 howard There’s some underwear in the hamper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 mrs_wolowitz Oh, good, I got that new stain stick to try out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 howard Thank you, I only put it on the list two weeks ago. Okay, I see what you’re getting at. How about this weekend I’ll box up all my things and move them to our place.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 bernadette Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 howard The lightsabres are gonna look great in the living room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 bernadette Or in the closet. We can decide later.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 mrs_wolowitz Howard, help, my hand’s stuck in the garbage disposal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 howard Let go of whatever piece of food you’re holding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 mrs_wolowitz Are you kidding? It’s a perfectly good chicken leg.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 leonard Hey, look who’s out after dark, like a big boy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon I was out raising heck with Mr. Wil Wheaton. Four hours more and we would have closed down the HomeTown Buffet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 leonard I thought you had plans with Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon Yeah, I did, but then Wil called Amy a pain in the A-S-S. She got huffy and left, then Wil and I headed out to dinner. That place really did remind me of my hometown. Because there we also have a HomeTown Buffet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 leonard Hold on. Wil and Amy had an argument?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon Yes, quite the kerfuffle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 leonard Then Amy got mad and left?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon Walked right out the door.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 leonard And you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon Enjoyed a delightful dinner at a reasonable price. The manager recognized Wil and let us sit right next to the frozen yoghurt machine. Right next to it. I was closer to it than I am to you right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 leonard Buddy, I think Amy might be upset.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon Why’s that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 leonard Because your friend was rude to her, and then you went to dinner with him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon You’re just repeating what I said. It’s like living with a lactose-intolerant parrot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 leonard Trust me, call her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon Fine. It’s a shame you didn’t go to dinner with us, because the buffet you’re about to enjoy only serves humble pie, a dessert much less tasty than frozen yoghurt. I was this close.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 amy What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon You’ll appreciate this. Leonard has some ridiculous notion that you’re mad at me. Tell him you’re not mad at me. Go ahead, set him straight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 amy I’m mad at you, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon Hmm. Eat one of your Luna bars. Very often when women think they’re angry, they’re really just hungry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 amy I’m not hungry. Your friend insulted me, and you didn’t do anything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon Precisely, I didn’t do anything. Now does someone feel like checking her emotional math?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 leonard Keep going, buddy, you’re doing great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 amy Sheldon, I’m your girlfriend, and you should have taken my side. That’s it. End of story. Good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon Wow, Amy’s mad and Leonard was right. What a weird day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 penny Hey. Sorry this took so long. But you used to work here, you know how it is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 bernadette Kitchen slammed again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 penny No, I’m a terrible waitress, remember?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 bernadette So, is there anything I can do to help you with the move tomorrow?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 howard Now that you mention it, I was thinking tomorrow might not be great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 bernadette What’s your excuse this time?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 howard No excuse. It’s just, you know, I’m Jewish, and technically, we’re not supposed to drive or carry anything on the Sabbath. So this one’s on God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 bernadette That might be a little more convincing if you didn’t have a mouthful of bacon cheeseburger.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 howard My religion’s kinda loosey-goosey. Basically, as long as you got your schmekel clipped and don’t wear a cross, you’re good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 bernadette Howie, you promised you’d move.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 howard And I will.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 penny Yeah, right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 howard I will. I’m obviously not going to live in my mother’s house for the rest of my life. I’m not a child.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 penny I’ve seen her burp you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 howard She did not burp me. She was patting me on the back, and I happened to burp. Don’t you have other tables you should be waiting on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 penny Yeah, but I told you, I’m not good at my job. Bernadette, listen to me. He is never gonna leave.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 bernadette I’m starting to think you’re right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 howard All right, I’ve had enough of this. I’m a grown man, I have a successful career, for the love of God, I’ve been to space. I will move out when I’m ready, and I don’t need anyone badgering me into it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 penny Wow, excuse me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 howard That was just for her benefit. I’ll move tomorrow. I love you. Don’t leave me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon Amy. Amy. Angry Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 amy What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon I’ve been thinking about what happened, and I hope this gift will make things better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 amy Star Trek DVDs? Why would I want this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon First of all, you’re welcome. And furthermore, not being familiar with Wil Wheaton’s body of work, there was no way for you to know you were being rude to a national treasure. Get ready for 130 hours of I told you so. Fine. I’ll just tell you what happens. Episode one, Encounter at Farpoint. Fade in. The new Enterprise heads out on its maiden voyage to contact the Bandi people of Deneb IV. Enter Wesley Crusher, played by my buddy… She’s hooked.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 raj Wow. An end of an era.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 howard Boy, if these walls could talk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 leonard They’d say, why does he touch himself so much?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 howard Yeah. I can’t believe I’m not going to live here anymore. This has always been my bedroom. Right here is where my mom used to mark my height.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 leonard Oh, yeah. Fifth grade. Sixth grade. Seventh grade. Eighth grade. Ninth grade.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 howard I remember when I was five, hiding under this desk with all my Halloween candy. Had some Peanut M&M’S, went into my first anaphylactic shock and had to be rushed to the hospital. Came home, celebrated with a Snickers, went into my second anaphylactic shock.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 raj When did you figure out you were allergic to nuts?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 howard Sometime around the third Almond Joy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 leonard Okay. You want to start loading this stuff into the truck?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 howard Yeah, I guess. Hey, would you do me a favour? Go on ahead. I just want one last moment alone in my old room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 leonard We’re not standing outside by the U-Haul while you fondle yourself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 howard Fine, let’s go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 penny Hey. What brings you in?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon Penny, if you wouldn’t mind, I’d like to have a conversation about girls.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 penny I had a feeling we’d have a talk like this sooner or later. Are you finally getting fuzz in weird places?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon Penny, please, I’m on the horns of a relationship dilemma. And for the record, I had a full pubis of hair by the time I was 19.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 penny And for the record, bleugh. So what are you drinking?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon Well, it’s been a rough day. I usually go chamomile tea, but I don’t think that’s going to cut it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 penny You could have a Long Island Iced Tea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon Will that calm my nerves?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 penny It’s calmed the pants off me a couple of times.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon Sold.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 penny Oh. So, the heart you got from the wizard giving you trouble?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon The trouble isn’t with me, Penny, it’s with your gender. Someday, scientists will discover that second X chromosome contains nothing but nonsense and twaddle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 penny Yeah, Amy told me what happened. Look, just apologize. It’ll warm her twaddle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon It’s a Band-Aid at best. See, the core problem is that Amy and Wil do not like each other. Which is baffling because they’re both crazy about me. And I like them, which indicates they’re bright and interesting and/or were on Star Trek.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 penny Honey, you can’t make people like each other.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon Not true. Leonard made me like you. And let me tell you, that was a hard row to hoe. Cheers, pal. Ooh. Boy, that is a treat that’s hard to beat. Get the Mad Hatter on the horn, I’m having a tea party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 penny You might want to pace yourself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon I drink tea all the time. I think I know what I’m doing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 penny Far be it from me to criticize a man with a full pubis. Look, Sheldon, your problem is not Wil Wheaton, okay? Your problem is the way you treated Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon My problem is I’m out of tea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 penny Come on, someone insulted your girlfriend and you just let him do it. I thought you Texas guys stood up for your womenfolk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon Penny, please, I think I’ve evolved beyond my simple rustic upbringing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 penny Sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon On the other hand, that low-down polecat done wronged my woman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 penny Welcome to Long Island, Tex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon Amy deserves better. You know, when we buy the Planter’s deluxe mix, she eats all the Brazil nuts so I don’t have to look at them. She’s a unique blend of saint and squirrel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 penny Yeah, that she is. Here you go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon I’m a callous egomaniac. She’s gonna leave me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 penny No, she won’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon No, she won’t. I’m great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 howard Okay, I have now officially moved out of my mother’s house. You are now the only woman in my life who I’ll see naked in the bathroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 bernadette I know this wasn’t easy. You doing okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 howard Oh, I’m fine. It’s just her I’m worried about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 bernadette Aw, she’ll be okay. She’s a grown woman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 howard I know. It’s just ever since my dad left, I’ve felt responsible for her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 bernadette That’s a lot for a kid to deal with.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 howard She was just so sad all the time. I was the only person who could cheer her up. Well, me and Ben and Jerry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 bernadette She’s lucky you were there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 howard You know, she’s why I first got into magic. I would do little shows for her, hang up a bedsheet like it was a curtain, put on a top hat and cape. And part way through the act, I would say I needed a volunteer from the audience to be my beautiful assistant and invite her up on stage. I can still remember the way she’d smile. For a few minutes, she’d forget how lonely she was.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 bernadette Aw, crap. Let’s go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 howard Where we going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 bernadette Grab a box. We’ll sleep at your mother’s place tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 howard No, but I want to live here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 bernadette Well, you should’ve thought of that before you told me the stupid magic trick story.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 howard Can’t we talk about this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 bernadette No husband of mine is gonna break his mother’s heart!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon Wil Wheaton! Wil Wheaton! Wait, how many was that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 wil Hey, Sheldon, what’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon Wouldn’t you like to know?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 wil Have you been drinking?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon Just tea. S’the best tea I’ve ever had.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 wil Why are you here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon I’ll tell you. I’m from Texas. Need I say more?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 wil Yeah, actually, a little more would be helpful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon You insulted my woman. I’m here to defend her honour. Two! It was two. Wil Wheaton! Now prepare yourself for what may come.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 wil Oh, Sheldon, do you really think we’re gonna fight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon My fists are not up here because I’m milking a giant invisible cow. They’re up to beat an apology out of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 wil Okay, I’m sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon Well, that was a long bus ride for not very much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 wil Are you okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon You’re asking a lot of questions, Wil Wheaton. As a matter of idle curiosity, which of your shrubberies do you feel would benefit from a thorough vomiting? Never mind, I’ll choose. You were so good in Stand by Me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon Hello, I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Get ready for a very special episode where we explore the flags of the popular entertainment franchise, Star Trek. And to help us, I’m pleased to introduce a special guest, surprisingly, it only took gas money and the promise of free food to get him here, Mr. LeVar Burton.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 levar Hey, Sheldon, it’s a pleasure to be here. Well, we’ve got some interesting flags for…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 amy Cut. Yikes, this guy is worse than Wil Wheaton.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 sheldon I don’t know what she’s talking about, but I’m obligated to agree with her. She’s my girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode07 levar Ah, I hear you, brother. I still get lunch, right?
