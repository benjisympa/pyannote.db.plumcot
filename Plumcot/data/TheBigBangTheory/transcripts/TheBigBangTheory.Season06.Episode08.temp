TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj What are you drawing over there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon It’s a hypothetical containment field for a Frisbee-sized wormhole that could serve as a portal to a parallel universe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard Oh, you silly doodlebug.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard You know, a lot of scientists believe that making contact with other life-forms would probably not end well for us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon It’s a Frisbee-sized wormhole, Leonard. You can block it with a Frisbee. Calm down. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard Do you expect me to build this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon I expect you to wipe the pudding off your chin. Gentlemen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard Have you guys ever noticed that Sheldon always disappears every day at two forty-five?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj He probably just goes to the bathroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard Actually, no, he goes to the bathroom at eight a.m. with optional follow-ups at one forty-five and seven ten high-fibre Fridays.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj It’s sad that you know that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard Oh, that’s just the tip of the sadness iceberg.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard I’m looking at his public calendar. Two forty-five to three-oh-five, nothing. Yesterday, two forty-five to three-oh-five, nothing, last week, nothing, last month, nothing. He never has anything booked during that time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj Twenty minutes a day, completely unaccounted for.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard We should figure out where he goes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj Ooh, this is exciting. Like one of my classic murder mystery dinner parties.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard Right, the case of who murdered three Saturday nights of my life?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard Colonel Koothrapali in the kitchen with the olive spread.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj It was tapenade and you guys suck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny So, how was work today?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard Well, I spent most of the afternoon growing isotopically pure crystals for neutrino detection.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny That sounds like fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard Yeah, it was.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny Oh, good, I guessed right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard Who you talking to?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny Oh, just this guy I met at school.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard Oh, great. We’re still dating, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny Relax. He’s just a friend. We’re doing an oral report together. He’s really nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard I’m sorry, what was that? I had a little stroke after oral.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny Would you stop? Look, he just moved here from London, okay? He doesn’t really know anybody.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard Oh, good, an English accent, the sexiest accent you can have.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny No. That’s not true. There’s French, there’s Italian. No, you’re right, it’s the best.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard Did you tell him you have a boyfriend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny It didn’t come up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard Well, maybe you should tell him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny What am I supposed to say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard Say, can’t talk right now, hanging with my boyfriend. England sucks, you suck, USA number one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny Fine. Hanging with my boyfriend. Talk to you later. Happy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard Yes. Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny Mm-hmm. Hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard What did he say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny Nothing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny Did your boyfriend make you type that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard I hate this guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny Don’t be like that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard Come on, trust me, he’s hitting on you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny No, he’s not. We’re just friends. Look, is this gonna be a problem? Because he’s supposed to come over tomorrow to work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard Really? Here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny If it makes you uncomfortable, I’ll switch partners, even though the thing’s due next week and everyone already has a partner and I’ll probably end up failing the class.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard That’d be great. Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard Two forty-four, Right on schedule. Hey, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon Oh, hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard Raj and I are heading over to the genetics lab to pet the glow-in-the-dark bunny. Want to come with us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon No, thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj Are you sure? They turn off the lights, and it’s like a cute little laser show that poops all over the place.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon I’m quite sure. Good day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard Well, where are you going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon Where are you going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj We just told you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon I just told you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard No, you didn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon Well, it’s your word against mine; see you in court.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard Should we follow him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj I don’t know, I’m torn. I want to know where he’s going, but now I kind of want to play with the bunny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 alex Hi, guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard Hey, Alex, do you know where your boss just went?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 alex No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard Don’t you know his schedule?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 alex All I know is corduroy makes too much noise and I have to go find quieter pants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard Come on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj Boy, what I wouldn’t give to get her out of those pants and into something a little more stylish.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard This is where he goes? What’s in there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj I think it’s an old storage room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard What could he be doing in there every day for twenty minutes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj Well, he’s not doing twenty-minute abs, because if he were, he would have way better abs. Can you hear anything?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard Not yet. What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj I’m listening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard Can’t you face the other way and listen?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj I can’t do anything right for you, can I?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard What the hell is he up to?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj He is kind of a weirdo. Maybe he’s got Leonard Nimoy chained up in there. Or Bill Gates. Or Stephen Hawking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard Why would he chain up Stephen Hawking?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj Howard, please, you can’t treat the man differently just because he’s disabled. That’s not okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard If you’re wondering why I’ve been staring through the peephole, I’m trying to get a look at this guy who’s coming over to Penny’s.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon To be honest, I didn’t know you were here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard It’s not a big deal. He’s just in her history class. They’re working on a project together. I don’t even know why I care. You know what, I don’t care.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon You think you don’t care?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard This is silly. I have nothing to worry about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon Oh, I don’t know. I mean, statistically speaking, I’m sure you have something to worry about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard What do you mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon Well, if we assume your looks are average, yeah, right off the bat, fifty percent of men on Earth are more attractive than you. That’s one point five billion handsome lads standing by, waiting to rain on your parade.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard Well, yeah, but this isn’t just about looks. I’m, I’m way above average in a lot of other things.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon Not height, vision, athleticism, or ability to digest dairy products.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard I’m talking about important things like emotional maturity.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon You were just spying on your girlfriend through a peephole.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard I liked it better when you thought I wasn’t here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon I’m not saying you don’t have attractive qualities. Your choice of friends is impeccable, you’re a good sleeper, and last but not least, you buy the grapes I like. You’re a real catch compared to some snoring guy with a fridge full of lousy grapes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard None of this matters. I trust that Penny cares about me, and nothing’s gonna happen with this guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon Well, unless of course he’s a skilled hypnotist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon While unlikely, it’s still a statistical possibility. She might be performing sexual acts with him and not even know it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard Now you’re just being ridiculous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon Am I? The mind’s a mysterious thing, Leonard. He could be having the time of his life while she thinks she’s a chicken pecking for corn.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj Look at us, sneaking around in the middle of the night like a couple of cat burglars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard I think we’re more like ninjas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj I don’t want to be a ninja, I want to be a cat burglar.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard Fine, I’ll be a ninja, you be a cat burglar.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj No, we both have to be the same thing. Okay, we’re ninjas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj But next time, we’ll be cat burglars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard It’s locked.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj Are you sure?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard Yes, I’m sure. Now, you stand guard, I’m going to…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj It’s locked.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard Just keep an eye out. I’ll have this open in a minute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj When did you learn how to pick locks?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard When I was starting to do magic in junior high, I thought I could be an escape artist like Harry Houdini.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj How did that work out?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard Pretty good. I managed to escape friends, popularity, and every party thrown in a twelve mile radius. There. Ready?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj Hold on, hold on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj Sheldon is a very smart man, and he obviously wants to keep this a secret.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard Yeah, so?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj What if it’s booby-trapped?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard Don’t worry, I’m one step ahead of him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj Great, what’s your pl… 
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard Are we good?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj Yeah. Huh. Forty-three? What the hell does that mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard I don’t know. The solution to an equation?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj Maybe. It’s a prime number. Encryption systems are built on prime numbers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard What kind of secret does Sheldon have to encrypt?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj He’s always been very cagey about what he puts in his egg salad to make it so tasty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard It’s paprika.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj Really? Well, oh, okay, one mystery solved.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 voice_from_outside Okay, good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny Thanks, Cole. See you at school.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 cole See you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard I’ll be right back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon I thought you left a long time ago.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard ‘sup?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 cole Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard You, uh, moving into the apartment on the fifth floor?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 cole No, I was just visiting a friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard Oh, cool. That cute blonde on four?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 cole Yeah. You know her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard I, well, I see her around. I like to keep my distance because her boyfriend is a pretty scary dude.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 cole Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard Yeah. He’s ganged up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 cole She told me he’s a scientist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard That’s the name of his gang. The Scientists. They are crazy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 cole Well, thanks for the tip.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard No problem, brother. Stay frosty. We’re still dating, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 alex Oh, hello, Dr. Hofstadter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard Hey, Alex, and call me Leonard. Dr. Hofstadter is my father. And my mother. And my sister. And our cat. Although, I’m pretty sure Dr. Boots Hofstadter’s degree was honorary.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 alex May I join you, Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 alex Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard Hey, Alex, let me ask you something. My girlfriend knows this guy at school. He’s got an English accent.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 alex Ooh, I love English accents.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard Yeah, you all do. Anyway, I feel like he’s hitting on her. She says he’s just being nice and that I should trust her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 alex It’s probably harmless. You know how it is. I’m sure you get hit on all the time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard Right. Because girls are always like, ooh, that guy owns two Star Trek uniforms and gets a lot of ear infections. I got to get me some of that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 alex I don’t know, I bet it happens more than you realize.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard Trust me, it doesn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 alex You sure? You’re cute, you’re funny. Maybe you’re getting hit on, and you don’t even know it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 alex Yep, pretty sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard Okay, I got to get back to work. Thanks for listening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 alex No problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard Hope-hope no girls rip my clothes off on the way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj Come on, we’re smart guys. We can figure this out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard Forty-three. What is forty-three? Besides my mom’s neck size.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj It’s the atomic number for technetium.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard That stuff’s radioactive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj Do you think he’s building a bomb?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard Ah, it took him two years to put together that Lego Death Star, I’m not worried.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj Ooh, this could be something. forty-three is the number of calories in half a cup of fat-free yoghurt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard Why would you know that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj I’m sorry. We can’t all eat whatever we want and still stay thin. Wait, in the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, isn’t forty-three the answer to the question of life, the universe,and everything?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard That’s forty-two, dumb-ass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj Hey, hey. Feelings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard We should stop. I’m exhausted.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj Yeah, me, too. We’ve got more important things to do. Who cares what stupid forty-three means?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard Not me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj Let’s go home. You want to get something to eat?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard Sounds good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj What the balls is forty-three?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard I have to know!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny Hey, shouldn’t you be out with your gang, spray painting equations on the side of buildings?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard Come on, I’m sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny I just can’t believe you don’t trust me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard I do, of course I do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny Then why did you embarrass me in front of my friend, who, by the way, knew exactly who you were?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny Your picture’s on my refrigerator.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard Oh. You know, I’m really starting to not like this guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny What is your problem? Do you use up all your thinking at work and then have none left over for when you get home?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard I don’t know. It-it-it’s hard sometimes. Everywhere you go, guys hit on you, even if I’m standing right there. And they’re all taller than me. Why is everyone taller than me? You know what, this is all in my head. It’s my problem, not yours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny Leonard, why do you always do this? Listen to me, you’re the one I’m with. You know I love you, so will you please relax because you’re driving me crazy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard You know that’s the first time you ever said that you love me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard We’re just supposed to pretend it’s not a big deal?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny That’s exactly what we’re gonna do because you’re about to make me cry, and we both know if I start crying, you’re gonna start crying.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard You’re right, you should go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard She loves me. Hey, it’s Alex. Nice having coffee with you. If you want to talk more, I’m always available. Smiley face, smiley face. What a friendly girl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard Okay, picture’s up. Looks like the camera’s working.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj That’s good quality video.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard It better be. It’s the spare camera for the Mars rover.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj How did you get your hands on that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard Million dollar camera, ten dollar lock.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj Oh, my God, here he comes. This is it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard What the hell is that thing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj I don’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Experimental log. Wormhole generator test forty-four.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard Wormhole generator test? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon The first forty-three parallel universes I’ve checked proved to be empty. I see no reason to suspect universe number forty-four will be any different. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard Oh, my God!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj Holy crap!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon Oh! It’s eating my face!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj Aah! It’s eating his face!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon I found your webcam and replaced the video feed. You two should be ashamed of yourselves.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj Sheldon, we’re really sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard Yeah, really sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon Sorry? You may not realize it, but I have difficulty navigating certain aspects of daily life. You know, understanding sarcasm, feigning interest in others, not talking about trains as much as I want to. It’s exhausting. Which is why, for twenty minutes a day, I like to go down to that room, turn my mind off and do what I need to do to recharge.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard But what are you doing in there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj And what does forty-three mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon You don’t need to know, you don’t deserve to know, and you will never know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj Yeah, well, I know how to make your egg salad now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight… Drat. I’m never going to get to forty-three again. One, two, three, four… Rats.
