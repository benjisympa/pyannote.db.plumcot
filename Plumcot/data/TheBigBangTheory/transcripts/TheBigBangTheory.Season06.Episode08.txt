TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali What are you drawing over there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon_cooper It’s a hypothetical containment field for a Frisbee-sized wormhole that could serve as a portal to a parallel universe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Oh, you silly doodlebug.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter You know, a lot of scientists believe that making contact with other life-forms would probably not end well for us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon_cooper It’s a Frisbee-sized wormhole, Leonard. You can block it with a Frisbee. Calm down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Do you expect me to build this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon_cooper I expect you to wipe the pudding off your chin. Gentlemen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Have you guys ever noticed that Sheldon always disappears every day at two forty-five?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali He probably just goes to the bathroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Actually, no, he goes to the bathroom at eight a.m. with optional follow-ups at one forty-five and seven ten high-fibre Fridays.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali It’s sad that you know that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Oh, that’s just the tip of the sadness iceberg.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz I’m looking at his public calendar. Two forty-five to three-oh-five, nothing. Yesterday, two forty-five to three-oh-five, nothing, last week, nothing, last month, nothing. He never has anything booked during that time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Twenty minutes a day, completely unaccounted for.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz We should figure out where he goes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Ooh, this is exciting. Like one of my classic murder mystery dinner parties.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Right, the case of who murdered three Saturday nights of my life?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Colonel Koothrapali in the kitchen with the olive spread.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali It was tapenade and you guys suck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny So, how was work today?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Well, I spent most of the afternoon growing isotopically pure crystals for neutrino detection.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny That sounds like fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, it was.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny Oh, good, I guessed right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Who you talking to?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny Oh, just this guy I met at school.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Oh, great. We’re still dating, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny Relax. He’s just a friend. We’re doing an oral report together. He’s really nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter I’m sorry, what was that? I had a little stroke after oral.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny Would you stop? Look, he just moved here from London, okay? He doesn’t really know anybody.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Oh, good, an English accent, the sexiest accent you can have.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny No. That’s not true. There’s French, there’s Italian. No, you’re right, it’s the best.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Did you tell him you have a boyfriend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny It didn’t come up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Well, maybe you should tell him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny What am I supposed to say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Say, can’t talk right now, hanging with my boyfriend. England sucks, you suck, USA number one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny Fine. Hanging with my boyfriend. Talk to you later. Happy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Yes. Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny Mm-hmm. Hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter What did he say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny Nothing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny Did your boyfriend make you type that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter I hate this guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny Don’t be like that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Come on, trust me, he’s hitting on you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny No, he’s not. We’re just friends. Look, is this gonna be a problem? Because he’s supposed to come over tomorrow to work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Really? Here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny If it makes you uncomfortable, I’ll switch partners, even though the thing’s due next week and everyone already has a partner and I’ll probably end up failing the class.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter That’d be great. Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Two forty-four, Right on schedule. Hey, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Oh, hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Raj and I are heading over to the genetics lab to pet the glow-in-the-dark bunny. Want to come with us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon_cooper No, thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Are you sure? They turn off the lights, and it’s like a cute little laser show that poops all over the place.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon_cooper I’m quite sure. Good day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Well, where are you going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Where are you going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali We just told you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon_cooper I just told you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz No, you didn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Well, it’s your word against mine; see you in court.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Should we follow him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali I don’t know, I’m torn. I want to know where he’s going, but now I kind of want to play with the bunny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 alex_jensen Hi, guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Hey, Alex, do you know where your boss just went?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 alex_jensen No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Don’t you know his schedule?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 alex_jensen All I know is corduroy makes too much noise and I have to go find quieter pants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Come on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Boy, what I wouldn’t give to get her out of those pants and into something a little more stylish.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz This is where he goes? What’s in there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali I think it’s an old storage room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz What could he be doing in there every day for twenty minutes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Well, he’s not doing twenty-minute abs, because if he were, he would have way better abs. Can you hear anything?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Not yet. What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali I’m listening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Can’t you face the other way and listen?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali I can’t do anything right for you, can I?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz What the hell is he up to?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali He is kind of a weirdo. Maybe he’s got Leonard Nimoy chained up in there. Or Bill Gates. Or Stephen Hawking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Why would he chain up Stephen Hawking?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Howard, please, you can’t treat the man differently just because he’s disabled. That’s not okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter If you’re wondering why I’ve been staring through the peephole, I’m trying to get a look at this guy who’s coming over to Penny’s.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon_cooper To be honest, I didn’t know you were here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter It’s not a big deal. He’s just in her history class. They’re working on a project together. I don’t even know why I care. You know what, I don’t care.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon_cooper You think you don’t care?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter This is silly. I have nothing to worry about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Oh, I don’t know. I mean, statistically speaking, I’m sure you have something to worry about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter What do you mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Well, if we assume your looks are average, yeah, right off the bat, fifty percent of men on Earth are more attractive than you. That’s one point five billion handsome lads standing by, waiting to rain on your parade.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Well, yeah, but this isn’t just about looks. I’m, I’m way above average in a lot of other things.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Not height, vision, athleticism, or ability to digest dairy products.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter I’m talking about important things like emotional maturity.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon_cooper You were just spying on your girlfriend through a peephole.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter I liked it better when you thought I wasn’t here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon_cooper I’m not saying you don’t have attractive qualities. Your choice of friends is impeccable, you’re a good sleeper, and last but not least, you buy the grapes I like. You’re a real catch compared to some snoring guy with a fridge full of lousy grapes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter None of this matters. I trust that Penny cares about me, and nothing’s gonna happen with this guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Well, unless of course he’s a skilled hypnotist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon_cooper While unlikely, it’s still a statistical possibility. She might be performing sexual acts with him and not even know it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Now you’re just being ridiculous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Am I? The mind’s a mysterious thing, Leonard. He could be having the time of his life while she thinks she’s a chicken pecking for corn.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Look at us, sneaking around in the middle of the night like a couple of cat burglars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz I think we’re more like ninjas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali I don’t want to be a ninja, I want to be a cat burglar.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Fine, I’ll be a ninja, you be a cat burglar.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali No, we both have to be the same thing. Okay, we’re ninjas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali But next time, we’ll be cat burglars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz It’s locked.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Are you sure?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Yes, I’m sure. Now, you stand guard, I’m going to…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali It’s locked.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Just keep an eye out. I’ll have this open in a minute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali When did you learn how to pick locks?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz When I was starting to do magic in junior high, I thought I could be an escape artist like Harry Houdini.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali How did that work out?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Pretty good. I managed to escape friends, popularity, and every party thrown in a twelve mile radius. There. Ready?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Hold on, hold on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Sheldon is a very smart man, and he obviously wants to keep this a secret.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Yeah, so?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali What if it’s booby-trapped?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Don’t worry, I’m one step ahead of him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Great, what’s your pl…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Are we good?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Yeah. Huh. Forty-three? What the hell does that mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz I don’t know. The solution to an equation?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Maybe. It’s a prime number. Encryption systems are built on prime numbers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz What kind of secret does Sheldon have to encrypt?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali He’s always been very cagey about what he puts in his egg salad to make it so tasty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz It’s paprika.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Really? Well, oh, okay, one mystery solved.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 voice_from_outside#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 Okay, good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny Thanks, Cole. See you at school.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 cole See you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter I’ll be right back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon_cooper I thought you left a long time ago.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter ‘sup?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 cole Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter You, uh, moving into the apartment on the fifth floor?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 cole No, I was just visiting a friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Oh, cool. That cute blonde on four?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 cole Yeah. You know her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter I, well, I see her around. I like to keep my distance because her boyfriend is a pretty scary dude.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 cole Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Yeah. He’s ganged up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 cole She told me he’s a scientist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter That’s the name of his gang. The Scientists. They are crazy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 cole Well, thanks for the tip.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter No problem, brother. Stay frosty. We’re still dating, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 alex_jensen Oh, hello, Dr. Hofstadter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Hey, Alex, and call me Leonard. Dr. Hofstadter is my father. And my mother. And my sister. And our cat. Although, I’m pretty sure Dr. Boots Hofstadter’s degree was honorary.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 alex_jensen May I join you, Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 alex_jensen Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Hey, Alex, let me ask you something. My girlfriend knows this guy at school. He’s got an English accent.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 alex_jensen Ooh, I love English accents.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, you all do. Anyway, I feel like he’s hitting on her. She says he’s just being nice and that I should trust her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 alex_jensen It’s probably harmless. You know how it is. I’m sure you get hit on all the time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Right. Because girls are always like, ooh, that guy owns two Star Trek uniforms and gets a lot of ear infections. I got to get me some of that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 alex_jensen I don’t know, I bet it happens more than you realize.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Trust me, it doesn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 alex_jensen You sure? You’re cute, you’re funny. Maybe you’re getting hit on, and you don’t even know it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 alex_jensen Yep, pretty sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Okay, I got to get back to work. Thanks for listening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 alex_jensen No problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Hope-hope no girls rip my clothes off on the way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Come on, we’re smart guys. We can figure this out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Forty-three. What is forty-three? Besides my mom’s neck size.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali It’s the atomic number for technetium.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz That stuff’s radioactive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Do you think he’s building a bomb?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Ah, it took him two years to put together that Lego Death Star, I’m not worried.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Ooh, this could be something. forty-three is the number of calories in half a cup of fat-free yoghurt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Why would you know that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali I’m sorry. We can’t all eat whatever we want and still stay thin. Wait, in the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, isn’t forty-three the answer to the question of life, the universe,and everything?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz That’s forty-two, dumb-ass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Hey, hey. Feelings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz We should stop. I’m exhausted.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Yeah, me, too. We’ve got more important things to do. Who cares what stupid forty-three means?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Not me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Let’s go home. You want to get something to eat?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Sounds good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali What the balls is forty-three?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz I have to know!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny Hey, shouldn’t you be out with your gang, spray painting equations on the side of buildings?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Come on, I’m sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny I just can’t believe you don’t trust me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter I do, of course I do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny Then why did you embarrass me in front of my friend, who, by the way, knew exactly who you were?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny Your picture’s on my refrigerator.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Oh. You know, I’m really starting to not like this guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny What is your problem? Do you use up all your thinking at work and then have none left over for when you get home?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter I don’t know. It-it-it’s hard sometimes. Everywhere you go, guys hit on you, even if I’m standing right there. And they’re all taller than me. Why is everyone taller than me? You know what, this is all in my head. It’s my problem, not yours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny Leonard, why do you always do this? Listen to me, you’re the one I’m with. You know I love you, so will you please relax because you’re driving me crazy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter You know that’s the first time you ever said that you love me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter We’re just supposed to pretend it’s not a big deal?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny That’s exactly what we’re gonna do because you’re about to make me cry, and we both know if I start crying, you’re gonna start crying.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter You’re right, you should go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 penny All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter She loves me. Hey, it’s Alex. Nice having coffee with you. If you want to talk more, I’m always available. Smiley face, smiley face. What a friendly girl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Okay, picture’s up. Looks like the camera’s working.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali That’s good quality video.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz It better be. It’s the spare camera for the Mars rover.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali How did you get your hands on that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Million dollar camera, ten dollar lock.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Oh, my God, here he comes. This is it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz What the hell is that thing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali I don’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon_cooper This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Experimental log. Wormhole generator test forty-four.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Wormhole generator test?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon_cooper The first forty-three parallel universes I’ve checked proved to be empty. I see no reason to suspect universe number forty-four will be any different.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Oh, my God!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Holy crap!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Oh! It’s eating my face!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Aah! It’s eating his face!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon_cooper I found your webcam and replaced the video feed. You two should be ashamed of yourselves.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Sheldon, we’re really sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Yeah, really sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Sorry? You may not realize it, but I have difficulty navigating certain aspects of daily life. You know, understanding sarcasm, feigning interest in others, not talking about trains as much as I want to. It’s exhausting. Which is why, for twenty minutes a day, I like to go down to that room, turn my mind off and do what I need to do to recharge.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 howard_wolowitz But what are you doing in there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali And what does forty-three mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon_cooper You don’t need to know, you don’t deserve to know, and you will never know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Yeah, well, I know how to make your egg salad now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode08 sheldon_cooper One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight… Drat. I’m never going to get to forty-three again. One, two, three, four… Rats.
