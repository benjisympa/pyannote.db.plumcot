TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter They are not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 raj_koothrappali They are, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Your hypothesis is completely disconfirmed by all the data. You’re just clinging to it out of intellectual stubbornness.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 raj_koothrappali No, you’re displaying a shocking ignorance of the subject matter. Mummies and zombies are the exact same thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Oh, yeah? Mummies are wrapped in bandages.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 raj_koothrappali That’s called a fashion choice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter All right, you brought this on yourself. Sheldon, get him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper If a zombie bites you, you turn into a zombie. However, if a mummy bites you, all you turn into is some schmo with a mummy bite. So, like a zombie, that’s been eaten from the waist down, you, sir, have no leg to stand on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Good boy. Here’s a cookie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Oh, thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Hey, fellas, what’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Oh, mummies and zombies again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Oh, they’re not the same thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter You get a cookie, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Thanks. Guess who picked up his new car this morning?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 raj_koothrappali Congratulations. Does it have that new car smell?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Yep. For as long as I can keep my mother out of it. If you want to check it out later, it’s parked right out front, space 294.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper I’m sorry, 294?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper That’s my parking spot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 raj_koothrappali Why do you have a parking spot? You don’t have a car. You don’t even drive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper It doesn’t matter. That’s my spot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Maybe they reassigned it because you never use it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Well, I’m not using my nipples, either. Maybe they should reassign those.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Sheldon, someday, if you get a car, I’m sure they’ll give you another parking space.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper I don’t want another parking space. I want my parking space. It’s perfect. It’s a corner spot, cutting the risk of door-dings in half. It’s a mere 28 steps from the building entrance. The nearby tree provides shade on hot days and is also home to a delightful squirrel. Which is fortuitous because most squirrels are real jerks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Fun story. Meanwhile, you still don’t have a car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Don’t try to change the subject. This is about a parking space. It has nothing to do with cars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Are you listening to yourself?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper I always listen to myself. It’s one of the great joys of my life. Now, get your car out of my spot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Nope.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Very well. You leave me no choice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper What are you looking at, you stupid squirrel?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper President Siebert, listen to reason. Yeah, I understand I don’t use the parking spot, but that’s not the point. I… Yes, I’m aware you told me not to call you at home, but you didn’t answer the door. And I know you were there, because I saw you through the mail slot. Yeah, well, that’s some salty language. May I remind you that you’re the president of a major university, not the president of the Potty Mouth Club. There it is again. Do you kiss your mother with that mouth? Oh, well, I’m sorry for your loss. Good night, sir. Unbelievable. He says Wolowitz deserves my spot because he’s a high-profile asset to the university.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Well, he’s not wrong. Howard did go to the International Space Station.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Yeah, that was five weeks ago. How much longer is he gonna milk that cow?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, let it go. It’s not a big deal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper No, no, this is a slippery slope, Leonard. It starts with a parking space, where does it end? It’s like my dad always said, first they say you can’t drink and drive, next thing you know, you can’t let your 10-year-old take the wheel while you sleep one off in the backseat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter All that story does is make me feel bad for your mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Leonard, you’re my best friend. Why don’t you ever take my side?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Because I can never understand your side.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Give it back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper I’m sorry, but could you be more specific?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 howard_wolowitz My Iron Man helmet. Koothrappali saw you take it. Give it back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Oh, that. Well, see, I wanted it, and you weren’t using it. Apparently, those are the rules we live by now. Payback, it truly is the B word, isn’t it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Sheldon, that is a five hundred dollar limited edition collectible, and I want it back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper I’d love to help you out, but unfortunately , I’m using it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Fine. I’m taking your diploma.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Go ahead. That’s the only doctorate you’ll ever get. It smells funny in here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski We’re so proud of you, Amy. Your first bikini wax.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 penny Yeah. So, how you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler A little sensitive, but not bad. Does it always take that long?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 penny Uh, no, they usually don’t have to go out and get more wax.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler I feel like I’m five pounds lighter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski Really? Only five?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 penny Hey, anybody want a drink?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski Okay. So, did you spend last night hearing about this silly parking space fight, too?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler For hours. Fortunately, I couldn’t understand most of it ’cause Sheldon was wearing that stupid robot mask.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski Howard was so angry I had to mash up Benadryl in his ice cream to get him to fall asleep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler I guess this is what we get for being with two testosterone-fueled alpha males. At some point, they’re bound to lock horns.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 penny I’m assuming these are some kind of horns they bought at Comic-Con?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski I’m really sorry they took Sheldon’s spot away. He shouldn’t have to suffer just because Howard’s such a big deal now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler I know, Sheldon should just let Howard have his little moment in the sun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski What’s that supposed to mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler Well, I mean, Howard’s never gonna go to space again, but Sheldon will always be a genius.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski You’re right. And I’m sure Sheldon will get a fancy parking spot again, if and when he makes a worthwhile contribution to science.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler If and when?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 penny Okay, maybe we should change the subject. Um, Amy, how are your lady parts? Still chilly down there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski Hang on. None of Sheldon’s theories have ever been definitively proven. My husband actually went to outer space.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler That’s an impressive accomplishment. He’s now an inspiration to millions of Americans who know you don’t have to be special or even qualified to go into space.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 penny You know, I remember the first time I got a bikini wax. My sister did it with melted Crayolas and duct tape. It’s a bad idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski Gosh, Amy. I’m sensing a little hostility. Is it maybe because, like Sheldon’s work, your sex life is also theoretical?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 penny Damn.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler Yeah, well, at least when we do make love, Sheldon won’t be thinking about his mother. And yes, that is a cleverly veiled reference to Howard’s lifelong obsession to crawl back into her spacious womb.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 penny Anyway, to this day, I still can’t see a box of crayons without crossing my legs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t have to take this. I’m gonna go home and have sex with my husband right now. Maybe I’ll let him do it to me in the parking spot. Which sounds dirty, but I didn’t mean it that way,
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Cookie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter I don’t have any.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Well, I’m not giving it away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Hi Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper He’s in my spot. Leonard, make him stop being naked in my spot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Howard, what are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 howard_wolowitz He wasn’t using it. And I needed a nice cool piece of leather to wiggle my naked ass on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Get off there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Give me back my Iron Man helmet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Give me back my parking space.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 howard_wolowitz You don’t need a parking space. You don’t have a car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper You don’t need an Iron Man helmet. You’re not Iron Man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Well, we appear to have reached an impasse. And you know, I have to say, I thought you’d be more upset that your laptop is sitting on my junk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 raj_koothrappali I didn’t pick up on that. That’s a nice touch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Mmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler This is so exciting. I’m feeling all tingly. Although that could just be my newly defoliated bikini zone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Keep a lookout. This place is swarming with campus security. They will not hesitate to scold us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler Freaking pigs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Oh, yeah. Okay, now, pull your car into the spot and let’s get out of here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler Wait, I’m leaving my car here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Yes, and be sure and put on the emergency brake. Really makes these things tough to budge.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler Before I park, come in the back seat. I want to show you something I had done today.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper All right, colour me intrigued.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler What do you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper I think you’re high on paint fumes. And boy, that’s a lot of Band-Aids.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 penny Okay, Howard’s mother is in, like, every one of your wedding photos.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski What can I tell ya? She’s a big girl. Wherever you look, there she is. More coffee?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 penny No, Leonard’s taking me to a physics lecture, and coffee’ll just keep me awake. Oh, I’ll get it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, looks like someone’s on Team Bernadette. Where’s Howard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski He’s not here. What’s wrong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler He had my car towed. It cost me two hundred dollars to get it back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, no. Where was it parked?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler In Sheldon’s spot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski That doesn’t make sense. Sheldon doesn’t have a spot. Was it maybe in Howard’s spot?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler Don’t play dumb with me, sister. You tell your husband he owes me two hundred dollars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski Well, that doesn’t make sense, either.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski Because I’m the one who had it towed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler You?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski Didn’t see that one coming, did ya?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, yeah? Well, you’re not gonna see this coming.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 penny Ow! Ow!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, my God,
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski Are you okay?!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 penny You idiot, what the hell do you have in there?!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler Just my wallet, keys and a coffee can full of change I’ve been meaning to take to the bank.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski Don’t move. I’ll get some ice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler Are you okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 penny Get away from me or I swear to God I will rip out what’s left of your pubes!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski Here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 penny Thanks. Ah!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski Amy, you think maybe this has gotten a little out of hand?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 penny Gee, you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler I do. Penny, Bernadette and I are sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski You hit her! What did I do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler You had my car towed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski You were parked in Howard’s spot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler I was parked in Sheldon’s spot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski Sheldon doesn’t have a spot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 penny Guys, I think I need to go to the emergency room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski Okay, let’s go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler I’ll drive. You can see where the tow truck scratched my car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski The tow truck didn’t scratch your car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler How do you know?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski ‘Cause I did it!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Morning, Professor Stevens. Don’t look at that whiteboard. That’s my math, not your math. Keep walking, nosey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 howard_wolowitz What the hell are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Oh. You said I’m not using my space, so I’m using it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Okay, you need to move now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper No, I don’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 howard_wolowitz You can’t stay there forever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Actually, I have a plastic baggy strapped to my leg that says I can. Give up, Wolowitz. You’ve chosen to tangle with a superior intellect you can’t defeat. There is nothing you could possibly do to…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Those aren’t gonna help you, Sheldon,
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Oh, yes, they are. I mean, what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 howard_wolowitz I’m warning you, Sheldon!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Your threats are empty, nothing can move me. Stop that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Get out of my spot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper No. That’s it. I am calling campus security. You prepare for the scolding of your life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter What are you idiots doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper He’s trying to kill me, Leonard. Video games and rock music have desensitized him to violence.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Would you please talk some sense into your lunatic roommate?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter You’re both acting like lunatics. It’s just a parking spot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 howard_wolowitz It’s not just a parking spot. He can’t handle the fact that I’m a bigger deal than he is now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Oh, preposterous. I have been solely responsible for this university’s six loop quantum gravity calculations, I have changed the way we think about Bose-Einstein condensates, and I am also the one who got Nutter Butters in the cafeteria vending machine. Maybe you missed that news while you were floating around like a goof in outer space. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have work to do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Can you believe this guy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter What I don’t believe is that you tried to run him over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Oh, like you’ve never thought of doing that. Don’t hate me just because I lived the dream.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Hey, sweet ride.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 howard_wolowitz What are you doing in there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Just breaking in your new car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Stop that. You stop that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper You know what they say? Revenge is a dish best served nude.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 raj_koothrappali Hey, got a minute?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Oh, of course, come in. This is an authentic Chinese throwing star, and I must warn you, I have seen many people throw them in movies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 raj_koothrappali Calm down. Howard has something he wants to say to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 howard_wolowitz All right. Sheldon, when this whole thing with the parking space started, I had no idea just how much of a crazy bastard…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 raj_koothrappali Howard, that’s not how we practiced it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 howard_wolowitz I had no idea how much that spot meant to you. Anyway, I called President Siebert and told him it’s not worth fighting over the spot, so you keep it, and I’ll park in the structure across the street.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Well, Howard, thank you. It’s quite a gesture on your part. You’ve shown yourself to be the bigger man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Which I find totally unacceptable. I must be the bigger man. Therefore, you may use my spot until such time as I learn to drive or get a Batmobile.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Wow, okay. Well, thanks. I don’t know what to say.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper There is nothing to say. Except I’m the bigger man. I’m not kidding. Say it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 raj_koothrappali Just say it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 howard_wolowitz You’re the bigger man, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Oh, stop. And I believe this is yours. FYI, if you wear that into a bank, they will tackle you to the ground.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 howard_wolowitz I’d like to propose a toast, to burying the hatchet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper To burying the hatchet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski You know, I’m kind of glad this happened.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler Me, too. In some weird way, I kind of feel like it brought us closer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 penny Yeah, everybody’s happy, great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 shopkeeper#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 Can I help you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Yes. According to information I gleaned from Yelp, you had great success when a santeriasuzy37 brought you a pair of leather slacks stained with chicken blood. I believe I may have a similar problem. This cushion experienced a nude revenge wiggle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 shopkeeper#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 A what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper A naked man sat on it. Now, here’s my concern, his diet is rich in fatty deli meats. What test do you have to detect lipid residue?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 shopkeeper#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 Lipid what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Lipid residue. An anal autograph. A colon calling card, if you will.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 shopkeeper#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 Tuesday okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Don’t rush it. We may be dealing with befoulment on a molecular level.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 shopkeeper#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 Let me write you a ticket.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Is that your son?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 shopkeeper#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 Uh-huh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Looks like that laptop’s seen better days. If you’re interested, I’m selling this. It’s only two years old, 16 gigabytes of RAM, Intel core i7 processor, and I can personally guarantee it has spent less than 20 minutes resting on an astronaut’s penis.
