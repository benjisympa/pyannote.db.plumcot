TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 sheldon Is anyone else troubled by the Spider-Man theme song?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 leonard Why would it trouble you? It’s, like, your third favourite cartoon theme song.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 sheldon It is, right behind do-do-do-do-do Inspector Gadget., and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, heroes in a half-shell.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard_and_raj Turtle power!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 sheldon However, the Spider-Man lyrics posit that Spider-Man, Spider-Man does whatever a spider can.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard Yeah, so?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 sheldon I can think of many things Spider-Man can’t do that a spider can. One, crawl in your ear and die. Two, legally leave Guatemala without a passport. Three, have sex with a spider.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 raj an we change the subject? Spiders give me the jeebie-jeebies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard It’s heebie-jeebies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 raj I know, but that sounds anti-Semitic. Anyway, I was thinking we could have a little film festival tonight. The theme, movies that killed their franchises.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 leonard Oh. Like Jaws 4, Indiana Jones 4, Daredevil 1.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 leonard Penny’s working tonight, I’m in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard Not me. I’m having dinner with Bernadette and her parents.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 leonard Fun. We know how much you love that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard It’s torture. Especially with her dad. We have nothing in common.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 sheldon You know what I like to do when I’m forced to speak with those beneath my intellectual station? I bring up an interesting topic, like the difference between Spider-Man and spiders.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard Thanks, Sheldon. I’ll try that with my father-in-law.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 sheldon No, you can’t use that one. That’s mine. Uh, try this one for an ice-breaker. Uh, despite popular lore, there is no place in the continental United States, Alaska or Hawaii from which one can dig straight through the centre of the earth and come up in China.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard Great, thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 sheldon Actually, you can’t have that one either. It’s too good. Sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 raj What about you, Sheldon? Do you have any plans tonight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 sheldon Sadly, yes. Amy’s taking me to a memorial service. It’s for one of her colleagues who is of Asian descent, so my planned conversational gambit is to casually remark that no matter how deep they dig his grave, he’ll never make his way back to China.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 leonard That should lighten the mood.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 sheldon What can I say? I put the fun in funeral.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 sheldon Amy. Amy. Oh, right, funeral. Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 amy Hello, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 sheldon I’m not allowed to wear my Silver Surfer neck tie, but you can wear a bathrobe?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 amy I think I’m too sick to go to the funeral.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 sheldon You’re sick? You poor kid. Well, see ya.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 amy Sheldon, aren’t you gonna take care of me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 sheldon Me? No. No, I’m not that kind of doctor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 amy But our relationship agreement clearly states that when one of us is sick, the other must take care of them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 sheldon Oh, no, I see the confusion. No, the intent behind that clause was to force you to take care of me when I’m ill. When you’re feeling better, you’ll think that’s funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 amy Never mind. Good night, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 sheldon Amy. Amy. Amy. I made a commitment in writing to comfort you in times like this. Additionally, you are my girlfriend, and I care about your well-being.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 amy Thank you, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 sheldon You’re welcome. Now let’s get this over with.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard So, how have you been?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 mr_rostenkowski Fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard Good. Fine is good. How you liking retirement?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 mr_rostenkowski It’s fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard I’m sensing a theme. You ever really think about the Spider-Man theme song? How’s that dinner coming?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 bernadette I just put it in. It’s gonna be a while.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard I like rare chicken. Let’s do this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 bernadette You could die.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard Death by chicken. That’s a pretty fowl way to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 mrs_rostenkowski Here’s another beer, honey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 mr_rostenkowski Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard So, Mrs. Rostenkowski, you took that trip to the Grand Canyon. How was it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 mrs_rostenkowski It was good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard Had no idea you were the chatty one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 sheldon 102.2. Exactly what it was half an hour ago. It’s like you’re not even trying to get better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 amy Sheldon, you don’t get over the flu in half an hour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 sheldon Well, not with that attitude.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 amy I have to say, I’m finding your bedside manner a little lacking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 sheldon I’m sorry. I just want you to get better as soon as possible. And with that goal in mind, let me ask you a question. Do you believe in the placebo effect?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 amy Of course I do. There have been many studies proving its validity.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 sheldon Great. Now, this may look like a Tic Tac, but it is really a powerful medication specifically designed to cure your illness as well as freshen your breath.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 amy Sheldon, this isn’t helping. Why don’t you just let me get some rest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 sheldon How can you sleep? I’m not done making you feel better. I still have to put a cold rag on your head, sing to you and apply VapoRub to your chest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 amy You, you want to rub something on my chest?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 sheldon Yes. All over it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 amy Maybe we should start with that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 sheldon Now you’re being a responsible patient. Now, you may notice some tingling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 amy Oh, I’m counting on it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard Okay, dig in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 mr_rostenkowski Hold up. Bless us, O Lord for these Thy gifts which we are about to receive from Thy bounty through Christ our Lord. Amen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard Took the words right out of my mouth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 bernadette So, Dad, have you done any fishing lately?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 mr_rostenkowski I’m going next weekend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard Oh, you like to fish?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 mr_rostenkowski Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard Sure. I can hear it in your voice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 mrs_rostenkowski Oh, if he didn’t like it, he wouldn’t go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard You know, I hadn’t thought of that. Help me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 bernadette Hey, Dad, maybe you could take Howard fishing sometime. Give you guys a chance to get to know each other better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard No, no. We know each other well enough. He’s been talking my ear off all night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 bernadette Howie, I think you’d have fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 mr_rostenkowski Fine, you can tag along.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 bernadette Terrific. My two favorite fellas gone fishin’.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard Well, hang on a second, Bernie. Next weekend, we have that thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 bernadette What thing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard You know, the thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 bernadette Oh, that thing. No, I cancelled that thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 mr_rostenkowski All right, it’s settled. You and I are going fishing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard Great. Thanks for the help.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard I’ve never even been fishing. This is gonna be a disaster.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 raj If you don’t want to look foolish doing something, you should practice. Do you know how many Beef Wellingtons I made by myself before I invited you guys over? I’ll give you a hint. You can see them here, here and here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 leonard Raj is probably right. You should get someone to give you some pointers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard Do either of you guys know how to fish?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 leonard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 raj No. But if you catch anything, I know how to steam it in banana leaves.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard Come on, we must know somebody who can do manly stuff like this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 penny S’up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 penny Step one, worms.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard Ew!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 penny Okay, right there, ew is one of the things you’re not gonna want to say in front of your father-in-law. It’s right up there with icky and get it away. Now pick one up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 penny You’re gonna have to do it when you’re fishing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 penny What are you waiting for?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard I don’t know, for them to die of natural causes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 penny Just pick up a worm and put him on this hook.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard Fine. There.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 leonard I’m no expert, but I think the hook has to go through the worm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard Fine. Sorry, Mr. Worm. Sherm. Sherm the Worm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 penny Hey, don’t name him. Just jab a hook in his face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 raj You got this, buddy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 leonard Yeah, come on, Howard. Hook that worm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 raj You can do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 penny That’s great. Cheerleading, way to man things up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 sheldon And the control group displayed significantly fewer genetic abnormalities. But, because of flaws in the experimental design relating to environment and diet, they lived inconclusively ever after. The end.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 amy That was great. Rub my chest again. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 sheldon No. I need to get you down for a nap. And for some reason, that VapoRub gets you all fired up. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 bernadette How’s the poor thing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 sheldon Oh, I’m hanging in there. Thanks for asking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 bernadette Okay, Amy, I brought you some drugs we were working on in the lab. This is proving really good for congestion, but there’s a slight chance it can make your tears burn like acid, so if you take it, happy thoughts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 sheldon Uh, I’m going to draw you a soothing bath. Where’s your bath thermometer?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 amy I don’t have a bath thermometer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 sheldon Fine. Then I’m going to draw you a nerve-wracking bath of indeterminate temperature.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 bernadette This is a really good expectorant. Although some test subjects reported lactating uncontrollably when they heard music.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 amy Okay, okay, here’s the deal. I don’t need your medicine. I’m not sick.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 bernadette I don’t understand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 amy I got better two days ago. It’s just been so nice having Sheldon take care of me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 bernadette So you’ve just been lying to him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 amy See the stuff in my nose? Rubber cement.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 bernadette I don’t mean to be judgy, but this is the kind of thing lunatics do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 amy All right. I’ll tell him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 sheldon Amy, would you be strong enough to bathe yourself, or do you need my help?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 amy I’ll tell him tomorrow. Mama needs a bath.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 penny Now, let’s assume, by some miracle, you actually catch a fish. You’re going to have to know how to gut it. So, what you’re going to do is you’re going to take your knife, slice him right up the belly. You want me to stop?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard No, I’m fine. Keep going.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 penny All right. Now, you don’t want to cut too deep into its guts, or the blood will just squirt all over your face. Oh, my God. What is with you guys?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 leonard It’s not our fault. Our dads never did anything like this with us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 penny What, never?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 leonard My dad was an anthropologist. The only father-son time he spent was with a 2,000-year-old skeleton of an Etruscan boy. I hated that kid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 raj Mine just took me to his gynecology office. I got so bored, I’d put vaginal lubricant on the bottom of my shoes and pretend I was ice-skating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard Yeah, well, my quality father-son time was spending my adolescence looking out the window waiting for my dad to come back someday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 raj Yeah, okay, Howard wins.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 leonard You know, maybe we didn’t have opportunities like this when we were growing up, but right now, there’s a dad that wants to take you on a fishing trip.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard You’re right. Oh! I should do this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 penny Great. Here you go. What you’re going to do is you’re going to stick your thumb down its throat, grab the guts and pull.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard Here we go. Oh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 penny Oh, look, it’s a female. You can see all the eggs. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 amy Oh, Sheldon, am I glad you’re back. Taking a turn for the worst. I think I’m going to need another bath.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 sheldon I’m surprised to hear that. See, the other day, I was concerned that you weren’t recovering, so while you were sleeping, I took a cheek swab and had it cultured in the lab.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 amy Oh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 sheldon I got the results back. Have you developed any of the following symptoms? A growing nose, or perhaps a warm sensation in the trouser region? Also known as full-blown liar, liar, pants on fire.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 amy All right, all right. But I really was sick at the beginning. It’s just been so nice having you take care of me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 sheldon It hurts that you would lie to me, Amy. I thought our relationship was based on trust and a mutual admiration that skews in my favour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 amy I feel terrible I did this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 sheldon It pains me to say it, but I think some form of penalty is in order, so as to discourage this type of behaviour in the future.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 amy I suppose that’s fair. What do you suggest?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 sheldon In a perfect world, I’d lock you in a stockade in the public square. That probably requires a permit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 amy I could not be allowed to go to the opening of the next Star Trek movie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 sheldon Oh, that seems overly harsh. I mean, you gave in to a human weakness, you didn’t kill a man. You know, it’s a tad old-school, but my father was not one to spare the rod when my brother would sneak into his truck and drink his driving whiskey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 amy Are you saying you want to spank me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 sheldon I don’t want to. But it looks like you left me no choice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 amy That’s true. I’ve been a very bad girl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard Hi-ho, hi-ho, it’s off to fish we go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 mr_rostenkowski That’s what you’re wearing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard No good? The guy at the sporting goods store said these are what fishermen wear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 mr_rostenkowski Maybe in cartoons.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard Wish I had known that before I posted all those pictures on Facebook.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 mr_rostenkowski All right, let’s hit the road. I wouldn’t mind shooting some ducks in the morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard Wait, now we’re shooting things?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 mr_rostenkowski I like using a big shell. You can’t eat them afterwards, but it’s fun watching them blow up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard Sir, I’m flattered that you invited me, and I really want you to like me, but I don’t think this trip is the way to do it. And I can’t return these things if there’s chunks of duck all over them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 mr_rostenkowski So, why’d you agree to come?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard ‘Cause Bernadette made me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 mr_rostenkowski I tried to back out, too. My wife said I had to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard Really? Your wife makes you do stuff? You’re a big, scary cop.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 mr_rostenkowski You’re an astronaut, and your wife makes you do things, and she’s only four feet tall.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard So, what do we do now? They expect us to go away for the weekend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 mr_rostenkowski Ah. There’s an Indian casino near Palm Springs. You know how to shoot craps?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard No, but I’m not a stranger to dice games. I was the Temple Beth-El Hebrew School Yahtzee champion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 mr_rostenkowski Mazel tov. I’ll teach you how to play.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard Really? Thank you, sir.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 mr_rostenkowski Call me Mike.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard Okay. Oh, boy, we’re just married to a couple of ballbusters, huh, Mike?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 mr_rostenkowski That’s my wife and daughter you’re talking about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 howard Great couple of gals.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 mr_rostenkowski I wouldn’t go that far.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 sheldon Are you prepared to receive your punishment?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 amy One second. I want to put on some music.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 sheldon Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 amy I don’t want to disturb the people next door while you discipline me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 sheldon Very well, then. Get over my knee. Let’s begin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 amy Oh, my.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 sheldon Excuse me. You’re not supposed to be enjoying this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 amy Then maybe you should spank me harder.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 sheldon Maybe I will.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode10 amy Ooh!
