TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 penny Okay, now holding sides of hearth in position, lower mantelpiece assembly onto top tabs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 leonard Look at that, I built a fireplace with my own two hands.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 penny You’re so butch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 leonard Aw, I got a little paper cut.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 penny Of course you did. Your hands are softer than veal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 leonard Oh, before I forget, Saturday I’m planning a little Dungeons and Dragons night with the guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 penny Really? That’s how you’re gonna spend your Saturday night?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 leonard Oh, come on, I hardly ever get a chance to play anymore.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 penny Oh, you poor thing. Is having a real-life girlfriend who has sex with you getting in the way of your board games?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 leonard Little bit, yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 amy Oh, great! I’ve always wanted to play Dungeons and Dragons.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 sheldon Yeah, oh, I’m sorry. I should’ve mentioned this earlier. You’re not invited.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 amy Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 sheldon Amy, from time to time, we men need to break free from the shackles of civility and get in touch with our primal animalistic selves.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 amy By rolling dice and playing make-believe with little figurines?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 sheldon Yeah, like a bunch of savages.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 bernadette Saturday night? But I’ve been working late all week. That was gonna be our night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 howard But I have to go. We play as a group. If-if I’m not there, then everyone will blame you. They’ll be all, Bernadette ruined everything. She’s the worst. So, you see? I have to play Dungeons and Dragons for the marriage.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 bernadette You’re an idiot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 howard I’m your idiot. Forever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 raj So, listen, I know we talked about getting a bite to eat in Silver Lake, and then seeing the Christmas lights in Griffith Park, but Leonard’s talking about a big D and D game at his place.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 stuart Saturday night just went from crazy to epic. Woo-hoo!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 leonard All right, Sheldon, to start our quest you need to open this little Christmas gift I got you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 sheldon A Christmas gift? You know I don’t enjoy Christmas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 stuart What’s wrong with Christmas?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 sheldon Oh, where to begin? Trees indoors. Overuse of the words ’tis and ’twas. And the absurd custom of one stocking. Everyone knows socks belong in pairs. Who uses one sock?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 sheldon Actually that helps, thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 leonard Would you just look inside?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 sheldon Oh, a scroll. I like scrolls. They’re my third favourite system of transmitting the written word. After stone tablets and skywriting. You have all been summoned to join a thrilling Dungeons and Dragons adventure. Your quest begins in a secret northern village of elves who have all been massacred. I like where this is heading. Your task is to rescue their leader from a dungeon of ogres. Oh, that’s a saucy twist. That leader’s name, Santa Claus. No, no, no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 leonard It’s actually ho, ho, ho, but you’ll get the hang of it. Thought it’d be fun to make a quest with a holiday theme.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 sheldon Fun? Mixing Dungeons and Dragons with Christmas is like making a sandwich of grape jelly, the best-tasting jelly, and petroleum jelly, the worst-tasting jelly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 leonard Okay, here we go. You find yourselves in the smoking remains of Santa’s village. Clearly, a great battle has taken place.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 raj Oh, man, the first monster I see, I’m gonna sneak up behind him, whip out my wand, and shoot my magic all over his ass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 stuart Do you hear yourself when you say these things?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 leonard Okay, there are ogre tracks and a trail of broken candy canes in the snow. Sheldon, what do you do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 sheldon I signal my contempt for your cruel plan to shove Christmas joy down my throat by making a gesture that says get a load of this guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 leonard Fine. Howard, what do you do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 howard I follow the ogre tracks, checking for secret doors along the way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 leonard And you discover a secret door leading to a dark corridor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 howard Okay, guys, let’s make a plan, spell casters in the back, warriors in the front.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 raj No, screw that noise, I’m going in. Hang on, Santa, I’m coming for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 leonard Okay, you run into a room full of weapons, hit a trip wire, a cannon blows your face off, you die, you’re out of the game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 raj But, a cannon? Am I really out of the game?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 sheldon Lucky.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 leonard Okay, come on, moving on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 raj Wait, doesn’t anyone have a rod of resurrection? Because if you’ve got one, I need it bad. Get in here with your rod and give it to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 stuart Okay, you need to say these things in your head before you say them out loud.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 penny Hey, guys. I don’t mean to interrupt your little game, but I thought you’d like to see what you’re missing out on. So, Bernadette? Bernadette’s wearing leopard-print pumps and a rack-tastic red dress from Forever 21. And there’s Amy, showing all kinds of ankle. In an outfit I’m assuming is from Forever 63. And I, myself am wearing a little number that got me out of two speeding tickets and jury duty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 sheldon I know they’re making a rhetorical point, I just don’t know what it is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 penny See you, boys. We are going drinking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 raj Uh, wait, can I come with you? My character died.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 bernadette Sorry, Raj, it’s girls’ night out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 amy Maybe another time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 leonard Okay…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 penny Come on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 raj Ooh! Girls’ night, girls’ night! Ooh! Ooh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 stuart How does he not hear that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 amy So, what’s the plan? Are we gonna teach our fellas a lesson by getting stinking drunk, luring strange men into the bathroom, and turning the toilet stall into a temple of the senses?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 bernadette No!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 penny No!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 amy Geez, who’s Forever 63 now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 raj Can we get another bottle of champagne for the table? Don’t worry. It’s my treat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 amy Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 penny Wow, you should come to girls’ night more often. And not just because if you weren’t here, this would be a can of Pabst.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 raj My pleasure, nothing makes me happier than the chance to spoil a lady. Just ask my dog. My vet says if I give her any more foie gras, she’s going to die of gout.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 bernadette Hey, let’s help Raj meet a girl tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 raj No, no, no, I’m fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 penny Okay, wait, are we talking one-night stand or do we want to get him into a relationship?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 amy Let’s get him laid!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 raj Stop it. You’re ruining girls’ night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 penny Raj, you’re a great guy, you’re in a bar full of single women, let us help you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 bernadette Yeah, you’re a real catch. I know you’re shy, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t have someone wonderful in your life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 raj That’s sweet of you. But what can you do to help?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 bernadette We’ll nose around, see if we can find a nice girl, and then introduce you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 raj Okay. Well, a couple of things. Don’t tell them I come from money. I want them to love me for me. They must be insanely hot. Like, nines or tens.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 penny Nines or tens?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 raj Okay, an eight is acceptable if she’s willing to bring another eight to the hot tub.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 bernadette Bottom line, you’ll take any woman who’ll have you, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 raj In a New Delhi minute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 stuart I don’t remember you buying these miniatures in my store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 leonard Oh, uh, yeah. I got ’em on Amazon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 stuart Sure. I get it. Why support a friend when you can support a multinational conglomerate that is crushing the life out of that friend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 leonard I know, but when I shop online, I can do it on the toilet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 stuart Have you seen my store? The whole place is a toilet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 howard Can we please move this along?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 leonard Yeah, sorry. Uh, you come to the end of the tunnel and find a large chest. What do you do? And, Howard, do not say, I feel up the large chest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 howard Excuse me, I’m a married man now. I wasn’t going to say anything so juvenile.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 leonard Great. What do you do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 howard I walk up to the large chest, bury my face in it and go “blublublublublublublublu”
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 sheldon I open the chest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 leonard It’s locked, but suddenly the door behind you slams shut and now the walls of the room start closing in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 stuart That’s not good. My character and I both have claustrophobia.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 leonard Glowing letters appear on the chest that read, If squashed to death you wish not to be, sing of Svaty Vaclav and his victory.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 howard Who the hell is Svaty Vaclav?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 leonard Walls are getting closer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 stuart Oh, boy, happy place, happy place.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 sheldon Wait, Svaty Vaclav was the Duke of Bohemia.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 leonard You’re ten seconds away from getting crushed. Nine, eight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 howard What are we supposed to do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 leonard Seven, six.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 sheldon Wait, wait. Svaty Vaclav is better known as Good King Wenceslas from the beloved Victorian Christmas carol.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 howard Never heard of it. Must be the one Christmas song not written by a Jewish guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 leonard Three, two.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 stuart Somebody sing the damn song.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 sheldon Good King Wenceslas looked out, on the feast of Stephen. When the snow lay ’round about, deep and crisp and even
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 leonard The walls are getting slower.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 sheldon Brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost was cruel. When a poor man came in sight gathering winter fuel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 howard That was amazing, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 stuart How did you know that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 sheldon It was simple. I combined a well-known historical fact about Bohemia with the memory of my grandparents, Mee-Maw and Pop-Pop, singing Christmas carols while I sat in front of the fire and tried to build a high-energy particle accelerator out of Legos.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 leonard Okay, continuing our quest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 sheldon W-W-Wait. There’s still four more verses. You don’t sing a song and not finish it. Hither, page, and stand by me, if thou know’st it, telling. Yonder peasant, who is he? Where and what his dwelling? Brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 bernadette Looks like he’s doing pretty good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 penny Of course he is. Look, that girl just got dumped by her boyfriend. She’s angry, she’s drunk, and her favorite movie is Slumdog Millionaire. I mean.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 amy That is some low-hanging fruit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 bernadette Oh, here he comes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 penny So, how’d it go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 raj Great. I bought her a couple of drinks, and she gave me her e-mail address.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 penny Ooh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 bernadette Jennifer at not-even-if-you-were-the-last-guy-on-earth dot loser.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 raj What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 bernadette I’m sorry, Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 raj Why can’t I find someone? I’m smart, I’ve got a cool job, and my naturally bronzed complexion means I can pull off mustard yellow in a way most guys can’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 penny Oh, honey, it’s not you, it’s them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 raj No, it’s not. She was too beautiful for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 bernadette Why would you say that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 raj It’s true. I’m always attracted to women I can’t have. I do it all the time. I did the same thing with the two of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 amy The two of them? I don’t understand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 raj Well, uh, there was a time when I had a thing for Penny, and I thought she was into me, too, because she got drunk and naked and climbed into bed with me. But apparently I misread those signals.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 amy And you liked Bernadette also?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 raj That was before Penny. I make it a rule to only fall for one of my friends’ girlfriends at a time. I’m very old-fashioned that way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 amy So at, uh, some point, you probably had a thing for me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 raj No, not really.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 penny Oh, come on, Raj, not even a little bit?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 raj Not that I can think of.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 bernadette Think harder.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 raj Nope. I guess the heart wants what the heart wants. Or in this case, doesn’t, I mean, at all. What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 sheldon Ye who now will bless the poor, shall yourselves find blessing. Ba-da-bum.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 howard Done?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 sheldon I think the word you’re looking for is bravo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 leonard Okay, you leave the room and find yourself standing before a pool of melted snowmen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 sheldon Melted snowmen? Are there carrots and lumps of coal in the water?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 leonard I don’t know. What’s the difference?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 sheldon Well it’s a game of the imagination, Leonard. Paint a picture.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 leonard Fine. You leave the room and find yourself standing before a pool of melted snowmen. There are carrots and lumps of coal in the water.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 sheldon What happened to the top hats and the corncob pipes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 leonard You see those, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 sheldon Oh, it’s like I’m really there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 stuart I gotta tell you, this, this is the most holiday fun I’ve had since my therapist changed my anxiety medication and I stopped caring about the blood in my stool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 howard Good story.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 leonard What are you drinking there? A little eggnog?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 sheldon Yes. What, is there a problem?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 leonard No, it’s nice to see you enjoying a holiday beverage. Pretty Christmassy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 sheldon Since when is eggnog a Christmas drink? Eggs are available all year ’round. I’ve been known to enjoy this poolside.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 leonard Come on, Sheldon. You know all the Christmas stories, and the carols, you’ve got an eggnog moustache going on there. Just admit it. You’re getting a little Yuletide spirit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 sheldon Oh, don’t be silly. Christmas is a bunch of baloney created by the tinsel industry. Why is this so important to you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 leonard Honestly, because I had enough crappy Christmases as a kid and I’m tired of you sucking the joy out of them now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 stuart What was so bad about them?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 leonard I grew up in a house full of crazy academics. Instead of leaving Santa milk and cookies, we had to leave him a research paper. And in the morning, you could tell he’d been there because the paper would be graded.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 sheldon No wonder you love Christmas. That sounds amazing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 leonard It wasn’t amazing. I got a C-minus four years in a row.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 sheldon Yeah, I’m familiar with your work. C-minus was your gift.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 raj Amy, I’m really sorry. I didn’t mean to upset you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 amy It’s fine. I’m used to being the girl who never gets looked at twice. I didn’t have my first kiss till I was 22, and the guy only did it so I’d give him back his insulin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 bernadette Sometimes the pancreas wants what the pancreas wants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 amy Forget it. I don’t expect you guys to understand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 raj I understand. In seventh grade, I played Spin the Bottle and it landed on Alina Shankar. She said if I came near her, she would break the bottle and cut me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 amy You think that’s bad? In college, I passed out at a frat party and woke up with more clothes on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 raj Sometimes I get so lonely, I sit on my left hand until it goes numb, then I put it in my right hand and pretend I’m holding hands with another person.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 amy I do that, too. Sometimes the left hand tries to cop a feel. And I let it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 raj It’s kind of nice to talk to someone who understands what it feels like to be alone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 amy It is, isn’t it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 raj But you’re not alone anymore. Now you’ve got Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 amy I do. And don’t worry, someday you’ll have somebody, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 raj Thank you. I hope she’s half as lovely and amazing as you are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 amy Thank you, Rajesh. He wants me, I’m good. We can go now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 raj Damn it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 raj Now that I know she doesn’t like me, I’m kind of into her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 sheldon All right. I think I cracked the code to lower the drawbridge.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 howard Great. Let’s do it. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 leonard The drawbridge is lowering.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 stuart My carpal tunnel’s acting up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 sheldon Play through the pain.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 leonard You did it. The drawbridge is down. You cross the chasm and find yourself in a small dungeon room. And in the corner, chained to the wall, you see a bloodied and beaten Santa Claus. He says, ho, ho, help me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 howard Yes, we found Santa. Christmas is saved. Don’t ever tell my mother I said that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 stuart I take out my skeleton key and run to Santa to unchain him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 sheldon But first, I cast a spell of paralysis on Stuart and Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 howard Wait, what are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 sheldon You can’t talk, you’re paralyzed. I get right up in Santa’s big, fat face and say, well, well, well, jolly old Saint Nick, we meet again. Yeah, I believe the last time we spoke was in the Baybrook Mall in Galveston, Texas, when I was five years old, isn’t that right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 leonard Uh, okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 sheldon My mother dragged me there and she plopped me down on your lap and you asked me what I wanted for Christmas. And I told you, my Pop-Pop, because that was the year my grandfather died. I missed him and I wanted him back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 leonard This is weird, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 sheldon Pop-Pop was the only one in my family who encouraged me to pursue science. But you didn’t bring him back, did you? No, instead, I got Lincoln Logs. Well, you can build a lot of neat things out of Lincoln Logs, but Pop-Pop ain’t one of ’em. And now you’re here asking me for something, to save you. Well, sorry, Mr. Kringle, but today’s not your day. I’m leaving you here to rot, and I hope the ogres feast on your bones. I take the skeleton key, and I toss it into the chasm, and on the way out, I give Santa a swift kick in his bowl full of jelly!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 leonard Okay. So Wolowitz and Stuart are paralyzed, Santa’s dead, and I picked this over having sex with my girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 sheldon Santa?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 santa Oh, hello, Sheldon. You should be asleep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 sheldon Well, then, you shouldn’t have jingle bells on your boots.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 santa Oh. I’ve been wanting to talk to you. I’m sorry I disappointed you when you were a little boy. I can do a lot of magical things, but unfortunately bringing your Pop-Pop back isn’t one of them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 sheldon I understand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 santa But I do have something special for you. Close your eyes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 sheldon Oh, I hope it’s a train.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 santa Oh, it’s better than a train.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 sheldon Two trains?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 santa Better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 sheldon I’m getting three trains.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 santa Okay, open ’em. This is for leaving me in the dungeon to be eaten alive by ogres!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 sheldon Wait, uh, uh, hang on. In my defense…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode11 santa Ho, ho, ho, ya big dork.
