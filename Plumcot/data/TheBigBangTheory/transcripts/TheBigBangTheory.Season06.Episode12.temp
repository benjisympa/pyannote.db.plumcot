TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 sheldon Well, I must say, Leonard, when I first heard your idea for Giant Jenga, I was sceptical.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard I can’t blame you. Tiny Twister was a complete bust.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 sheldon No, I was wrong. The looming threat of being crushed under a pile of lumber does add a certain spice. I’ve never felt so alive. Oh, hello, Alex. Uh, let me go get you last night’s recordings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard What recordings?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 sheldon Well, you remember when you told me I talk in my sleep? Well, it occurred to me that, like most things I say, it’s probably pure gold. So I started recording it all, and now Alex gets to comb through eight hours of what I like to call Sheldon After Dark.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 alex Hey, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard Hey. Just playing a little Giant Jenga here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 alex Oh, I know, I’m the one who had to buy him the helmet. So, do you have any plans this weekend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard Well, most of Saturday’s gonna be figuring out where to put this game when we’re done. How about you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 alex Oh, I’m gonna go see Kip Thorne give a lecture on subatomic space-time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard Ooh. That’s his take on John Wheeler’s quantum foam. That should be great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 alex Well, if you want, you can come with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard Ah, I’d love to, but I’m supposed to hang out with Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 alex Well, bring her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard Well, she’s not really into that kind of stuff.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 alex Yeah, okay. Well, if you want to hear about the lecture, I can tell you all about it at work, or, you know, over dinner sometime.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 sheldon Jenga, I win!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 howard Oh, come on, that can’t be true.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 raj I did the research. Tony the Tiger, Dig’em the Frog, Cap’n Crunch, Toucan Sam, Count Chocula, Trix the Rabbit, Snap, Crackle and Pop. Not one cereal mascot is a girl. It’s a total breakfast sausage fest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard Are we done with this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 raj Almost. Franken Berry, Boo Berry, Sugar Bear and the Honey Nut Cheerio bee, I believe his name is Buzz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard Terrific. Something weird happened and I don’t know what to do about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 howard What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard Sheldon’s assistant asked me on a date last night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 raj How could you do that to me? You know I’ve been working it with Alex for weeks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard Working it? You can’t even talk to her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 raj I talk with my eyes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 howard You look like my little cousin when he’s dropping one in his diaper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard She knows I have a girlfriend. It’s so weird.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 raj Oh, my God. You’re loving this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard To my bones. I mean, I’m not gonna do anything about it. I love Penny. It’s just nice to have a young, attractive woman sniffing around the goods.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 raj I both hate you and want to be you. This is Ryan Gosling all over again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 sheldon Ah, gentlemen, what is on the conversational menu this morning?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 raj Leonard stole my woman, and he knew full well I was only six to eight months away from making my move.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard I didn’t steal anyone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 raj Your assistant is totally hitting on this jerk and he loves it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 sheldon Well, that’s not acceptable. I mean, I’m her boss. She needs to be solely focused on my needs, not distracted by your pasty, androgynous brand of sexuality.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard I’m androgynous?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 sheldon Oh, please. Look at you with your pouty bee-stung lips.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard What do you guys think I should do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 raj I say you tell Alex your heart belongs to Penny, I provide her a shoulder to cry on, and then roughly half a year later I give it to her good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 sheldon I want to thank you all for coming on such short notice. Uh, in the past, I’ve reached out to each of you individually, but I believe my present situation requires the collective wisdom of the group, which as you can see from your commemorative T-shirts I have dubbed Sheldon Cooper’s Council of Ladies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 penny What is happening?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 sheldon I need your advice about a delicate workplace situation. Uh, to protect those involved, I’ll be changing their names.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 bernadette Who’s involved?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 sheldon Well, a short, bespectacled colleague of mine who lives in the shadow of his brilliant roommate. Let’s call this colleague Ricardo Shilly-Shally.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 penny You’re talking about Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 sheldon No, no, Shilly-Shally has red hair and, uh, he briefly served in the Mexican Navy. Anyway, despite the fact that he has a girlfriend, Shilly-Shally has been the recipient of inappropriate workplace flirtations from a young lady.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 amy It’s your assistant Alex, isn’t it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 sheldon No. No. No. This is Tondelaya della Ventimiglia.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 penny Wait, what the hell’s going on with Leonard and Alex?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 sheldon No, uh, no, I’m sorry. Who’s talking about Leonard and Alex?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 penny Fine. Ricardo and Tondelaya.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 sheldon Okay, look, it’s not really about Ricardo and Tondelaya. It is really about her boss, who doesn’t quite know how to handle this situation and could use your advice, which is surprising because Dr. Einstein Von Brainstorm, he’s usually pretty smart about these things.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 penny I’m gonna kill her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 bernadette I’m sure you’ve got nothing to worry about. Leonard would never cheat on you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 amy She’s right. But say the word, I got a lab full of cocaine-addicted monkeys with nothing to lose. One of them could end up in the backseat of her car. Or her shower.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 sheldon Ladies, ladies, please. We’re not here to talk about Penny, okay? We’re here to talk about me. Uh, I mean Einstein Von Brainstorm. Oh, darn it! All right, I guess the cat’s out of the bag. Let me explain what’s going on. Ricardo is really Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 penny We know what’s going on, Sheldon!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 sheldon Well, what should I do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 bernadette Well, Alex is your employee. If she’s doing something that’s making Leonard uncomfortable, you should talk to her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 sheldon Oh, no, he’s not uncomfortable at all. No, he’s loving it. Yeah, he’s strutting around like he’s five-foot-six.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 penny What? He’s loving it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 bernadette Sheldon, you need to talk to Alex right away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 sheldon Talk to her? That’s all you’ve got? With a cool name like Sheldon Cooper’s Council of Ladies, I really expected more. Give me back the T-shirts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 sheldon Alex, check my schedule. What does my afternoon look like?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 alex I think it’s pretty wide open. Oh, wait. Here’s something at four o’clock. Give Alex a talking to?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 sheldon Well, that snuck up on us, didn’t it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 alex Is there a problem?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 sheldon Let’s not call it a problem. Let’s call it an opportunity. To solve a serious problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 alex What did I do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 sheldon You don’t know? Oh, you poor dear. Your ovaries are squirting so much goofy juice into your brains you don’t even know which way is up. You made an inappropriate sexual advance towards Dr. Hofstadter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 alex What? I didn’t make a sexual advance on anybody.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 sheldon Now, there’s no need to get defensive. I’m not unsympathetic to your plight. My father used to say that a woman is like an egg salad sandwich on a warm Texas day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 alex What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 sheldon Full of eggs and only appealing for a short time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 alex This conversation is making me uncomfortable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 sheldon Yeah, you and me both, sister. Now, please understand, I don’t hold you responsible for your behaviour because, see, from an evolutionary standpoint, you’re a slave to your desire to reproduce. But during the work day, when you feel possessed by amorous intent, may I suggest that you suppress it by leafing through this illustrated book of sexually transmitted diseases? Let’s see here. Oh, yes. Check out this oozy doozy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 alex I have to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 sheldon So does this fellow, but he can’t without it burning like hot soup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard Hey, pretty lady.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 penny Oh, you seem extra happy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard Uh, I guess I am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 penny Any particular reason why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard I don’t know, just having a good day. This morning Sheldon fell asleep on the way to work, so I got to listen to the radio. That was pretty crazy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 penny Mm-hmm. Anything else?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard Mm. I found this quiz online called Which Star Trek Character Are You? and it only took me four tries to get Captain Kirk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 penny That’s great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard Oh. It. Was.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 penny Hmm. Well, I’m glad you’re having such a great day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard Yeah. And the one thing that could make it even better is an evening with my special girl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 penny Oh, and who’s that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard What do you mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 penny Oh, I just didn’t know if you meant me or Alex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard Um, why would I mean Alex?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 penny Because I know she hit on you and I know you liked it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 penny Don’t play dumb with me, Ricardo Shilly-Shally!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard I’m missing something. Did you say something to Penny about Alex?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 sheldon Oh, yes. Yeah, and a fat lot of good it did me. All she did was get mad at you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard Why would you do that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 sheldon I needed advice about a woman. I would have asked you, but if the last few years have proven anything, it’s that you can’t tell a uterus from a unicycle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard At least I know not to blab to a girl about somebody flirting with her boyfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 sheldon Good to know. Yeah, a few more helpful hints like that, you may find yourself on the Council of Ladies. Hello. I see. Uh, what time? Very well, then. Huh. That was the Human Resources Department at the university. Apparently, my assistant Alex has filed a complaint accusing me of inappropriate behaviour in the workplace.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard Oh, my God, what did you do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 sheldon Hmm, let me think. Nothing. I’m a delight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 sheldon Human Resources Department. Human Resources Department. Human Resources Department.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 hr_woman Come in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 sheldon Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 hr_woman Ah, Dr. Cooper, have a seat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 sheldon Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 hr_woman I called you in today because your assistant Alex Jensen has lodged a complaint against you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 sheldon So I’ve been told. But I can’t understand what she has to complain about. I mean, she has a front-row seat as I make scientific history. There’s string cheese in my mini-fridge, and that’s for anyone. Yeah, and just yesterday I led her away from a life of sexual promiscuity by making her look at pictures of disease-ridden genitalia.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 hr_woman Cancel my next appointment. This is gonna take a while. Dr. Cooper, you said things to your employee that you just cannot say in the workplace.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 sheldon Like what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 hr_woman Well, according to Ms. Jensen, you said that she was a slave to her biological urges and called her an egg salad sandwich. I don’t even know what that means, but I’m gonna go ahead and tell you you can’t say it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 sheldon Oh! I see the confusion here. No, no, Alex thought I was singling her out. No. I meant that all women are slaves to their biological urges, you know? Even you. You’re a slave.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 hr_woman I’m a what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 sheldon Well, y-you, I-I’m just saying, you know, at a certain point in a woman’s menstrual cycle…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 hr_woman Whuh-ah! Woah! You can’t talk about that, either, Dr. Cooper. Your language is entirely inappropriate, and I’m gonna advise that you shut your mouth right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 sheldon I don’t see why I’m the one being persecuted here. Dr. Hofstadter, he was bragging about his sexual desirability to anyone who would listen. You know, and Howard Wolowitz, he spent two years using university resources building a six-breasted sex robot. Oh, and at the office Christmas party, I heard Rajesh Koothrappali refer to you several times as Brown Sugar.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 hr_woman Hofstadter… Wolowitz… and the last one was Rajesh Koothrappali?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 sheldon Yes. No, yeah, but in his defense, that wasn’t racist. He’s also brown.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard I’m sorry Alex hit on me, hit on me, hit on me. I’m sorry Alex hit on me, I’d no idea I’m cute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 penny Oh, damn it, you are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard Please forgive me. I should have told you about Alex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 penny I don’t care about Alex. Fine, I care. Okay, I hate that bitch. But what really hurt is that you liked it so much. I mean, do I need to be worried?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard Of course not. No. Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 penny Because, she is pretty and smart, and when you talk about work, she doesn’t have to go home and look up words in the dictionary to understand what you said.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard You do that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard Hang on. Are you feeling insecure? Because that’s my thing, and if you take it away, I don’t know what I’m bringing to this relationship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 penny Yes, Leonard, I am insecure. Happy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard No, I’m not happy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 penny Why are you smiling?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard I’m sorry. I just never think of you having feelings like that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 penny Well, I do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard Why? Nothing is ever going to happen between me and Alex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 penny Good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard Come here. Tell you a secret?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 penny What’s that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard With all these women chasing me, I kind of do feel like Captain Kirk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 penny Can I tell you a secret?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 penny Keep talking about Captain Kirk, and we’re all gonna stop.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard Message received. Ah, excuse me. Hello. This is Dr. Hofstadter. Okay. All right, thank you. That’s weird. I’m getting called in to Human Resources.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 penny What did you do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard I don’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 howard Huh. I just got called in to Human Resources.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 bernadette Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 howard I don’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 raj Huh. That is so strange. Human Resources wants to talk to me tomorrow. Could you stop licking your ass for two minutes? I have a problem here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 howard Do you really think you should be drinking right now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 raj How else am I supposed to talk to the Human Resources lady?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 howard I don’t know. Seek professional help?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 raj I did. The guy at the liquor store said this stuff tastes great in coffee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 howard Wait, you got called in, too? What is going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard Sheldon threw us all under the bus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 howard Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 raj I feel like I’ve been called down to the principal’s office. Although I wouldn’t mind if Brown Sugar suspended me. From a sex swing. This may have been a mistake.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 howard Relax. Everything’s gonna be fine. Before I met Bernadette I was in here every other day. Uh, little tip, turn off your I Like Big Butts ringtone before you go in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 raj Well, this is all your fault.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard How is this my fault?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 raj If you weren’t screwing around with Sheldon’s assistant, none of this would be happening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard I wasn’t screwing around with anyone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 raj Oh, of course not. She was just sniffing around your goods because she was hunting for truffles.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 hr_woman Ah, Mr. Wolowitz, it’s been a while.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 howard Hey, Janine. How are Tom and the kids?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 janine Fine. You must be Dr. Hofstadter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard Yes, but I think this is all a big misunderstanding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 raj Yeah, yeah, me, too. I didn’t do anything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 janine Is that alcohol on your breath?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 raj Howard built a sex robot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 howard That is not true. All I did was build a robot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 janine Did it have six breasts?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 howard I’m sorry, I’m a feminist, I don’t notice things like how many breasts a robot has.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 sheldon Well, hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard What are you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 sheldon Actually, I came to speak to Mrs. Davis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 janine And I’m a little busy right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 sheldon But I came to file a complaint. Somebody has made me feel uncomfortable in the workplace by using language of an inappropriate and sexual nature.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 janine And who was that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 sheldon You, you dirty birdie. I-I thought about the things you said to me yesterday, and I realized I’m deeply offended. Now, be a dear and get me one of those complaint forms.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 janine That’s it. All of you, in my office now!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 sheldon And thanks to you, I know better than to ask if you’re menstruating. And based on your behaviour, I don’t have to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 sheldon It has been pointed out to me that some of the things I said to you could be construed as offensive, and I would like to offer you my sincerest apology.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 alex Thank you, Dr. Cooper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 sheldon Yeah, additionally, you should know that the university has mandated that I take an online sexual harassment seminar so this sort of thing doesn’t happen in the future.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 alex Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 sheldon Yeah. Now, unfortunately, uh, my time is much too valuable to waste on nonsense like this, so, um, I’m gonna need you to take it for me. Oh, and, uh, you’d better ace it, they’re pretty mad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 penny So, hey, I was thinking about that stuff with Alex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard Oh, would you stop worrying about that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 penny I can’t help it. But, look, I figured I could sit around and feel insecure, or I could do something about it. So I got a course catalogue at school and looked at some of the science classes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard That’s great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 penny No, it isn’t, they are extremely boring. I mean, how do you not kill yourself, like, every day? Anyway, I decided I don’t need to be a scientist, I could just look like one. So I bought these.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard Glasses? I really don’t think that’s gonna change… oh, my God, you look so smart and hot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 penny I know, right? Watch this. Molecules.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard Okay, come with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 penny Where are we going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode12 leonard To my bedroom, so I can take everything off but those glasses. And maybe the boots.
