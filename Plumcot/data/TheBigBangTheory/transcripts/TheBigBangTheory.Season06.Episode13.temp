TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 leonard Hey, will you steam my uniform next?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 sheldon Interesting. Do you recall this conversation? Leonard, want to go halfsies on a steamer? No, Sheldon, we don’t need a steamer. Looks like that rumpled chicken’s come home to roost.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 penny Hi. Here are the make-up sponges you asked for.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 leonard Oh, thanks, I thought I had more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 penny Damn, you’ve got more makeup than I do. You’ve got better makeup than I do. Yeah, I’m borrowing this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 leonard Hey, hey, hey, hey. This is my Comic-Con makeup. I love you, but there are some things a man doesn’t share with his girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 sheldon That’s a wise policy. I once borrowed my sister’s makeup for a costume contest. Got a terrible case of pinkeye. But luckily, I was going as a zombie. I won second place.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 penny I feel like you guys just went to Comic-Con.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 leonard That was San Diego Comic-Con. This is Bakersfield Comic-Con.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 penny Is that better?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 leonard Well, it’s a lot smaller. It’s more about the comic books. The way these conventions used to be before they went all Hollywood.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 sheldon So to answer your question, no, it’s not better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 penny Well, then why are you going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 sheldon It’s a comic book convention. You know, it’s like pizza or particle accelerators, even the stinky one’s still pretty good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 penny All right. Well, you guys have fun. I guess I’ll see you Sunday night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 leonard Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 penny Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 leonard Oh, hang on a second. Hold this. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 penny What was that for?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 leonard To show people when they don’t believe me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 penny Oh, this is the best. You have booze with breakfast on a Tuesday, you got a problem. You do it on the weekend, you got brunch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 amy Sheldon doesn’t believe in brunch. He can’t stand being at a table where one person’s having an omelette and another person’s having a sandwich.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 bernadette He’s not exhausting at all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 penny Oh. It’s Leonard. He says they’re on the road and headed for Bakersfield at warp speed. Maybe it’s the mimosa, but I’m gonna give the kid an LOL.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 bernadette It’s cute how excited they are. You should have seen Howard sewing his costume all week for the convention.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 amy When did Howard learn to sew?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 bernadette When he was a little boy, every couple months, he would have to let his mom’s pants out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 amy I don’t even understand why they go to these conventions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 penny I know. The four of them work at a major university. They’re all super smart. How can they still be into something made for 12-year-olds?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 bernadette I don’t mind it. I think Howie’s just in touch with his inner child. Although when he comes to bed in his Batman pyjamas, sometimes it feels like I’m touching his inner child.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 amy It’s probably because they were bullied growing up. In a world where you can’t fight back, superheroes provide meaningful wish-fulfillment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 penny Mmmm. Now I feel bad for picking on all those kids. Although, in my defence, if Danny Biffle didn’t want to eat a mouthful of dirt, he shouldn’t have shown up to school wearing a bow tie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 bernadette I’ve never even read a comic book. You guys?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 penny Uh-uh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 amy No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 bernadette I mean, it’s such an important part of their lives. Maybe we should try reading some.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 amy Seriously?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 bernadette The comic book store isn’t far from here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 penny That is an amazing idea. Okay, how many of these have I had?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 sheldon I think you should turn on the GPS.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 leonard It is on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 sheldon But the turn-by-turn voice option isn’t on. I know I’d feel more safe if you turn on the turn-by-turn voice option. I love the turn-by-turn voice option.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 howard Has it really only been ten miles?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 leonard I’m turning it on, but just to shut you up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 gps Leonard, bear left and continue on Interstate 210.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 sheldon Ooh, sounds like that fellow knows what he’s talking about. I’d put on my listening ears if I were you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 leonard What did you do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 sheldon I found a hack online. I was able to upload MP3 recordings of my voice to your GPS.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 raj That is so cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 leonard Counterpoint, no, it’s not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 gps Continue on Interstate 210 for five miles. Here’s an interesting fact about interstates.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 leonard Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 sheldon Shh, he said it’s interesting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 gps Interstates are numbered as follows. Even-numbered routes run east and west, odd-numbered routes run north and south. Three-digit route numbers indicate bypasses or spurs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 howard Look, Leonard, there’s a bridge. Drive off it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 raj You know, we’re not that far from Vazquez Rocks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 sheldon Oh, they shot a lot of Star Trek episodes out there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 howard We’ve got our costumes in the trunk. We could go there and have a little photo shoot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 raj Great idea. I haven’t had a carbohydrate in two weeks. These cheekbones need to be in front of a camera before I eat a pretzel and they’re gone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 leonard Yeah, that sounds fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 sheldon Oh, smashing. Now, Leonard, do you know how to get there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 leonard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 sheldon Yeah, well luckily, someone in the car does.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 gps Recalculating. While we’re waiting, do you know which president signed the Intestate Highway System Act into law? The answer, coming up in 14 miles.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 sheldon None of you will get it. It’s Eisenhower.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 bernadette Why are they staring?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 amy Who cares? Just soak it in. Hello, boys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 stuart Oh, hey. Could you please stop staring? They’re just girls. It’s nothing you haven’t seen in movies or in drawings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 penny Hey, Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 stuart What brings you guys here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 bernadette We were looking for a recommendation about comic books.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 stuart Oh, well, I recommend you don’t open a store and sell them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 penny No, we were just wondering why the guys like this stuff so much, so we thought we’d give it a try.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 stuart Oh, okay. What do you think you might be into? Superhero, fantasy, graphic novels, manga… I swear I will turn a hose on you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 bernadette What kind of comics do the guys like?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 stuart Um, a little bit of everything. Mostly superhero stuff.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 amy All right, well, who’s the best superhero?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 stuart Shh! You can’t ask a question like that in here. Are you trying to start a rumble?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 penny Well then, what do you recommend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 stuart Well, uh, let’s see. You’ve got your basic clean-cut good guys, Superman, Spider-Man, Captain America. Then you have your darker anti-heroes, your Batman, your Wolverine, Punisher.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 amy Ooh, I do love a bad boy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 penny As evidenced by your boyfriend and his fear of hamsters.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 stuart If I were you, I’d go for Fables number one. The artwork is sophisticated, it’s intelligently written, and it doesn’t objectify or stereotype women.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 penny Ooh, Thor! He’s hot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 stuart Yeah, he kind of is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 raj And we’re blending, and we’re blending, and we’re done.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 sheldon I know Mr. Data isn’t supposed to smile, but here it comes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 howard Come on, guys. Let’s do this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 leonard Yeah, I’m sweating my bald cap off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 howard So what’s our first pose going to be?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 raj I say we begin with a classic Star Trek fight scene.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 leonard I’ll set the timer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 howard Sheldon, how is that a fight pose?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 sheldon Mr. Data’s weapon is his mind. I’m wielding it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 raj Phasers on the Borg! Charlie’s Angels.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 howard Okay, what’s next?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 raj Now let’s do some sexy glamour shots. I’ll set the mood. Oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, Yeah, nice one, oontz, oontz. That’s right. Oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 howard Oh, my God. Leonard, someone’s stealing your car!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 leonard What? Hey, hey! Come back here!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 raj Stop!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 sheldon Stealing is against the law!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 leonard I don’t believe this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 howard Son of a bitch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 raj I’ll call 911. What, oh, no, my phone is in my other pants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 howard Oh, so is mine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 leonard Mine, too. Anybody got any ideas?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 sheldon Nope. The only thing left to do now is assign blame. Nice going.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 leonard What kind of a person steals another person’s car in broad daylight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 sheldon What kind of person leaves his keys in the car?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 leonard I thought we agreed this was all Koothrappali’s fault.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 sheldon You’re right. Nice going.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 howard Car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 raj What is wrong with people? Why don’t they stop?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 sheldon Maybe we’re better off. What if we were to get in a car with a crazy person?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 leonard Look at us, Sheldon. We’re the crazy people.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 sheldon Well, perhaps we should hold up a sign that assures passing motorists of our mental competence.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 howard Good idea. Why don’t you get started on that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 leonard Come on, let’s just start walking. There’s got to be a gas station or something nearby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 sheldon What, you think just because you’re wearing a captain’s uniform, you’re in charge?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 leonard Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 sheldon All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 penny Hmm, okay, I’m done. How did you guys finish so fast?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 bernadette I don’t know, there were a lot of pictures, and one page only had the word brakkadoom!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 penny Yeah, well, I have street smarts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 bernadette So, what’d you guys think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 amy Well, there was a lot of action.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 penny Mmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 amy And the story moved along at a brisk pace. It was, overall, what’s the word I’m looking for?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 penny Stupid?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 amy So stupid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 penny I don’t know how Leonard can get so caught up in this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 bernadette It’s crazy, they spend hours arguing about things that don’t even exist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 amy What a waste of time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 penny I know. A hammer so heavy that no one else can pick it up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 bernadette I don’t think it’s heavy. It’s some sort of magic, so only Thor can lift it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 penny That makes even less sense, I mean…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 amy No, no, no, it doesn’t. Thor is a god. The hammer is his, only he can use it. It’s like Sheldon and his toothbrush. Or his thin, beckoning lips.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 penny Okay, hang on, what if Thor’s hand is on the hammer? I mean, if he’s touching it with his god magic, does that mean I could lift it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 bernadette No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 amy Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 penny Well, which is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 amy Maybe we missed something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 bernadette Let’s read it again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 penny Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 amy Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 bernadette You want some tea?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 amy Good idea. I’ll help you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 penny Wait, I thought we were reading.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 amy We are. We’re just, uh, giving you a head start.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 howard I wish my mom was here. We could all hang out in her shadow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 raj Wool pants in the desert. I feel like I’ve got poached testicles.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 leonard Oh, you poor thing, you’re sweating. That’s so much worse than having your car stolen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 raj Insurance is gonna buy you a new car. It’s not gonna de-funk my junk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 sheldon Gentlemen, a little less bellyaching. We’re Starfleet officers and a member of the Borg Collective.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 leonard Please, Sheldon, I am so not in the mood.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 sheldon Leonard, all our lives we have dreamed of finding ourselves inside one of the fantasy worlds we love. And look at us. At this moment, we are, in fact, a Star Trek landing party stranded in an alien and unforgiving environment, relying only on our wits, our fortitude and our moxie. As long as we have those things, nothing can stop…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 guys_in_passing_car Nerds!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 sheldon I hate this planet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 amy It says right here on the hammer, whoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 bernadette Hold on, who decides who’s worthy? Does the hammer decide?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 penny Yes!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 amy No! It can’t decide. It’s a hammer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 penny You said it’s a magic hammer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 amy Yeah, but, it can’t make decisions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 penny If Harry Potter’s wand can make decisions, why can’t Thor’s hammer?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 amy Okay, if you’re going to start comparing wands and hammers, I can’t even take you seriously.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 sheldon Hello. Hello. Uh, uh, uh, four glasses of water, please. Anything for you guys?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 leonard Can I use your phone? Our car got stolen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 waitress Why don’t you ask Scotty to beam you up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 sheldon Scotty was on the original series, and we’re Next Generation. So, joke’s on you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 howard We’re not with him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 amy You can’t pick something up in outer space. In space, there is no up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 penny Oh, yeah? Then how does the sun come up every day?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 amy Hard to argue with those kind of street smarts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 bernadette Leonard and Sheldon have boxes of comics across the hall. Why don’t we go look at those?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 penny Oh, great. Yes. And then you will see, I am not wrong, because if we were in outer space, then anyone could pick up the hammer because it would be floating around in a weightless environment. Yeah, that’s right, the slow reader used science. Suck on that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 policeman Was there anything valuable in the car?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 leonard Our clothes, our wallets, phones.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 raj And about three hundred dollars worth of makeup, so this thief could look like anyone right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 policeman Makeup? Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 leonard Uh, we’re going to the Comic-Con in Bakersfield. They have a big costume contest. It’s cooler than it sounds.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 policeman I don’t know, sounds pretty cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 raj It, it is. It’s not just comic books. They’ve got action figures, toys, a Tron-themed dance party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 leonard Okay, he gets how cool it is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 policeman I think I have all I need here. You guys need me to call someone? I’m guessing your moms?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 leonard Thanks, but we’ve got it covered.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 howard Okay, I just talked to my mom. She arranged for us to get a rental car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 raj Great. We can still make it to Comic-Con.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 leonard Are you kidding me? After all we’ve been through, I just want to go home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 raj Don’t be like that. Come on, Howard, talk to him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 howard I’m with Leonard. I’m done.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 raj Fine, then I guess it’s two against two. How do we decide?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 sheldon Actually, it’s three against one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 raj What? What about the mission? You said we were a real-life landing party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 sheldon Yeah, well, we’re not. We’re an imaginary landing party who had real-life garbage thrown at us by real-life strangers who think we’re idiots. And to tell you the truth, I’m starting to feel like one. I want to go home now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 raj Okay. Did we at least rent the car from Enterprise? Get it? Enterprise? Screw you. That’s funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 bernadette Well, what if the Hulk picked up Thor while Thor is holding the hammer?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 amy Yeah?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 bernadette Then by the transitive property of picking things up, Hulk picked up the hammer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 amy No. Hulk picked up Thor, Thor picked up the hammer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 penny Okay, hang on. If I go to a bar and pick up a guy, and he picks up a girl, and then we all leave together, did I pick up the girl?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 amy Did that ever happen?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 penny Hey, are we talking about me or are we talking about Thor?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 sheldon Well, I say that’s the last time we ever go outside.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 amy Look, right here. Red Hulk is picking up Thor’s hammer ’cause Thor’s touching it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 penny No, it’s because they’re in space. He’s really just touching the strap.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 amy The strap is part of the hammer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 bernadette No, it’s not!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 raj Are they actually arguing about comic books?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 leonard No, that can’t be right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 howard Maybe Thor’s Hammer is a new colour of nail polish.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 bernadette Then Red Hulk must be worthy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 penny How could Red Hulk be worthy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 bernadette You don’t know his life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 sheldon There’s only one logical explanation. Somewhere in the desert we crossed into an alternate dimension where the women in our lives can finally appreciate great literature.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 raj If it’s an alternate dimension, sounds like a job for a landing party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 sheldon Captain, what are your orders?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 leonard I say we investigate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 sheldon Wait. They might be hostile.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 leonard Fine, but set them to stun. If we vaporize Penny, I’ll never find a girlfriend that pretty again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 gps Fun fact, President Eisenhower signed the Federal Aid Highway Act from his hospital room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 first_car_thief Wow, that is interesting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 second_car_thief You learn something new every day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 gps Say, can you name the four state capitols that are not served by the interstate system?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 first_car_thief Ooh, another quiz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode13 second_car_thief Yes!
