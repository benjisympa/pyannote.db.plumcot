TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 leonard Sheldon, your food’s getting cold.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon I’ll eat later. Right now, I’m suckling at the informative bosom of mother physics.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 penny It’s hot when Sheldon talks dirty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 raj So, I found this Web site where you send them pictures, they sculpt your head and make an action figure out of you. How awesome is that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 howard Let me see.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 raj Yeah, you can pick your wardrobe. You can even choose your accessories.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 howard Leonard, you can get a little asthma inhaler.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 leonard Oh, this is neat. Think about all the action figures we’ve bought over the years. It would be kind of cool to have ones that look like us. Don’t you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 penny Yeah, if that’s your idea of what’s cool, you should get one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 leonard Yeah, so, I’m out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 raj What do you think, Sheldon? Want an action figure that looks just like you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon Would it come with Kung-Fu grip?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 raj No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon Don’t waste my time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 leonard You get that these are personalised action figures.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 penny Honey, if you want one, just get one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 howard You’re still out, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 leonard Yep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon A hush falls over the crowd as Cooper studies the board. He makes his move. He’s dividing both sides by I. He’s adding back the coefficient. He has a value for P. He’s plugging that back in. He takes the derivative, and he solves the equation. The crowd goes wild. Nobel! Nobel!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 kripke Cooper?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon Nobel. Kripke. Don’t look at my board.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 kripke What’s that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon That’s a drawing of a really cool train. Don’t look at that, either. What do you want?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 kripke I have some bad news. You’re working on a gwant pwoposal fow a new fusion weactow. I’m working on a gwant pwoposal fow a new fusion weactow. The university is only awowed to submit one pwoposal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon So they asked you to pack up your things and ship out. That’s hard cheese, Barry. You’re one of the good ones.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 kripke No, they’re making us work together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon That’s ridiculous. I am one of the great minds of our generation. I work on a level so rarified you couldn’t even imagine it. I said stop looking at my cool train!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 leonard Hmm. Kind of a strange place to put a picture of you and Bernadette.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 howard Well, I wanted everybody to know I love my wife. And nobody to know I forgot to turn off the laser.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 raj They’re here. Our action figures have arrived. This is the best five hundred dollars I’ve ever spent.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 leonard A thousand dollars on action figures? How can you afford that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 howard Easy. His family’s loaded, and Bernadette has a great job. My wife came with both fun bags and money bags.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 raj Say hello to an exact scale model of me. Oh, I’m not dark chocolate. I’m melt-in-your-mouth caramel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 howard Oh, man. Look at my nose.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 leonard Maybe it’s a shipping problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 howard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 leonard Yeah. Maybe Wesley Snipes and Toucan Sam just got action figures that look like you guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 raj This sucks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 howard I can’t believe I wasted all that money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 leonard Aw, and my girlfriend wouldn’t let me get one. Look at my face. Do I look smug? I feel smug.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 penny I hate it when you make me sit through all the credits.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 leonard Well, sometimes there’s a secret ending, like in The Avengers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 penny Yeah, but I don’t think that’s going to happen in a documentary about the Holocaust.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 leonard They could show bloopers. Oh, no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 penny What is that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 leonard That is Sheldon’s “I’m unhappy and about to destroy the planet” music. Come on, let’s just go to your place.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 penny Well, wait, if he’s unhappy,shouldn’t we talk to him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 leonard Shouldn’t we talk to him? Have you learned nothing in six years?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 penny You doing okay, sweetie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon There is ominous music playing, and there is an afghan over my head. I don’t know where you’re from, but where I’m from, that means I’m not doing okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 leonard Want me to make you some tea?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon Tea is for when I’m upset. I’m not upset. The university’s forcing me to work with Kripke. I’m outraged.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 leonard So, cocoa?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon Yes, cocoa. Do you have any idea what it’s like to be paired with someone who’s so incredibly annoying?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 leonard Oh, teacher! Me! Me!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon See, I did all this great work, and now he’s just going to come along and ruin it. I am angrier than ever and filled with despair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 penny What beverage do you make for that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 leonard Oh, no, no, no, I know this. Uh, hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon Yes, hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 kripke What the fwig, Cooper? We were supposed to meet in my office a half an hour ago.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon And yet, now you’re in my office. Point, Cooper. Welcome to the Thunderdome, Kripke.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 kripke We agweed to exchange copies of our work. Let me see yours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon Why don’t you show me yours first.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 kripke You think I just few off the turnip twuck? We exchange at the same time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon How do I know you’re not going to take my ideas and publish them as your own?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 kripke How do I know you’re not going to do that with mine?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon Because I’m not interested in getting published in Mad magazine. Zingers fly fast in the Thunderdome, Barry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 kripke Are we going to do this or not? Thank you. So, we wead each other’s work, meet again tomowow?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon Fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 kripke Nice twy. This is bwank paper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon And I am sure it’s still more valuable than whatever’s in here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 kripke Cough it up, Cooper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon Very well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 kripke If this one’s bwank, too, I’m going to be fuwious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon Fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 raj You! Always bet on black.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 howard Get that waste of money out of my face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 raj It’s only a waste of money if we don’t play with them. He’s right, dawg.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 howard Please, I’m working.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 raj You know, there is a way we can get action figures to look exactly like us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 howard Oh, yeah? How’s that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 raj Two words, 3-D printer. Wait, maybe it’s three words. No, hang on. Okay, one word, a letter and a number and maybe a hyphen. 3-D printer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 howard I have always wanted a 3-D printer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 raj Of course you have. They’re an engineer’s dream. Anything you can design, a 3-D printer can make out of plastic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 howard Yeah, but they’re so expensive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 raj Oh, come on. You deserve one. You’ve worked hard to find a woman who makes a lot of money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 howard Well, the prices have been coming down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 raj Oh, true. They’re practically giving them away. You know, in exchange for money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 howard And we can make stuff we need for work with it. Prototypes of my CAD/CAM designs, specialized tools…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 raj Not to mention Malibu Koothrappali and his totally bitchin’ dream house.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 howard We don’t need Malibu Koothrappali’s dream house.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 raj Really, smart guy? Where’s he supposed to park his sweet little Corvette?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon I’m fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 amy All right, well, how was work today? Did you exchange your research with Kripke?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 amy Sheldon, what’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon I read his research, and, it’s leaps and bounds ahead of mine. Which means the mommy of the smartest physicist at the university is not my mommy as I had thought. It’s his mommy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 amy Sheldon, I wish there was something I could do to make you feel better. May I offer you a consoling hug?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon What do we have to lose?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 amy How’s that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon I feel like I’m being strangled by a boa constrictor. Why’d you stop?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 leonard Come on, Sheldon, we’re going to be late.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon I can’t go in today. I’m sick.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 leonard You’re not sick. You just don’t want to face Kripke.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon No, look.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 leonard 128.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon See?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 leonard What did you do, put this in your tea?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon Oh, dear. Now I’m not even smarter than you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 leonard Sheldon, Kripke’s not smarter than you. You just got stuck on a wrong path. Happened to Einstein. He got stuck on the unified field theory for decades.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon Oh, don’t play the Einstein card. His great breakthroughs happened when no one knew anything. So everything was a great breakthrough.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 leonard Sheldon Lee Cooper, I do not have time for this nonsense. Now, go put your clothes on, get in the car, and lets go to work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon All right, geez. What a grouch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 leonard How did I do that? I got to remember how I did that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 howard Do you realize, by owning a 3-D printer, we are reclaiming the manufacturing process and taking jobs back from sweatshops in China?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 raj I think this thing was made in China.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 howard Eh, what can you do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 raj Ooh, I, I think it’s done. Oh, it worked. We printed a whistle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 howard Amazing. You realize these things go for 25 cents a pop at a party store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 raj And we made it in only three hours. Sounds just like store-bought.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 howard Okay, give me a superhero pose, and I will scan you into the computer for your action figure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 raj Oh, I wish I was in better shape.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 howard Stop holding your stomach in. I’ll give you a six-pack with the computer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 raj Oh, okay, great. Now I can look like Val Kilmer as Batman instead of Val Kilmer as he looks today.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 howard All right, you can suck it in a little bit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 kripke Cooper, we have a pwobwem. Your work is weawy not at a wevew I expected it to be.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon I know. Go ahead, mock me. Just use small words so I understand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 kripke Don’t pway dumb with me. We both know what your pwobwem is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon We do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 kripke You have a girlfwiend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon So?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 kripke So my work would suffew, too, if I was getting waid all the time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon Yes. That is the reason. My work is suffering because of all the laid I’m getting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 kripke You wucky bastard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon What can I say, you know? She enjoys my genitals. I am giving them to her on a nightly basis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 kripke Okay, stop bwagging. You had some bwiwiant insights in here, but if we’re gonna make this work, you need to buckew down and focus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon I’ll do what I can. But it’s not going to be easy, because when I’m with Amy and our bathing suit areas mush together, boy howdy, is it magic
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 howard Oh, good, you’re home. Got a little surprise for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 bernadette What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 howard Say hello to my little friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 bernadette Oh, my God. That’s so cute. I didn’t think there could be a smaller version of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 howard I know, right? And, thanks to photographs and a little 3-D modeling, here comes the bride.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 bernadette Oh, Howie, I love these.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 howard I thought you might.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 bernadette Were they expensive?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 howard Didn’t cost a thing. I made them myself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 bernadette How?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 howard Koothrappali and I bought a used 3-D printer for $5,000.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 bernadette $5,000 for a couple of dolls? Are you out of your mind?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 howard Not just for a couple of dolls. For as many dolls as we want. And whistles.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 bernadette At any point, did it dawn on you to talk to me about spending this kind of money?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 howard It’s kind of dawning on me now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 bernadette I don’t believe you. Howie, we can’t afford to waste money on junk like this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 howard What are you talking about? We make plenty of money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 bernadette I make plenty of money. You make peanuts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 howard Yes, but we’re married now. That means, when you get sick, I take care of you. And when you make a bunch of money, I get to buy stuff. Sorry if you don’t like it, but that’s how love works.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 bernadette No, here’s how love works. You’re gonna return the machine, or you can print out a working set of lady parts and sleep with those. Oh, my God! Are you actually thinking about it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 penny All right, I don’t understand. Why didn’t you just tell Kripke the truth?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon Because the truth made me look bad, whereas a ridiculous bald-faced lie makes me look good. Anyway, if Kripke asks, tell him my coitus with Amy is frequent, intense and whimsically inventive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 leonard Is my coitus whimsically inventive?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 penny That is what I write on the bathroom walls. For a whimsically inventive time, call Leonard Hofstadter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 leonard I know you’re joking, but I’d be okay with that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 penny Yeah. Sheldon, can I ask you a question?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon Of course.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 penny You ever going to sleep with Amy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon That’s awfully personal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 leonard We don’t ask Sheldon things like that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 penny Maybe you don’t, I do. What’s the deal?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon Well, word around the university is I’m giving her sex organs a proper jostling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 penny All right, come on, be serious. Look, you guys have been going out a long time. She would clearly like to have a physical relationship with you, so what are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 leonard All right, we’re down the rabbit hole. What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon Well, first of all, I’m quite fond of Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 penny Then what’s the problem?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon Penny, all my life, I have been uncomfortable with the sort of physical contact that comes easily to others, hand-shaking, hugging, prostate exams. But I’m working on it, you know? Just recently, I had to put VapoRub on Amy’s chest. A year ago, that would have been unthinkable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 leonard Now you know how I feel when I have to put it on you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 penny Okay. Hang on. Are you saying someday you and Amy might actually get physical?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon It’s a possibility.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 penny Oh, my God! Sheldon, I know this wasn’t easy for you, and I’m really glad we could have this conversation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon Fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 penny Oh, my God!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 leonard Ow!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 raj Are you sure you want to do this? Give up your half of the 3-D printer?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 howard Yes. And can you please make that out to Bernadette? I was taken off the joint account until I learn the value of money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 raj Wow, that’s harsh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 howard Tell me about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 raj Aren’t you gonna eat lunch?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 howard Nah, I blew my food allowance on Pokemon cards.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon Well, the equation balances, but it’s certainly not elegant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 kripke Whatever. You get any wast night?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 kripke Gave it to her good, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon No, I gave it to her well. Now, over here, I was thinking the turbulence could be reduced if we just put…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 kripke Yeah, yeah, yeah. Was she naked, or was she weawing wingewie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon I didn’t notice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 kripke How could you not notice?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon I was too busy squishing all the desirable parts of her body.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 kripke Ah, you’re kiwing me, Cooper!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon Can we get back to work?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 kripke Sure, sure, sure. You guys ever use any toys?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 sheldon Toys? I do have a model rocket next to my bed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode14 kripke A wocket? You’we a fweak! I wove it!
