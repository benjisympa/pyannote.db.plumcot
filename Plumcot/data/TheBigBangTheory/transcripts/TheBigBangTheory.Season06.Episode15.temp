TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 leonard I don’t know why I avoided the Harry Potter books for so long. These are great. I just started number six.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon That’s a good one. Dumbledore dies in that one. Yeah, I know, I didn’t see it coming, either.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 leonard Why would you say that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon You brought up the subject. I contributed an interesting fact on that subject. It’s called the art of conversation. Okay, your turn.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 leonard That was a huge spoiler.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon Good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 leonard What is wrong with you? If I did that, you’d bitch about it for weeks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon Oh, really, Leonard? Are you going to have another one of your hissy fits?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 leonard Hissy fits? I have hissy fits?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon Yes, and I have a theory why. Because of your lactose intolerance, you switched over to soy milk. Soy contains estrogen-mimicking compounds. I think your morning Cocoa Puffs are turning you into a hysterical woman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 leonard You are unbelievable. I don’t know why I put up with you. You’re controlling, you’re irritating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon There you go again, nag, nag, nag. You’re only proving my point, little lady.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 leonard You know what? Screw you, Sheldon. You are the most annoying person I have ever met.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon What? I’m annoying? You criticize my behaviour all the time. Sheldon, don’t talk about your bowel movements over breakfast. Sheldon, when the president of the university is giving a eulogy at a funeral, don’t yawn and point at your watch. Sheldon, don’t throw away my shirts ’cause you think they’re ugly. You’re impossible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 leonard That’s it. I don’t, I don’t have to put up with this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon Actually, I have your signature on a roommate agreement that says you do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 leonard Aw. Here’s what I think of your roommate agreement.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon You pick that up right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 leonard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon Roommate agreement, section 27, paragraph 5, the roommate agreement, like the American flag, cannot touch the ground.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 leonard I don’t care. I don’t have to do anything you say because I don’t think I want to live here anymore.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon Where are you going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 leonard To live with Penny and not you, you crazy bastard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon Crazy bastard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 leonard Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon Leonard, wait.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon Dobby the elf dies in book seven.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 raj Here you go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 howard Great. Come on in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 raj What, you don’t say thank you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 howard It’s my suitcase. I lent it to you two years ago.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 raj Well, then, I should tell you I broke the wheel and the handle. So, is everyone from Bernadette’s company going to Vegas?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 howard No, just me, her and a couple of the big wigs. It’s part of a bonus she got.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 raj Cool. Did she discover a cure for something?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 howard Not exactly. They spent a ton of money developing this dandruff medication that had the side effect of horrible anal leakage.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 raj Is there a good anal leakage?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 howard Anyway, it was Bernie’s idea to rebrand the stuff as a cure for constipation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 raj Way to make lemonade. You know, from around the corner where fudge is made.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 howard Hey, I got a favour to ask.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 raj Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 howard My mom’s been kind of an emotional wreck since that dentist she was dating dumped her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 raj Dumped her? What, did he use a forklift? Sorry. There’s nothing funny about morbid obesity.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 howard She’s huge. It was funny. Anyway, I was just hoping that maybe you could check in on her tomorrow night and make sure she’s doing okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 raj Dude, I’m a single man. Saturday night is my party night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 howard Really? What do you got going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 raj I don’t know, maybe drive down to Hollywood, hit a few hot spots, see if I can get lucky.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 howard Yeah, tell me if this sounds familiar. You pay fifteen dollars to park, you stand on the pavement for an hour until you break down and give the bouncer twenty bucks to let you in. You push your way to the bar, where you drink an eighteen dollar cosmopolitan, then you stare at a pretty girl and imagine your perfect life together. Your children, grandchildren. Meanwhile, she leaves with a guy who claims he wrote Beverly Hills Chihuahua. Then you give up on anyone ever loving you, go to Marie Callender’s, buy a pie and eat it in your car in the parking lot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 howard I told her around seven.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 leonard I swear, that man is the most egotistical, insufferable human being I have ever met.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 penny Yeah, but you two make such a cute couple. Like Burt and Ernie. You guys even teach me stuff about words and numbers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 leonard Well, I’ve had it. I am done. I can’t, I can’t live with him for one more minute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 penny Wow. Where are you going to go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 leonard I was thinking here with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 penny Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 leonard That a problem?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 penny No, not at all. No, it’s, it’s great. It’s terrific. I, you know, I just can’t help feel bad about Sheldon. I mean, how’s he going to get by without you? Ernie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 leonard He’s got Amy now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 penny Yeah, he does, but it’s not the same.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 leonard Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 penny Um, well, um, all right. You, you know how in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Ron didn’t abandon Harry just because Harry started dating Ron’s sister?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 leonard Harry and Ginny get together?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 penny Sorry. Spoiler alert. My point is, as much as I want to live with you, I can’t do it knowing how much Sheldon needs you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 leonard Please, the only thing he needs me for is to be his whipping boy, his, his stooge, his doormat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 penny Well, you know what they say, if it ain’t broke.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 leonard Wow. It sounds to me like you don’t want us to live together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 penny No. No, no, I do. I do. It’s just, I mean, it’s a really big step.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 leonard Is it? We’re together all the time. Financially, it makes great sense. Can you think of one reason why we shouldn’t do this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 penny Well, um, I’m just a little thirsty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 leonard Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 penny I got nothing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 leonard Great. I’ll go get my stuff.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 penny Yeah. Okay, all right, don’t freak out. You can make this work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 leonard Oh, could you clear off a shelf for me in the bathroom? I take a lot of medicine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 penny Oh, please let some of it be Xanax.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 mrs_wolowitz Are you ready for dessert?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 raj No, thank you, Mrs. Wolowitz. As it is, I’m going to have to carry my stomach out of here like I’m a fireman rescuing an infant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 mrs_wolowitz Oh, please. You’re a tall glass of brown water. Have dessert.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 raj Well, I, I really couldn’t. But, uh, I’ve had a lovely time eating your brisket and hearing about the things you’ve had removed from your body over the years. Didn’t know you could have a cyst inside another cyst.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 mrs_wolowitz The doctor said they were like Russian nesting dolls. Well, if you have to go, how about I put a little doggie bag together for you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 raj That would be lovely. Thank you. Mrs. Wolowitz, uh, are you okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 mrs_wolowitz Don’t mind me. I just cry when I’m lonely and have nothing to live for.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 raj I, uh, I suppose I could stay for some dessert.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 mrs_wolowitz Great. You like chocolate chip cheesecake?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 raj Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 mrs_wolowitz I’ll make one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon One vintage Mr. Mxyzptlk action figure. That’s Leonard’s.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 amy Children’s toy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 amy Children’s toy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon One Game of Thrones collector’s edition Longclaw sword. Oh, Leonard and I bought that together. That’s a bit of an ethical conundrum. Eh, I’ll keep it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 amy So, uh, what’s your plan moving forward?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon Uh, suppose I’ll have to find and cultivate a new roommate. What a task that will be. Do you know how uncivilized Leonard was when I took him in?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 amy No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon Oh, it took me forever to get him on a bathroom schedule. He would just go whenever the mood struck him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 amy Like a dog-boy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon Exactly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 amy What if you could find a roommate who was a scientist and already familiar and comfortable with your ways?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon That would be ideal. If a person like that existed, I would sign on, no further questions asked.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 amy Great. Here I am!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon Wait. Here who is where?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 amy Me. Aren’t I your perfect roommate?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon Um…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 amy Think about it, Sheldon. I’m not a stranger, we’re intellectually compatible, I’m willing to chauffeur you around town, and your personality quirks, which others find abhorrent or rage-inducing, I find cute as a button. What do you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon Um…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 amy Tell me one reason why this isn’t a fantastic idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon Um…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 amy See? You can’t. I’m gonna go see if Leonard’s room is big enough for my water bed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon Um…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon Good buddy Leonard. Good buddy Leonard. Good buddy Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 leonard What do you want?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon Hey, good buddy. So, uh, I was just talking to Amy, and she made me realize that this little dust-up between you and me is much ado about nothing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 leonard Is that so?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon Yes. All is forgiven, so come back home. I’ll make you some soy hot chocolate, and then I’ll you tell you about our exciting new devil-may-care bathroom policy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 leonard Cut to the chase, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon Okay. Amy’s decided she wants to move in with me, so I need you to come back home, you lovable scamp. That’s a lot of product.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 penny Hey. What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 leonard Oh, get this, suddenly, Sheldon wants me back because Amy wants to move in with him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 penny Really? Interesting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 leonard Well, too late, pal. I’m not going anywhere. Penny and I are very happy living together. Isn’t that right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 penny It’s like the happiness won’t ever leave the apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon Leonard, please. You know Amy moving in marks a level of intimacy our relationship isn’t ready for.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 penny Yes. That is a real thing. And it doesn’t mean you don’t care about each other, it just means things are moving at a pace you’re not comfortable with, and that’s fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 leonard Well, if he doesn’t want to live with her, then he should tell her how he feels.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 penny Well, maybe he doesn’t know how to say it without hurting her feelings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon Feelings? What am I, a hippie at a love-in? No. The problem is, she laid out a series of logical arguments that I couldn’t refute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 penny That is the worst, isn’t it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 leonard I’m sorry, Sheldon. I can’t help you. Oh, spoiler alert, this door’s about to slam in your face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 amy Oh, there you are. When do I get a key to our apartment?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon Um…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 raj Hello?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 howard Hey. How’d it go last night with my mom?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 raj Okay, I guess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 howard What time did you leave?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 raj Actually, I’m still here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 howard What? You spent the night?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 raj Yeah. Uh, after dinner, we watched a rerun of Rockford Files, and then she opened a bottle of, uh, cream sherry, and the next thing I know, she was tucking me into your bed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 howard You wore my pyjamas?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 raj Mm-hmm. How do you sleep in these things? Silk pajamas on satin sheets? I slid out of the bed, like, three times.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 mrs_wolowitz Rajesh! You up? You ready for breakfast?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 raj Oh, boy. Breakfast.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 howard Okay, Raj, listen to me. You need to get out of there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 raj But I have a cream sherry hangover and I smell blintzes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 howard If you don’t leave now, she’ll use food and guilt to keep you there for the rest of your life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 raj Oh, Howard, stop.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 howard Trust me, you’re not Jewish. That’s how they get you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 raj You’re being silly. I can leave whenever I want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 howard Oh, really? Where are your clothes and your shoes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 raj They’re on the chair, right over… Oy vey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon Hello, home wrecker.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 penny What did I do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon You gave Leonard somewhere to go. Thanks to you, Amy’s out buying his and hers bath towels. Like I’d ever dry myself with something that has a possessive pronoun on it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 penny Okay. Listen, the truth is I don’t want him living with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon Great. Kick him out. Break his heart. Everybody wins.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 penny No, I don’t want to break his heart. I love him. This is just happening too fast.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon You think this is fast? It’s just a matter of time before I see Amy’s leg stubble in my shower.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 penny Yeah, and I’ve seen those legs. You might want to get some Drano.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon Hold on. If you don’t want to live with Leonard, why don’t you just tell him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 penny Well, you know how he is. He’s sensitive and emotional.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon That’s because he drinks too much soy milk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 penny Well, I don’t know what else we can do but tell them the truth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon I suppose there’s no choice but to face the crying, angry accusations and the high-pitched wails of despair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 penny Yeah. And who knows how Amy will react.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 howard Here’s some more ice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 bernadette Oh, thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 howard What were we thinking? We should have just done it the regular way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 bernadette Those Chinese acrobats in Cirque du Soleil made it look so easy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 howard Honestly, if I could bend that far, what would I need with you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 bernadette If you could bend that far, you’d be doing us both a favour. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 howard Hey, Raj. What’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 raj You were right. I can’t get out of here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 howard You’re still at my mother’s?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 raj I’m trapped. My clothes have been in the laundry all day, and she hid my keys. I think they might be in her bra, because she jingles when she walks. What do I do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 howard Hey, you wanted a woman in your life. Now you got one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 raj Come on, Howard, help me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 mrs_wolowitz Rajesh, tatellah, I ran you a bath.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 raj Oh, my God. She’s not gonna bathe me, is she?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 howard Gee, I wish I could tell you no. All right, well, thanks again for helping me out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 raj But, Howard…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 bernadette Should we go back and rescue him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 howard It’s too late. We’ll see him at his Bar Mitzvah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 amy Here you go. I picked up the Chinese food just the way Leonard used to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon Is it kung pao chicken?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 amy Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon Brown rice, not white rice?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 amy Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon Spicy mustard from the Korean deli?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 amy Yes. I did good, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon Yes. Amy, are you worried that us living together will take the mystery out of our relationship?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 amy No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon Yeah, why would you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 amy Oh, and, uh, check this out. I took the liberty of scripting a new outgoing voice mail message for both of us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon Hello. This is Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 amy And this is Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon We’re not home right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 amy ‘Cause we out dropping science, son.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 together Leave a message.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 amy Beep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon You can’t live here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 amy What? Why? Is it the message? I only used urban slang to sound tough so people wouldn’t break in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon No. It’s not the message.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 amy Well, what is it, then? I did everything just the way you like it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon You did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 amy Then what the hell, Sheldon? We have been going out for over two years, and I have been nothing but patient with you. I watch your dopey space movies. I signed your ridiculous contract. I even stopped wearing lip gloss ’cause you said it made my mouth look too slippery. I am the best girlfriend you’re ever gonna have. You give me one good reason why I can’t live here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon It’s Penny’s fault.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 amy What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon She doesn’t want to live with Leonard, so he has to come live here again. She’s the snake in our garden. She’s the reason we can’t be happy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 penny Hey, Ames.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 amy Yeah. Hey, Ames, nothing. I was all set to move in with Sheldon, and now I hear I can’t ’cause you don’t want to live with Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 penny Sheldon, what did you say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon I said the truth. You don’t want to live with Leonard, and you know it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 leonard Since when don’t you want to live with me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 penny Oh, don’t get all huffy. You’re the one who decided to move in without even asking me if I was ready.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon Yeah, I think we should talk about that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 penny And since you love the truth so much, why don’t you tell Amy you don’t want to live with her instead of blaming it on me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon I thought we were talking about the other thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 amy You’re a coward.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon Well, the evidence does support that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 penny Come on, Amy, let’s go drink wine and talk about what jerks our boyfriends are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 amy You know what would show them? I should move in here with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 penny Um…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon Do you want to catch up on some Walking Dead?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 leonard ‘Kay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon Have you seen the one where Lori dies?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 leonard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 sheldon Or maybe she doesn’t. Let’s find out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 mrs_wolowitz Where you going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode15 raj No!
