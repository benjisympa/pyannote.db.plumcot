TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 penny You’ll never believe what happened to me at work today.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Hmm?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 penny This old guy was choking on his food, and I saved his life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter You’re kidding. Did you Heimlich him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 penny No. I said, oh, my God, I think that old guy’s choking, and then one of the busboys Heimlich’ed him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter You’re a hero.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 penny Yeah, that was the point of the story.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Oh, yeah, speaking of work, do you know if you have Thursday night off?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 penny Um, I think so. Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter What do you mean, why? It’s Valentine’s Day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 penny Oh, right. Yeah, we can do something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter You could be a little more into it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 penny No, I’m into it, I’m into it. Just, there’s so much pressure to make the night special, and it never works out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Okay, well, this time it’s going to be different. Because I am like a romance ninja. You don’t see it coming, and then bam, romance, watch out, hearts, kisses, love, ooh-ya!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 penny You know, sometimes I think I’ve made you so much cooler than you used to be, and then you go and do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 sheldon_cooper So, in conclusion, I believe the painful sensation felt after passing a meal of spicy chillies is proof that the rectum does possess the sense of taste.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler I concur, but you changed the subject. What are we doing for Valentine’s Day?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Oh, you caught that, did you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay! Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 raj_koothrappali Everything okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Bernie’s a little cranky since she’s been working, like, 17 hours a day. And I’ve got a lot on my plate, too, because I’ve been busting my tail playing Assassin’s Creed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 raj_koothrappali Hey, Stuart, you got anything going on for Valentine’s Day?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 stuart_bloom Not really. Other than hiding all the sharp objects around here and white-knuckling it till morning. What do you got going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 raj_koothrappali Oh, well, I was going to spend the night with my special little lady, but, uh, she got worms, and then I had to take her to the vet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 stuart_bloom There must be something we can do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 raj_koothrappali Well, uh, how about you keep the store open late, and we throw a party for all the people who don’t have dates?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 raj_koothrappali Yeah, the theme will be that the greatest love a man can have is the love he has with himself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 stuart_bloom That’s good. Or maybe something a little less hand in the pants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Ah, Alex, excellent. I have a research problem that I believe you can help with.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 alex_jensen Oh, Dr. Cooper, thank you. I’ve been waiting for an opportunity to contribute to your scientific work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Oh, no, no. That’s not going to happen, no. What I need you to do is find a Valentine’s gift for my girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 alex_jensen You realize I passed up an opportunity to work at Fermilab to take this job with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Well, I guess those chaps will have to have someone else buy their girlfriends presents. Now, here is, let’s see, this is, this is about two thousand dollars, um, I think she likes monkeys and the colour grey. Contribute to my work. Ah, kids say the darnedest things.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Hey, you coming to lunch?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Yeah, one second. Come here. I want to show you something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter What you looking at?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Well, I was trying to come up with something really romantic to give Bernadette for Valentine’s Day since she’s been such a pain in the ass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter You can’t find a card that says that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Check it out. I used the atomic force microscope in the material science lab and wrote our initials in a heart one one-thousandth the size of a grain of sand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Oh, that’s cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 howard_wolowitz A micro-valentine for a microbiologist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter From her micro-husband. That is amazing. How long did this take you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Mmm, about twelve hours. I pulled an all-nighter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Oh, wow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Yeah, I know, it really took a bite out of my video game time. What are you and Penny doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Oh, I’m going to take her to a nice restaurant for dinner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Oh, that’s not bad, but as far as romance goes, I think my gift hits it right out of…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Want to come to dinner with us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Yes, please.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Okay. Amy will be here shortly, expecting the perfect Valentine’s gift, so, you’re up kid. Dazzle me. Go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 alex_jensen Okay, I think I have some really great choices. I went on Amy’s Facebook page and read up on her interests.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Now, see, I never would have thought to do that. Clearly, I made a good choice farming this out to you. But I am telling you, Amy hit the boyfriend jackpot. Anyway, my socks are on. Let’s knock them off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 alex_jensen Well, um, I know she loves playing the harp, so I found this beautiful music box that plays one of her favourite songs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Now, Amy already has a real harp. And it can play any song. What are you trying to pull here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 alex_jensen No, I just thought it would be…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Next.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 alex_jensen Okay. Um, I know she’s a fan of The Canterbury Tales.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Mmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 alex_jensen So I found this cool map that illustrates the character’s journey through England. I thought we could put it in a really nice frame.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 sheldon_cooper But she’s got Google Maps on her phone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 alex_jensen I don’t know how to respond to that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Well, I hope it’s with a third good option, because these first two, buh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 alex_jensen Okay. Well, uh, luckily, I saved the best for last. Since Amy’s a neuroscientist, I did some research and found out that Santiago Ramon y Cajal, the father of modern neuroscience, did lots of hand drawings of brain cells. And I managed to find this signed print.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Wow. Oh, this is truly remarkable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 alex_jensen Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 sheldon_cooper I think I’ll keep it for myself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 alex_jensen What about your girlfriend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 sheldon_cooper It’s too late. I call dibs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 penny This place is really beautiful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Waugh, romance ninja.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 penny Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Sorry we’re late.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 penny No problem. We just sat down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Mmm, would you like some wine?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, fill her up. I’ll tell you when to stop.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 penny Is everything okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Terrific. Couldn’t be better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, bite me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Look, we can still have a nice night. Just tell me where it is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski Maybe if you did what you said you were going to do, I’d tell you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Uh, where what is?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 howard_wolowitz She hid my Xbox like I’m a child. Yeah, and my mom got me that for my birthday, so if you don’t give it back, I’m telling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski I’ve been working late every night. All I asked was that he clean the apartment and do one load of laundry. But did he do it? No. He just kept on playing that stupid game. You like pushing buttons so much, try pushing them on the washing machine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 howard_wolowitz I said I’m sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski Sorry doesn’t clean my underpants, buddy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 howard_wolowitz I told you, turn them inside out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski And I told you to bite me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Trying to have a magical night here, guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 penny Oh, son of a bitch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 penny Nothing. Nothing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter No, tell me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 penny It’s just this guy I used to date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 penny Until he cheated on me with my friend Gretchen, who’s here with him now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter You’re kidding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 penny And it looks like she lost a lot of weight, damn it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter I know it’s not ideal, but don’t let them ruin our night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 penny No, you’re totally right. She could be skinny ’cause she’s dying.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter That’s the spirit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 penny You know what, screw them. Our night is going to be way more special than theirs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski Uh-oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 penny What? Oh, you got to be kidding me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 gretchen Oh, my God, yes. Of course I’ll marry you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Two can play this game. Penny…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 penny Get up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 raj_koothrappali It’s nice that all the people who are lonely on Valentine’s Day can come here tonight and be together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 stuart_bloom Yeah, I’m really looking forward to it. In fact, there’s no place I would rather be than here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 raj_koothrappali Except on a date with anybody.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 stuart_bloom Literally anybody.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 raj_koothrappali You know, you and I have so much fun hanging out. If you were a girl, all our problems would be solved.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 stuart_bloom What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 raj_koothrappali Oh, yeah, think about it. We’d hang out, we’d read comic books, we’d see movies. It’d be like the best relationship ever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 stuart_bloom That does sound nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 raj_koothrappali Then I’d take you home, slip off your little black dress and just pile-drive you into oblivion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 stuart_bloom What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 penny Oh, I can’t believe he’s going to marry the girl he cheated on me with.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Isn’t it kind of nice? I mean, he was with the wrong person, and now he found the right person.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 penny What, so I’m the wrong person? Maybe you want to be with Gretchen, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski They do look happy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Yeah, maybe tonight. But a year from now, he’ll be crawling under the sink looking for his Xbox. Well, he will.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter You know what? Why don’t we just forget about them and enjoy our Valentine’s Day?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 penny Yes, absolutely. Now they’re doing that phony link-arm-drink thingy. I totally taught him that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter I thought we were letting it go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 penny We were; it’s just, it’s not fair, okay? They’re bad people. It’s not supposed to end happy for them, it’s supposed to end happy for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Um, it did end happy for you. You’re here with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 penny Yeah, yeah, I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Okay, this is getting a little hard to not take personally.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 penny Oh, come on, don’t make this about you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Oh, I’m not. It’s about you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 penny Yeah, well, whatever, okay? I told you, Valentine’s Day sucks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter This one does, and you’re the reason why.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski You know, compared to them, I’m feeling pretty good about us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Me, too. How about we blow off dessert, go home early, I’ll do that laundry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 howard_wolowitz I love you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski Love you, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 howard_wolowitz So where’d you hide it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski Where you’d never look.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Damn it, it’s in the washing machine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler Happy Valentine’s Day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Okay. Shall we go to dinner?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler Hang on. As you know, I had planned a traditional evening of romance and gifts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Yes, and as you know, I planned to pretend to enjoy it. I’ve been working on this facial expression all day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler And I appreciate your effort, but upon contemplation, I decided I was being selfish. So, I cancelled our dinner reservations and came up with an even better way to celebrate Valentine’s Day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 sheldon_cooper What is that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler By doing none of it. No dinner, no romance, no gifts. We stay here, order a pizza and watch one of your beloved Star War Trek things.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler Well, that’s what you’d love, isn’t it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 sheldon_cooper More than anything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler Well, then, that’s what we’re going to do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Well, I don’t know what to say. This is the most thoughtful gift that anyone’s ever given me. And that’s including an amazing gift that I gave myself earlier today.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler I’m your girlfriend. That’s my job. And I know gift-giving puts a lot of pressure on you, so whatever you got me, you can return.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 sheldon_cooper No. No, after everything you didn’t do for me tonight, I want you to have it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler What’s this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Read it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon Cooper, Caltech University employee information?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 sheldon_cooper At the bottom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler In case of emergency, please contact… Amy Farrah Fowler. And there’s my phone number. This is the most beautiful gift you could’ve ever given me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Well, I thought, if I have a stroke or a kidney stone, who would I want to share that with?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler And you picked me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 sheldon_cooper It’s like you said, you’re my girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Yeah. Okay. Stop ruining Valentine’s Day and order my pizza.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 penny Night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Yep. You know what? That was pretty crappy of you. I mean, all I wanted to do was give you a great night, and it’s like you-you went out of your way to destroy it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 penny Yeah, I know. I’m a total bitch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter I’m not saying that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 penny Well, I am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Fine, you win. You’re a bitch. Why couldn’t we just have a nice time?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 penny I don’t know. Maybe ’cause things are going so well between us lately and I’ve been really happy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Okay, you’re gonna have to make a lot more sense than that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 penny Obviously, I have some commitment issues.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Glaringly obvious. Go on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 penny As long as things keep going great between us, you’ll keep asking me to marry you, and eventually I’m gonna end up saying yes, and then we’re gonna be married forever, and the whole thing just freaks me out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Okay. I know I propose a lot. So how about this? I promise I will never ask you to marry me again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 penny What, what do you mean? Are you breaking up with me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter No. No, no, no, no. But if someday you decide you want to get married, you have to propose to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 penny Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Yes. It’s all on you. But I got to tell you, when the time comes, I want the whole nine yards. I want you down on one knee, flowers, I want to be swept off my feet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 penny Yeah, you got it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter And I’m cool with surprises. But nothing on a Jumbotron. I don’t want to cry on a big screen like that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 penny Okay. You know what? This might be the wine talking, but I have a very important question to ask you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter You do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 penny Leonard Hofstadter?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Yes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 penny Will you be my valentine?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Sorry. Maybe next year. I’m just kidding. Romance ninja. Let’s have sex. Waugh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 nerdy_guy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 Thank you, guys, for doing this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 raj_koothrappali We’re glad you could make it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 nerdy_guy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 Usually I spend Valentine’s Day sad and alone. This year, I’m just sad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 raj_koothrappali What is it about this holiday that makes people so unhappy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 stuart_bloom I know. I hate myself most of the time, but tonight’s the night I know everyone else does, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 nerdy_guy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 I think you’re cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 stuart_bloom Great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 raj_koothrappali I got to tell you, we’ve got to stop beating ourselves up like this. Excuse me, everybody. Can I have your attention, please? We’re all here tonight because we have no one to be with. But that doesn’t make us mutants. The only mutants here are in these comic books. We’ve got to stop defining our self-worth by whether or not we’re in a relationship. You know what I see when I look around? I see a room full of great people. So let’s give ourselves a break. We are a community, and as long as we have each other, we’re never truly alone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 That was cool. What you said.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 raj_koothrappali You really think so?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 Yeah, I do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 raj_koothrappali Thank you. Uh, would you like to, uh, get a cup, a cup of coffee or…?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 raj_koothrappali Later, losers!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler Hello? Another medical emergency? What’s wrong with him now? I seriously doubt he was bitten by a Chinese bird spider. How exactly does a bump feel Asian? Just put him on the phone. Sheldon, I am not driving over there again. Because I drove over there yesterday for a brain tumour that turned out to be an ice cream headache. Yes, I still want to be your emergency contact. Yes, you can eat your ice cream too fast and also have a brain tumour. I’m on my way. Brain tumour would explain a lot.
