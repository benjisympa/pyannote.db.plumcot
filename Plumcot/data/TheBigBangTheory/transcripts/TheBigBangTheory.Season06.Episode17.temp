TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 raj So then I went to Cambridge, which was wonderful not only because it’s a good school but because it totally looks like Hogwarts. That’s where I fell in love with astronomy, and now I’m an astrophysicist at Caltech, so I guess you could say, uh, Raj is my name and stars are my game. And rhyming is also my game. So, uh, two games. Uh, anyway, that, that’s enough about me. I want to hear everything about you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 girl I have to go to the bathroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 raj I go to the bathroom, too. Sometimes more frequently than I care to admit. Oh, I’ve had it checked out, it’s nothing. Hmm. This is going great. Mmm, can I have a refill on my chai tea? Yes, I have a good feeling about this. I should have bought condoms.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 sheldon Hello, I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. My apologies that this episode is coming late. I did shoot one last week, in honour of Black History Month, but I was informed by my roommate that my spot-on portrayal of George Washington Carver could be considered wildly racist. My heart goes out to the members of the African-American community, who, like me, have been kept down by The Man. Now, Fun with Flags is not just for the flag aficionado, it’s also for the flag novice, so, to help me with that, please welcome my friend, neighbour, and flag virgin, yeah, not a real virgin. She’s had coitus many times. Sometimes within earshot of this flag enthusiast. Once while he was trying to watch The Incredibles. Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 penny Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 sheldon So, Penny, I understand you would like to learn more about flags.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 penny Yeah, I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been at a party where everyone’s talking about flags and I just couldn’t join in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 sheldon Yeah. Well, you came to the right place.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 penny Uh, I’m sorry, can we just pause for a minute?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 sheldon What’s wrong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 penny I just think it might look more natural if you talked to me instead of the camera, you know, like, like a real conversation. It’s something we work on in my acting class.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 sheldon Interesting. A few people in the comments section have said that my delivery is robotic. Perhaps that isn’t the compliment it sounds like.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 penny Yeah, let’s try it again, and maybe, this time, you could work on your body language a bit. You know, when you’re all hunched like that, you’re shutting the audience out, but when you’re relaxed and open, you’re inviting them in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 sheldon Right. And which one do I want?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 penny Let’s try open.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 sheldon If our friend, the flag, has taught me anything, it’s to go where the wind takes you. As long as you remain firmly attached to a rigid pole. And, action. So, Penny, what sort of flag questions keep you awake at night?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 penny Um, well, I’m from Nebraska. So what can you tell me about the state flag?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 sheldon Gosh, Penny, what’d you have for breakfast? A big glass of good question juice? The Nebraska state flag is simply the state seal on a field of blue. Spread your legs, invite them in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 howard I’m telling you, something’s wrong. I can always feel it when Raj is in trouble.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 bernadette Geez, how close were you guys before we got married?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 leonard Don’t look under that rock. Raj, you okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 howard You in there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 raj Go away!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 leonard Come on, buddy, open up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 howard We’re worried about you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 raj Oh, just because I’ve stopped going to work and answering my phone you think something bad happened? Maybe something good happened.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 bernadette Did something good happen?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 raj Of course not. Nothing good ever happens. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 leonard Whoa.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 raj What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 leonard Nope, just, just, whoa.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 bernadette It smells pretty ripe in here. You kind feel it in your eyes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 leonard Raj, what’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 raj I was humiliated by yet another woman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 howard You didn’t kill her and chop her up, that’s not what we’re smelling, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 raj No. I took her for coffee, and she snuck out the bathroom window to get away from me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 bernadette Oh, you poor baby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 raj I went and looked. It was a high and tiny window. She must have been very motivated.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 howard I’m sorry. That’s awful, but come on, you got to shake it off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 leonard Yeah, you can’t stay in your apartment for the rest of your life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 raj Why not? With online shopping and overnight delivery, I can get anything I want. Look, I just ordered a case of Dinty Moore beef stew and two live lobsters on Amazon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 leonard Lobsters overnight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 howard Oh, you’re kidding. Let me see. Well, I’ll be. Look, you can throw in a couple steaks and have a surf and turf.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 leonard The surf and turf sounds good. See if they have corn on the cob.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 bernadette Guys, we’re trying to get him out of here, not you in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 raj You’re wasting your time. Just please, leave me alone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 howard Now what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 leonard I don’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 bernadette We could go to Red Lobster and talk about it. We’re all thinking it. I just had the decency to wait for him to leave.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 amy Hello, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 sheldon Hello. How’s the final stage of your nicotine addiction study going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 amy Fine. Just hold on. Mommy’s on the phone! Sorry. We’ve cut the monkeys down to one cigarette a day, so things are a little intense. Makes me miss my marijuana-abusing flatworms. Those guys were mellow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 sheldon Good news. Uh, the latest episode of Fun with Flags is online.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 amy Oh, that’s right. How’d it go with Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 sheldon Much better than I expected. She even gave me some helpful tips about acting and body language. Watch. Welcome to my world. Not welcome to my world. Welcome. Not welcome.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 amy Subtle, but powerful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 sheldon I know. I’m still learning to control it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 amy Did you tell Penny how helpful she was?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 sheldon Why would I do that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 amy Because she’s your friend, and she did a nice job. I’m sure she’d like to hear it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 sheldon All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 amy I didn’t mean now. Hello? Yeah, yeah, you want a cigarette. Well, I’d like a normal boyfriend. Deal with it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 penny Oh, hi. What’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 sheldon Um…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 penny You need me to shut the door so you can do your knocking thing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 sheldon No. I didn’t start yet, it’s fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 penny Okay. So, what do you need?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 sheldon Well, I was thinking about you helping me out last night Penny. And I just wanted to tell you Penny, that the answer to the question, who did a great job? is you, Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 penny Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 sheldon Yes, you were very natural in front of the camera, and I found your suggestions extremely helpful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 penny Aw, sweetie, you just made my day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 sheldon Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 penny Hey, my acting class is putting on a play Friday night. I could put you and Amy on the guest list.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 sheldon Oh, that sounds terrible. Why would I want to do that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 amy That’s right. They’re no good without the lighter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 sheldon Well, so much for your advice on complimenting Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 amy Why? What happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 sheldon She tried to rope us into going to her acting class to see a play. Don’t worry. Luckily, I had the good sense to drown that kitten in the river.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 amy Sheldon, that’s very rude. She helped you with your show. The right thing to do is reciprocate by going to see her play.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 sheldon Oh, so many crazy rules.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 amy That better be Tootsie Rolls you’re throwing at me!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 sheldon Penny. Penny. Penny. Oh yeah, much better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 sheldon Amy pointed out to me that since you did something nice for me, I’m obligated to do something nice for you. So, yes, I’ll go to your dopey play.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 penny Hey, I don’t want you to go any more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 sheldon Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 penny You should go ’cause you want to go, not because you have to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 sheldon Oh, Dear Lord, more rules? Where does it stop? Can I want to go because I have to want to go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 penny Okay. Do whatever you want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 sheldon Yeah, but now, wait. Do whatever I want? Or whatever I have to want?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 penny Oh, for God’s sake, just come to the play.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 sheldon All right. I don’t want to, but at least that makes sense.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 sheldon You know, I haven’t seen Raj in several days. Is he no longer a part of our social group? And if so, should we be interviewing for a replacement? Perhaps, this time, we go Latin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 howard He’s just decided he’s never leaving his apartment again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 sheldon Oh, brilliant. I’ve been itching to pull that trigger.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 howard He’s upset because he can’t get anywhere with women.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 sheldon Would it help if I gave him some pointers? I’m just funnin’ ya.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 girl Hi. I don’t know if you remember me, but I was here the other night at your party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 stuart Oh, yeah, you left with Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 girl Uh, yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 howard You’re the one? Okay, let me tell you something. That guy you blew off happens to be my best friend. Okay? He was devastated.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 girl Sorry. Can you just give him this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 howard Okay. But I gotta warn you, Raj is a proud, passionate man. If you go running out on him again, you’re only gonna get, like, three or four more chances before you are history.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 howard Come on, she came back. This is good news. You should celebrate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 raj I don’t want to celebrate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 howard Not even a little? I mean, we could have a pants party. Go put some on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 raj Why would I want her number? I don’t want anything to do with this woman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 howard Oh, come on, Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 raj No, you don’t get it. I want nothing to do with any woman. My heart is stone. From now on, I’m a monk. I renounce all worldly pleasures. Except for lobster. And garlic butter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 howard Boy, I want to tell you it’s her loss, but you are not making it easy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 raj You’re, you’re a good friend for trying to help, but, I’ve made my choice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 howard All right. Well, I’ll see you around.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 raj See you. No, wait, take her number. I don’t want the temptation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 howard Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 raj I must be strong so I don’t stray from my true purpose, the study of the universe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 howard All right. Thanks for ruining lobster for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 raj Wait! Give me the number! Give me the number! Give me the number!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 leonard So, Amy, what’s going on with your addiction study?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 amy Sadly, I’m no longer associated with that project.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 leonard Why? What happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 amy Typical bureaucratic nonsense. You can get animals addicted to a harmful substance, you can dissect their brains, but you throw their own faeces back at them and suddenly you’re unprofessional.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 leonard I’m sorry. That I asked.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 sheldon All right, let’s get this stupid play over with.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 leonard Uh, hang on. Empty your pockets.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 sheldon Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 leonard You know why. The Nintendo DS. And the PSP. Now the Gameboy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 sheldon Aw, for Pete’s sake. Can we go now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 leonard Well, is that all of it? Just set it down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 amy Just so you know, this is not a stupid play. A Streetcar Named Desire is an American classic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 sheldon It’s about streetcars? Oh, great. I won’t need this. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 raj Just a sec. Oh, who says just a sec? I hate myself. Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 girl Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 raj Uh, would you like to come in?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 girl Oh, no, I can’t stay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 raj Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 girl I just wanted to say, I’m sorry for running out of the coffee shop. That wasn’t cool. So, uh, yeah. I’m sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 raj Wait. Can you at least tell me what went wrong? It’s okay. I can take anything. Unless it’s something I did, or said, or am. ‘Cause those are, like, my buttons.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 girl No, it’s not any of that. It’s just, I kind of have a hard time around people I don’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 raj Really? Then what were you doing at the comic book store that night?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 girl I’ve been trying to force myself into situations that I’m not comfortable with. I saw the flyer in the store window, and I made myself go in. I don’t even like comic books.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 raj Yeah, me neither.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 girl Then what were you doing there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 raj I lied. I love them. I only said that so you’d go out with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 girl Oh, you don’t want to do that. I’m kind of broken.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 raj That’s great. I’m broken, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 girl Oh, no, you’re not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 raj Oh, I totally am. If it wasn’t for this beer, I couldn’t even talk to you right now. I’m a wreck. There are many things seriously wrong with me. And not quirks, either. Like, diagnosable psychological problems. Maybe brain damage.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 girl Well, how do I know you’re not just saying that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 raj Go out with me on one date, and I promise you, you’ll see.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 girl Okay. Text me. Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 raj You won’t regret it. I’m the most pathetic guy you’ve ever met. And that, boys and girls, is how it’s done.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 penny You love her very much, don’t you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 actor Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 penny I think you have a great capacity for devotion. You’ll be lonely when she passes on, won’t you? I understand what that is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 actor To be lonely?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 leonard She’s pretty good, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 sheldon She is. But when do they get to the part about streetcars?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 penny …when I was a very young girl. When I was 16 years old, I made the discovery, love. All at once, and much, much too completely. It was like you suddenly turned a blinding light on something that had always been half a shadow. That’s how it struck the world for me. But I was unlucky. Deluded.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 sheldon She’s remarkable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 leonard She really is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 amy Our Penny’s a star.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode17 sheldon How can she remember all those lines, but as a waitress, she can’t remember no tomato on my hamburger?
