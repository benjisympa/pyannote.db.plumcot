TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 leonard Look, I know you guys don’t want to do this, but we have no choice. So, you can either bitch and whine or we can just get it over with.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 howard I got whine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 sheldon I got the B word.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 leonard Yeah, well, it’s in our contract to serve on a university committee. And frankly, this is one I believe in. Okay, here we go. Encouraging more women to pursue a career in the sciences.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 howard Come on, if I was any good at convincing women to do stuff, I wouldn’t have spent so much of my twenties in the shower.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 sheldon If you ask me, this whole thing is a waste of our time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 leonard Helping women? Y
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 sheldon Helping anyone. People should take care of themselves.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 leonard Oh, like yesterday, when you made me drive you to the dry cleaners, the pharmacy and the post office?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 sheldon I’m not saying people can’t use tools. Even an otter picks up a rock when he wants a clam.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 leonard You don’t think it’s worthwhile to try to get more women working in science.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 sheldon I think that’s incredibly sexist of you. I believe in a gender-blind society like in Star Trek, where women and men of all races and creeds work side by side as equals.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 leonard You mean where they were advanced enough to invent an interstellar warp drive, but a black lady still answered the space phone?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 howard Oh, I did spend a lot of my shower time with Lieutenant Uhura.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 sheldon Howard’s disturbing recollections aside, I don’t appreciate being forced to do banal committee work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 leonard Yes, I know, you’re too smart for this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 sheldon Exactly. It’s like asking the Human Torch to heat up your frozen burrito.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 leonard Got it. All right, I’m thinking one way to counter bias in the peer-review process, is for papers to be submitted under gender-neutral names. Like S. Smith instead of Samantha Smith.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 sheldon I suppose there is a history of professional women using their initials so as not to be pre-judged. Harry Potter’s J.K. Rowling, uh, Star Trek’s D.C. Fontana.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 howard Van Nuys pole-dancer D.D. Melons. All right, I think we’ve really helped women today. Let’s fire up the old Xbox.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 leonard Guys, please don’t make this a school project where I’m the smart kid doing all the work while the slackers sit back and watch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 sheldon We’re not. This time you’re the smart kid doing all the work while the even smarter kids sit back and watch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 howard So, you think I’m one of the smarter kids?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 sheldon No, you’re a tool I was using to make my point.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 leonard Guys, our topic is encouraging women in science, can you at least play a less sexist game
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 sheldon How is it sexist? My character wields a battle axe as well as any man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 howard Not to mention she has mammary glands that could nurse a family of 30. And have enough milk left over to open a Baskin Robbins.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 sheldon Mother, warrior-princess, franchise owner, I hear glass ceilings shattering all over town.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 leonard Sheldon, you’re always saying how much smarter you are than me. Spend five seconds and come up with one idea on how to get more women into science.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 sheldon All your ideas address the issue at a university level. By then it’s too late. You need to design an outreach program that targets girls at the middle school level and sets them on an academic track towards the hard sciences.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 leonard That’s actually good. Why didn’t I think of that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 sheldon Some people are otters, some people are rocks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 leonard I wonder if there’s a way we could give the idea a trial run.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 howard Maybe I could call my old middle school, see if we can talk to some of the female students.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 leonard That’s great, try to set up something for the three of us to go over there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 sheldon Oh, hold on. While I’m comfortable speaking about science, I’m not sure I know how to spark the interest of schoolchildren. Better Google it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 howard What exactly are you looking up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 sheldon How do I get 12-year-old girls excited.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 leonard_and_howard No!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 raj Thanks again for letting me crash girls’ night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 penny Are you kidding? You brought fancy wine and made fondue. I’ve slept with guys for less. It’s a joke. Based on real events.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 raj Anyway, I was hoping I could, uh, pick your brains a little. I’m supposed to take Lucy out Friday and I need a killer first date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 amy Well, evolutionary biology says that women are attracted to a man who is steady n the face of danger, so I recommend an unsafe environment. Seedy bar on the wrong side of the tracks, picnic near a lunatic asylum, a wine tasting on Skid Row.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 raj Uh, Lucy has some, uh, social anxiety issues. Maybe we could start with something simpler.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 bernadette Why don’t you take her to Disneyland? You go on Space Mountain, you’re in the dark, she’s holding onto you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 penny Yeah, but you just have to remember, that ride is shorter than you think and they take a picture of you at the end, so make sure you got your clothes back on. It’s a joke. Based on real events.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 raj Mm, Disneyland? I don’t know. With all the crowds and the weird characters walking around, just reminds me too much of India.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 amy I haven’t been to Disneyland since I was a kid. We should definitely go one weekend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 bernadette Weekends are too crowded.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 penny So, blow off work, go on a weekday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 amy Hooky? I’ve never played hooky in my life. My mom said that’s how girls end up addicted to reefer and jazz music.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 penny It’s more like how girls end up at a Best Western hotel with a 34-year-old guy named Luther.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 bernadette Joke?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 penny I can laugh about it now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 bernadette So, what do you say? This Friday we ditch work and go to Disneyland?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 penny I’m in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 amy Me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 raj Excuse me, I thought we were trying to solve my problem?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 penny Oh, yeah, right. Wait, what was your problem again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 raj I am a man who can’t talk to women, trying to figure out how to go on a romantic date with a girl who suffers from such crippling social anxiety she can’t be around other people.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 penny Yeah, that’s a toughie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 bernadette Let’s think.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 amy Hmm. We doing just Disney or California Adventure, too?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 leonard It’s nice of your old school to let us try out our science talk on some female students.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 howard Well, they’re actually pretty excited. I’m their most famous alum. If you don’t count the serial killer who ate all those prostitutes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 sheldon This must feel pretty good for you, coming back to your alma mater as an astronaut.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 howard Yeah, last time I was here, I was just a scrawny little nerd.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 leonard And now you’re also an astronaut.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 howard So many memories. I mean, how many times in these hallways was I tripped, punched and spit on? Oh, look, here’s my old locker. I have a masters in engineering and I still can’t figure out how Scott Kapinski got me and my briefcase to fit in there. Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 kid What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 howard Nothing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 sheldon Smart. We don’t want any problems.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 amy I can’t believe I ditched work for Disneyland.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 bernadette What did you tell your boss?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 amy Oh, I was very clever, I did it in stages. At seven o’clock last night, I called about a problem at the lab and casually mentioned I was going out for seafood. At nine thirty, I called and told him that one of my scallops tasted weird. At eleven thirty, I called and said I was throwing up like a fire hose. At twelve forty-five, I called and made nothing but dry heaving sounds, and now I’m going to Disneyland.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 bernadette Penny, what did you say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 penny I work at the Cheesecake Factory, I said bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 amy So, what are we gonna do first?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 bernadette I don’t know about you guys, but I’m gonna make a beeline for the place that gives you a princess makeover.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 amy Ooh, that sounds like fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 penny You’re kidding, right? We’re not just gonna get drunk and go on rides?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 amy Come on, do it with us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 penny All right, whatever. How does it work?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 bernadette Okay, so, you pick your princess, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, Cinderella, they give you hair, makeup, the works.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 penny Guess it would be fun to be Cinderella.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 amy Oh, I want to be Cinderella, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 penny Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 bernadette We can’t all be Cinderella.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 amy Then how do we decide?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 bernadette Well, it’s simple. This was my idea. I’m driving. I’m Cinderella. You bitches got a problem with that, we could stop the car right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 raj Excuse me, I’m meeting a girl here. It’s kind of our first date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 man In a library?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 raj She and I are both a little awkward in social situations, so this seemed like a good idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 man People say I’m a little awkward, too. May I join you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 raj No, you can’t join us. Just go, go climb back up whatever beanstalk you came down from.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 man You can do better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 lucy Oh, we’re eating here? We’re having a texting date? I love that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 raj As you’re reading, it will help to remember I have an adorable accent.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 leonard Okay, who’s ready for some science? Me, too. Okay, I am Dr. Leonard Hofstadter. I am here with my friends Dr. Cooper and real-life astronaut Howard Wolowitz, and we are going to show you girls how cool a job in science can be. How cool, you ask? Well, how about negative 273 degrees, ’cause that’s the temperature at which entropy reaches its minimum value. Did I just learn something new and have fun doing it? What? All right. So now let’s bring out theoretical physicist Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 sheldon Hello, female children. Allow me to inspire you with a story about a great female scientist. Polish-born, French-educated Madame Curie. Co-discoverer of radioactivity, she was a hero of science, until her hair fell out, her vomit and stool became filled with blood, and she was poisoned to death by her own discovery. With a little hard work, I see no reason why that can’t happen to any of you. Are we done? Can we go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 howard The thing to remember is you can go to outer space, too. I mean, look at me. I went to this very school. Those desks you’re sitting in, I was once superglued to one of them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 girl Did you go to the moon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 howard No, but I did go to the International Space Station.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 girl Did you fly the rocket?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 howard No, but I was in the rocket. I didn’t actually…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 girl So you just flew around? That’s kind of like my uncle. He’s a flight attendant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 howard No, I’m an American hero. Your uncle brings people nuts, okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 leonard Alright, alright. Boy, we are learning a lot here, huh? Thank you, astronaut Howard. Um, I am what’s called an experimental physicist, which is super-fun, because I get to test theories and work with lasers. Yes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 girl_2 How did you decide to become a scientist?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 leonard Uh, excellent question. Um, I suppose I’ve always been into science, you know. My mother and father are scientists, so I was kind of led in that direction. Uh, pushed might be a better way to describe it. To be honest with you guys, when I was your age, I wanted to be a rap star. Like Snoop Dogg, but with a healthy respect for the police. Yeah, no, sure, you laugh. Just like my mother did. After I confided, I was derided and chided, my moms and I collided. She said my dreams were misguided. That’s just a little freestyle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 raj My dad’s a gynaecologist in India, so if you’re over there and need a check up, as he likes to say, he’s at your cervix.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 lucy That’s terrible. Your dad should be sent to the pun-itentiary.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 raj That’s a fitting pun-ishment. I still don’t know what you do for a living.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 lucy Web design.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 raj Anything I might have seen?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 lucy I don’t know. You ever look at porn Web sites?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 raj No, never. What is porn?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 lucy Sorry. Autocorrect. That was supposed to say prom Web sites.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 raj Ooh, fun. I love prom. The romance, the gowns, it’s like a fairy tale come to life. Sorry. Autocorrect. That was supposed to say, I like sports.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 leonard I never wanted to play the cello. How do you meet girls playing the cello? Hey, you want to come over to my house and listen to me play an instrument that sounds like a suicidal bumblebee?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 howard Quick, pull the fire alarm. Let’s get out of here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 sheldon Uh, hello again. Um, yeah, I don’t know if women in general have been actively discouraged from pursuing the sciences, but it’s clear you young women here, today, have been. While I was listening to my colleagues waste your time, it occurred to me that it might be much more meaningful to hear about women in science from actual women in science, and, uh, I happen to know two brilliant examples who have agreed to speak to you on the phone right now. Uh, Dr. Rostenkowski, Dr. Fowler, are you there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 amy We’re here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 sheldon Thank you for taking time out of your very busy schedule to enlighten these young women.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 amy It’s our pleasure. I’m Dr. Fowler, and I’m a neuroscientist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 bernadette And I’m Dr. Rostenkowski Wolowitz, and I’m a microbiologist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 amy The world of science needs more women, but from a young age, we girls are encouraged to care more about the way we look than about the power of our minds.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 bernadette That’s true. Every one of you has the capacity to be anything you want to be.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 penny Unless you want to be Cinderella.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 bernadette Come at me. See what happens.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 raj This was really fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 lucy My battery’s dying, so I’m just gonna talk. Thanks for today. I’ve been trying to do more things that scare me, and coming here was definitely one of them. But it was also really nice. So thanks, and, um, I’m gonna go. Maybe I could do one more scary thing before I go and give you a kiss good-bye? You know, if that’s okay. Okay. Panic attack. Maybe next time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 raj I’m counting that as foreplay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 howard Bernie, I’m home. You have fun today?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 bernadette Yes, and I have a surprise for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 howard Please be Cinderella. Please be Cinderella.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 bernadette Well, hello, Prince Charming.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 howard Milady.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 leonard Hey, how was your… what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 penny I can explain. I played hooky with the girls, then we all went to Disneyland and got… What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 leonard Disneyland. Go on, I’m listening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 amy Sheldon, all Snow White needs is one little kiss to wake up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode18 sheldon Heard you the first time.
