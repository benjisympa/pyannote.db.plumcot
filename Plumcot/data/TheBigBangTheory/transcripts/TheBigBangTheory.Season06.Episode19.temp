TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette What you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard You said clean up. I’m cleaning up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette You can’t just throw everything in the closet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard Hey, you can tell me what to do or you can tell me how to do it, but you can’t do both. This isn’t sex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette What if someone looks in there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard They’re just coming over for dinner. No one’s gonna look in the closet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette Well, you don’t know that. What if someone’s looking for the bathroom and they open that door?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard Could work out. For all we know there’s a toilet in there somewhere.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette Fine. But after tonight we need to get a handle on this mess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard You know what we should do? We should show the closet to Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard Are you kidding? He’s like a savant at organizing. Everything in his apartment has a label on it. Including his label maker, which has a label that says label maker. And if you look really close at that label maker label, you’ll see a label that says label.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette He’s our guest, we can’t just ask him to straighten our closet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard No, we wouldn’t ask him. We’d just show him the closet and let the goblins in his head take it from there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard Hey, guys, come on in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 all Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny Ooh, it smells good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette Thanks. And, Sheldon, I know tonight’s the night you eat Thai food, so I went to the Asian market, got all the ingredients and made it from scratch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon Oh, you shouldn’t have.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette Oh, it’s my pleasure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon No, you really shouldn’t have. I brought my own.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette You stopped and got him takeout?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard I had no choice. He kept kicking the back of my seat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette Sheldon, I’ve been cooking all day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon Well, now don’t you feel silly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette Show him the closet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 raj These spring rolls are amazing. Good job, Bernadette.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette That’s the takeout that Sheldon brought.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 raj Oh, well, I’m sure they wouldn’t have tasted nearly as good if I hadn’t tried your food first.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon Howard, did you want your clothes arranged seasonally or by colour?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard Colour’s fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon Wrong, they’ll be arranged seasonally.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny Sheldon, aren’t you gonna spend a little time with Amy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 amy Oh, it’s okay, I’m used to it. The other day at Whole Foods, he spent an hour optimizing the cheese aisle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon Yeah, and some thanks I got. The assistant manager chased me out with an artisanal salami.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 amy His quirks just make you love him more. Someone please agree with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard Sheldon, come on. It’s getting late. Time to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon Oh, five more minutes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard That’s what you said five minutes ago. Amy and Penny are already in the car. Let’s move it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon How come I never get to do anything I want to do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard You know, if he really wants to stay and finish, I can give him a ride home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon Please, Leonard, he said it’s okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard Sheldon, it’s, wait, I can go home without you? Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon Howard, I have a few questions. I found three bowling pins. Now, do you juggle these, or are you missing seven?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard Juggle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon You health nuts kill me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette Oh, my God, it’s beautiful. Look, he found the juggling pins I hid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon Uh, just a couple more items. Howard, I found this letter from your dad in a box. Now, based on the content, it could either be filed…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard Whoa, you opened this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon Well, I had to find out if it was personal correspondence or memorabilia. Now, as I was saying, based on the content…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard I couldn’t be less interested. Now, come on, I’ll take you home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette Howard, don’t you want to know what’s in the letter?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard If I wanted to know, I would’ve opened it years ago. The closet looks great. Let’s get out of here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon Wait, can I bring this box of extra shirt buttons to sort on the ride?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard Do whatever you want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon Thanks. Oh. Great party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard You know, when I first met Howard, he would pull his scrotum out of his shorts and say, aw, I sat in gum.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny What is your point?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard Well, it’s just kind of weird how grown up he is now. Happily married guy throwing dinner parties.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny Really? You couldn’t just say that? You had to tell the scrotum story?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard Trying to paint a picture.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny It was a nice change of pace not eating takeout around a coffee table.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard Mm, you know, we could throw a dinner party, too. Maybe even ask everyone to get dressed up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny Sure. Just, when you say dressed up, you mean nice clothes, right? Not, like, capes and tights and crap?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard Yeah. Although…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette Howie, you okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard Yeah, I just couldn’t sleep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette Told you you shouldn’t have espresso after dinner. I know the little cups make you feel big, but it’s not worth it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard It’s this stupid letter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette Did you read it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette You must be curious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard Of course I’m curious. I haven’t seen the man since, oh, I was a little kid. And a letter shows up on my 18th birthday? What’s that about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette Why don’t you read it? Maybe he apologizes or explains why he left.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard He abandoned me and my mother. Why does he deserve a chance to explain anything?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette I get that. So, what do you want to do with it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard Something I should have done a long time ago. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette Really? Are you sure?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard Yep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette Feel better?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard I do. Great. Neither one of us is tall enough to reach that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 amy I can’t believe he set it on fire.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette Yeah, just seeing that letter really freaked him out. And he was already having a tough day ’cause he accidentally wore my pants to work. I don’t know why he was upset. They were bigger on him than me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 amy Boy, I’m really curious what was in that letter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette Me, too, but I guess now we’ll never know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 amy Well, you said Sheldon read it. Why not ask him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette I can’t do that. What kind of wife would I be if I didn’t respect my husband’s privacy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny What if I ask Sheldon, you just happen to be in the room?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bermadette That works.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon Bleuch. Like cleaning out the entire building’s belly button.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny Hey, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon Oh, hello. What can I do for you ladies?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 amy You have something we want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon Oh, dear. My mother warned me this is what happens to pretty boys in the big city.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny No, we just want information.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon Oh. Oh, I’ve got that in spades. Ravage me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny We heard you read the letter from Howard’s father.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon I did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny What did it say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon I can’t tell you that. I’m bound by closet organizer/organizee confidentiality.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 amy Sheldon, that’s not a real thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon Well, neither is the rule that you have to hold your girlfriend’s hand at the movies. You know. That doesn’t stop you from pawing at me like you’re a bear and I’m a trash can full of sweets.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny Why do you even care? Just tell us what it says.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon Control over the information contained in that letter belongs to Howard. By happenstance, I came to know it. That doesn’t give me the right to disseminate it freely.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny Come on. Look, the letter was found in Bernadette’s closet. Doesn’t that count for something?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon Are you pointing out that California is a community property state, and since Howard and Bernadette are married, the intellectual property contained in that letter is jointly owned by the two spouses?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny Yeah, obviously.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon Well played. Sometimes I don’t give you enough credit, Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 raj Dude, you made the right choice coming to me for help with this party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard Actually, all I did was invite you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 raj Well, put your mind at ease. I’m here to make sure your dinner party kicks Howard’s dinner party’s ass. Now, the first thing we need is a theme. I’m thinking, ah, turn-of-the-century Moulin Rouge.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard I’m thinking you need a testosterone patch. Penny and I just want to do something low-key. You know, cocktails, light jazz music, hors d’oeuvres.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 raj So your theme is I saw a rerun of Mad Men and bought some crab puffs from Trader Joe’s? Hate to miss that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard Hey, where have you been?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon Oh, Leonard. If I was prone to sarcasm, I’d say I was pulling off a major heist at the museum of laundry baskets.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. I meant, golly, Sheldon, you’ve been gone a long time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon Oh. Yeah, well, I was waylaid by Penny, Bernadette and Amy. They made me reveal confidential information about Howard’s father.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard What information?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon I can’t tell you that. I am bound by closet organizer/organizee confidentiality.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 raj Well, come on, we won’t tell anyone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon Sorry, badgering me won’t work. What you should have said is, It’s pointless to keep this a secret because Penny will tell us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard Fine, then that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon All right, I’ll tell you. My goodness, everyone’s on their game today.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 amy This is really fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 raj Yeah, it’s nice to get dressed up once in a while.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny Yeah, and the hors d’oeuvres are delightful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard As is the company.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny Aw.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon My shirt is itchy and I wish I were dead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard Hey, uh, listen, everybody. Before Howard gets here, et’s all just agree to not bring up the letter from his father.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 raj Of course.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 amy Absolutely.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon If I say yes, can we turn off that Latin orgy music?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard Ridiculous that we still have to walk up all these flights of stairs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette Yeah, try doing it in heels.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard I am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette Wait. There’s something I have to tell you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette I know what was in your dad’s letter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard Sheldon, I swear to God, I’m gonna kill you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 amy Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette I made him tell us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard What? Us? Who else knows?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 amy Me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard Same here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 raj Shame on all of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard You know, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 raj Couldn’t leave him one friend, could you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard So everybody knows what’s in that letter except for me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon Yes, it’s six against one. Stand down, sir.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard How could you do this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette I’m sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 raj If you want, we could tell you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard No, I don’t want to know. I mean, I do, but… I got to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 amy Use me as a human shield!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon I panicked. He looked taller than usual.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette Howard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard In here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette I’m sorry. I should have left it alone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard It’s okay. Sorry I ran off like that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette What are you looking at?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard Uh, pictures of my dad and me when I was a kid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette That’s nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard I got to tell you, as angry as I am at Sheldon for blabbing, he did a hell of a job organizing this closet. Look at this. Photos of Wolowitz family before father left forever. Check out nine-year-old Howie with cornrows. Neither race was happy to see me with those.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette Think you could take a break?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette Got a little surprise for you. Come on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard Oh, honey, I am in no mood to have sex tonight. I’ll lay there if you absolutely have to have it, but… Oh. What are you guys doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard When you left, you weren’t sure whether or not you wanted to know what was in your dad’s letter, so we came up with kind of a cool solution.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard Oh, yeah, what’s that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon It’s simple, really. It occurred to me that knowing and not knowing can be achieved by creating a macroscopic example of quantum superposition. The, the principle that a physical system exists partially in all its possible states at once.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny We were all thinking it, really. It was kind of the elephant in the room, so…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon Anyway, um, I realized that if we each present you with an account of what your father wrote to you, only one of which is true, and then we don’t tell you which one it is, you will forever be in a state of epistemic ambivalence.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny Yeah. And I said if it wasn’t epistemic, we might as well not do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette Sit down, honey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard Raj, you’re up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 raj Okay, um, It was a card for your 18th birthday. Inside it said, Happy birthday, Howard. I love you. Dad. Oh, and it was a Far Side card, the one where the frog has its tongue stuck to the underside of an airplane. Thinks it’s a fly. Silly frog. So funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon It was a map leading to the lost treasure of famous pirate One-Eyed Willy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard Nice try. That’s the plot for Goonies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 amy Told you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon Don’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 amy You didn’t know it, but your father was in the auditorium at your high school graduation. And he cried because he was so proud of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon Or that’s complete poppycock which Amy made up. It still could be the map.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny It was a letter explaining that your dad wasn’t who he said he was. Eventually, his other life caught up to him, and the only way to keep you and your mom safe was to leave.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon I would like to change mine. The pirate’s name was Peg-Leg Antoine. Now it’s completely different from Goonies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 amy No, it’s not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon Don’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard Okay, my turn. Your dad wrote about how family is the most important thing, and that you should never throw it away like he did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard Hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard Bernadette.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette Inside the envelope was a picture of your dad holding you the day you were born. On the back he wrote Howard, my son, my greatest gift. You okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard Yeah. I’m terrific.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard So, which one do you think it is, matey?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard Actually, I don’t want to know. I want all of them to be true.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard Well, one of them is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard That’s pretty cool. Thank you, guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny Hey, it’s still early. Why don’t we go back and have that party?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 raj Yeah,
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard Yeah, cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 amy Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon You know, surprisingly, uh, the letter from your father wasn’t the most interesting thing I read in the closet. Bernadette’s diary has some saucy passages.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette Sheldon, don’t you dare.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon There’s nothing to worry about. Your secret’s safe with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette That’s more like it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon Although copyright law would allow me to quote snippets in the context of a review.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette Glad you’re feeling better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard Me, too. If I’d known we were gonna be dancing, would have worn my flats.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny This turned out pretty well, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard Yeah, I think so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 raj I agree. That is, if you’ve never been to or heard of a party before.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 amy If you’d let me pierce your brain with a hot needle in the right place, you’d be happy all the time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon Uh, Penny, I, I have a couple of questions about your closet. Is there any reason you’re keeping this dead goldfish?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny Damn, I forgot to feed him. And that I had him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon Well, now, did you also have a dog? Because I found what appears to be a battery-operated chew toy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny Party’s over! Party’s over!
