TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski What you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard_wolowitz You said clean up. I’m cleaning up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski You can’t just throw everything in the closet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Hey, you can tell me what to do or you can tell me how to do it, but you can’t do both. This isn’t sex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski What if someone looks in there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard_wolowitz They’re just coming over for dinner. No one’s gonna look in the closet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski Well, you don’t know that. What if someone’s looking for the bathroom and they open that door?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Could work out. For all we know there’s a toilet in there somewhere.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski Fine. But after tonight we need to get a handle on this mess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard_wolowitz You know what we should do? We should show the closet to Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Are you kidding? He’s like a savant at organizing. Everything in his apartment has a label on it. Including his label maker, which has a label that says label maker. And if you look really close at that label maker label, you’ll see a label that says label.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski He’s our guest, we can’t just ask him to straighten our closet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard_wolowitz No, we wouldn’t ask him. We’d just show him the closet and let the goblins in his head take it from there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Hey, guys, come on in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 all@ Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny Ooh, it smells good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski Thanks. And, Sheldon, I know tonight’s the night you eat Thai food, so I went to the Asian market, got all the ingredients and made it from scratch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Oh, you shouldn’t have.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, it’s my pleasure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon_cooper No, you really shouldn’t have. I brought my own.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski You stopped and got him takeout?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter I had no choice. He kept kicking the back of my seat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski Sheldon, I’ve been cooking all day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Well, now don’t you feel silly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski Show him the closet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 raj_koothrappali These spring rolls are amazing. Good job, Bernadette.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski That’s the takeout that Sheldon brought.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 raj_koothrappali Oh, well, I’m sure they wouldn’t have tasted nearly as good if I hadn’t tried your food first.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Howard, did you want your clothes arranged seasonally or by colour?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Colour’s fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Wrong, they’ll be arranged seasonally.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny Sheldon, aren’t you gonna spend a little time with Amy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, it’s okay, I’m used to it. The other day at Whole Foods, he spent an hour optimizing the cheese aisle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Yeah, and some thanks I got. The assistant manager chased me out with an artisanal salami.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler His quirks just make you love him more. Someone please agree with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, come on. It’s getting late. Time to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Oh, five more minutes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter That’s what you said five minutes ago. Amy and Penny are already in the car. Let’s move it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon_cooper How come I never get to do anything I want to do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard_wolowitz You know, if he really wants to stay and finish, I can give him a ride home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Please, Leonard, he said it’s okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, it’s, wait, I can go home without you? Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Howard, I have a few questions. I found three bowling pins. Now, do you juggle these, or are you missing seven?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Juggle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon_cooper You health nuts kill me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, my God, it’s beautiful. Look, he found the juggling pins I hid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Uh, just a couple more items. Howard, I found this letter from your dad in a box. Now, based on the content, it could either be filed…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Whoa, you opened this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Well, I had to find out if it was personal correspondence or memorabilia. Now, as I was saying, based on the content…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard_wolowitz I couldn’t be less interested. Now, come on, I’ll take you home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski Howard, don’t you want to know what’s in the letter?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard_wolowitz If I wanted to know, I would’ve opened it years ago. The closet looks great. Let’s get out of here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Wait, can I bring this box of extra shirt buttons to sort on the ride?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Do whatever you want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Thanks. Oh. Great party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter You know, when I first met Howard, he would pull his scrotum out of his shorts and say, aw, I sat in gum.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny What is your point?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Well, it’s just kind of weird how grown up he is now. Happily married guy throwing dinner parties.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny Really? You couldn’t just say that? You had to tell the scrotum story?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Trying to paint a picture.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny It was a nice change of pace not eating takeout around a coffee table.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Mm, you know, we could throw a dinner party, too. Maybe even ask everyone to get dressed up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny Sure. Just, when you say dressed up, you mean nice clothes, right? Not, like, capes and tights and crap?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Yeah. Although…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski Howie, you okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Yeah, I just couldn’t sleep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski Told you you shouldn’t have espresso after dinner. I know the little cups make you feel big, but it’s not worth it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard_wolowitz It’s this stupid letter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski Did you read it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard_wolowitz No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski You must be curious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Of course I’m curious. I haven’t seen the man since, oh, I was a little kid. And a letter shows up on my 18th birthday? What’s that about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski Why don’t you read it? Maybe he apologizes or explains why he left.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard_wolowitz He abandoned me and my mother. Why does he deserve a chance to explain anything?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski I get that. So, what do you want to do with it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Something I should have done a long time ago.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski Really? Are you sure?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Yep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski Feel better?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard_wolowitz I do. Great. Neither one of us is tall enough to reach that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler I can’t believe he set it on fire.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, just seeing that letter really freaked him out. And he was already having a tough day ’cause he accidentally wore my pants to work. I don’t know why he was upset. They were bigger on him than me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler Boy, I’m really curious what was in that letter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski Me, too, but I guess now we’ll never know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler Well, you said Sheldon read it. Why not ask him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski I can’t do that. What kind of wife would I be if I didn’t respect my husband’s privacy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny What if I ask Sheldon, you just happen to be in the room?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski That works.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Bleuch. Like cleaning out the entire building’s belly button.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny Hey, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Oh, hello. What can I do for you ladies?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler You have something we want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Oh, dear. My mother warned me this is what happens to pretty boys in the big city.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny No, we just want information.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Oh. Oh, I’ve got that in spades. Ravage me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny We heard you read the letter from Howard’s father.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon_cooper I did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny What did it say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon_cooper I can’t tell you that. I’m bound by closet organizer/organizee confidentiality.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, that’s not a real thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Well, neither is the rule that you have to hold your girlfriend’s hand at the movies. You know. That doesn’t stop you from pawing at me like you’re a bear and I’m a trash can full of sweets.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny Why do you even care? Just tell us what it says.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Control over the information contained in that letter belongs to Howard. By happenstance, I came to know it. That doesn’t give me the right to disseminate it freely.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny Come on. Look, the letter was found in Bernadette’s closet. Doesn’t that count for something?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Are you pointing out that California is a community property state, and since Howard and Bernadette are married, the intellectual property contained in that letter is jointly owned by the two spouses?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny Yeah, obviously.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Well played. Sometimes I don’t give you enough credit, Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 raj_koothrappali Dude, you made the right choice coming to me for help with this party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Actually, all I did was invite you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 raj_koothrappali Well, put your mind at ease. I’m here to make sure your dinner party kicks Howard’s dinner party’s ass. Now, the first thing we need is a theme. I’m thinking, ah, turn-of-the-century Moulin Rouge.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter I’m thinking you need a testosterone patch. Penny and I just want to do something low-key. You know, cocktails, light jazz music, hors d’oeuvres.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 raj_koothrappali So your theme is I saw a rerun of Mad Men and bought some crab puffs from Trader Joe’s? Hate to miss that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Hey, where have you been?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Oh, Leonard. If I was prone to sarcasm, I’d say I was pulling off a major heist at the museum of laundry baskets.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. I meant, golly, Sheldon, you’ve been gone a long time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Oh. Yeah, well, I was waylaid by Penny, Bernadette and Amy. They made me reveal confidential information about Howard’s father.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter What information?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon_cooper I can’t tell you that. I am bound by closet organizer/organizee confidentiality.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 raj_koothrappali Well, come on, we won’t tell anyone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Sorry, badgering me won’t work. What you should have said is, It’s pointless to keep this a secret because Penny will tell us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Fine, then that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon_cooper All right, I’ll tell you. My goodness, everyone’s on their game today.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler This is really fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 raj_koothrappali Yeah, it’s nice to get dressed up once in a while.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny Yeah, and the hors d’oeuvres are delightful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter As is the company.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny Aw.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon_cooper My shirt is itchy and I wish I were dead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Hey, uh, listen, everybody. Before Howard gets here, et’s all just agree to not bring up the letter from his father.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 raj_koothrappali Of course.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler Absolutely.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon_cooper If I say yes, can we turn off that Latin orgy music?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Ridiculous that we still have to walk up all these flights of stairs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, try doing it in heels.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard_wolowitz I am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski Wait. There’s something I have to tell you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard_wolowitz What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski I know what was in your dad’s letter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Sheldon, I swear to God, I’m gonna kill you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski I made him tell us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard_wolowitz What? Us? Who else knows?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler Me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Same here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 raj_koothrappali Shame on all of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter You know, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 raj_koothrappali Couldn’t leave him one friend, could you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard_wolowitz So everybody knows what’s in that letter except for me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Yes, it’s six against one. Stand down, sir.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard_wolowitz How could you do this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski I’m sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 raj_koothrappali If you want, we could tell you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard_wolowitz No, I don’t want to know. I mean, I do, but… I got to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler Use me as a human shield!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon_cooper I panicked. He looked taller than usual.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski Howard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard_wolowitz In here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski I’m sorry. I should have left it alone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard_wolowitz It’s okay. Sorry I ran off like that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski What are you looking at?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Uh, pictures of my dad and me when I was a kid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski That’s nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard_wolowitz I got to tell you, as angry as I am at Sheldon for blabbing, he did a hell of a job organizing this closet. Look at this. Photos of Wolowitz family before father left forever. Check out nine-year-old Howie with cornrows. Neither race was happy to see me with those.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski Think you could take a break?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski Got a little surprise for you. Come on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Oh, honey, I am in no mood to have sex tonight. I’ll lay there if you absolutely have to have it, but… Oh. What are you guys doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter When you left, you weren’t sure whether or not you wanted to know what was in your dad’s letter, so we came up with kind of a cool solution.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Oh, yeah, what’s that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon_cooper It’s simple, really. It occurred to me that knowing and not knowing can be achieved by creating a macroscopic example of quantum superposition. The, the principle that a physical system exists partially in all its possible states at once.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny We were all thinking it, really. It was kind of the elephant in the room, so…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Anyway, um, I realized that if we each present you with an account of what your father wrote to you, only one of which is true, and then we don’t tell you which one it is, you will forever be in a state of epistemic ambivalence.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny Yeah. And I said if it wasn’t epistemic, we might as well not do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski Sit down, honey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Raj, you’re up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 raj_koothrappali Okay, um, It was a card for your 18th birthday. Inside it said, Happy birthday, Howard. I love you. Dad. Oh, and it was a Far Side card, the one where the frog has its tongue stuck to the underside of an airplane. Thinks it’s a fly. Silly frog. So funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon_cooper It was a map leading to the lost treasure of famous pirate One-Eyed Willy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Nice try. That’s the plot for Goonies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler Told you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Don’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler You didn’t know it, but your father was in the auditorium at your high school graduation. And he cried because he was so proud of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Or that’s complete poppycock which Amy made up. It still could be the map.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny It was a letter explaining that your dad wasn’t who he said he was. Eventually, his other life caught up to him, and the only way to keep you and your mom safe was to leave.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon_cooper I would like to change mine. The pirate’s name was Peg-Leg Antoine. Now it’s completely different from Goonies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler No, it’s not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Don’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Okay, my turn. Your dad wrote about how family is the most important thing, and that you should never throw it away like he did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Bernadette.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski Inside the envelope was a picture of your dad holding you the day you were born. On the back he wrote Howard, my son, my greatest gift. You okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Yeah. I’m terrific.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter So, which one do you think it is, matey?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Actually, I don’t want to know. I want all of them to be true.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Well, one of them is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard_wolowitz That’s pretty cool. Thank you, guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny Hey, it’s still early. Why don’t we go back and have that party?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 raj_koothrappali Yeah,
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon_cooper You know, surprisingly, uh, the letter from your father wasn’t the most interesting thing I read in the closet. Bernadette’s diary has some saucy passages.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski Sheldon, don’t you dare.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon_cooper There’s nothing to worry about. Your secret’s safe with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski That’s more like it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Although copyright law would allow me to quote snippets in the context of a review.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski Glad you’re feeling better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Me, too. If I’d known we were gonna be dancing, would have worn my flats.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny This turned out pretty well, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I think so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 raj_koothrappali I agree. That is, if you’ve never been to or heard of a party before.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler If you’d let me pierce your brain with a hot needle in the right place, you’d be happy all the time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Uh, Penny, I, I have a couple of questions about your closet. Is there any reason you’re keeping this dead goldfish?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny Damn, I forgot to feed him. And that I had him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Well, now, did you also have a dog? Because I found what appears to be a battery-operated chew toy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode19 penny Party’s over! Party’s over!
