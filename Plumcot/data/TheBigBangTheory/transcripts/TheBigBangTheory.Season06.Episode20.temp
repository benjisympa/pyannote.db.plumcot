TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 leonard I was reading about this jellyfish that never dies. Instead, it reverts to its asexual state and then grows up again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 howard We thought my 90-year-old grandfather had reverted to an asexual state, but the lawsuit from his Jamaican caregiver proved us all wrong.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 leonard My point is, immortality is not only a possibility, it is real.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 raj Only if you’re this jellyfish which periodically reverts to a mass of undifferentiated protoplasm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon If I could keep my Gmail account, I’d be okay with that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 barry – Hewwo, fewwas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 all Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 barry Wemember when we were twying to figuwe out what that smell coming fwom Pwofessor Tupperman’s office was?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 howard Yeah?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 barry Turns out it was Tupperman. Dead at his desk for two weeks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 howard That’s terrible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 leonard Oh, my God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 barry In wieu of fwowers, the department chair is asking that evewyone donate a bottle of Febweze.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon If we’re going to change the topic from jellyfish, I’d be okay with brine shrimp or the history of the unicycle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 howard Show a little compassion, a man died.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 barry And turned into a puddew of goo. Now, we can either sit awound and cwy over spilt pwofessor, or we can wejoice in the knowwedge that a tenured position has just opened up. I choose to do the watter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon Excuse me, the whole tenure system is ridiculous. A guaranteed job for life only encourages the faculty to become complacent. If we really want science to advance, people should have chips implanted in their skulls that explode when they say something stupid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 raj Well, I believe people do their best work when they feel safe and secure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon Pchew!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 barry If you need my nose, you’ll find it firmwy wodged up the qectum of the tenure committee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 howard You Ph.D’s gonna go suck up like Kripke?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 leonard No. I mean, I’ll apply, but I’m not gonna stoop to playing politics.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 raj Yeah, me neither. It should be about the work. And if I can’t get tenure, I’d like to see you or Sheldon get it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon Raj, don’t dangle false hope in front of Leonard like that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 leonard Excuse me, but I think I’m just as qualified as you are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon Pchew! Pchew! Pchew! Pchew!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 penny So tenured means a job for life?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 leonard Yup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 penny You can’t get fired even if you’re bad at it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 leonard Mm, not really.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 penny Wow, sounds a lot like being a pretty waitress at the Cheesecake Factory.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon While I disagree with the premise of tenure, if they gave it to me, it wouldn’t diminish my output. You know, I’m like the sun. Can’t turn this off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 amy Are Rajesh and Leonard competing for it as well?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon Mm-hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 amy Do they know they don’t stand a chance ’cause you’re so great?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon Well put. You know, I must say I go back and forth on this boyfriend-girlfriend thing, but those moments when you worship me really keep you in the running.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 raj It would be nice to have the increased income. Stop taking money from my parents.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 howard Money from family does come with strings attached.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 raj You have no idea. They buy me a new BMW for my birthday but can I get seat warmers? No. Rajesh, if you want a warm butt, you’re gonna have to pay for it yourself. Well, maybe I will, old man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 bernadette I think that’s enough wine for now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 leonard I just keep thinking about how cool it would be if I called my mom and told her that I got tenure at Caltech.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 penny She’d be proud, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 leonard Oh, very. Assuming she takes my call.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon My primary concern with being granted tenure is living with an insanely jealous roommate after the fact. I might need to sleep with a gun under my pillow. Or a chainsaw.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 amy Or you take advantage of your newfound economic stability and move out, buy a house, get married. start a family.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon Or, the chainsaw.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 raj And I will return to New Delhi in triumph atop a bejeweled white elephant. And you know what will be on that elephant’s back? A seat warmer. No, Father, you may not have a ride.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 bernadette I’m gonna make some coffee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 penny So, who do you have to schmooze to get this deal?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 leonard I’m not gonna schmooze anybody. I’m gonna let my work speak for itself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 penny That’s great. That shows a lot of integrity.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 leonard Thank you. I’m a naive idiot, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 penny Oh, good, you heard me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 amy You know, if you really want tenure, maybe you should cozy up to the people making the decision.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon Sheldon Cooper does not do cozy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 amy You don’t say.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon But I suppose it wouldn’t hurt to know who’s on the committee. Let’s see. Oh, Janine Davis. Oh, dear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 amy Is that a problem?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon Well…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon Even you. You’re a slave.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 janine I’m a what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon I’m not sure, it could go either way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 leonard Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey. Mrs. Davis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 janine Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 leonard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 janine Dr. Hofstadter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 leonard Yeah. Just thought I’d come down and start getting ready for swimsuit season.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 janine Good for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 leonard Not that you need it. I bet you look great in a swimsuit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 janine Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 leonard I’ve got what my father used to call furniture disease. My chest is falling into my drawers. I’m not, uh, familiar with this model. How do I make it start?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 janine You push start.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 leonard Right. This one might be broken.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 janine You have to move.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 leonard Got it. Oh. There. Oh, yeah. Yeah, now I’m feeling it. Oh, this is great. I could do this for the rest of my life. Hey, speaking, speaking of things you do for the rest of your life, uh, did I read that you’re on that-that tenure committee?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 janine Yep. I got to get a home gym.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 leonard Well, I’m sure you have a lot of good applicants, I just wanted to say hi and let you know that I’ll be throwing my hat in the ring.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 janine All right, I’ll keep an eye out for that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 leonard Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 barry Hey, Hofstadter. Funny seeing you here for the first time in… ever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 leonard Go away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 barry Janine the Machine, wet’s do this!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 janine Hey, Barry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 leonard Well, look at that. Burned a whole calorie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 barry I guess you got here ewwy to burn off that banana bwead I baked you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 janine Yeah, it was delicious. Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 barry No, my pweasure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 leonard Oh, if you, if you like banana bread, I’ve got a-a great recipe. The trick is in, in fresh ground, I’ll e-mail it to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 barry Aw wight, I’m warm. Weady to kick it up a notch?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 janine Let’s go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 leonard That’s enough cardio for me. I’m just gonna stretch out before I hit the weights.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 janine You okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 leonard Call someone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 raj Good day, Mrs. Davis. This is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali from the astrophysics department. Don’t be alarmed, I’m not really in space. Anyhoo, I’d like to take this opportunity to tell you about myself, so sit back, relax and enjoy the following 90-minute video.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 janine Oh, come on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 raj Born in New Delhi, the third son of an itinerant gynecologist, I showed early signs of genius. At the age of five I discovered a celestial object which later turned out to be the moon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 shelldon Mrs Davis? Mrs Davis? Mrs Davis?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 janine God, they’re everywhere. Come in. Dr. Cooper, how can I help you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon Yes, hello. I’m fine. Um, I understand you may have a bad impression of me, so I bought you a gift.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 janine Uh, Dr. Cooper, that’s not necessary.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon It’s too late. Get ready to like me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 janine Roots?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon The tragic history of slavery in America. Fun for the whole family.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 janine Why would you think this is an appropriate gift?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon Um… Well… You are black, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 janine This meeting has come to an end.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon Because you want to start watching it right now. Copy that. Let’s see. Up next on the tenure committee is Professor Wu. Well, get ready for the complete works of Jackie Chan.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 leonard Gentlemen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 raj Where have you been?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 leonard Nurse’s office.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 howard Asthma attack?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 leonard Asthma, heart, some kind of attack. I’m fine, though.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 howard You guys going to Professor Tupperman’s memorial?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 raj I don’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 leonard Probably not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon Barely knew him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 howard Yeah, you wouldn’t want to look like you guys are brown-nosing the tenure committee, who will all be there. Oh, yeah, that’s what I was hoping for, meerkats.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon I won’t be able to make our date night this Thursday, so, bad news for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 amy Well you better have a good excuse this time, because trimming Q-tips to fit your ears right is obvious nonsense.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon First of all, when you say things like that, people think you’re crazy. Second, the reason I’m cancelling is because I have to attend a memorial service for Professor Tupperman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 amy It sounds like a long and tedious evening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon Eh, it will be. Honestly, if I must endure a long and tedious evening, I’d rather it be with you on date night. But I have no choice. The tenure committee’s going to be there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 amy Oh. Well, in that case, perhaps I should come along.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon Well, now that I think about it, that would be most helpful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 amy Of course it would. I’m well-versed in academic politics, and as a respected scientist, I can only raise your stock as a candidate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon Actually, I meant you could drive me. But if it makes you happy, that other stuff, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 leonard Do anything interesting today?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 penny Oh, not really. I was out shopping with Amy. She wanted me to help her find something for this memorial thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 leonard Wait, Sheldon’s going to be there? We all promised we weren’t going to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 penny Oh, what a jerk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 leonard I know. I was hoping to go without anyone finding out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 penny Well, since Amy’s going, do you want me there? You know, to support you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 leonard Oh, that’s nice, but it-it’s just gonna be a room full of boring old men and I’m not sure how much help you’d be.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 penny Okay. I’m just gonna tie my shoe while you think about that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 leonard Oh, yeah. No. Thanks, that would be great help. You realize you might kill some of them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 penny Oh, then you all can get tenure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 raj Come on, Daddy. All the other scientists have seat warmers. This is so humiliating. I’ve got to get tenure. Okay, let’s meet halfway. How about I cut my cleaning lady down to twice a week? Looks like we’re both going to be living like animals.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 amy Let’s go over our emotional responses one last time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 amy Professor Tupperman is dead, and that makes us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon Sad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 amy The fact that there are so many people here tonight doesn’t make us cranky and claustrophobic. It makes us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon Glad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 amy Giving Mrs. Davis the box set of Roots was?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon Bad. However…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 amy No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon Fine. Bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 raj Unbelievable. You have some nerve showing up here just to schmooze with the tenure committee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon You’re here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 raj Excuse me. I’m here to pay my respects to Professor Tupperware, or whatever his name is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon So am I. His passing makes me feel bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 leonard Well, well, well, Sheldon, fancy meeting you here. I guess the train store in Glendale wasn’t having a cotillion after all. And you, you said you weren’t coming here, either.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 raj I have a thick accent. You don’t know what I said.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 amy I’d like to know why Penny’s here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 penny I’m here to support my man, just like you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon What are you going to do? Take people’s drink orders and get them wrong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 leonard Do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon What? Did she do it yet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 amy She plans on flirting with members of the tenure committee to further Leonard’s cause.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon Well, that’s a fine how-do-you-do. Don’t just stand there. Take your breasts out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 howard Ooh, meerkat fight!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 amy You’re all wasting your time. Sheldon is the most qualified for the job, and no amount of gravity-defying bosom’s going to change that. Seriously, is that tape? Like, how are they staying up like that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 leonard Way to hit ’em with both barrels.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 raj You two should be ashamed of yourselves. Using women to advance your cause with sexuality, and whatever Amy plans on doing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon Are you implying that my girlfriend has no sexuality to exploit?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 raj Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon Okay, because that was not clear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 amy Sheldon!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon What? That was ambiguous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 raj Well, now it’s biguous. What are you gonna do about it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon Um…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 howard You could talk some smack about his mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon Well, yes, of course, he wouldn’t like that at all. Last night, I was feeling in need of sexual release when I happened to come across your mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 leonard Okay, okay. Guys, what are we doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon I don’t know what you’re doing, but I was about to insinuate that I had coitus with Raj’s mother for a dollar.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 leonard Oh, you do what you want, but I don’t want to lose my friends over tenure. Friends are forever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 howard So is tenure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 bernadette Walk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 leonard I’m just gonna go home and let my work speak for itself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 raj You’re right. This is beneath me. Lie your mother was last night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 leonard How about it, Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon What do you think I should do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 amy Well, you’ll always be an academic success, but I seriously question whether you’ll make any more friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon I don’t want any more, but let’s go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 barry Are you kidding? I would wove to baby-sit for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 janine I could not ask you to do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 barry Nonsense. Childwen wove me. Something about me just makes them waugh and waugh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 leonard No. We cannot lose to that jerk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 raj Yeah, screw it. I’m going in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon Wait. Hold on. I believe screw it, I’m going in is what I said to your mother last night. Don’t worry, I didn’t really say that. I find the concept of coitus ridiculous and off-putting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 amy Should have taken my breasts out while I had the chance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon Mrs Davis? Mrs Davis? Mrs Davis? I know you’re in there. I saw your car in the parking lot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 janine What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon I just found out that you recommended myself, Dr. Hofstadter and Dr. Koothrappali to be on the short list for tenure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 janine Well, despite your quirks, the three of you are very accomplished in your respective fields.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon I don’t know what you mean by quirks, but, um, I do want to express my gratitude.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 janine You didn’t bring another gift, did you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon No, no. No, I learned my lesson. I understand that was inappropriate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 janine Good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon Anyway, thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 janine You’re welcome. I’m gonna pretend that didn’t happen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode20 sheldon Yeah, right on, sister.
