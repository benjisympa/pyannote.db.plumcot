TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter The interface is pretty simple. You put your horizontal X coordinate here, vertical Y coordinate here. When you’re happy with those, you press this button.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 penny Got it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Leonard, you’ll never guess who I just found online. Hey!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Nice shot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 penny Eh, his giant head did most of the work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Very mature. You’re lucky I’m out of silly string. As I was saying, Leonard, you’ll never guess who I just found online. Professor Proton.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter You’re kidding. He’s still alive?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 penny Who’s Professor Proton?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter He was the host of this great… Hey!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 penny Yes! Sorry, tell me about Professor Proton.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Professor Proton hosted my favourite science show when I was a child. I never missed an episode. He demonstrated scientific principles using everyday objects.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter It was pretty cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 penny Aw, so cute when you use the word cool wrong. Like when kids say pasghetti.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Oh, dear lord, Leonard, look. He’s still available for parties and events. We should hire him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Hire him to do what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Well, whatever we want. Hang out, do experiments, make him take 12 pictures with us so we can make a calendar.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter It would be pretty awesome to hang out with him. I just used awesome wrong, didn’t I?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Well, I’m e-mailing him right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Do you remember his old theme song?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Of course I do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 together#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 Grab your goggles, put your lab coat on, here he comes, Professor Proton.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 raj_koothrappali Hey, I just found out I have to be at the telescope lab all weekend. Any chance you and Bernadette could take care of my dog?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 howard_wolowitz Why don’t you put her in a kennel?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 raj_koothrappali Why don’t you put your mother in a home?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 howard_wolowitz To be honest, she’d do better in the kennel. I’ll talk to Bernie. I’m sure it’s fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 raj_koothrappali Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper It’s happening. Leonard, it’s happening. Professor Proton is coming to our house.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter You’re kidding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 howard_wolowitz You mean the guy who used to host that lame kids show?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper And you just got yourself uninvited. See? I told you I’d find a tactful way to do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 howard_wolowitz How’d you get him to come to your house?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper As Professor Proton always says, there is no problem you can’t solve if you use your noggin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter And he wrote him a cheque.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Yeah, that, too. Big cheque.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 raj_koothrappali Uncle Howard. Cinnamon’s here for her sleepover party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 howard_wolowitz You know if you had a stroke, she’d eat you, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 raj_koothrappali And it would be my pleasure to be her num-num.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 howard_wolowitz Okay, so what do I need to know to take care of her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 raj_koothrappali It’s very simple. For breakfast, she has an egg-white frittata. Feel free to give her a choice of home fries or an English muffin, but not both. We’re watching our weight. Uh, for dinner, something simple, a veal chop, some scampi, whatever you like.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 howard_wolowitz Classy dog.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 raj_koothrappali Yes. Also, don’t forget to close the toilet or she’ll drink out of it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 howard_wolowitz I feel for ya. I’ve got a psychotic mommy, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Leonard, are you in bed?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper I can’t sleep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Well, I can, so shut up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Do you realize that in less than nine hours, Arthur Jeffries, aka Professor Proton, will be in our apartment?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, you know that if you stay up all night, you’re gonna be sleepy tomorrow. And a sleepy Sheldon is a cranky Sheldon. And a cranky Sheldon is actually no different than a regular Sheldon. Good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper I’m thinking of wearing a tuxedo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter That’s not ridiculous. Good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Do you have cufflinks?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Ah, just as well. Where can you rent a tuxedo at three o’clock in the morning?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Okay, good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Prof… Ow! Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper I still can’t sleep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 howard_wolowitz She really tuckered herself out at the park, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, you two were so cute playing together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 howard_wolowitz It was kind of fun throwing a ball and not having anyone laugh at me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 bernadette_rostenkowski And you were sweet not to throw it too far so she didn’t wear out her tiny legs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 howard_wolowitz Yeah, that’s what I was doing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 bernadette_rostenkowski You know, there were a few moments today when I almost felt like we were a little family.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 howard_wolowitz Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah. I never thought of myself as a mom, but when the three of us were out there having fun, I felt like maybe someday we could do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 howard_wolowitz Of course we can. Especially if our baby’s as calm and quiet as little Cinna… Son of a bitch, she’s gone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 bernadette_rostenkowski Where’d she go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 howard_wolowitz I don’t know, she didn’t leave a note.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 bernadette_rostenkowski Well, you were the one who was supposed to put her back in the stroller.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 howard_wolowitz No, I wasn’t. You were.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 bernadette_rostenkowski No, I wasn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 howard_wolowitz Yes, you were!.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, well, you throw like a girl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper I’m getting worried.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 penny Relax, Sheldon, he’s only a few minutes late.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Professor Proton was never late when he was on TV. You know, every day, four o’clock, he was there. Unless tornadoes were ripping apart East Texas, in which case we’d join him in progress. It’s him. Hello. Well, I see. Yes. All right, we can come get you. Yeah, well, see you soon. Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Where is he?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper The third floor landing. The poor old guy’s been walking up the stairs for half an hour. It’s really you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Mr. Jeffries, I am so sorry. We should’ve told you about the broken elevator.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 arthur_jeffries I agree.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Professor Proton, it’s an honour to meet you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 arthur_jeffries Just, just call me Arthur.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Leonard, you hear that? Professor Proton said I should call him Arthur. That means we’re friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 arthur_jeffries No. A friend would’ve, would’ve told me about the elevator.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Look at me. I can get as close to you as I want without my mom saying it’s going to ruin my eyes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 arthur_jeffries Is, uh, is he dangerous?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Actually, he’s a genius.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper I am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 arthur_jeffries That doesn’t answer my question.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Mr. Jeffries, I’m, I’m Leonard. This is my girlfriend, Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 arthur_jeffries Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 penny Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 arthur_jeffries Well, I hope I haven’t, uh, kept the kids waiting too long for, for the show.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Oh, no, there are no kids. No, the, the show’s for me. Come on. I’ll race ya, Arthur.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 arthur_jeffries Is the, is the blonde girl really your, your girlfriend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Yes, sir.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 arthur_jeffries You’re the genius.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 penny So, do you do a lot of appearances like this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 arthur_jeffries It, it’s hard to say. I’m, I’m still trying to figure out what, what th, what this is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter We just wanted to hang out with you and maybe learn a little about your life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 arthur_jeffries Well, there, there really isn’t too much to tell. After the TV show was, was cancelled, nobody in the scientific world would, uh, would take me seriously. So I was forced to do these, uh, children’s parties to, to make a living.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter That’s too bad. But still, working with kids, it must be rewarding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 arthur_jeffries You, you get bit a lot. Let me see if, if I have this straight. You, you two are, are physicists, and you, and you want me to do a children’s science show?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Yes. And if there’s time, take 12 pictures with us in seasonal clothing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 arthur_jeffries You know, I’m a real scientist. I, I have a PhD from Cornell University.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Yeah, that’s great. Did you bring your puppet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 arthur_jeffries No, no. I, I hate that puppet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Oh, no. How could anybody hate Gino the Neutrino? It’s nice, huh? I got him for 20 bucks on eBay. Including the shipping!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 arthur_jeffries I’m, I’m awake, right? Th, this is happening?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 bernadette_rostenkowski Cinnamon!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 howard_wolowitz Cinnamon!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 bernadette_rostenkowski You know, maybe she doesn’t recognize her name because of Raj’s accent.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 howard_wolowitz Good thinking. Cinnamon, come to Daddy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 bernadette_rostenkowski Cinnamon. Where are you, my little lamb chop?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 howard_wolowitz Nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 bernadette_rostenkowski Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 howard_wolowitz When this all blows over, remember that voice. It’s kind of a turn-on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 bernadette_rostenkowski It turns you on when I sound like Raj?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 howard_wolowitz Cinnamon!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 arthur_jeffries Okay, as, as I put the egg on top, and, and the flame goes out and, and, and the air pressure decreases in, in the flask, what do you think will happen?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 penny I think I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper It’s gonna get sucked in. It’s going to get sucked in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 penny Okay, I didn’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 penny See, I’m not a scientist like them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 arthur_jeffries I, I figured that out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Potato clock. Do potato clock.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 penny What’s that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 arthur_jeffries I, I power a clock with a, with a potato.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 penny Shut up. You can do that? I mean, wouldn’t that solve the world’s energy crisis?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 arthur_jeffries No. Look, guys, keep your money. I, I think, uh, I, I think I’m done.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper What, well what’s wrong? Is she upsetting you? Because I can make her go away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 arthur_jeffries No, she, she’s the only reason I’ve, I’ve stayed this long.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter Then what is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 arthur_jeffries I don’t know. I think I’m just, I, I just, I just don’t want to be Professor Proton any more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Well, how can you say that? Professor Proton’s the best.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 arthur_jeffries What, what has it ever gotten me? I mean, I’m, I’m an 83-year-old man who has potatoes in, in his suitcase. Other scientists think, think I’m a joke. And the, the puppeteer who did, who did Gino, well, he also did my wife.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Mr. Jeffries, I need to show you something.:14:11,446
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 penny I’m sorry to hear about your troubles.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 arthur_jeffries Uh, thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 penny But if you don’t mind me asking, uh, the potato clock, how does it work? Is it a trick clock or a trick potato?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 arthur_jeffries What do you two talk about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper I wrote a fan letter to you when I was a child in Texas, and you sent this autographed picture back to me. Do you remember that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 arthur_jeffries I’ll, I’ll give you a hint. I have a bracelet with my own address on it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Well, anyway, um, you may find this hard to believe, but I didn’t have any friends growing up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 arthur_jeffries No, I, I get that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper But, um, I did have you. And every day at four o’clock, you’d come to my house on Channel 68, and we’d do science together. If it hadn’t been for you, well, who knows what would’ve become of me? You know? Instead of a world-class physicist, I could’ve wound up as a hobo. Or a surgeon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter I bet there are important discoveries being made every day because you inspired millions of kids to pursue science. In a way, their discoveries are your discoveries.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Yeah, it’s true. A generation of young scientists are standing on your shoulders.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 arthur_jeffries Well, thank, thank you, guys. That, that, that means a lot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter It’s important you know how much you mean to us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 arthur_jeffries Uh-oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 penny Arthur, are you okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 arthur_jeffries I’m having a problem with my pacemaker.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter I’ll, I’ll call for help.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 penny Any chance we could plug it into the potato?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 arthur_jeffries No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 raj_koothrappali Hello? What do you mean, you found my dog? She’s with my friends. Is she okay? Oh, thank you. Uh, just text me your address, I’m on my way. Oh, and if she’s hungry, go ahead and feed her. But do not give her anything starchy. She’s having risotto for dinner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 paramedic Your vitals are stable, but let’s take you in for some tests just to be safe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter You want one of us to go with you in the ambulance?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper I’ll do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 arthur_jeffries He’s not a relative, he’s not allowed, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 paramedic No, that’s not a rule. He can go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Oh, yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 arthur_jeffries I can’t catch a break today.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 penny We’ll pack up your stuff and meet you at the hospital.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 leonard_hofstadter I’m sorry things turned out this way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 arthur_jeffries Well, at, at this point, I’m just glad someone’s carrying me down the stairs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Met my childhood hero, now I get to ride in an ambulance. Boy, if we can get him to do that calendar, this’ll be the best day ever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 bernadette_rostenkowski Can’t believe we lost her. What was I thinking? I’d be a terrible mom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 howard_wolowitz Well, maybe with the first one. But kids are like pancakes. The first one’s always a throwaway. How’s this look?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 bernadette_rostenkowski It’s fine. Where’d you get that picture of her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 howard_wolowitz It’s not her. I just googled foo-foo little dogs. It’s Raj. Stay quiet. Hey, bad timing. Bernadette just took Cinnamon out for a walk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 raj_koothrappali Hmm. Interesting. Did they take a walk down Liars’ Lane?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 howard_wolowitz What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 raj_koothrappali A lane frequented by liars. Like you, you big liar.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 howard_wolowitz You have her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, thank God she’s okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 raj_koothrappali Well, I trusted you, and you let me down. The poor thing’s been shaking for hours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 howard_wolowitz I’m really sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 bernadette_rostenkowski Hang on, you’ve had her for hours?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 raj_koothrappali Yes. I picked her up, and then we both went for massages to try and calm down. And then we got Pinkberry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 bernadette_rostenkowski So you knew she was okay, and you couldn’t pick up the phone to tell us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 raj_koothrappali Well, I, I thought about…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 bernadette_rostenkowski Don’t well me, mister. We’ve been worried sick. She could have been dead for all we knew. You should be ashamed of yourself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 raj_koothrappali Sorry. I, I just…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 bernadette_rostenkowski Sorry’s not good enough. Maybe you need to take some time and think about what you’ve done.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 howard_wolowitz Nice guilt trip. You are gonna be an amazing mom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 arthur_jeffries Thank you, Sheldon. That, that was very nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Want me to sing it again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 arthur_jeffries No. The fourth, the fourth time was, was the charm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper There anything I can get for you? Some apple juice? Uh, some Jell-O?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 arthur_jeffries No. No, thank you. But I, I do, I do have a favour to, to ask.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Name it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 arthur_jeffries Well, I’m, I’m booked to do a children’s party tomorrow, and, um, frankly I, you know, I, I don’t feel up to it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Oh, you’re not. You look awful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 arthur_jeffries Thank you. Anyway, uh, I mean, you know my act better than anybody. I was, I was hoping that maybe, you know, maybe you’d fill in for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Are you saying that you want me to be Professor Proton?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 arthur_jeffries Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Oh, my. What an honour. Oh, this is like being asked to ascend Mount Olympus and dine with the gods.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 arthur_jeffries Or a Korean family in Alhambra.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper But they’ll know I’m not you. Should I call myself Professor Proton, Jr.?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 arthur_jeffries Sounds great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper So, in a way it’s like I’m your son.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 arthur_jeffries What, Whatever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 sheldon_cooper Father.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode22 arthur_jeffries Sure, what the hell.
