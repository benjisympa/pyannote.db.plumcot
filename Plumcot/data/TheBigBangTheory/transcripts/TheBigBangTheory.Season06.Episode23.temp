TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 bernadette Burbank Airport, please.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 penny Vegas, here we come.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 bernadette No husbands, no boyfriends, no rules.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 amy No rules? We’re not gonna get drunk and have a six-way with the Blue Man Group, are we?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 amy So there are some rules.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 bernadette Fine. No husbands, no boyfriends, some rules.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 amy Thank you. Vegas!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 howard The ladies are away, the boys will play.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 raj Anything can happen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 leonard It’s gonna get crazy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 sheldon Dungeons & Dragons.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 penny I got a brand-new bikini, so drinks at the pool are on these.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 bernadette I got a sexy new tube top that says come hither, and a can of pepper spray that says close enough, Jack.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 amy I got some old underwear I’m gonna throw on stage at the Garth Brooks concert.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 penny I’m sorry, why old?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 amy ‘Cause last time I saw him, I threw new ones and it got me nothing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 sheldon I’ve got a brand-new seven piece set of polyhedral dice. Hello, new dice smell.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 leonard I’ve got my helm of lordly might, my boots of speed, and if things get too exciting, my inhaler of asthma.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 raj I got my new bloodthirsty savage warrior who will lay waste to all who stand before him. And I had a sensible salad for lunch, so I can eat all the pizza I want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 howard Come on, are we gonna sit around chatting like a bunch of teenage girls, or are we gonna play D&D like a bunch of teenage boys who are never gonna have sex with those teenage girls?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 girls Vegas! Vegas! Vegas!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 boys The Dungeon of Mofooskay-Heeko! The Dungeon of Mofooskay-Heeko! The Dungeon of Mofooskay-Heeko!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 raj I’m actually glad Lucy had to work tonight. Saved me the awkward conversation about how I was gonna be hanging with my bros.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 howard Isn’t every conversation you two have awkward?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 raj Painfully so. We have this rule on the phone that if no one talks for three minutes, you can just hang up. So into her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 howard Ready whenever you guys are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 sheldon Yeah, yeah, we’ll be right there. Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 leonard Yeah?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 sheldon I’m not sure how I feel about Howard being dungeon master instead of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 leonard Oh, that’s nice. But relax, sometimes change is good. Uh, you were worried about Zachary Quinto being the new Spock, but you wound up liking him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 sheldon Oh, please. Every time the topic of change comes up, you throw Zachary Quinto in my face. I’m upset the mailman has a new haircut, Zachary Quinto. I’m upset that daylight saving time started, Zachary Quinto. I’m upset daylight saving time ended, Zachary Quinto. I’m saying this for the last time, Zachary Quinto was a weird, wonderful, unrepeatable event. So stop using him against me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 howard Okay, here we go. You find yourselves in an overgrown old forest. Before you is a giant oak tree with a face on it that looks a lot like Nicolas Cage. He says, Travel with caution. These woods are home to the bones of many a fallen hero.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 leonard See, Howard’s just as good a dungeon master as I am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 sheldon As good? You just got pantsed in the schoolyard, four-eyes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 raj Hey, come on, guys, focus. Um, uh, oh, mighty Nicolas Cage tree, we thank you for your warning, but we are brave warriors, and nothing short of death will keep us from our goal. Oh, Lucy’s free after all. See ya.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 leonard Hey, hey, hey, you can’t leave. We just started.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 raj You’re right, I should finish the game. I take my plus-one long sword, stab myself in the face with it. I’m dead, I’ve got a date with a girl. Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 howard We’ll be fine, watch. Suddenly, a spectral shape rises from Koothrappali’s bloody corpse, and says, don’t worry, buddies, ghost Raj will help guide you through the forest. Well, I’m just a tree, but if I were you, I’d listen to your ghost friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 sheldon Go on, give him your lunch money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 raj I’m very happy you were able to hang out tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 lucy Me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 raj Not that it’s up to you to make me happy. Uh, well, unless you find neediness sexy. In which case, you’re about to have dinner with the hottest man on the planet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 lucy Can I tell you something? I was so nervous about seeing you, before I left my apartment, I put roll-on antiperspirant all over my body.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 raj Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 lucy Yeah. If sweat starts squirting out the top of my head, you’ll know why.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 raj I, uh, I’m sorry to put you through that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 lucy Oh, it’s okay. I’ve been trying to force myself to do things that make me scared.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 raj What else have you been thinking about doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 lucy Well, let’s see. I’d love to be able to tell the lady who cuts my hair that I don’t like bangs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 raj I like your bangs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 lucy Oh, thanks, I like ’em, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 raj What else?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 lucy Mmm, it’s kind of a tie between sending food back in a restaurant and saying no to those kids who sell magazines door-to-door.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 raj Mm, yeah. Those are both toughies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 lucy I know. I have a two-year subscription to Guns & Ammo.53
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 leonard I push my shoulder against the secret door to see if it gives way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 howard Uh, it does. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 sheldon He does sound effects, too!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 leonard Hey, I always did sound effects. A-A swarm of bloodthirsty bats fly through the dungeon. Uh, uh, they attack a nearby unicorn. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 sheldon Okay, well, I have a sound effect for those sound effects. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 penny Guess who?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 howard What are you doing back?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 bernadette That’s an excellent question. Amy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 amy Uh, well, when we were going through security, I got pulled out of line for a pat-down. The, uh, TSA agent got a little handsy. I may have broken her nose with my elbow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 bernadette Long story short, she’s on the No Fly List and we might have been followed here by a drone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 amy I’m sorry. I feel like such an idiot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 penny Oh, it’s not so bad. You lost money, you’re filled with shame and you got groped by a stranger. I mean, that’s Vegas, you nailed it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 amy You guys enjoy your evening. I’m gonna go before I ruin anybody else’s weekend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 sheldon Ah, that’s my girl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 leonard No, no, no, Amy, wait. I know it’s not the night you had in mind, but why don’t you guys stay and play with us? It’ll be fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 sheldon It would? Fun? Okay, three weeks ago you bought crunchy peanut butter, now you want the girls to play D&D? Do you have a drug problem?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 leonard What’s the big deal? Raj bailed, so we could use some extra players.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 sheldon Well, I’ve just never played Dungeons & Dragons with girls before.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 penny Oh, don’t worry, sweetie. No one has.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 leonard So, what do you say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 sheldon I’ll leave it up to the dungeon master.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 howard A satanic fungus that looks suspiciously like Al Pacino rises from the forest floor and says, You’re playing D&D. You’re playing D&D. This whole apartment is playing D&D.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 penny Okay, who wants a drink?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 sheldon Yeah, we, now, Penny, we don’t consume alcohol during Dungeons & Dragons. It impairs our judgment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 penny Oh, this isn’t alcohol. It’s a magic potion that makes me like you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 leonard Double potion, please.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 howard Okay, here we go. You find yourselves face-to-face with two hulking ogres. What are you doing in our dungeon? You shall die!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 sheldon Okay, literal goose bumps. Look.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 howard What do you do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 leonard I draw my broadsword.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 sheldon I ready my quarter-staff.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 penny I drink my potion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 bernadette I say we attack the big one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 penny You know what? Give me the dice, I want to roll.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 howard The dungeon master’s supposed to roll.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 penny Yeah, well I’m supposed to be in Vegas throwing up on a shrimp buffet. Now give it. All right, what do I need?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 howard Uh, fifteen or higher.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 penny Fifteen’s the point, the point is fifteen. Give the little lady some room, here it is, coming out. Sixteen! Yes! Oh, please tell me we’re playing for money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 sheldon Oh, even better than money. You gained experience points.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 penny More potion, please.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 leonard Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 raj How are your crab cakes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 lucy Kind of funky.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 raj That’s great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 lucy It is? Does funky mean something different in India?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 raj No, no. Uh, you’ve always wanted to send your food back in a restaurant, here’s your chance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 lucy Mmm, it’s okay. I just won’t eat ’em.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 raj Don’t be ridiculous. Waiter?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 waiter Everything all right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 lucy Uh, yeah. Everything all right with you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 waiter Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 lucy ‘Kay, thanks, bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 raj Hold on. Isn’t there something else you wanted to tell him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 lucy N-No, it, it’s fine. Uh, He’s from a different country, he doesn’t understand our ways.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 raj Don’t be silly. Just tell him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 lucy I have to go to the bathroom. And it’s not because the crab cakes are funky.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 waiter So you’re okay here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 raj Uh, yeah, sorry. She’s just a little shy. The first time we met, she was so nervous, she climbed out a bathroom window to get away from me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 lucy Uh-oh. Hey, Raj. Funny story.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 bernadette Come on, mama wants a pair of dead ogres.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 howard Seventeen, the larger ogre is dead. The-the other ogre says, you killed my brother, now Ogre Thanksgiving is ruined.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 sheldon That is amazing. He made me care about the ogre.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 leonard All right, Amy, there’s one ogre left. Take him out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 amy Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 penny Pretend he’s that TSA agent. Come on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 amy Nineteen. Yes, this is turning out to be even better than Vegas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 penny No, it’s not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 raj Lucy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 lucy Hey. Long time no see.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 raj You don’t know me very well, but each time you crawl out a bathroom window to escape my company, it chips away at my masculinity.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 lucy I’m sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 raj Why would you leave like that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 lucy You were pushing me. I clearly didn’t want to send my food back, and you tried to make me do it anyway.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 raj Okay, if I upset you, then why didn’t you just say something?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 lucy Well, how can I tell you I’m upset if I can’t tell the woman at Supercuts that my forehead’s my best feature? It’s scary.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 raj Yeah, well, I like you a lot, and that’s scary for me. Mostly because you’re a proven flight risk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 lucy How could you like me a lot?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 raj Well, uh, for one thing, you have bigger emotional problems than I do, and I find that very attractive in a woman. I, I don’t know. I just, I think you’re wonderful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 lucy I’m sweating out of my head.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 howard The dragon falls from the sky, crashing into the volcano.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 sheldon Yay!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 howard But wait., he’s not dead. He crawls out, spreads his wings and prepares to attack.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 sheldon Yeah, uh, wait. Doesn’t he say something first? You know, maybe in the voice of a beloved celebrity?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 howard Fine. You’d think, after all these years, I’d know not to fly over volcanoes. I’m a freaking idiot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 sheldon The dragon’s Christopher Walken. That’s perfect.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 leonard All right, Amy, it’s your turn. We need one more hit. Finish him off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 amy Here we go. Fifteen?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 howard It’s a hit. The dragon collapses to the ground.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 sheldon Wait. Wait. And says?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 howard Mother? Is that you? Your little boy is coming home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 sheldon Oh, I don’t know about you guys, but I have been through the emotional wringer tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 bernadette This may be the potion talking, but you are one fine-ass dungeon master.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 howard Oh, yeah? Well, when we get home, I’m gonna take you on a whole different adventure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 sheldon Another quest by Wolowitz? Count me in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 amy Sheldon, they’re talking about sex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 sheldon Oh, then I’m out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 penny Ooh, I have an idea. Since it’s not happening any time soon, why don’t your character and your character do it in the game?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 bernadette Ooh! Come on, back me up here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 howard Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 together Ooh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 bernadette Okay, I cast a love spell on Sheldon and Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 leonard Ooh! Sorry, I thought you were gonna do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 howard The love spell takes effect. When Sheldon looks at Amy, she is the most beautiful half-orc he’s ever seen, and he’s overcome with a desire to rip her armour off and gaze fondly at her four hairy breasts. When Amy sees Sheldon, he looks, well, just like Sheldon, ’cause apparently she’s into that. What do you do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 amy I don’t like this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 sheldon You see what happens when you let girls play D&D?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 sheldon Amy. Amy. Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 amy What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 sheldon I’ve never knocked on my own door before. That was a wild ride.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 amy You don’t have to come in here and cheer me up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 sheldon Thank you. Would you go tell everyone else that? Because they sure think otherwise.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 amy I’ll tell you what they think. They think our relationship is a joke.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 sheldon Well, I don’t think our relationship is a joke. I think “a horse goes into a bar, bartender says, why the long face?’, that’s a joke. It’s a good one, too, because a horse has a long face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 amy Sheldon, are we ever going to have an intimate relationship?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 sheldon Oh, my. That’s an uncomfortable topic. Amy, before I met you, I never had any interest in being intimate with anyone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 amy And now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 sheldon And now what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 amy Do you have any interest now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 sheldon I have not ruled it out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 amy Wow. Talk dirty to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 sheldon I know it doesn’t seem like it to you, but, for me, what we have is extremely intimate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 amy I guess I know that. It’s just, part of me wants more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 sheldon More? I mean, look at us. It’s only been three years, here we are in bed together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 amy Come on. Let’s go back out there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 sheldon Well, no. Hold on. My Elven magic-user and your half-orc warrior did have a love spell cast on them. We wouldn’t really be playing the game right if we didn’t see that through.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 amy Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 sheldon I believe that, uh, we just killed a dragon. While the others pillage the corpse, I lead you to a secluded area where I attempt to remove your leather armour. It comes off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 amy Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 sheldon What do you do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 amy I kiss you on the lips.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 sheldon I kiss you back on the lips as well. Your turn.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 amy I remove your armour. What do you do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 sheldon I erotically caress your nose.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 amy Keep rolling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 leonard Hey, you guys have been in there for a while. You doing okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 sheldon We’re fine, thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 penny Okay, we just want to say, we feel really bad about…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode23 amy Go away! Sheldon is nibbling on my 14! Yes!
