TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 raj_koothrappali So, anyway, last night on video chat, I spent, like, twenty minutes just staring into Lucy’s eyes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 leonard_hofstadter Oh, that sounds romantic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 raj_koothrappali It was until I realized the screen had frozen. Still one of my top three dates of all time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 leonard_hofstadter So, are we ever gonna hang out with this girl?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 raj_koothrappali I’d love that, but she’s not really comfortable around people.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 sheldon_cooper Yeah, I used to be uncomfortable around people, but then I learned a trick. I pretend everyone I meet is a beloved character from Star Trek.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 leonard_hofstadter How’s that been working for you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 sheldon_cooper Oh, like a charm, unnamed crewman in a red shirt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 howard_wolowitz Leonard, I may have gotten you a job.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 leonard_hofstadter I have a job.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 sheldon_cooper Yes, he does. He caters to my every whim.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 howard_wolowitz No, in a couple of weeks, Stephen Hawking’s team is sending an expedition to the North Sea to test hydrodynamic simulations of black holes. One of their experimental physicists dropped out, and I recommended you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 leonard_hofstadter Well, do you really think I have a shot?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 howard_wolowitz Yeah, I’ve worked with Hawking. I talked you up. He knows your research. I think this could happen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 leonard_hofstadter He knows, wow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 sheldon_cooper Well, now, but do you think that’s a good idea? Uh, you know Star Trek. Should a guy with no name and a red shirt really go on an expedition?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 raj_koothrappali Hey, don’t discourage him. This is a fantastic opportunity.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 sheldon_cooper No one asked you, Uhura.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 sheldon_cooper Would you like to hear a classic Sheldon Cooper factoid?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 leonard_hofstadter What do you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 sheldon_cooper Great. I’ve been doing some reading about vehicular safety. Did you know that the highest number of drowning accidents happen on or around boats?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 leonard_hofstadter Interesting that you would bring that up when I might go work on a boat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 sheldon_cooper Well, that’s the thing about factoids, they’re interesting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 leonard_hofstadter I know what you’re doing. You don’t want me going on this research trip because you’re afraid to be alone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 sheldon_cooper I’m not afraid to be alone. On land. On the sea, it would be terrifying. Because of all the drowning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 sheldon_cooper Fine, no more drowning talk. I’ll change the subject. Oh. Who do you think would win in a fight, you or a shark?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 leonard_hofstadter Look, I appreciate your signature blend of concern for me and incredible selfishness. If I get the chance to do this, there is nothing you can say that’s going to stop me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 sheldon_cooper Very well. Things between you and Penny have never been better. I hope four months apart doesn’t change anything. I should have opened with that, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 raj_koothrappali If you look carefully at Venus, you should be able to see the International Space Station pass by.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 lucy Wow. Your friend was actually up there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 raj_koothrappali Yeah. He brought me back a T-shirt that said My Friend Went to the Space Station and All I Got Was This Lousy T-Shirt
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 lucy Did he take the T-shirt to space?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 raj_koothrappali Nope. It’s exactly as lousy as advertised. Speaking of friends, they have been asking to meet you. I was thinking maybe we could all hang out sometime?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 lucy I don’t know. How many are there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 raj_koothrappali Let’s see. Six. That’s pretty cool, I have six friends. Kind of like Sinatra.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 lucy Six strangers? That’s a lot of pressure. Staring at me, asking me personal questions. Like, what do you do? Where are you from? Why did you lock yourself in the bathroom?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 raj_koothrappali Okay, how about you just dip your toe in and meet one of them?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 lucy Will you be there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 raj_koothrappali Of course.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 lucy Well, that’s two. Three if you count me. Oh, this is getting out of hand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny So, then, during my afternoon shift, I spilled an entire tray of drinks on myself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 leonard_hofstadter Oh, that’s awful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny Not really. My shirt was soaking wet. I got, like, the biggest tip of my life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 leonard_hofstadter So, listen, do you remember when I said the similarities of the equations of general relativity and hydrodynamics suggest you could find the equivalent of Unruh radiation in a large body of water?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny I thought I said that to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 leonard_hofstadter Anyway, Stephen Hawking’s team is looking into that, and I’ve been invited to join them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny Wow, Hawking. Good for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 leonard_hofstadter Well, it is. Just, you know, I’d be gone for a while.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny Well, how long?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 leonard_hofstadter Three, four months.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny Whoa. When would you leave?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 leonard_hofstadter Couple of weeks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny Wow. Oh, okay, well, I’ll just come visit you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 leonard_hofstadter That’s the thing, you can’t. I’ll be on a ship in the North Sea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny On a ship? Aren’t they afraid Hawking will just roll overboard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 leonard_hofstadter Uh, he’s not gonna be there. He’s just sending a team to research his theory.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny Oh, sure. Like when you send me to kill spiders in your bathtub. Wow. Okay. Four months.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 leonard_hofstadter Yeah. And I’m a little worried because things between us have been so great, and I’d hate to do anything that screws that up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny Oh, sweetie, if you’re gonna screw things up, it’s gonna be while you’re here, not while you’re away. No. I mean, look, you have to go. It sounds like an amazing opportunity. And I’m just basing that on how much I didn’t understand what you said about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 leonard_hofstadter Okay. I’ll confirm the travel arrangements in the morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny Okay. Good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 leonard_hofstadter I do have to ask you one favour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon’s nervous about me leaving. Just keep an eye on him while I’m gone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny Oh, I don’t know. Remember what happened when I took care of your goldfish?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 leonard_hofstadter Well, flush Sheldon down the toilet and get me a new one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 leonard_hofstadter Really, you guys do not need to throw me a going-away party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 howard_wolowitz Are you kidding me? How often can you say bon voyage to somebody when they’re actually going on a voyage?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 amy_farrah_fowler Hello, Rajesh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 howard_wolowitz Hello, Amy. Nice to see you. What can I say? It’s funnier with the accent.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 leonard_hofstadter There’s beer in the fridge. Anyway, you guys really don’t need to make a big deal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 sheldon_cooper Leonard, you’re being selfish. We need to give you a proper send-off so we’ll have closure when you die at sea and crabs eat your face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny Sheldon, sweetie, shut up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 bernadette_rostenkowski You know, one of the things that helped me get through Howard being in space for so long was getting married before he left.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny Bernadette, sweetie, shut up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 raj_koothrappali Okay. I have a request to make.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 amy_farrah_fowler And now he can talk. I want to cut open your brain and see what the heck’s going on in there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 raj_koothrappali The only person allowed inside this head is Dr. Phil. Anyway, I, I spoke to my new lady friend about meeting you all, and she thought it would be easier for her to start with just one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 sheldon_cooper Oh, gee, I don’t know. My schedule’s a little busy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 raj_koothrappali Actually, I was thinking Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 leonard_hofstadter Oh. Thank you, Raj. I’d be honoured.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 howard_wolowitz What the hell? I thought I was your best friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 raj_koothrappali You are, but you’ve got kind of a big personality, with your flashy clothes and your Woody Allen swagger.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny You know, maybe she’d be more comfortable meeting a girl first.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 raj_koothrappali Good idea. Bernadette?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny What the hell?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 raj_koothrappali Well, you’re very pretty. That could be intimidating to another woman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny Oh, yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 bernadette_rostenkowski Hey, you don’t think I’m pretty enough to scare your girlfriend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 howard_wolowitz Calm down, Bernie. You’re very scary.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 amy_farrah_fowler It should be me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 raj_koothrappali Why? So you can make jokes about cutting open my brain?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 amy_farrah_fowler A, that was not a joke, that was a sincere request. And B, more importantly, I was the outsider to this group, and I know how frightening that can be. But you guys took me in and made me feel loved, like I was family.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 sheldon_cooper Fine, I’ll do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 amy_farrah_fowler So, after I started dating Sheldon, I met Leonard, and then everybody else, and they’ve all been so wonderful to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 lucy That’s really nice to hear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 amy_farrah_fowler Maybe next week, we could all get together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 raj_koothrappali Oh, Lucy, you don’t have to answer that. Don’t put her on the spot. She hates that. Am I right? Tell her how much you hate being put on the spot. Go ahead, tell her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 amy_farrah_fowler Ignore him. He’s a little nervous ’cause he doesn’t think I understand the severity of your social anxiety.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 raj_koothrappali What the? Are you crazy? You can’t talk about social anxiety to someone who has social anxiety. It makes them socially anxious!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 amy_farrah_fowler Excuse me, but I’m a neurobiologist. I think I’m a little more qualified than you to understand what’s not working in your girlfriend’s brain!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 raj_koothrappali Don’t call her my girlfriend. We haven’t discussed whether or not we’re girlfriend or boyfriend yet. Now that it’s out there, are you my girlfriend? By the way, if you say no, I’ll never be happy again. Not to put you on the spot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 lucy I think I have to go to the bathroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 raj_koothrappali We might as well go ahead and eat. She’s not coming back anytime soon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 sheldon_cooper This is ridiculous, we’re shopping for a party and this store doesn’t even have a party section.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny Yeah, it does, and here we are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 sheldon_cooper You know, I have to say, Penny, I don’t understand why you of all people are encouraging Leonard to do this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny Well, I’m his girlfriend, of course I’m gonna support him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 sheldon_cooper Yeah, well, you’re his girlfriend for now. You know, maybe you’re not aware of this, but there is a rich tradition of men at sea finding comfort in each other’s arms and britches.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny Honey, this is a big deal for Leonard, okay? He gets to work with Stephen Hawking. Who, by the way, will not be on the boat. I checked it out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 sheldon_cooper It’s not that big of an opportunity. And even if Hawking’s theories are correct, all they prove is where the universe came from, why everything exists and what its ultimate end will be. I mean, me? I’m interested in the big questions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny Oh, my God, Sheldon the genius is jealous of Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 sheldon_cooper I’m not jealous. I’m just very unhappy that good things are happening for him and not happening for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny Look, sweetie, this is a natural thing to feel, okay? But just because good things are happening to Leonard doesn’t take anything away from you. You know what? Let me tell you a little story. Once there was a girl who worked at the Cheesecake Factory, and she wasn’t very good at her job.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 sheldon_cooper It was you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny It wasn’t me. But she was also an actress, and we were both up for the same part in a toothpaste commercial. She got it. Look, I was so jealous. But instead of ripping out her fake blonde hair…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 sheldon_cooper You ripped out your own fake blonde hair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny I, looked her in the eye, smiled and said, I’m happy for you. Because that’s what friends do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 sheldon_cooper They lie so they don’t look petty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 sheldon_cooper How?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny Like this. I am so happy for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 sheldon_cooper Wow. No wonder you didn’t get that toothpaste commercial.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 raj_koothrappali Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 lucy Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 raj_koothrappali I want to apologize for Amy last night. She was completely out of line. Are you, are you not speaking to me or did the screen freeze again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 lucy Amy wasn’t the problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 raj_koothrappali Okay. I know. It was me. I, I pushed too hard. I’m sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 lucy Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 raj_koothrappali You know, I, I’ve been thinking that maybe meeting somebody one-on-one is too intense, so Friday night, my friends are having a party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 lucy A party?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 raj_koothrappali A little one. It’s, it’s a farewell for Leonard, so all the attention will be on him. If you wear something brown and sit on the couch, they won’t even know you’re there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 lucy I’m not sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 raj_koothrappali Oh, please?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 lucy Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 raj_koothrappali Come on. Don’t make me beg. And I’m from India, so I know how to do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 lucy Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 raj_koothrappali Yeah, thank you! This means a lot to me. My friends are like my family. Unless you don’t like them, in which case, they’re dead to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 bernadette_rostenkowski So, have you ever spent a long time on a boat before?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 bernadette_rostenkowski Are you referring to the time we got stuck on the Small World ride at Disneyland?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 howard_wolowitz I’m proud of you, Leonard. Working out on the North Sea for months, that’s really something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 leonard_hofstadter I know. As far as science goes, this is the adventure of a lifetime.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 howard_wolowitz Maybe your lifetime. I went to space.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 leonard_hofstadter It’s not a competition.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 howard_wolowitz You’re right, you’re right. I’m really proud of you, and I’m gonna miss you when you’re gone. And space beats water.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 amy_farrah_fowler Rajesh, I thought Lucy was coming.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 raj_koothrappali She is. She’s just running a little late. You know how it is, girls always fussing about their hair, their makeup. She’ll be here. Just give it a rest, okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 sheldon_cooper Um, can I have your attention, everyone? That’s, uh, B-flat, for those who don’t have perfect pitch. I would like to propose a toast to my best friend, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter. He has been presented with a wonderful opportunity, and I couldn’t be happier for him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 leonard_hofstadter Thank you, Sheldon. That must’ve been very hard for you to say.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 sheldon_cooper Well, I mean it. I’m really happy for you. And that’s how you get a toothpaste commercial. Cheers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 howard_wolowitz Cheers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny Cheers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 howard_wolowitz It was really nice of you to try to be happy for Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 sheldon_cooper Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 howard_wolowitz It must’ve killed you when I went to space.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 raj_koothrappali Oh, no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 howard_wolowitz Buddy, you okay? Oh, man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 bernadette_rostenkowski What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 raj_koothrappali Uh, go ahead. Read it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 howard_wolowitz Raj, I can’t come to the party. This is all just too much for me. I don’t think we should see each other any more. Sorry. Lucy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 raj_koothrappali Excuse me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny Raj, I’m so sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 amy_farrah_fowler Me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 sheldon_cooper It did not kill me when you went to space. Monkeys went to space.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny Well, here we are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 leonard_hofstadter Yep. I’m really gonna miss you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny I’m gonna miss you, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 sheldon_cooper Penny, we’re in the red zone. The white zone is for loading and unloading. We’re breaking the law.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny Okay, there’s no space in the white zone, so…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 leonard_hofstadter Anyway, we can e-mail, and I think the phone connections are pretty good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 sheldon_cooper All right, you have to get out of the car right now. I’m not going to jail for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 leonard_hofstadter Would you just relax?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 sheldon_cooper Oh, I see a space in the white zone. Quick, circle the airport.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny Did you bring enough inhalers?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny And, uh, extra Dramamine? You remember what happened on It’s a Small World.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 leonard_hofstadter I’m covered.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 sheldon_cooper Oh, dear Lord, a police officer’s glancing in our direction. We’ve been made.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 leonard_hofstadter Calm down. I’m getting out. I have something I want to give you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny Oh, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 sheldon_cooper It’s just a heart-shaped locket with a picture of Leonard’s face in it. He got it at the mall on clearance. Now move, move, move.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny I love you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 leonard_hofstadter I love you, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 sheldon_cooper Don’t worry, Officer. They just love each other. We’re not smuggling drugs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny Raj, it’s Penny. Are you in there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 raj_koothrappali Hang on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny Hey. I’m just coming back from the airport. I wanted to see how you’re doing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 raj_koothrappali That’s, that’s very nice of you. Uh, come, come. Come on in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny Can’t stay long. I left Sheldon in the car with the window cracked open. He’s gonna go through that activity book in, like, 30 seconds, so… Are you okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 raj_koothrappali No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny Oh. I’m so sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 raj_koothrappali No. It’s my fault. You know, I finally found someone who was right for me, and I, I drove her away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny Oh, Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 raj_koothrappali Penny, I, I miss her already.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny I know how you feel. I miss Leonard, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 raj_koothrappali What’s like, what is wrong with me? Why, why can’t I ever have love?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny You will.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 raj_koothrappali No, I, I won’t. I’m, I’m unlovable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny That’s just the booze talking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 raj_koothrappali No, it’s not. I haven’t had a drink since last night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny You’re talking to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 raj_koothrappali I am. And now I’m crying for a whole different reason!
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny Oh, me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 raj_koothrappali So I guess what I’m saying is I get where Lucy’s coming from.
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 penny That’s great. Do you want some wine?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 raj_koothrappali Uh, no, water’s fine. Anyhow, I’ve been thinking about it a lot and, and I totally see why Lucy did what she did. I pushed too hard. But you know what? If I back off and give her enough space, maybe there’s still a future for us. Yeah, the funny thing about life is that, you know, sometimes…
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 amy_farrah_fowler Does he ever shut up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season06.Episode24 raj_koothrappali … but then it turns good again, and that means it’s better than if it had never been bad for a while. I know that now, thing’s aren’t good, they are in fact very very bad but at least my heart is starting to heal. Slowly but surely. And oh how I cried. It was like a little, uh, thunderstorm on my face. But I’m a man, okay? So I need to pull myself together, pick up a pen and get it all out in my journal. I mean, it’s not all bad, right? Having my heart broken has allowed me to finally speak in front of you, so, you know, a silver lining….
