TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 leonard Sheldon, it’s not a great time, what do you want?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon Hello to you, too. I’m sorry, but this is important.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 leonard What is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon Back to the Future II was in the Back to the Future III case, and Back to the Future III was, get this, in the Back to the Future II case.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 leonard So?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon So, did you do that, or am I in the house with an intruder?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 leonard Sheldon, I got to go inside. It’s getting rough out here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon You’re dodging the question, I knew it was you. What was that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 leonard What was what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon This isn’t a very good connection, but it sounded like someone just released a kraken.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 leonard Okay, I’m hanging up now. You know there’s no such thing as a k… 
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon No!
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon Penny. Penny. Penny. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny What’s the matter?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon Um, well, I was worried that you might be missing Leonard. And that might be causing you to have bad dreams, like the kind you’d get if you watched Clash of the Titans right before you went to bed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny Sweetie, did you have a bad dream?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon To be honest, I did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny Aw.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon Back to the Future II was in the Back to the Future III case. Leonard did it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny Good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon No, wait. Perhaps I should sleep here so you don’t miss Leonard as much, uh, ’cause you’re being kind of a baby about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny You know what? That would make me feel better. Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon You’re welcome. Good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 raj I think you’d be pleased to hear that this morning in the parking garage I saw this oil stain on the ground that was shaped just like my ex-girlfriend, Lucy, and I didn’t get upset at all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 howard I’m proud of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 raj Well, you should be, ’cause she was looking good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon Dear Lord, you’re an astronomer. Although you may have earthly woes, get your mind back on the stars. Gee, even the lowly dung beetle chooses to plot its course by using the Milky Way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 raj Is that true?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon Everything I say is true. Now, of course, the dung beetle also enjoys eating faeces, living in faeces and making little balls out of faeces, so, you know, pick and choose which aspects of its lifestyle you want to embrace.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 howard Come on, you can talk to girls now. It shouldn’t be hard for you to meet someone new.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 raj How can I meet someone new when everywhere I look, I see Lucy’s face? Tell me you don’t see her smile in the crust of this chicken pot pie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 howard Oh, will you stop it. Now, listen to me, there’s a welcome party for incoming post-docs tonight. Go to it and meet someone who isn’t made of grease or pie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 raj You think you’re so cool because your wife is a person?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 howard Look, Bernie’s at a neuroscience conference with Amy, I’ll go with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 raj You would do that for me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 howard Of course. You’re my friend. I want you to be happy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 raj Thanks. Oh, Sheldon, since Amy’s out of town, would you like to join us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon I want you to be happy, too, but not enough to do anything about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 bernadette Howie, stop. I can’t talk like that. Amy’s right here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 amy Sheldon, stop. For the last time, I will not bring home bed bugs. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 bernadette The hotel’s nice. There’s a pool, a gym, the bar looks like fun. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 amy Because I looked in the bed, and there are no bugs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 bernadette Aw, I love you, too. If I don’t talk to you before you go to sleep, I’ll meet you in dreamland.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 amy Good night. No, I will not consider sleeping in my garment bag.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon Penny, did you ever wonder how Starfleet captains…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon Well, now that I’ve piqued your interest, welcome to the exciting world of 3D chess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny Why don’t you just admit you only want to play this game because you always play it with Leonard and you miss him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon You overestimate his significance in my life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny Mmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon Do I miss how he makes a face on my toaster waffle with syrup? No. Do I miss the way he fixes the zipper on my jacket when it gets stuck? I don’t think so. Do I miss how we say good night to each other through the walls of our bedroom using Morse code? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny Okay, I get it, I get it. You are an emotionless robot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon Well, I try.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny All right, let’s just get this stupid game over with.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon Great. I’ll go first.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon By the way, how are you with zippers?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon Well, I really need to go to the bathroom, and this one’s gone all cattywampus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 raj Wow, your work on jellyfish neural nets sounds so interesting. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 girl It is. You can download my paper off the university server.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 raj I will. You can download my paper on the Van Allen Belts from the university server as well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 girl I will.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 raj All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 howard How’d it go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 raj Well, if you like dry, factual statements interspersed with painful moments of silence, it was bananas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 howard Check it out. Mrs. Davis from Human Resources is here. She’s probably on the lookout for sexual harassment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 raj Oh, great. There go my chances of being sexually harassed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 howard I heard her husband left her for a hot, young undergrad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 raj That’s so much better than the old, ugly ones.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 mrs_davis Mr. Wolowitz, Dr. Koothrappali. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 howard Mrs. Davis, nice to see you. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 raj You know, I recently read a fascinating article on infidelity among penguins.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 mrs_davis Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 raj So if the fact that your husband left you makes you feel unattractive, just remember, penguins get cheated on, and they’re adorable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 howard It was better when you couldn’t talk to women.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 bernadette I was thinking of going to the lecture on posterior cingulate cortex lesions in the formation of autobiographical memory.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 amy Oh, brain lesions are fascinating. Unless they’re yours, then they’re a drag.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 bernadette To the advancement of science.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 amy And to the sick and dying who make it possible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 bernadette This is fun, we never really get to talk shop with Penny around. We usually just end up talking about boys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 amy Which is fine, but it’s nice to mix it up with a little intellectual conversation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 waiter From the two gentlemen at the bar.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 amy Oh, my gosh, boys bought us drinks, boys bought us drinks. Thank you, thank you, thank you so much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 bernadette Be cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 amy You be cool. Guys are hitting on us, and not just to get to Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 bernadette You’re right. Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon Ooh. Bad move.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny Really? Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon My queen can now take your rook from below.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny So that means I lose, right? It’s over?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon If I make this move, but I won’t because we’re having too much fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny Okay, let’s take a break. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon We’re all out of alcohol.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny I wasn’t going to get alcohol. Gosh, I wonder what Leonard’s doing right now. I miss him so much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon Well, if you’d like, we could call him. I mean that you could call him. As I’ve explained, the absence of my friends does not cause me pain. As rock and roll bad boy Paul Simon once said, I am a rock, I am an i-i-i-island.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny I’m calling him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon Oh, goodie, put him on speaker phone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 leonard Excuse me, ladies, my pants are buzzing. North Sea, how can I kelp you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 leonard Penny? Hey, it’s Penny. Everybody say hi to Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 everybody Hi, Penny!
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny Wow, it sounds like you’re having a good time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 leonard Best time of my life. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon Isn’t it five thirty in the morning there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 leonard Is it? Hey, everybody, it’s five thirty in the morning!
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny Uh, okay, well, we were just calling you because we were missing you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 random_voice Iceberg!
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 leonard Uh-oh, hang on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon Are you in danger?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 leonard No, it’s a drinking game. Whenever we see an iceberg, we take a shot!
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 everybody Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg!
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny Leonard, Leonard? I cannot believe we were missing that jerk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon You were.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 amy So what happened? How’d it go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 bernadette It’s fine. I thanked them again and let them know we’re not available.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 amy So I can drink this without having to give up the goodies?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 bernadette Yes, it’s all cool. Although, if you wanted to talk to one of them, no one would blame you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 amy And why would no one blame me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 bernadette I don’t know what I’m saying.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 amy Well, it sounds like you’re saying that I could do better than Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 bernadette Boy, these drinks are strong. Hoo, mama, I’m gonna be huggin’ the toilet tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 amy No, tell me, I want to know what you meant by that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 bernadette I just meant that you’re not married and your boyfriend’s kind of, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 amy And your husband is extremely Howard. What’s your point?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 bernadette Sorry. I have no point. That was a stupid thing to say. Can we please just go back to having a nice time?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 amy We could, but unfortunately my brain is lesion-free and I remember that rotten thing you just said about my sweet baboo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 bernadette Come on. I apologize. Can we please just let it go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 amy Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 bernadette Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 amy Your husband’s weird and his clothes are ridiculous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny I can’t believe it. All this time I’ve been doing nothing but sit around and miss that guy. And you know what the worst part is?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon That you’re having to process your emotional pain without vodka?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny No. Yeah. But you know what the second-worst part is? He does not miss me at all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon Allow me to comfort you. At least you’ve got your health.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny Really? That, that’s it? That’s comforting?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon Um, uh, in a hundred years, you’ll both be dead and it won’t matter?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny No. Come on, you’re supposed to say, of course he misses you, the only reason he’s partying is to cover up his pain.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon Oh, no, I don’t think that’s true at all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny This is ridiculous. Why am I upset just because he’s off having a good time?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon Well, perhaps you’re obsessively picturing him engaged in drunken coitus with another woman. Is that it? Did I get it right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny Okay, that, that’s great. You can stop trying to make me feel better now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon Actually, I can’t. Before Leonard left, he made me promise that I’d take care of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny He did?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny Oh, that’s really sweet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon Plus, if I do a good job, he said he’d bring me back a sailor’s cap.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny Well, now I miss him even more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon Well, if it’s any consolation, I’m sure Leonard’s tormented every moment he’s away from your warm embrace and cherry lips.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon Oh, seriously?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 raj Uh, excuse me, Mrs. Davis?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 mrs_davis What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 raj I’d like to apologize for being insensitive. And for possibly making penguins seem like jerks, because 99% of them are stand-up guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 mrs_davis Forget about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 raj You know, you, you and I, you and I have a lot in common.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 mrs_davis Is that right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 raj Oh, yes, I, I too am in the throes of heartbreak. Okay, fine, I’ll tell you about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon Here is a hot beverage to comfort you. It’s in a to-go cup. Make of that what you will.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny Come on. It’s still early. Let’s do something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon Well, I have been toying around with an idea for 4D chess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny How about we just talk?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon All right. In 4D chess…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny No. Come on, let’s talk about our lives. Tell me something about you I don’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon I own nine pairs of pants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny Okay, that, that’s a good start, but I was thinking maybe something a little more personal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon I see. I own nine pairs of underpants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny How about I go first?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon But I don’t want to know how many underpants you own. Although, based on the floor of your bedroom, I’d say it’s a thousand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny Okay, look, here’s something people do not know about me. When I first moved out to L.A., I did a topless scene in a low-budget horror movie about a killer gorilla. Ugh! After I did it, I felt so ashamed. Thankfully, that thing never came out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon I’ve seen that. Yeah. Serial Apeist. Howard found it online the day we met you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny Oh, God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon And it was literally the moment you walked out the door. But I see the type of personal revelations you’re going for. Okay, here’s one I thought I’d take to the grave.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon Hmm. A while back, YouTube changed its user interface from a star-based rating system to a thumbs-up rating system. I tell people I’m okay with it, but I’m really not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny That’s your big revelation?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon Yes. Whew, I feel ten pounds lighter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny Okay, you know what? I give up. I’m going to bed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon Here’s something else you don’t know about me. You just hurt my feelings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny What did I do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon I opened up and shared something deeply upsetting to me, and you treated it as if it were nothing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny I, I didn’t think it was a big deal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon It is to me; that’s the point.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny Sheldon, you are right. I’m really sorry. I should’ve known better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon Your apology is accepted.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny Thank you. How about a hug?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon How about a hearty handshake?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny Come on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 sheldon Now I know how you felt getting mauled by that sex-crazed gorilla.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 bernadette Good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 amy Mm-hmm. It was rather flattering to have strangers send us drinks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 bernadette Yeah, that felt nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 amy Maybe tomorrow morning we put on some hot pants and see if we can score us some free omelettes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 bernadette So, hypothetically, if, if we were to have gone with them, which one would you have picked?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 amy I think I would have gone with the short one with the goofy haircut.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 bernadette Oh, good, ’cause I liked the tall thin one. He seemed intelligent, kind of a loner, maybe a little sexually inexperienced, like I’d have to teach him a thing or two.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 amy Not my guy. I caught him staring at my rack. It’d be nice to be with a man who wants to know what’s underneath my cardigan. FYI, it’s another cardigan.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 bernadette Your short sexed-up guy kind of sounds like Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 amy Your brainy virgin kind of sounds like Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 both Good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 mrs_davis All right, Dr. Koothrappali, it’s been nice talking to you, but I need to go home and relieve my babysitter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 raj Yeah, I can relate to being a single parent. I have a dog.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 mrs_davis Yeah, it’s exactly the same thing. Good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 raj Mrs. Davis, I, uh, I must confess, I came here tonight in a futile attempt to pick up some lonely postdoc, but instead I got to connect with you at a human level. That’s a much better evening. You’re a lovely person.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 mrs_davis Are you hitting on me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 raj No, no, no, that would be crazy. I mean, if I were hitting on you, you’d know it ’cause you’d feel uncomfortable and a little sad for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 mrs_davis You’re sweet. Good night, Dr. Koothrappali.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 raj Good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 howard Looks like she accepted your apology.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 raj And then some. I think we had a moment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 howard Oh, please, you did not have a moment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 raj Who died and made you king of moments?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 howard Okay, fine. Let’s say there was a moment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 raj There was.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 howard There wasn’t. But, but even if there was, what are you gonna do about it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 raj I will slowly seduce her until she falls helpless into my bed, hungry for the pleasure only I can give her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 howard So nothing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 raj No, not a thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny Ah, I’m so glad the police finally caught that psychotic genetically engineered ape.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 leonard That is my girlfriend. I swear to God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 everyone Leonard! Leonard! Leonard! Leonard!
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode01 penny Aaaaaaah!
