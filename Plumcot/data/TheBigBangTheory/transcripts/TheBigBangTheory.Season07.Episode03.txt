TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 raj_koothrappali So, couldn’t help but notice none of you RSVP’d to my murder mystery dinner party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Oh, yeah. We were meaning to do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 raj_koothrappali No, you weren’t because it was a week ago and nobody came. So, if you want to solve the mystery of who stabbed Koothrappali in the back with the weapon of indifference, it was all of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 sheldon_cooper I don’t think thatqualifies as a mystery, we all knew what we were doing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler We’re sorry, Rajesh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Maybe we can do it next week.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Whoa, whoa, we’re not that sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Don’t worry, I can take a hint. No more murder mystery parties.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Hallelujah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Because I’ve got something even better planned.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Aw.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Come on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Just hear me out. I’m going to make you guys a scavenger hunt like they have at M.I.T.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Oh, I loved those. I did them every year there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter We did them at Princeton, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Oh, that’s cute. Like it’s a real college.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 sheldon_cooper That’s amusing, I was going to say that about M.I.T., but it works for Princeton, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Scavenger hunts at Harvard were really tough. I always got stuck on the first challenge, trying to find someone to be on a team with me. I guess that story’s more sad than funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 penny I love scavenger hunts. My friends and I had them all the time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Oh, these are a little different. There’s a tradition at elite universities…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 howard_wolowitz And Princeton.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter A tradition of hunts full of puzzles that rely on logic and obscure knowledge, science.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 penny Oh, in ours we would just run around town looking for a store that would sell us beer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 raj_koothrappali So, uh, who’s in?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter I think it sounds fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Yeah, me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 various#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 I’m in, let’s do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 sheldon_cooper I’m sorry. Are we really doing this or are we tricking Koothrappali again like with the dinner party?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter What’s all this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Oh, everything I could possibly need to win the scavenger hunt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter You really think he’s gonna send us to a bowling alley?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Well, if he does, do you know how filthy those rental balls are? They might as well stand on the corner and give away free rectal exams.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Okay, everybody. Who’s ready for a scavenger hunt? Somewhere in the city of Pasadena, I’ve hidden a golden coin. You will be faced with a total of ten puzzles. Each p… each, each puzzle will lead you to the location of the next, the last of which will lead you to the coin. The first team that finds it wins.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 sheldon_cooper He is a born showman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Any questions?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Yes, to be fair, do people who went to Princeton get a head start?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter It’s not funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 sheldon_cooper No, Oh, it actually is if you get the joke. It’s based on the premise that Princeton isn’t a very good school.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Ha-ha.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Oh, see? Now he gets it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Okay, guys, go ahead and divide yourselves into teams of two.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Should we just do couples?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Couples sounds great. Or we could mix things up. Maybe pick names out of a hat. Whatever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 penny Whoa, whoa, whoa. Why don’t you just admit you don’t want to be on a team with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter I just said, couples sound great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 penny Mm-hmm, yeah, you don’t think I’m smart enough. You think I’m gonna be a liability. Even though I totally just used the word liability correctly in a sentence. Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter All right, let’s, let’s do couples. I want to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 penny No, no. Let’s mix things up. I choose Sheldon, and we’re gonna kick your ass!
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Really? The only time I’m ever picked first for a team and I’m stuck with the liability?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Stop that. Penny is not a liability.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 penny Thank you. Do you want to be on my team?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Maybe we pick names out of a hat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 penny All right, hurry up and close the door so they can’t hear us. Would you stop pouting? So, you picked my name. Get over it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Yes, and do you know what the odds are I’d pick your name?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 sheldon_cooper It’s not hard, one in five. Now you know why I’m pouting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 raj_koothrappali All right, teams. Get ready to open your first puzzle. Go. Do you see what I did? The first puzzle is a puzzle. Oh, my God, how adorable is that? I wish I had a friend like me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 sheldon_cooper What are you doing? You have to start with the edges.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 penny Well, there’s no right way, Sheldon. I already found a few pieces that fit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Yeah, well, take them apart and start with the edges. And stop wasting time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Wow, you’re really good at puzzles.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler I did them all the time as a kid. As my mom used to say, when you’re doing a puzzle, it’s like having a thousand friends. She was full of fun lies like that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 howard_wolowitz If it makes you feel any better, my mom’s just full of pound cake.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler I’m sorry you got stuck with me. I bet you wanted to be with Bernadette.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Have you ever played a game with Bernadette?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Have you ever gone into a steel cage with a wolverine?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Faster, faster, faster! Do you not know that word? It means more fast!
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Stop yelling at me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Hey, you’ll know when I’m yelling at you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 penny Ooh, ooh, it’s the comic book store. All right, come on, that’s where we have to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 sheldon_cooper But we haven’t finished the puzzle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 penny But, it, it doesn’t matter. We know the answer, come on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 sheldon_cooper You think you know the answer. But it could be a trick. What if when the puzzle’s complete, there’s a sign in the window that says go to the train store?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 penny Okay, it’s not gonna say that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Well, I hope you’re wrong. I really want to go to the train store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 howard_wolowitz It’s the comic book store. Let’s go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Come on, numb nuts, it’s the comic book store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 penny It’s the comic book store, it’s the comic book store, it’s the comic book store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 sheldon_cooper It’s the comic book store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Do you think Penny’s mad at me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Because you’re in the right lane behind a bus and you won’t go around it? I’m sure she finds it charming.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter No, because I didn’t want her on my team.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski I’m starting to think she dodged a bullet. The slowest bullet in the world.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Geez, I never realized you were so competitive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, I know. Its, it’s probably because I grew up with five brothers and sisters so I had to fight for every… Oh, my God, you did not just slow down for a bird, you know they fly, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler I think this is the first time we’ve ever actually been alone together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Huh, I guess you’re right. Wonder why that is?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Well, off the top of my head, I’d say we don’t have a lot in common except for the people we’re involved with. Plus, when we first met, Penny warned me never to get into a car alone with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Yeah. You know, I bet you and I have more in common than we think.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Such as?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 howard_wolowitz I don’t know. Tell me some things you like.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Uh, let’s see. I like harps, Little House on the Prairie, medieval poetry, medieval literature…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Hey, how about some music?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Great. Sheldon never lets me listen to music in the car. He doesn’t want to be mistaken for a gang member.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Find something you like.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Beatles, boring. Eminem, scary. Weird Al? How old are you? Neil Diamond?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Yeah, I love Neil Diamond.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler I love Neil Diamond.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 both#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 Sweet Caroline, bum-ba-da, good times never seemed so good, so good, so good, so good. I’ve been inclined…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Oh, hey, thanks for letting me use the comic book store as part of the scavenger hunt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 stuart_bloom Oh, my pleasure. Always happy to help out with fun things that I wasn’t invited to be a part of.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Oh, congratulations. You’re the first team to arrive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Yes, it’s not a ruse to make fun of me. It’s a real game and I’m winning it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Your next puzzle is a riddle. And who better to give it to you than The Riddler?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go! How am I faster than you? I’m in heels and I stopped to take a phone call.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter I have asthma. Back off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Riddle me this. Arrah, Arrah, and gather round, the work of this hero is legion-bound. He multiplies N by the number of He, and in this room the thing you’ll see.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Good riddle, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 stuart_bloom Yeah. So when you guys plan fun activities, does my name even come up, or…?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 raj_koothrappali I invited you to my murder mystery party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 stuart_bloom No, you didn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 penny Ugh, we’re the last ones here, hurry up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 sheldon_cooper It is a marathon, not a sprint.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 penny People run in a marathon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Not with a bowling ball on their back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Hey, Penny, I just wanted to say good luck, and I hope there’s no hard feelings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Hey, Romeo. Repair your relationship on your own time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Relax, it’s a hard puzzle. It’s gonna take a while to solve.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 penny Riddle me this…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Got it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 penny Hey, Princeton, look at that, Team Community College Night School is in the lead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 sheldon_cooper I thought we were the Lightning Sharks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Hey, you know what this could mean .
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, oh, that’s good. Then this would be
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 howard_wolowitz That’s it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler To the Neil Mobile.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski I knew it, we’re gonna lose.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Wait, I got it. I got it/
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Congratulations, you got it last.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter You’re really mean, you know that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 stuart_bloom So no one’s gonna buy anything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 penny Aha. Okay, let’s see. To continue on your quest, leave no stone unturned. Ooh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 sheldon_cooper The next clue must be hidden under one of these rocks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 penny Oh. Okay. Sheldon, I, I’ve got to ask, how did you figure out that it was the geology lab?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Oh, simple, the ‘arrah, ‘arrah in the riddle mean Jan Arrah, a member of the Legion of Superheroes, known as Element Lad. And then the word He, it wasn’t the masculine pronoun, but rather H e, the abbreviation for helium. See where I’m going with this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 penny Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Nice try. Now, Element Lad’s ability is the power to transmute chemical elements. Helium has an atomic number of two. If you multiply that by the atomic number of N, nitrogen, you get 14, which is the atomic number of? I’m just funnin’ you, silicon. And that is the most common element in the Earth’s surface. So that narrowed it down to the geology lab or the chemistry lab.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 penny Wow. I can drink a beer underwater.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 sheldon_cooper And I’m sure your parents are proud. Now, finally, the line in this room the thing you’ll see was an obvious reference to Fantastic Four member The Thing, who’s made entirely of…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 penny Shut up. I solved it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Those are map coordinates. Got ’em. Let’s go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 penny Well, wait. Don’t you want to know how I figured it out?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 sheldon_cooper No one likes a know-it-all, Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 howard_wolowitz On the boats and on the planes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler They’re coming to America.

TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Um, I’m okay with you driving my car. I’m not okay with you flying my car.

TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Uh-huh. Like death?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Your kid may be an honour student but you’re a moron.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Penny’s not answering my texts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Who cares? Focus on the game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter This stupid game is why she’s mad in the first place. I’m telling her I’m quitting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski No. Quitting would be the worst thing for your relationship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Because it would make you seem like something she already thinks you are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter What does she think I am?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski How do I put this? She’s been known to call you a name that usually applies to a lady part. Or a cat. Or a willow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter I can’t believe she would say that about me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski If you’re gonna cry about it there’s tissues in my purse. Unless you got some in yours. Big willow.

TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 penny What? Why me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Because you’ve been training for this your whole life. You live in a pile of dirty laundry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski They’re here first. This is because you made me slow down for that blind guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 penny Okay, the clue must be in the bag.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter The clue must be in the bag.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 penny It’s just a bunch of pants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter It’s just a bunch of pants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 penny You know, I’m surprised you want to copy my answers since I’m not even smart enough to be on your team.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Well, why would you want to be on someone’s team who you like to call a, I can’t even say it in front of Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 penny What are you talking about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter You know exactly what I’m talking about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski No, she doesn’t. I just made that up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Why would you do that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Because you were about to quit like a big, Sheldon, cover your ears.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 sheldon_cooper I’m not a child. I know the word ninny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 penny Yeah, well, you should have quit ’cause I’m still gonna beat your ass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Wish I had a man like her on my team.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Hey, I am every bit as much of a man as Penny. Now, let’s do this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Wait, it’s not all pants, there’s one shirt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 penny Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Hey, that’s my shirt.

TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 penny But wait. So does this one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Maybe the spot’s the clue.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 penny Sheldon’s spot. The coin is in your spot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Oh, that’s clever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 penny Hurry.

TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 penny Well, where the hell’s the coin?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Wasn’t the answer Sheldon’s spot?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Oh, yes, Leonard. Yes, it was.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Then where’s the coin?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Yes, exactly. Where is the coin? Why don’t you look in your pockets? I slipped them in there earlier today.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 penny I don’t get it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Don’t you see? When we’re all having fun together, we’re already winners. Oh, look. See? Even I’m a winner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Are you kidding me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 penny That is the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski You suck so hard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Well, I thought… Come on, I didn’t want anyone to feel bad at the end of the game. And some of those puzzles were really hard and I didn’t know who was gonna get Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 penny Run.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Okay, okay, that-that came out wrong, but you have to admit, you all had a wonderful time.
