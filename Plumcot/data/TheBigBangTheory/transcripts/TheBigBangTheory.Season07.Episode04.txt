TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 sheldon_cooper So what’d you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 amy_farrah_fowler It was good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 sheldon_cooper That’s it? Good”
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 amy_farrah_fowler I enjoyed it. When you told me I was going to be losing my virginity, I didn’t think you meant showing me Raiders of the Lost Ark for the first time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 sheldon_cooper My apologies. I chose my words poorly. I should have said you were about to have your world rocked on my couch. Anyway, thank you for watching it. It’s one of my all-time favourites.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 amy_farrah_fowler It was very entertaining despite the glaring story problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Story problem? You, oh, Amy, what a dewy-eyed moon-calf you are. Raiders of the Lost Ark is the love child of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, two of the most gifted filmmakers of our generation. I’ve watched it 36 times, except for the snake scene and the face-melting scene, which I can only watch when it’s still light out, but, I defy you to find a story problem. Here’s my jaw, drop it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 amy_farrah_fowler All right. Indiana Jones plays no role in the outcome of the story. If he weren’t in the film, it would turn out exactly the same.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Oh, I see your confusion. You don’t understand. Indiana Jones was the one in the hat with the whip.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 amy_farrah_fowler No, I do, and if he weren’t in the movie, the Nazis would have still found the ark, taken it to the island, opened it up and all died, just like they did. Let me close that for ya.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 penny Hi. I thought you went to the comic book store on Wednesdays.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, but Sheldon and Amy were having date night and they don’t need me there to make it awkward. They have each other for that. So, how was school?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 penny Oh, good. Check it out, The Disappointing Child by Beverly Hofstadter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter You bought my mom’s book?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 penny Yeah. It’s on the recommended reading list for my psychology class.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Oh, come on. Not that book. It, it’s got, like, every horrible story from my childhood in it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 penny Oh, cool. Are there pictures?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Seriously, please find another book.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 penny Oh, come on. Why? How bad could it be?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter There, there’s chapters about potty training, and bed-wetting and masturbation. Basically, if something came out of me, she wrote about it. You know what? Do whatever you want, just don’t talk to me about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 penny Not even the chapter on the breast-feeding crisis?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter It was not a crisis. Apparently, I favoured the left one, she got a little lopsided.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 penny Oh, my God, you still go left.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Which celebrity would you say I look like the most?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Halle Berry. Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Stuart and I are putting dating profiles online, and it’s one of the questions. And thank you, I’d kill for that woman’s bone structure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Why are you reading Pride and Prejudice?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 sheldon_cooper I’ll tell you why. Amy ruined Raiders of the Lost Ark for me, so now I’m trying to find something beloved to her and ruin that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Because her life wasn’t enough?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Wait, how can, how can anyone ruin Raiders? It’s perfect.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Yeah, except for the fact that Indiana Jones is completely irrelevant to the story. With or without him, the Nazis find the ark, open it and die.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 dr_beverly_hofstadter Aw!
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Hey, wait a minute. No, the Nazis were digging in the wrong place. The only reason they got the ark was because Indy found it first.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Actually, they were only digging in the wrong place because Indy had the medallion. Without him, they would have had the medallion and dug in the right place.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 dr_beverly_hofstadter Aw!
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 penny Okay, I know you don’t want to talk about it, but can I just ask you one question about your mom’s book?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 penny I just want to know why a five-year-old boy puts on his mom’s make-up and wears balloon boobies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter They weren’t boobies, they were muscles. And the make-up was green. I was pretending to be The Hulk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 penny You were wearing her bra.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter That was to keep my muscles from sagging. Can we please stop talking about this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 penny Okay, okay. But you know, as a student of psychology who got a check-plus on her first homework assignment, I think, sometimes, it’s good to open up about these things.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Okay, fine. Do you want to know why I dressed like The Hulk? Because I was always mad at my mom and I wanted to smash my way out of that house.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 penny Well, why were you so angry?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Gee, I don’t know. Maybe it’s because I was always the subject of her little experiments. Did you get to the chapter where she staged the Easter egg hunt with no eggs to see how long I’d keep looking? The answer, by the way, June.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 penny Sweetie, I’m so sorry. I wish there was something I could do to make you feel better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter I do, too, but there’s not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 penny Really? Are you sure about that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Of course, who am I to argue with a check-plus student? Just warning you, I’m gonna go right. Don’t make a big deal out of it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 stuart_bloom Is make-up really necessary?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Well, when someone looks at your dating profile, the first thing they see is your picture. I just want to make sure you look fun and full of life and not like a body they just pulled out of the river. All right, here we go, and smile. Okay, uh-uh, that one’s in the bank. How about this? Turn away, and then turn back into it. But when you do, imagine the camera is the girl you want to meet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 stuart_bloom You got it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Okay, uh, let’s try it again. Uh, but this time, pretend the girl you want to meet doesn’t want to hurt you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 stuart_bloom I don’t think I can give you that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Come on. One more time. Yeah, it’s, it’s a little blurry, but I think that works in your favour. Do you want a beer?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 stuart_bloom Sure. Hey, have you finished writing your profile yet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Almost. Oh, what did you put as the one-word description of yourself?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 stuart_bloom I put unobjectionable. But now that I hear it out loud, it just seems like I’m being cocky. What did you put for your best feature?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 raj_koothrappali My parents’ money. Uh, what did you put for your best feature?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Come on, dude, you’re being too hard on yourself. You’ve got a lot of good stuff going on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 stuart_bloom Really? Like what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Well, okay, you’re a, you’re a talented artist, you own your own business.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 stuart_bloom Neither of those things have ever helped me meet a woman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Okay, well, can we imply that you’re well-endowed?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 stuart_bloom I do have one oddly long testicle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Okay, now you’re talking like a winner!
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Whatcha doin’?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Oh, it turns out Amy’s beloved Pride and Prejudice is a flawless masterpiece. He’s got too much pride, she’s got too much prejudice, it just works.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter So you’re looking to ruin something for her in the funny pages?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Amy has a fondness for the comic strip Marmaduke.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Mm-hmm. And?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 sheldon_cooper And I think I’ve got it. Consider, a family possesses a dog that is so large and poorly disciplined, he causes nothing but problems. Why do they keep him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Maybe they fell in love with him as a puppy and didn’t know how big he was gonna be.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Of course. You know, why couldn’t she just like Ziggy? Yeah? That thing’s riddled with plot holes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Sorry, buddy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Ooh, I think she’s a fan of Garfield as well. Oh, darn it, now so am I.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter I’ll see you later. I gotta go watch a stupid football game with Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Wait, hang on. You’ve spent time with Amy. Can you think of anything she’s fond of that has a bunch of flaws she hasn’t noticed?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter I gotta go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter You ready to go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 penny Yep. Hey, and maybe this time you don’t try and talk sports with the guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Some sports bar. It’s like they never even heard of Quidditch. Do we really have to go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 penny Oh, come on. Every time we’re about to hang out with my friends, you don’t want to. It’s like, It’s too loud, or the bathroom’s too dirty, or they put a chicken wing in my ear. I mean…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Well, you’re, you’re right. Let’s just go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 penny Hey, what’s going on with you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Nothing, I’m fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 penny All right, hang on. is this still about your mom’s book?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter No. Not everything is about my mom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 penny ‘Cause if you’re still upset about that, we don’t have to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Except this is totally about my mom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 penny I’m so sorry. I never should have read that book. You know what? You want to just get dinner and watch the game here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter That sounds nice. Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 penny Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Or, you know, we could get take-out and watch the Blu-ray extended version of The Hobbit movie with commentary track. On account of how sad I am about my mom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Leonard, you ready for lunch?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter One sec. Hey. Sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Hi, Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 penny Hi. All right, sweetie. You hang in there today.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter I’ll try, but I might be sad again tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 penny Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Wow. Sex at work?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Leave it alone. That’s my girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Who just had sex with me at work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Damn. How’d you swing that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Well, whenever I talk about how awful my mom was, Penny will do anything to make me feel better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Seriously?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Look, I mean, I’m not proud of it, but it does work. I got her to watch a six-part documentary on Monty Python. Even I was bored, I just wanted to see if she’d make it to the end.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 howard_wolowitz You sound kind of proud of it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter I am, I’m really proud.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 amy_farrah_fowler Hello, Sheldon. Is everything okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Yes. Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 amy_farrah_fowler Well, the last time you made an unscheduled video-chat, there was a curly fry in your regular fries and you thought someone might be trying to slip you a mickey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 sheldon_cooper April 13, a dark night, indeed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 amy_farrah_fowler So what can I do for you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 sheldon_cooper I’m calling to invite you to a spontaneous date night tomorrow evening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 amy_farrah_fowler Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Yes. You were kind enough to watch Raiders of the Lost Ark with me. So I’d like to return the favour by inviting you to watch an episode of your favourite childhood television series, Little House on the Prairie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 amy_farrah_fowler That sounds lovely. Why are you rubbing your hands together?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Um, I’m putting on lotion. Are you in or not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 amy_farrah_fowler Of course I’m in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Excellent. Then I shall see you tomorrow. Good night, Dr. Fowler.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 amy_farrah_fowler Good night, Dr. Cooper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Good night, indeed. What a rube. Why would I put on lotion when I have such soft hands?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 bernadette_rostenkowski You were really quiet during dinner. Is everything okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Yeah. I guess I was just thinking about my mom, and how sad my childhood was.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, I bet it sucked. I’m gonna take a bath, you do the dishes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 howard_wolowitz How about I take a bath with you and see what happens.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 bernadette_rostenkowski Here’s what’s gonna happen. I’m gonna take a bath, and you’re gonna do the dishes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 howard_wolowitz That’s it? No compassion?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 bernadette_rostenkowski Aw, poor Howie. We good? I’m gonna take a bath.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Bernie…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 bernadette_rostenkowski God, what is going on with you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 howard_wolowitz I’m sharing my pain.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 bernadette_rostenkowski And I’m not buying it. Try again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 howard_wolowitz I’m learning to be a man in a culture where it’s increasingly difficult to know how?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 bernadette_rostenkowski Strike two.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 howard_wolowitz I’m copying Leonard. When he does this to Penny, they have sex and watch Monty Python.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 bernadette_rostenkowski Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 howard_wolowitz I know. It was dumb, I shouldn’t have done it. And it’s making me feel sad. So sad. You know, why don’t you take a bath? I’ll do the dishes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Three, two, one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 stuart_bloom That’s it. Our dating profiles are live on the Internet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Attention all shoppers, my business is open for business!
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 stuart_bloom That’s right, ladies. For all you know, I’m confident and fun to be around.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Oh, cool, it tells you when someone’s reading your profile. Jenny309. I hope that’s not her weight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 stuart_bloom If it is, I’ll take her. Ooh, I got one, too. The ladies are coming to us. Oh, man, if I’d started this years ago, I’d be divorced two or three times by now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 raj_koothrappali What? Another one. You know, it, it’s weird. When they’re reading your profile, does it, does it make you feel exposed? Like they see you naked?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 stuart_bloom Well, they’re not running away screaming, so, no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 amy_farrah_fowler I love Little House. It made me want to live on a farm so much I tried to milk my cat. That tangy bowl of Cheerios was not worth the stitches.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Well, you sit back, relax and enjoy a beloved childhood memory. You see that cabin there? I read they were illegally squatting on Indian land. Yeah. Personally, I think what we did to the Native Americans was wrong, but this is your favourite show, not mine. Oh, look at little Laura Ingalls, eating that peanut butter sandwich. Peanut butter? Huh? That’s strange, since peanut butter wasn’t introduced until the early 1900s. If I knew this show was about time travel, I would have watched it much sooner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 amy_farrah_fowler You’re trying to get back at me for what I said about Raiders of the Lost Ark.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 sheldon_cooper That’s silly. Almost as silly as Dr. Baker having a telephone, since telephones only existed in large cities at that time. This is more like Little House on the Preposterous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, we’re in a relationship. When you get angry, just tell me. You don’t need to seek revenge.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Are you sure? Every time my dad stayed out all night, my mom would put hamster poop in his chewing tobacco.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 amy_farrah_fowler Well, that’s not how we’re going to do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Fine. I’m mad at you. Not only did you ruin Raiders for me, you may have ruined the whole franchise. Except for the fourth one, which was bad before you got your mitts on it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 amy_farrah_fowler I shouldn’t have said it. I’m sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 amy_farrah_fowler Do you feel better?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 sheldon_cooper Yes. But not as good as I’m going to when I tell you that your precious Garfield has no reason to hate Mondays. He’s a cat. He doesn’t have a job.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Hey, I was just… what is happening?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 penny Oh, just a little treat. I know you’ve been feeling really bad about your mom lately.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Oh, oh, I have. So bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 penny And I wanted to make you feel better, so I planned something very special for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Uh-huh, I can already feel it working.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 dr_beverly_hofstadter Hello, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Mom?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 dr_beverly_hofstadter I understand you have been whining about my parenting in order to emotionally manipulate your girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter I… uh…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 penny Bernadette told me everything. Now you don’t get the left or the right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 dr_beverly_hofstadter Let’s discuss why you continue to involve me in your sex life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Oh, please, Mommy. No, Mommy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 dr_beverly_hofstadter When you were six years old, you walked in on me and your father naked. I was swatting his bottom with your brand new Ping Pong paddle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter I didn’t dream that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 dr_beverly_hofstadter How did that make you feel?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Penny, come back. I’m sad for real now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 raj_koothrappali In the last two hours, 162 women have read our profiles. How many of them have sent us messages?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 stuart_bloom Combined?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 stuart_bloom Zero.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Dude, this is, this is brutal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 stuart_bloom I don’t think I’ve ever felt so rejected. And I had a rescue dog who ran back to the pound.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 raj_koothrappali This is the worst. If we’re gonna get shot down, we might as well just go to a bar and do it old school.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 stuart_bloom And make them look us in the eye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Yeah, anything is better than this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 Not interested.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 raj_koothrappali I was wrong. This is worse.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 howard_wolowitz Wait, wait, if it wasn’t for Indiana Jones, the ark would never have ended up at the warehouse.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 sheldon_cooper That’s true. He collected and delivered the ark to the proper authorities for filing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 raj_koothrappali Like a hero.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 dr_beverly_hofstadter Yeah!
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 leonard_hofstadter Although, technically, Indy was supposed to take the ark to a museum to be studied. He couldn’t even get that done.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode04 dr_beverly_hofstadter Aw!
