TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 penny Awkward silence, Sheldon on his phone, no touching. Somebody’s having date night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 amy It’s actually steamier than it looks. Sheldon’s looking up the phallic symbolism of root vegetables in Renaissance paintings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon Oh, no, I got bored with that. I’m just browsing cuticle scissors on Amazon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 penny How do you not tear off his clothes and take him right here on this table?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon If you do that, I’ll scream.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 amy Sheldon, I have some exciting news to tell you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon That makes two of us. My new cuticle scissors will be here in one to two business days. Come on, one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 amy I’ve been invited to consult on an experiment at your university for a few months. Isn’t that great? We could have lunch together. We could carpool. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon You know, riding with Leonard has gotten a little tedious lately. The only car game he ever wants to play is the Quiet Game. And he’s terrible at it, I always win.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 amy So, you’re okay with this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon Well, why wouldn’t I be?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 amy Well, this project would have us working in close proximity to one another. And there’s the vulgar adage that one should not defecate where one eats.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon My father used to say that all the time. That and, um, who does one have to orally gratify to get a drink around here? But what does that have to do with you working at the university?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 amy Sheldon, don’t defecate where you eat means don’t have a romantic relationship in the workplace.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 amy Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon Huh. Yeah, I always took it literally. That’s why I have never once moved my bowels in this or any restaurant. Hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 amy I’m relieved that you don’t have a problem with us working together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon Not as relieved as I’m about to be. It’s a brave new world, little lady.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 howard Are you crazy? You don’t want your girlfriend at work with you. Hell Clam.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon Why not? Hairy Fairy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 raj I think it could be romantic. You know, my parents met at his place of work. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 leonard Your father’s a gynaecologist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 raj I know. What started as a pap smear turned into a date. Which turned into her working there, which turned into marriage, which then turned into hatred, which continues to this day. Two-Eyed Cyclops.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 howard Would you please tell him this isn’t a good idea?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 leonard No, no, I think it’ll be great. Maybe next time he gets conjunctivitis at work, she can hold his head and try to put the drops in his eyes. Giant baby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon That’s a Raging Ogre.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 leonard Yeah, I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 howard I’m just saying, I’d never want to work with Bernadette. Can you imagine seeing someone all day long and then you’re supposed to hang out with them after work, too?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 raj Hold on. We do that all the time. You and I work together and play together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 howard Yeah, I know, and it drove me into the arms of another woman. Bipolar Bear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon Well, I appreciate your concern, but I won’t be seeing any more of Amy than I already do. I assume we’ll deduct any extra time we spend together at work from our weekly quota.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 leonard Please let me be there when you tell her that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon Why? So you can see the look on Amy’s face when she hears my top-notch idea?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 leonard Please, oh, please, just let me be there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 bernadette So, Amy, what are you gonna be working on at Caltech?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 amy I’m leading a study to see if deficiency of the monoamine oxidase enzyme leads to paralyzing fear in monkeys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 bernadette If they’re anything like humans, the answer’s yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 amy Wait, you’ve, you’ve done this experiment on humans?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 bernadette You mean like death row inmates with nothing to lose? No, that would be unethical.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 penny You know, not a lot of people know this, but the monoamine oxidase enzyme was discovered by a woman, Mary Bernheim. That’s right, my phone is just as smart as you guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon Amy, Bernadette, Penny. Amy, Bernadette, Penny. Amy, Bernadette, Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 bernadette He’s never gonna stop doing that, is he?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 amy I don’t mind. I’m hoping to put his love of repetition to good use someday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon Hi. Um, I’ve reconsidered. Uh, you can’t work where I work. Enjoy the rest of your evening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 amy Sheldon. I already signed the contract. I cashed a cheque. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon Mmm, you are not going to come out of this looking good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 penny Sheldon, I don’t understand. I thought you said you were fine with it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon Well, I was. But that was before Howard explained to me how awful it would be if he had to work with his significant other.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 bernadette He said what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon Now, don’t be insulted. He just thinks too much of you would be mind-numbingly tedious. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 bernadette Excuse me, I need to have a chat with my husband.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon Yeah, well, now, well, keep it short. From what I gather, brevity is your friend. So, are we good here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 amy No, we’re not good here. I am working on this project.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 penny Yeah, and you can’t tell her what she can and cannot do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon Last week, you told Leonard he couldn’t wear his Wookie jacket out in public.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 penny That’s different. I’m not going to the mall with someone dressed like a dumb space bear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 amy Sheldon, you don’t have to worry about me bothering you. I’ll be in a different building. And we don’t even have to have lunch together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 amy Yes. Before all things, I’m a scientist. I’m just there to do my work and, with a little luck, scare the living crap out of some monkeys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon Hmm. You sure your mothlike personality won’t be drawn to this blazing fire that is myself?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 amy More and more sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon Well, then, you have my permission.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 amy I didn’t ask for your permission.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon Too late. No backsies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 howard No, no, listen to me. Sheldon misunderstood. What I meant was, if we worked together, there’d be too much of me for you, not the other way around.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon Howard, if you’re going to lie to your wife, don’t start the sentence with Sheldon misunderstood. That’s a dead giveaway.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 bernadette Well?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 howard Okay, fine. I did say that, and I think it’s true. I think if we worked together and lived together, we’d get sick of each other.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon Yeah, but to be fair, he only said the part about him getting sick of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 howard For the love of God, why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 bernadette What exactly do you think you’d get sick of?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 raj His only options here are to fake a heart attack or have a real one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 howard It’s nothing in particular. I…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 bernadette Is it my voice? Am I too bossy? What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 howard My arm is feeling numb.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 leonard Nailed it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 bernadette That’s the wrong arm for a heart attack, doofus. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 howard My point is, I’m sure there are things about me that would drive you crazy if you had to deal with them all day long.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 bernadette Like looking me in the eye and lying to me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 howard Oh, well, come on, where am I supposed to look when I lie to you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 bernadette Find somewhere else to sleep tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 howard Bernie…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon If it makes you feel any better, Amy and I are fine. I mean, really good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 leonard So, boys, how was the pyjama party? You guys jump on the bed and sing into hair brushes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 raj It wasn’t a pyjama party. It was just a couple of bros hanging out, giggling, eating cookie dough and watching Princess Bride.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 howard Please, stop talking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 raj As you wish.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 howard I mean, you know, Sheldon, none of this would’ve happened if I hadn’t tried to help you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon Uh, it also wouldn’t have happened if, in the early universe, hydrogen was a little more common or a little less common. This is fun. Your turn.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 amy Gentlemen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 raj Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 leonard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 leonard That was kind of icy. You two okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon Oh, we’re fine. As Howard advised, she’s merely respecting our professional boundaries.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 leonard Smart. Take relationship advice from a man who spent last night braiding Raj’s hair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon Yeah, you make a good point. It would appear I was worried for nothing. Look at her, desperately wishing she was over here at the cool table. Don’t worry, little moth. The flame will come to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 raj Oh, uh, on the off chance that Bernadette doesn’t call back and apologize, how do you feel about Mexican food for dinner tonight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 howard I don’t know. Sounds kind of heavy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 raj That’s ’cause you always fill up on chips.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 amy And this is Dr. Gunderson from Stockholm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon Ah, Sweden. Yeah, home of my favourite Muppet and, uh, second favourite meatball. Okay, the Nordic reputation for lack of humour is well-founded. Boy, is his name Gunderson or No-Funderson?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 amy Where are we going with this, Dr. Cooper?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon Oh, please, I’m your boyfriend. You call me Sheldon. That’s right, I am in a boy-girl relationship with this cute little lump of wool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 amy Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon It’s a physical relationship, too. Hand-holding, hugging, even on hot days. Ow. Okay, here’s a new one. Apparently now we kick each other in the shin under the table. How do you like it when I do it to you? Not so much, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 amy Test subject D7, aka Betsy, fear response study. Image number one, Frenchman on bicycle carrying baguettes. No visible reaction. Image number two, sousaphone. Still no reaction. Okay. Let’s kick things up a notch. Image number three, crocodile with a mouthful of monkeys. Okay, now we’re talking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon Dr. Fowler?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 amy What do you want, Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon Well, I’m done with work, so… ugh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 amy Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry. Sorry, uh, better?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon Oh, baguettes. Yes, I like baguettes. What exactly are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 amy Determining baseline fear levels in capuchin monkeys by measuring their response to visual stimuli.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon So, goofing off. As I was saying, I’m done with work and Leonard’s not. So good news, you get to take me home. Play your cards right, I’ll let you drive me past the lot where the buses park at night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 amy I can’t leave now, Sheldon. I’m very busy. Besides, why would I want to do you a favour after the way you treated me in the cafeteria? Image number four, boa constrictor. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon What on earth are you talking about? My behaviour in the cafeteria was delightful. Maybe your friend Gunderson needs to head over to IKEA and assemble a sense of humour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 amy You embarrassed me in front of my colleagues on my first day here. Image number five, kitten in a teacup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon Aw. Embarrassed you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 amy You know what? I don’t have time for this. Find another way home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon I’m starting to get the sense that you’re angry with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 amy Really? What tipped you off?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon Couple things, actually. Your tone of voice, your body language…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 amy Get out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon Well, now, that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 amy Image number six, woman giving birth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon Bleugh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 leonard It’s nine o’clock, where you been?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon Oh, I had to take the bus home. Fell asleep and missed my stop.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 penny Oh, no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon Did you know that Los Angeles has a Little Sri Lanka?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 leonard I did not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon Well, I do now. They’re a lovely people. Although terrifying when you wake up face-to-face with them. If you’re hungry, I brought home some mutton and coconut milk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 penny Why’d you get that? You hate lamb.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon I was asking for directions. Apparently, there was a communication problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 leonard I thought Amy was gonna drive you home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon Yeah, I thought so, too, but she’s acting very strangely. I was discussing it with a Sri Lankan fellow on the bus, and he hypothesized that a tiger may have recently run across her shadow. Although he may have just been trying to drum up business for his brother-in-law’s witch doctor practice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 penny Okay, Sheldon, what happened between you and Amy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon Well, can you believe she said I embarrassed her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 penny Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon But you didn’t even hear the details.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 leonard Sheldon, I’ve known you a long time, and I’m going to tell you this with all the love I can possibly muster. Amy’s right. You’re wrong.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon But you don’t even know…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 leonard Doesn’t matter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon But, now, but in my defence…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 leonard Doesn’t matter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon You’re not listening to my side of it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 penny Okay, fine, Sheldon. What is your side?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon Well…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 penny Nope, got to go with Amy on this one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 howard Ooh, shrimp was spicy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 raj You want a TUMS?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 howard You got the tropical fruit kind?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 raj No, if I buy those, I just go through them like candy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 howard Tell me about it. One time, I swear I pooped out a stick of chalk. I’ll get it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 raj Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 bernadette Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 howard Oh, hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 bernadette I may have overreacted.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 howard Yeah, well, I didn’t handle it so great, either.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 bernadette It’s just sometimes I feel like you enjoy spending time with your friends more than with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 howard That’s not true.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 bernadette It’s not? You spend all day together at work, and then you all hang out at night playing games, going to the comic book store. Last week, you two got a couples massage. So, when you said you wouldn’t want to spend that much time with me, it really hurt my feelings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 howard Oh, wow. Yeah, no, I get that. I’m so sorry. Starting tomorrow, I am turning over a new leaf. Time with you is my number one priority.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 bernadette Why tomorrow?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 howard Well, we’re real close to finishing off the new Batman game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 raj It is awesome. Uh, you should probably go after her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 howard Should I go after you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 bernadette No!
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 howard Thanks for getting me in trouble.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon Amy. Amy. Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 amy Sheldon, what are you doing here so late?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon I couldn’t sleep because I kept thinking about what happened earlier between us. Also, I had one heck of a bus nap. Oh, speaking of which, do you want some mutton and coconut milk?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 amy No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon Well, I cannot give this stuff away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 amy What do you want?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon Amy, this isn’t easy to say. All relationships are difficult, but even more so when you’re in one with a person who struggles with everyday social interactions. And frankly, who can strike some people as being kind of a weirdo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 amy Sheldon, you’re not a weirdo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon I wasn’t speaking about me. I mean, honestly, there’s no telling what will set you off. You know, introducing myself as your boyfriend. Giving you the opportunity to drive me home. Breaking the ice with your colleagues using ethnic humour, the funniest kind of humour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 amy What’s your point?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon My point is, we’re a couple, and I like you for who you are, quirks and all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 amy I like you, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 sheldon Well, I should hope so. I don’t see anyone else banging on this door to put up with your nonsense. Not even a good-bye? You see, that’s the kind of thing that makes people think you’re weird. Poor kid. She just doesn’t see it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 bernadette I’m not apologizing to Howard. He can come beg me on his knees.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 amy Sheldon, too. If I see him at work, I’m just going to ignore him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 penny All right, don’t worry. I talked to Leonard. He is gonna sit the guys down and set them straight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 leonard Laser’s warmed up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 howard Pull.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode05 all Yeah!
