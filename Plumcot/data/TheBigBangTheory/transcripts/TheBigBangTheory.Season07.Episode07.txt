TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler I’ve never seen him this happy before.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter That’s because you’ve never seen him on restock the medicine cabinet day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Look. A new topical antihistamine with lidocaine. Wow. I can’t wait until I get a rash.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Oh, Gas-X has a new ultra strength. I guess they really do read their mail.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Hey, isn’t that Professor Proton?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Oh, yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Look at him, just standing in line like he wasn’t moderately famous 30 years ago. Let’s go say hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Oh, maybe we shouldn’t bother him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 sheldon_cooper I’m not going to bother him, I’m going to talk to him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter He thinks there’s a difference.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Arthur? Arthur, it’s me, Sheldon Cooper. You may not remember because of your advanced age.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 arthur_jeffries Trust me, I, I remember.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 sheldon_cooper This is my girlfriend, Amy. Amy, this is television legend Arthur Jeffries. His science show inspired millions of children.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 arthur_jeffries Hold, hold, hold on. You, you have a girlfriend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler Yes, and I’ve heard so much about you. Hey look, we’re wearing the same orthopaedic shoes. I can’t believe I dress like a celebrity.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 arthur_jeffries Oh, okay, I get it now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Dr. Jeffries, hello again. Leonard Hofstadter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 arthur_jeffries Oh, oh, right, I remember your, your girlfriend. Is, is she, is she here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter No, she’s not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 sheldon_cooper So, what prescription are you getting filled?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 sheldon_cooper No. Wait, I want to guess. Don’t tell me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 arthur_jeffries I wasn’t going to tell you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, come on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 sheldon_cooper No, no, no. I’m really good at this. All right, give me a hint. Does it involve difficulty initiating a stream of anything?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 arthur_jeffries Well, given my age, that’s more than just a lucky guess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Hey, Sheldon, let’s go mock the people buying homeopathic medicine, you love that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 sheldon_cooper But I’m hanging out with my friend, and we’re having fun. Look how happy he is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Bernie’s having a girls’ night on Friday at our place. You want to do something?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Actually, I’m busy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Doing what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 raj_koothrappali There’s a new sports bar over on Colorado Ave…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 howard_wolowitz You’re going to girls’ night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 howard_wolowitz You know they’re making jewellery right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 raj_koothrappali You think they came up with that? They were going to drink beer and play darts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter What’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Not his testosterone levels.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Excuse me. I happen to be very comfortable with my masculinity.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 howard_wolowitz How is that possible?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Hey, I got an email from Professor Proton.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Goody. What’s it say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter He’s working on a paper about nano vacuum tubes, and wants to know if I’d take a look at it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 sheldon_cooper That’s strange. That he would come to you for that and not me. Oh, I got two emails from him. Do you have Leonard’s email address? And. Never mind, I found it. I can’t believe he picked you over me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 howard_wolowitz You don’t want to read a paper by some old has-been who hasn’t done any real science in decades.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Yeah, it’s nothing to cry about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Sheldon Cooper does not cry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 howard_wolowitz It’s true, you’d rust.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 sheldon_cooper And to think I idolized that man. And why? At the end of the day he’s just another Hollywood phony.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler Is it really worth getting upset about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Yeah, they say don’t meet your heroes. Don’t peek behind that curtain of fame and celebrity, because if you do, you’ll see them as they really are, degenerate carnival folk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler Come on, he’s a retired kids show host.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 sheldon_cooper That’s even worse. Using the sweet candy of science to trick children into loving him. Pervert.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler Have you ever thought about why Arthur didn’t want you to read his paper?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Yes, I have. And my only conclusion is the prescription he was picking up the other day was for cuckoo pills.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler Maybe he found you, um, a bit much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 sheldon_cooper That’s kind of a stretch. Look, when it comes to social skills, I’ve mastered the big three. There’s the coy smile. There’s the friendly chuckle. There’s the vocalization of sympathy. Aw. That last one’s tricky, I’m still working on it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler From what I saw the other day, I could understand why he and some people might find you…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 sheldon_cooper What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler Doesn’t matter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 sheldon_cooper No, go ahead, say it. I know what it is. I’ve heard it my whole life. The word’s annoying. Go ahead, say it. Say it. Say I’m annoying.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Oh, it won’t hurt my feelings. Go ahead, Amy, say I’m annoying. I’m annoying. I’m annoying. I’m annoying. Yeah, now, uh, now where are you going? Look, you know you want to say it, say it. Say I’m annoying. Go ahead, say it. Say it. Say it. Amy, say it. Well, she can’t stand it when I’m right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler This is fun. I’m going to feel like such a vixen wearing jewellery that doesn’t have a list of medications I’m allergic to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Penny, how’s it going over there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 penny Good, I’m just having little trouble with the glue.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler How do you not know how to use glue? Did you ditch pre-school?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 penny Yeah, but only because I was dating a second grader.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Hello, everyone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Okay, let me have it. Let’s hear all the Raj is a girl jokes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Nope. Bernadette told me it isn’t nice and I’m not allowed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 howard_wolowitz So I won’t be making fun of you, or the things you like, or the fact that you just want to have fu-un.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 bernadette_rostenkowski Howie, stop. Come on, look at what I’m making.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Oh, that’s actually pretty nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler I’m making a bracelet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 penny Yeah, I’m just making a mess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 howard_wolowitz You know, instead of beads and glue, you guys can use my soldering iron. You’d be able to make much cooler stuff.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Oh, I think we’re doing just fine, thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler Actually, I’d kind of like to try that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 bernadette_rostenkowski Me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Be right back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 penny When did I have pistachios?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Arthur. Arthur. Arthur. Door knocker. That’s TV money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 arthur_jeffries Sheldon, what are you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 sheldon_cooper I’m sorry, did I wake you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 arthur_jeffries Of course you woke me, it’s seven thirty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Well, I would have been here sooner, but for some reason your home isn’t on this map of Hollywood stars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 arthur_jeffries What do you want, Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 sheldon_cooper It’s been pointed out by my girlfriend that I may have been annoying to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 arthur_jeffries She sounds like a keeper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Anyway, I wanted to apologize. I am truly sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 arthur_jeffries All right, apology accepted. Have a nice night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 sheldon_cooper No, no, now that we’ve cleared the air, I wanted to discuss another matter with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 arthur_jeffries Sheldon, in a couple hours I have to get up, pee and then wander around the house.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Well, then, I’ll make this quick. Um, I want to talk about the paper you sent Leonard. Now, I know he said it’s promising and he’s going to collaborate on it, but now that you and I are friends again, I am at your disposal. And, um, frankly, lending my name and reputation to it will help, because a lot of people think that you’re a washed-up has-been. Or dead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 arthur_jeffries I should be so lucky.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 sheldon_cooper So, uh, what do you say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 arthur_jeffries You know, if it’s all the same with you, I, I think I’ll, I’ll stick with Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 sheldon_cooper It’s because I’m annoying, right? I know it is. Say it. Say it. Say I’m annoying.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 arthur_jeffries Good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Say it. Arthur, say it. Say I’m annoying. Say it. Say it. I’m annoying. Say it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 arthur_jeffries You’re annoying.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Well, that really hurt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter If you would have told me when I was a kid that someday I would be doing science next to Professor Proton, I would not have believed you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 arthur_jeffries If someone had told me that people would still call me Professor Proton when I was 83 years old, I never would have quit smoking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter I’m sorry, Dr. Jeffries, I’m just excited. This nano vacuum tube idea of yours is, it’s really interesting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Hello, Leonard. Oh, hello, Arthur. What an odd coincidence that you’re both here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Why is it odd?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Because as it just so happens, I’m also spending the day with a beloved children’s television science personality. Isn’t that right, new friend and colleague Bill Nye the Science Guy. Sorry, I replaced you with a newer model.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 bill_nye Wow, Arthur Jeffries. It’s an honour to meet you. My show never would have happened without yours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 arthur_jeffries That’s what I told my lawyers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Mr. Nye, hello. I’m sorry he got you involved in this nonsense.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 bill_nye He said I’d be speaking to a class.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 sheldon_cooper No, I said you were teaching someone a lesson. Now let’s go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 bill_nye What are you guys working on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Oh, uh, we’re making nano vacuum tubes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 bill_nye Oh, that’s interesting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 arthur_jeffries Haven’t you stolen enough from me? Back off, bow tie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 penny Hey, guys, what do you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler Wow, Penny, good job.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 penny Thanks. Target, four ninety-nine. I’m getting a drink.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler What are you working on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Ah, I’m making a necklace for my mom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler That’s sweet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Yeah, she and my dad are going through a bit of a rough patch, so I wanted to do something to let her know I was thinking about her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 penny What’s going on with them?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 raj_koothrappali They’re just having a little trouble communicating. My dad says it’s because the sound of my mom’s voice makes him want to tear his ears off and sew them over his eyes so he never has to look at her again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 bernadette_rostenkowski Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 penny Hey, guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Look who’s here to put the Jew in jewellery night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, sure, so it’s fine when you say it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Sorry we’re late. I wanted to swing by the lab and pick up some even cooler tools for us to use.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 raj_koothrappali I didn’t know you were coming again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Well, last week was a blast. Plus, I thought you might like having a guy here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 penny It was not funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler So, what tools did you bring?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Everything we need to make jewellery moulds. Here’s some silver, a crucible and an acetylene torch to melt it down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 penny Ooh, that looks like fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 bernadette_rostenkowski Maybe you should master glue before you move on to fire.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Okay, who’s up first?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler Rajesh, do you want to make a bracelet for your mom to go with the necklace?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 raj_koothrappali No, thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 howard_wolowitz I was gonna make a necklace for my mom, but unfortunately she doesn’t have a neck. She’s just chins and fat and feet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Okay, we’re almost ready to go. Once we bond the wires, we can test the tubes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 arthur_jeffries This is so exciting, I, I feel like I’m 75 again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Oh, God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 arthur_jeffries What, what is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon just sent me a picture of him and Bill Nye getting smoothies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 arthur_jeffries Can, can I ask you a question?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 arthur_jeffries Why do you put up with Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Oh, uh, you know, because we’re friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 arthur_jeffries Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Wow, you ask really hard questions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 arthur_jeffries Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Look, I know he can be aggravating, but what you have to remember is that he’s not doing it on purpose. It’s just how he is. But he’s also loyal and trustworthy and we have fun together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 arthur_jeffries You, you know you’re describing a dog.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter He did bite me once. But in his defence, I came up behind him while he was eating, so…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 arthur_jeffries Yeah, they, they hate that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter You know what, Sheldon is the smartest person I have ever met. And he’s a little broken and he needs me. I guess I need him, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 arthur_jeffries Why, why is that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Boy, you will not let this go, will you? Oh, jeez.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 arthur_jeffries Another photo from Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter No, I have to go pick him up. Bill Nye ditched him at the smoothie place.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 arthur_jeffries He probably stole his wallet, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 howard_wolowitz You know, if you guys are interested, there’s a technique where I can take a lock of your hair, refine it into carbon dust and use the hydraulic press at work to turn it into a tiny little diamond with your DNA in it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 penny Oh, that’s amazing,
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Yeah. See Bernie’s engagement ring? That came right off my mom’s back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 bernadette_rostenkowski He’s kidding. If that were true, it’d be so much bigger.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 raj_koothrappali My name is Howard. I can make your hair into diamonds. My mom is morbidly obese. Everybody love me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Whoa, where is that coming from?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 raj_koothrappali I’ll tell you where it’s coming from. All you do is make fun of me for coming to girls’ night and now you’re here ruining it for everyone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 penny Raj, cool it, he’s gonna make us hair diamonds.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 howard_wolowitz How am I ruining anything? I’m just trying to help you make better jewellery.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 raj_koothrappali But this isn’t about the jewellery. This is about me having a place where I can open up about my feelings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Since when can’t you open up with me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 raj_koothrappali There are just some things that I feel more comfortable sharing with the girls, because they won’t make fun of me or and call me names, or ask me if my Koothrapanties are in a bunch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Buddy, I was just joking around.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Yeah, well, sometimes your jokes hurt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 howard_wolowitz You’re right. I didn’t realize I was making you feel that way. It was very brave of you to tell me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Thank you. It wasn’t easy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler They’re gonna have sex before Sheldon and I do, I know it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Arthur?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 arthur_jeffries Hi, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 sheldon_cooper I’m surprised to see you here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 arthur_jeffries Yeah, me, too. Somewhere around the third floor I began to see a, a white light.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 sheldon_cooper I’ll get Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 arthur_jeffries No, no, no, I’m, I’m here, I’m here to see you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 sheldon_cooper If you’re hoping to get in touch with Bill Nye, I can’t help you. I’ve been informed that he’s now Bill Nye the Restraining Order Guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 arthur_jeffries No, I, I, I was thinking, if it isn’t too much trouble, I’d like to get your opinion about my, my paper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Thank you. It would be an honour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 arthur_jeffries Oh. Uh, great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Actually, I don’t need that. I hacked into your e-mail account and read it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 arthur_jeffries And, what did you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Well, first, I think the fact that you use your birthday as a password is embarrassing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 arthur_jeffries Mmm. Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Second, um, I thought your paper was inspired.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 arthur_jeffries Oh, well, that, that means a lot to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Can I invite you in for tea?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 arthur_jeffries Uh, no, no. I, I really, I have, I have to run.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 penny Hey, Arthur. How are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 arthur_jeffries Well, I guess one cup wouldn’t hurt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Oh, hey, buddy, what’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Well, I was feeling bad about how I acted the other night so I made you a little something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 howard_wolowitz You didn’t have to do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Well, it was fun. I used some of the jewellery techniques you taught us. It’s a lightsabre belt buckle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Wow, this is so cool. Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Oh gets better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Wow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 raj_koothrappali And that’s not even the best part. See? I have one, too. Check it out. You can wear yours and we can have little sword fights whenever we want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Yeah, and my eighth favourite episode of Professor Proton was Alka-Seltzer rocket. You said, plop, plop, fizz, fizz, oh, what a blast-off it is. Remember? Remember that? Remember?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter He can’t help it. He can’t. He really can’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Oh, wait here. I’ll get some Alka-Seltzer, we can build that rocket, and we can shoot it at Bill Nye’s house. As long as I’m not within 500 feet of it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 arthur_jeffries So, you, uh, you have, you have any, single grandmothers?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 penny Sorry, they’re both married.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 arthur_jeffries Good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 penny Mmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode07 arthur_jeffries Hap, hap, happily?
