TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard The math is all there. It’s not real.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Yes, it is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon Yeah,uh, look, it is scientifically impossible for a person to tip a cow. Even you, with your stocky build and lumberjack shoulders, you couldn’t do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 raj It’s horrible. Why would you push a cow over? They’re sacred.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Oh, stop it. I’ve seen you eat, like, a million hamburgers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 raj Hey, an animal can be both sacred and delicious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Look, I’m telling you I’ve done it, okay? I clearly remember the cow standing up and then the cow on its side.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard Were you drunk?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny I was 16 in Nebraska. What do you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard I think you’re the one who fell over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny That would explain why the sky was also on its side.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Howard. Cow tipping. Real or not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard Mmm. I’m gonna say not. That’s just based on me trying to roll my mom over when she’s snoring. Speaking of that big side of beef, uh, she’s invited all of you to Thanksgiving at her house.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon Mmm. You know, I’ve been told that a bald refusal of an invitation is rude and one must instead offer up a polite excuse, so I’d love to go, but, unfortunately, that sounds awful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard Come on, it’ll be fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Uh, we were actually gonna do it here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard Please? Bernadette’s bringing her dad ’cause her mom’s out of town, and I never have anything to say to that guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon Oh, since you put it that way, I’d love to go, but that sounds even more awful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard It’d actually be nice to not hear Sheldon complain about my cooking all day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon Uh, excuse me, but every year you prepare a terrible meal and every year I criticize it. Do our traditions mean nothing to you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard I want to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Yeah, me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 raj I’m in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon Ugh, fine, I’ll go. But if her food is delicious, Thanksgiving is ruined, and it’s on you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon Do we really have to go to Mrs. Wolowitz’s house?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 amy We do. And I expect you to be on your best behaviour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon Now I know how the African slaves felt. Being dragged from their homes to labour under the yoke of the white man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 amy Are you honestly comparing Thanksgiving dinner at Wolowitz’s mom’s with one of the greatest tragedies in the history of mankind?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Sheldon, you can have a nice Thanksgiving anywhere. I spent one in Vegas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard You did?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Yeah, back when I was dating Zack. It was actually more fun than I thought. We gambled, we went to one of those cheesy wedding chapels, we had a really good turkey dinner. Which was surprising, since we were at a strip club.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard Wait, you went to a chapel?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Yeah. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard Why? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny We had one of those silly fake weddings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard Penny, you know those are real, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny No, they’re not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard Yeah, they are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny No, they’re not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard Yeah, they are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon He’s right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 amy They’re real.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny But it didn’t seem real.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon Let me ask you a question. At any point, was Las Vegas on its side?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 bernadette Hi, Dad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike Hi, honey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 bernadette Oh, you brought beer for everybody.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike Uh, okay, yeah, it’s for everybody. I really just wanted to have a nice, quiet day at home and watch the game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 bernadette You can have a quiet day and watch the game here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mrs_wolowitz Howard, the medicine’s not working.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard You just took it. At least let it reach your first stomach. Hey, Mike. Let me help you out, there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike Thanks. What’s wrong with your mom?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard Oh, her gout’s flaring up. Turns out an apple pie a day does not keep the doctor away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mrs_wolowitz How can one little toe hurt so bad? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard Maybe because that little piggy is being crushed by the barn. She should quiet down soon. I gave her enough pain meds to choke a, well, her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 bernadette I guess we’re gonna have to do all the cooking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard I have a better idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 bernadette If you think you’re gonna make me do all this by myself, you’re crazy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard I was gonna make Raj do it all by himself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 bernadette Oh, well, that’s a great idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 amy No traffic, we’re sailing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon Yes. Like we’re on a ship. Coming from Africa to America.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 amy Sheldon, that’s completely inappropriate. You can’t keep comparing yourself to a slave.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon Yes, Miss Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard I can’t believe you’re married to that idiot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Ugh, would you stop? We just did it as a goof.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard Well, a goof or not, you’re actually married. You need to get this taken care of.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny I will. Why are you making this such a big deal?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon Oh, oh, oh, I have a reason. It could be because you said yes to marrying Zack, but every time Leonard’s proposed, he’s gotten a resounding no. Yeah, that’s just off the top of my head.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny So how do I undo this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard I’m hoping you can get an annulment. It’s just like it never happened.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Great, well, what do I have to do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 amy It says here you can get an annulment if any of the following conditions are met. Were you unable to consummate the marriage?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon Hah!Penny? Next.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 amy Is there any evidence of fraud, bigamy, want of understanding?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Want of understanding? What does that even mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 amy Ding, ding, ding. We have a winner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 bernadette Thanks for saving the day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 raj Ah, no problem. It wouldn’t be Thanksgiving without an Indian providing the food. Uh, now, where does your mom keep the Crisco?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard Um, I don’t know. Probably in a wad in her cheek.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 bernadette I’ll help Raj in here. Why don’t you go keep my dad company?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard He doesn’t want me in there. I’m the creepy little guy who has sex with his daughter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 bernadette Don’t be silly, he loves you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard Does he?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 bernadette Okay, he cares about you a lot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 bernadette I do crap for you all the time. Get out there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard So your wife’s in Arizona with the grandkids?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike Uh-huh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard You know, my mom’s been to Arizona. She rode one of those mules down in the Grand Canyon. Long story short, they had to shoot it. ‘Cause she’s so fat. I’ll get the door while you finish laughing. Hey, guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 amy Happy Thanksgiving.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon It smells wonderful. Is anyone slaving away in the kitchen? Because I, too, know…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 amy Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Here. Thank you for having us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard What’s with you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard Oh, she’s mad at me because she just found out she’s married to Zack.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard Really? That dumb-ass she used to date? That’s hysterical.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny I can’t believe I felt bad for opening this in the car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 amy You need any help?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 raj Uh, yeah, can you, uh, reach that, uh, gravy boat up there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 amy Uh, sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 raj Great. That makes one of you. Okay, we have a lot to do and not much time to do it. Bernadette, you’re on corn, gravy and yam detail. Amy, you’re on rolls, cranberries and making sure Bernadette stays away from the marshmallows. That’s right, I see you. Okay, if you have any questions, I’ll be over here basting my ass off. Focus is key.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 amy Did you guys know Penny married Zack three years ago?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 together What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard You ever play football?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike A little in college. You?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard No. But I did get tackled in the hallway once. The whole school cheered.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard Okay, I found the, uh, court papers that you and Zack need to fill out. I’ll print them when we get home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard And we can just put this whole thing behind us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Are you done?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Look, I get it, I screwed up. Is this all we’re gonna talk about the rest of the day?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard Why are you mad at me? You’re the one that did the stupid thing. I’m just trying to fix it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Ugh, I need some air.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard Wuh, Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon I don’t know the first thing about women, but I would not follow her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike Listen to Stretch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard How am I the bad guy? She’s the one who married someone else. I’m the victim.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard Sounds like Zack’s the victim. You’re sleeping with his wife.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike I’ve kept my marriage together for 35 years. Can I weigh in here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike I’m trying to watch the game. Shut up. Oh, how do you not make a first down there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon They passed against a nickel defence. They should have run it off-tackle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike How the hell do you know that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon My father loved football. He always made me watch it before I was allowed to do my homework.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Well, you’ll be happy to know I just spoke to Zack and he’s willing to sign the court papers. He’s on his way here now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard Wait, you invited him here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Yeah. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike I’m getting ready to weigh in again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard Come on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike What do you think they ought to do now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon I would throw a quick slant to a wideout, given that the defence is showing blitz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard Oh, I love a good blitz, especially with sour cream. Get it? ‘Cause it sounds like blintz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mrs_wolowitz Did someone say blintz?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard I just don’t understand why you invited him here today.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Because you wouldn’t shut up about it. When I called him, he had nothing to do, so I just thought it would…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 raj Hey, guys, I’m trying to cook in here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Oh, sorry. We’ll keep it down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 raj No, no, speak up. I’m about to use the blender, and I don’t want to miss anything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard Well, you might have to cook for one more because she invited Zack.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 bernadette What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 amy Ooh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 raj My, my. The plot, like my gravy, thickens.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon I don’t care for your mother’s bathroom. There’s not an angle to do one’s business without a clown figurine staring at you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard That’s why I sit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike Yeah, that’s why. You remember the Thanksgiving game when it snowed in Dallas?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon 1993. Leon Lett blew the game in the final seconds and the Dolphins emerged victorious. Then I finally got to do my calculus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike I was so pissed, I wanted to shoot my TV.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon So was my dad. And then he did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard Anyone need a beer?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard Thank God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike So, does your dad still live in Texas?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon No. He died when I was 14.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike I’m sorry to hear that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon So was the man who owned the local liquor store. He cried and cried.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard Here you go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike Oh, thanks. So, if your dad died when you were 14, you were never old enough to have a beer with the man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon No, sir. He did try to give me one for my high school graduation, but I was 11 and my mom said no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike Well, you’re having one with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike To your dad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard I never had a beer with my dad, either.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon Do you mind? We’re having a moment here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 amy I can’t believe Penny’s married to Zack.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 raj Wonder what she saw in that guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 bernadette I don’t know. He’s sweet, he’s tall, handsome. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 amy Broad shoulders, good hair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 raj Hmm. Wonder what she sees in Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 bernadette How’s it going out there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard Sheldon and your dad are bonding and completely ignoring me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 amy I know how you feel. Sheldon ignored me for a week when he got that Roomba vacuum. I kick it when he’s not looking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 bernadette What are they doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard They’re drinking beer and watching football. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 bernadette So why don’t you do that with them?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard They don’t want me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 bernadette What do you mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard Well, Sheldon started talking about how his dad isn’t alive any more, and they were toasting, and I tried to tell them about how sad I was when my dad abandoned…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 amy Zack’s here!
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 raj Stir the gravy. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 bernadette Sorry. I really want to hear how sad you are. I’ll be back in like five, ten minutes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard Sorry she made you come over here on a holiday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 zack It’s all right. I didn’t have anything going on. Plus, Penny told me we’re married, and Thanksgiving’s a time to be with family.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Yeah, okay, great. Can we just get this over with?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard Yeah, uh, you guys have to sign here and here. On Monday, we’ll file for the annulment, and this marriage will be over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 zack I don’t know if I want to sign it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 raj_bernadette_and_amy Ooh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard Why won’t you sign it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 zack I just think splitting up can be rough on kids.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny We don’t have any kids.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 zack Are you sure? ‘Cause you didn’t know we were married until this morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Okay, look, Zack, come on. You know neither of us thought this was real. I mean, we were married by an Elvis impersonator.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 zack Of course it was an impersonator. We could never afford a real Elvis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard You married him instead of me? Good call. Sign the papers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Hang on. You know what? You have been a jerk about this all day. You always do this, whenever I mess up, you’re right there to make me feel even worse about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard That is not true.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Yeah, we could’ve waited till Monday, signed the papers, this all would have been over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard You’re the one who invited him here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Oh, there you go again, just another mistake you’re throwing in my face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 zack Not cool, bro. I’m starting to think you’re not the kind of guy I want dating my wife.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard Yeah, well, she’s not gonna be your wife for long.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 zack Oh, no. Are you dying?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny I’m about to. Sign the paper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 zack Know what they say, happy wife, happy life. Let’s eat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon Two, three, eight, four, six. That’s all I can do without throwing up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike That is not what I expected when you said you were gonna burp pie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mrs_wolowitz Did somebody say pie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike I don’t know what’s scarier, the bathroom clowns or the woman that put them there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon All I know is you can only fit one of her in a car. And there’s the clown that came out of her. I really didn’t want to come here, but this is shaping up to be one of the best Thanksgivings I’ve had in a long time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike Me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 bernadette Hey. Howie says you’ve been making fun of him all day. Now, both of you apologize right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon She’s so tiny. It’s funny when she’s mad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 amy All right, mister, I think you owe Howard and Bernadette an apology.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon Perhaps you’re right. I’m sorry for my behaviour. I’ve had alcohol, and it’s caused me to be inappropriate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 bernadette It’s okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard Don’t worry about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 amy Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon Ain’t she great? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike Mmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 amy Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon Now, how’s about you get us a couple of beers?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 bernadette Thanks again for cooking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 amy Yeah, everything was delicious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 raj Well, I couldn’t have done it without my two favourite girls. Martha Stewart and Rachael Ray.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike Hey, Sheldon, what do you say we go outside and throw around the old pigskin?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon This is a Jewish house. I don’t think they have pigskin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mrs_wolowitz Did someone say pigskin?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Hey, I’m sorry about today. And I promise, next time I get married, it won’t be a joke. It’ll be for love. Or money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard I’m sorry, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 zack Don’t be. It’s my fault. I was a terrible husband. I was never around.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike I know I’m hard on you, but you’re not the worst son-in-law in the world.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard Mike, that’s the nicest thing you’ve ever said to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike Well, I’m drunk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon I just vomited on a lot of clowns.
