TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter The math is all there. It’s not real.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Yes, it is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Yeah,uh, look, it is scientifically impossible for a person to tip a cow. Even you, with your stocky build and lumberjack shoulders, you couldn’t do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 raj_koothrappali It’s horrible. Why would you push a cow over? They’re sacred.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Oh, stop it. I’ve seen you eat, like, a million hamburgers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 raj_koothrappali Hey, an animal can be both sacred and delicious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Look, I’m telling you I’ve done it, okay? I clearly remember the cow standing up and then the cow on its side.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Were you drunk?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny I was 16 in Nebraska. What do you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter I think you’re the one who fell over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny That would explain why the sky was also on its side.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Howard. Cow tipping. Real or not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Mmm. I’m gonna say not. That’s just based on me trying to roll my mom over when she’s snoring. Speaking of that big side of beef, uh, she’s invited all of you to Thanksgiving at her house.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Mmm. You know, I’ve been told that a bald refusal of an invitation is rude and one must instead offer up a polite excuse, so I’d love to go, but, unfortunately, that sounds awful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Come on, it’ll be fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Uh, we were actually gonna do it here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Please? Bernadette’s bringing her dad ’cause her mom’s out of town, and I never have anything to say to that guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Oh, since you put it that way, I’d love to go, but that sounds even more awful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter It’d actually be nice to not hear Sheldon complain about my cooking all day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Uh, excuse me, but every year you prepare a terrible meal and every year I criticize it. Do our traditions mean nothing to you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter I want to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Yeah, me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 raj_koothrappali I’m in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Ugh, fine, I’ll go. But if her food is delicious, Thanksgiving is ruined, and it’s on you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Do we really have to go to Mrs. Wolowitz’s house?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler We do. And I expect you to be on your best behaviour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Now I know how the African slaves felt. Being dragged from their homes to labour under the yoke of the white man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler Are you honestly comparing Thanksgiving dinner at Wolowitz’s mom’s with one of the greatest tragedies in the history of mankind?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Sheldon, you can have a nice Thanksgiving anywhere. I spent one in Vegas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter You did?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Yeah, back when I was dating Zack. It was actually more fun than I thought. We gambled, we went to one of those cheesy wedding chapels, we had a really good turkey dinner. Which was surprising, since we were at a strip club.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Wait, you went to a chapel?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny We had one of those silly fake weddings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Penny, you know those are real, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny No, they’re not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, they are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny No, they’re not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, they are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon_cooper He’s right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler They’re real.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny But it didn’t seem real.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Let me ask you a question. At any point, was Las Vegas on its side?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski Hi, Dad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike_rostenkowski Hi, honey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, you brought beer for everybody.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike_rostenkowski Uh, okay, yeah, it’s for everybody. I really just wanted to have a nice, quiet day at home and watch the game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski You can have a quiet day and watch the game here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 debbie_wolowitz Howard, the medicine’s not working.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard_wolowitz You just took it. At least let it reach your first stomach. Hey, Mike. Let me help you out, there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike_rostenkowski Thanks. What’s wrong with your mom?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Oh, her gout’s flaring up. Turns out an apple pie a day does not keep the doctor away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 debbie_wolowitz How can one little toe hurt so bad?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Maybe because that little piggy is being crushed by the barn. She should quiet down soon. I gave her enough pain meds to choke a, well, her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski I guess we’re gonna have to do all the cooking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard_wolowitz I have a better idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski If you think you’re gonna make me do all this by myself, you’re crazy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard_wolowitz I was gonna make Raj do it all by himself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, well, that’s a great idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler No traffic, we’re sailing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Yes. Like we’re on a ship. Coming from Africa to America.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, that’s completely inappropriate. You can’t keep comparing yourself to a slave.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Yes, Miss Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter I can’t believe you’re married to that idiot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Ugh, would you stop? We just did it as a goof.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Well, a goof or not, you’re actually married. You need to get this taken care of.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny I will. Why are you making this such a big deal?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Oh, oh, oh, I have a reason. It could be because you said yes to marrying Zack, but every time Leonard’s proposed, he’s gotten a resounding no. Yeah, that’s just off the top of my head.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny So how do I undo this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter I’m hoping you can get an annulment. It’s just like it never happened.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Great, well, what do I have to do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler It says here you can get an annulment if any of the following conditions are met. Were you unable to consummate the marriage?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Hah!Penny? Next.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler Is there any evidence of fraud, bigamy, want of understanding?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Want of understanding? What does that even mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler Ding, ding, ding. We have a winner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski Thanks for saving the day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 raj_koothrappali Ah, no problem. It wouldn’t be Thanksgiving without an Indian providing the food. Uh, now, where does your mom keep the Crisco?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Um, I don’t know. Probably in a wad in her cheek.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski I’ll help Raj in here. Why don’t you go keep my dad company?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard_wolowitz He doesn’t want me in there. I’m the creepy little guy who has sex with his daughter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski Don’t be silly, he loves you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Does he?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski Okay, he cares about you a lot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski I do crap for you all the time. Get out there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard_wolowitz So your wife’s in Arizona with the grandkids?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike_rostenkowski Uh-huh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard_wolowitz You know, my mom’s been to Arizona. She rode one of those mules down in the Grand Canyon. Long story short, they had to shoot it. ‘Cause she’s so fat. I’ll get the door while you finish laughing. Hey, guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler Happy Thanksgiving.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon_cooper It smells wonderful. Is anyone slaving away in the kitchen? Because I, too, know…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Here. Thank you for having us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard_wolowitz What’s with you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Oh, she’s mad at me because she just found out she’s married to Zack.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Really? That dumb-ass she used to date? That’s hysterical.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny I can’t believe I felt bad for opening this in the car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler You need any help?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 raj_koothrappali Uh, yeah, can you, uh, reach that, uh, gravy boat up there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler Uh, sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 raj_koothrappali Great. That makes one of you. Okay, we have a lot to do and not much time to do it. Bernadette, you’re on corn, gravy and yam detail. Amy, you’re on rolls, cranberries and making sure Bernadette stays away from the marshmallows. That’s right, I see you. Okay, if you have any questions, I’ll be over here basting my ass off. Focus is key.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler Did you guys know Penny married Zack three years ago?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 together#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard_wolowitz You ever play football?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike_rostenkowski A little in college. You?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard_wolowitz No. But I did get tackled in the hallway once. The whole school cheered.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Okay, I found the, uh, court papers that you and Zack need to fill out. I’ll print them when we get home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter And we can just put this whole thing behind us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Are you done?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Look, I get it, I screwed up. Is this all we’re gonna talk about the rest of the day?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Why are you mad at me? You’re the one that did the stupid thing. I’m just trying to fix it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Ugh, I need some air.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Wuh, Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon_cooper I don’t know the first thing about women, but I would not follow her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike_rostenkowski Listen to Stretch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter How am I the bad guy? She’s the one who married someone else. I’m the victim.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Sounds like Zack’s the victim. You’re sleeping with his wife.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike_rostenkowski I’ve kept my marriage together for 35 years. Can I weigh in here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike_rostenkowski I’m trying to watch the game. Shut up. Oh, how do you not make a first down there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon_cooper They passed against a nickel defence. They should have run it off-tackle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike_rostenkowski How the hell do you know that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon_cooper My father loved football. He always made me watch it before I was allowed to do my homework.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Well, you’ll be happy to know I just spoke to Zack and he’s willing to sign the court papers. He’s on his way here now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Wait, you invited him here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike_rostenkowski I’m getting ready to weigh in again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Come on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike_rostenkowski What do you think they ought to do now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon_cooper I would throw a quick slant to a wideout, given that the defence is showing blitz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Oh, I love a good blitz, especially with sour cream. Get it? ‘Cause it sounds like blintz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 debbie_wolowitz Did someone say blintz?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter I just don’t understand why you invited him here today.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Because you wouldn’t shut up about it. When I called him, he had nothing to do, so I just thought it would…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 raj_koothrappali Hey, guys, I’m trying to cook in here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Oh, sorry. We’ll keep it down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 raj_koothrappali No, no, speak up. I’m about to use the blender, and I don’t want to miss anything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Well, you might have to cook for one more because she invited Zack.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler Ooh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 raj_koothrappali My, my. The plot, like my gravy, thickens.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon_cooper I don’t care for your mother’s bathroom. There’s not an angle to do one’s business without a clown figurine staring at you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard_wolowitz That’s why I sit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike_rostenkowski Yeah, that’s why. You remember the Thanksgiving game when it snowed in Dallas?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon_cooper 1993. Leon Lett blew the game in the final seconds and the Dolphins emerged victorious. Then I finally got to do my calculus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike_rostenkowski I was so pissed, I wanted to shoot my TV.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon_cooper So was my dad. And then he did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Anyone need a beer?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike_rostenkowski Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Thank God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike_rostenkowski So, does your dad still live in Texas?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon_cooper No. He died when I was 14.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike_rostenkowski I’m sorry to hear that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon_cooper So was the man who owned the local liquor store. He cried and cried.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Here you go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike_rostenkowski Oh, thanks. So, if your dad died when you were 14, you were never old enough to have a beer with the man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon_cooper No, sir. He did try to give me one for my high school graduation, but I was 11 and my mom said no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike_rostenkowski Well, you’re having one with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon_cooper All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike_rostenkowski To your dad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard_wolowitz I never had a beer with my dad, either.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Do you mind? We’re having a moment here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler I can’t believe Penny’s married to Zack.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 raj_koothrappali Wonder what she saw in that guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t know. He’s sweet, he’s tall, handsome.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler Broad shoulders, good hair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 raj_koothrappali Hmm. Wonder what she sees in Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski How’s it going out there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Sheldon and your dad are bonding and completely ignoring me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler I know how you feel. Sheldon ignored me for a week when he got that Roomba vacuum. I kick it when he’s not looking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski What are they doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard_wolowitz They’re drinking beer and watching football.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski So why don’t you do that with them?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard_wolowitz They don’t want me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski What do you mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Well, Sheldon started talking about how his dad isn’t alive any more, and they were toasting, and I tried to tell them about how sad I was when my dad abandoned…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler Zack’s here!
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 raj_koothrappali Stir the gravy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski Sorry. I really want to hear how sad you are. I’ll be back in like five, ten minutes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Sorry she made you come over here on a holiday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 zack_johnson It’s all right. I didn’t have anything going on. Plus, Penny told me we’re married, and Thanksgiving’s a time to be with family.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Yeah, okay, great. Can we just get this over with?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, uh, you guys have to sign here and here. On Monday, we’ll file for the annulment, and this marriage will be over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 zack_johnson I don’t know if I want to sign it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler@bernadette_rostenkowski@raj_koothrappali Ooh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Why won’t you sign it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 zack_johnson I just think splitting up can be rough on kids.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny We don’t have any kids.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 zack_johnson Are you sure? ‘Cause you didn’t know we were married until this morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Okay, look, Zack, come on. You know neither of us thought this was real. I mean, we were married by an Elvis impersonator.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 zack_johnson Of course it was an impersonator. We could never afford a real Elvis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter You married him instead of me? Good call. Sign the papers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Hang on. You know what? You have been a jerk about this all day. You always do this, whenever I mess up, you’re right there to make me feel even worse about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter That is not true.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Yeah, we could’ve waited till Monday, signed the papers, this all would have been over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter You’re the one who invited him here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Oh, there you go again, just another mistake you’re throwing in my face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 zack_johnson Not cool, bro. I’m starting to think you’re not the kind of guy I want dating my wife.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, well, she’s not gonna be your wife for long.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 zack_johnson Oh, no. Are you dying?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny I’m about to. Sign the paper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 zack_johnson Know what they say, happy wife, happy life. Let’s eat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Two, three, eight, four, six. That’s all I can do without throwing up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike_rostenkowski That is not what I expected when you said you were gonna burp pie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 debbie_wolowitz Did somebody say pie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike_rostenkowski I don’t know what’s scarier, the bathroom clowns or the woman that put them there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon_cooper All I know is you can only fit one of her in a car. And there’s the clown that came out of her. I really didn’t want to come here, but this is shaping up to be one of the best Thanksgivings I’ve had in a long time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike_rostenkowski Me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski Hey. Howie says you’ve been making fun of him all day. Now, both of you apologize right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon_cooper She’s so tiny. It’s funny when she’s mad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler All right, mister, I think you owe Howard and Bernadette an apology.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Perhaps you’re right. I’m sorry for my behaviour. I’ve had alcohol, and it’s caused me to be inappropriate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski It’s okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Don’t worry about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Ain’t she great?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike_rostenkowski Mmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon_cooper Now, how’s about you get us a couple of beers?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 bernadette_rostenkowski Thanks again for cooking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 amy_farrah_fowler Yeah, everything was delicious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 raj_koothrappali Well, I couldn’t have done it without my two favourite girls. Martha Stewart and Rachael Ray.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike_rostenkowski Hey, Sheldon, what do you say we go outside and throw around the old pigskin?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon_cooper This is a Jewish house. I don’t think they have pigskin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 debbie_wolowitz Did someone say pigskin?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 penny Hey, I’m sorry about today. And I promise, next time I get married, it won’t be a joke. It’ll be for love. Or money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 leonard_hofstadter I’m sorry, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 zack_johnson Don’t be. It’s my fault. I was a terrible husband. I was never around.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike_rostenkowski I know I’m hard on you, but you’re not the worst son-in-law in the world.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 howard_wolowitz Mike, that’s the nicest thing you’ve ever said to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 mike_rostenkowski Well, I’m drunk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode09 sheldon_cooper I just vomited on a lot of clowns.
