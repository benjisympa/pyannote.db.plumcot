TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 ira_flatow This is Science Friday. I’m Ira Flatow. My guest today is responsible for the discovery of the first stable super-heavy element. Welcome, Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Thank you. Uh, the university made me come here. I didn’t want to. Uh, big fan of the show.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 ira_flatow So, I understand that you actually discovered this element by mistake.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 ira_flatow And some people in the science community are calling it The Wonder Blunder.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Who? Give me their names. I bet it’s Wolowitz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 ira_flatow It’s just such a fascinating story. Your calculations are way off, but they find the element anyway. It’s like misreading a treasure map and still finding the treasure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Can we talk about something else? Do you know that I yodel?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 ira_flatow That’s interesting, but this could be taking you down the path toward a Nobel Prize. And in chemistry, no less. And wouldn’t that be unusual? Because you’re a physicist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Yes, yes, I’d be a physicist with a Nobel in chemistry. Everyone laugh at the circus freak. You know, I don’t need to sit here and take this, Flatow. It is because of bullies like you, every day more and more Americans are making the switch to television.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper President Seibert, I don’t know why you’re yelling. You’re the one who made me go on the radio. I was expecting a professional science interview, not an attack by some morning zoo shock jock. Well, if the university needs money so badly, perhaps you should start a swear jar. Whoa, that one’s worth a dollar.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 amy_farrah_fowler I know you don’t like it, but every time you do an interview, it raises the profile of the university. That translates to funding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Yeah, well, I’m not just some trained monkey dancing for coins.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Of course you’re not. People love trained monkeys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 penny How can you not be happy? You’re tall, thin and famous. Oh, my God, I’m jealous of Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Look, you’re gonna be doing this stuff for a while. You’re just gonna have to find a way to get used to it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper But none of you know what this is like. Being celebrated for something you wish you never did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 penny Mmm, you clearly haven’t been with me at Mardi Gras.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski Want to pause the video game and help me clean up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 howard_wolowitz I am cleaning up. Look at the mess the Joker made of Gotham City.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski Come on, it’s your friend who’s coming to stay here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Raj grew up in India. Trust me, he’s seen worse.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski Howie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 howard_wolowitz I promise I’ll help out the rest of the week.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski The rest of the week? You said it was just gonna be a night or two.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Yeah, but if I told you a week, would you have said yes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Then you left me no choice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski I love Raj, but that’s a long time for a house guest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 howard_wolowitz I know, but they’re tenting his building. He can’t find a hotel he likes that allows dogs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski He’s bringing Cinnamon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 howard_wolowitz For a whole week, the nerve of some people.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Here comes the Embarrassment Express. With stops at Fraudville, Wonder Blunderberg, and Kansas City. Because it’s a hub.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, can I come in?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Do you have cookies?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 amy_farrah_fowler No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Good. I don’t deserve cookies. Come in. Wil?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 wil_wheaton Hey, Sheldon. It’s been a while.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Why are you here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 wil_wheaton Amy said you were having a rough time, and I thought maybe we could talk. Is that okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Certainly. Although, right now, I’m having a rough time because there’s three people in my room, and it’s starting to feel like a discotheque.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, you said you were unhappy getting attention for something you wished you never did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 wil_wheaton Yeah, I know a little something about that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Oh, nonsense, Wil. Your endless tweets are not that bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 wil_wheaton I remember why it’s been a while. Sheldon, I was actually talking about when I was a kid on Star Trek.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper How could you not like getting attention for playing Wesley Crusher? You were wonderful. A know-it-all boy genius with an eidetic memory. Who couldn’t relate to that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 wil_wheaton Well, not everybody felt that way. A lot of people really hated the character, and some of them hated me because of it. I would do interviews, and people would be mean to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper That just happened to me. Next time you’re stuck for a tweet, feel free to say what a jerk Ira Flatow is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, the point is Wil learned to embrace that part of his life and moved on to bigger and better things.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 wil_wheaton Yeah, I’m an author now, I do public speaking, and I have my own Web series about board games.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 amy_farrah_fowler Uh, we’re trying to cheer him up, so…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 wil_wheaton I’m just saying that there was a time when I thought I would never get out of Wesley Crusher’s shadow. But now, it’s just one small part of a pretty great life, and it’s a part that I’m happy is there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper I do see what you’re saying. That helps.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 wil_wheaton Good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Would you two like to stay and play trains with me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 wil_wheaton Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 amy_farrah_fowler Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Oh, great, now, I work the controls, I say all aboard. You sit quietly and watch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper You should probably go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 howard_wolowitz You’re gonna brush your teeth on my couch?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 raj_koothrappali No, I’m gonna brush Cinnamon’s teeth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Why bother? She spends half the time licking her butt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 raj_koothrappali And the other half licking my face. That’s why I’m brushing her teeth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski Hey, guys. Sorry I’m so late. Did you already have dinner?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 howard_wolowitz No, we were waiting for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski Aw, that’s so sweet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Yeah. So what do you feel like making?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 raj_koothrappali Howard, the poor thing just got home from work. Let me get you a glass of wine. I’ll cook dinner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, Raj, you’re our guest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 raj_koothrappali Don’t be silly. Sit. You look like you’ve had a long day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 howard_wolowitz No, she always looks like that. Because she married an idiot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski Thank you, Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 raj_koothrappali Please, this is my way of thanking you for letting me stay here. Now, tell us all about your day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski Okay, um, well, first, I was late to a meeting ’cause I was stuck in traffic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Well, I keep telling you to put that traffic app on your phone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 raj_koothrappali Hey, when you got home today complaining that you felt sick from eating too many jelly beans, did I tell you how to fix it? No. I said, aw, that must hurt, and I rubbed your belly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 howard_wolowitz I thought of you the whole time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 raj_koothrappali All I’m saying is there’s a time to just listen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 raj_koothrappali There’s also a time to stop eating too many jelly beans. And it’s when you’re ten.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Hello, President Siebert. Thank you for taking my call. I just wanted you to know that you can now expect enthusiastic participation from me regarding my discovery. Oh, no, no, no, no. No need to thank mNo, thank my friend, Wil Wheaton. For your information, I have nine friends, hmm? Ten if we include you. Nine it is. Ah, it’s ten. I’ll count Wolowitz. Hello, friend Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Hey, you’re in a good mood.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper I’m in a great mood.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Well, you’re about to be in an even better one. I didn’t want to say anything until I knew for sure, but, I’ve been re-running the tests on your element in my lab and I disproved it. Your element does not exist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Yeah, but what about the Chinese research team? They found it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, it turns out someone added simulated signals to the data files. They faked the results.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Yes. Do you know what that means? That means all of this attention that you hate goes away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper So no more interviews?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter No, it’s all over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper I can’t believe it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Well, you’re welcome.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper You robbed me of my greatest achievement.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper I’m back down to nine friends. Make it eight, I’m sick of Wolowitz, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter I, I don’t understand. All you’ve done since you discovered this stupid element was complain. I was trying to make you happy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper By taking away my only claim to fame? Well, if you wanted to make me happy, you could have told me a joke. Or shown me a cute video of a koala and an otter becoming unlikely friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Oh, there is no winning with you. And koalas and otters don’t even live near each other.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper That’s what makes their friendship unlikely,
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 penny Hey, what’s with all the yelling?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Leonard disproved my element. Now all the attention is going to go away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 penny Oh, that’s great. You must be thrilled,
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper That’s it, I’m down to seven friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 penny He’s counting hobbits and superheroes, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper When I thought the element was real, I didn’t want it. But now that Leonard made it not exist, I want it more than anything in the world.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter The, the element never existed. I didn’t take it away, science took it away. Be mad at science.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Don’t you dare use science against me. Science is my best friend. Oh, good, I’m back up to eight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Will you tell him he’s out of his mind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 penny Actually, I get what he’s saying.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Oh, yes, nine. Welcome back, buddy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 penny It’s like if you’re dating someone you’re not that into, and then they break up with you and then you want them more than ever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper I have no idea what she’s talking about, but we’re ganging up on you so I agree.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Okay, Sheldon, what do you want me to do, hide the information? If I don’t publish it, it’s just a matter of time before someone else does.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper No, no, of course you have to publish. That’s your responsibility as a scientist. Doing otherwise would be unethical. You have no choice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Fine, I’ll publish.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Can you believe this guy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski Aw! Raj did the dishes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 howard_wolowitz How do you know I didn’t do them?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski Because once, when all the knives were dirty, you cut a bagel with your keys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 raj_koothrappali Good morning, everybody. I picked up coffee while I was out. Bernadette, here’s your soy peppermint mocha.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski Aw, you didn’t have to do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 raj_koothrappali Oh, my pleasure, and don’t worry about your presentation today. You’re gonna be great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Yeah, you’re gonna knock it out of the park.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski What presentation do I have today?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Just go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 raj_koothrappali He loves you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 howard_wolowitz What are you doing? Are you trying to make me look bad?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 raj_koothrappali I’m just being a good house guest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 howard_wolowitz No, you’re being a better husband than I am. Doing the dishes, getting coffee, knowing about her life, who does that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 raj_koothrappali Oh, come on, I brought you one, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 howard_wolowitz I don’t want coffee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 raj_koothrappali That’s why I got you hot chocolate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Give me that. Just stop showing me up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 raj_koothrappali Howard, listen to me. You’re a great husband. Yes, your listening skills could use some work. But it’s amazing how far you’ve come given that you’re an only child raised by an over-protective mom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Um, is this getting weird?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 raj_koothrappali Hang on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 howard_wolowitz So, yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Hey. I just wanted to let you know that I, I posted my findings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper I saw. And I just posted a retraction of my paper. Now the whole scientific community knows I was wrong.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter These things happen all the time, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Not to me. The only other retraction I ever had to issue was when I was seven and I conceded that my brother was the greatest ninja in East Texas. But that was just a ploy to get my face out of his armpit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 barry_kripke Thew he is. It’s my favowite superhewo, the Wetwactor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Come on, don’t give him a hard time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 barry_kripke I’m sowwy, Cooper. I wetwact it. By the way, Hofstadter, nice job dispwoving the Chinese team.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter It’s not a big deal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 barry_kripke It’s a huge deal. Cooper, maybe physics just isn’t your thing. Have you ever considered a caweer in wetail? That way you could take things back for a wiving.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Okay, Barry, that’s enough.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper No, no, no, that’s okay. I can fight my own battles. Isn’t that right, Bawwy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 barry_kripke Is? Is that a wefewence to my speech impediment? That’s pwetty hurtful. I, I can’t contwol it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper You’re right, That was uncalled for. I take it back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 barry_kripke Of course you do. Because you’re the Wetwactor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski Raj, this dinner was amazing. If you’re here much longer, I’m gonna have to buy bigger clothes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 raj_koothrappali Nonsense. You need a little fattening up. You’ve been looking too skinny lately.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski Aw. Howie, how come you never say anything sweet like that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 howard_wolowitz What are you talking about? Remember last week, when I asked you if you were wearing Spanx and you weren’t? How’s that different?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski Maybe you could try being more thoughtful, like your friend Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Yeah, well, maybe you could try being more like Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Yeah, yeah. He packed me a lunch this morning. And there was a note inside that said go get ’em.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski Like I don’t do enough around here. Now I need to pack your lunch? And by the way, why do you need a note telling you to go get ’em? You’re a grown man, you should know to go get ’em.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 howard_wolowitz I do know to go get ’em, but sometimes it’s nice to have emotional support when I’m going and getting them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 raj_koothrappali Hey, hey, do you hear yourselves? Let’s just, you know, all calm down and take a step back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski This is stupid. Why are we fighting?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 howard_wolowitz I don’t know. I guess I was just feeling like I’m a lousy husband.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski You’re not a lousy husband. You’re a great husband. I was the one feeling like a lousy wife.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Are you kidding? You’re the best. I know what the problem is. It’s him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 raj_koothrappali Oh, what did I do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 howard_wolowitz You made us feel like we’re not trying hard enough.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, we were totally fine half-assing our marriage till you showed up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 raj_koothrappali Look, I’m sorry you’re upset with me, but I just have to say it’s nice to see the two of you on the same page.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Oh, it does feel good to have you backing me up for once.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski I back you up all the time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 howard_wolowitz That is not… he’s doing it again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski What is wrong with you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter I can’t believe they kicked you out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 raj_koothrappali I can’t believe they’re still married. Oh, no, I forgot Cinnamon’s toothbrush at Howard’s. I guess you’re sharing with Daddy again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 penny Bark once if you need me to call PETA.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper What’s that animal doing in our apartment?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Oh, relax, she’s in her crate. She can’t get out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper I have two words for you, Jurassic Park. This day just keeps getting worse and worse.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 penny You know, if it makes you feel any better…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper It probably won’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 penny You’re probably right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, it’s a beautiful night. Why don’t you and I go for a nice walk together?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Oh, everything is just sex with you isn’t it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 raj_koothrappali Sheldon, I think you might find the support you’re looking for if you realize that relationships are a give and take. She can only be there for you as much as you are for her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 amy_farrah_fowler Thank you, Rajesh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 raj_koothrappali And, Amy, you need to be patient with Sheldon, instead of pressuring him to accept intimacy on your terms.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 amy_farrah_fowler You should probably go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 ira_flatow I’m Ira Flatow, and this is Science Friday. I’d like to welcome back Dr. Sheldon Cooper, who thought he had discovered a new super-heavy element only to have it disproved by my next guest, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter. Welcome to Science< Friday, gentlemen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Thank you. Ira, if I may, I’d like to apologize for my behaviour last week.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 ira_flatow It’s all right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Now, isn’t there something you’d like to say to me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 ira_flatow No. Now, Dr. Hofstadter. Can you walk us through the process you used to disprove his theory?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Well…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper I believe I can answer that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter He asked me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter As I was saying…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper You’re telling it wrong. Ira, to really understand the story here, you have to start at the very beginning. A small town in East Texas, where a young genius named…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper That’s right, Sheldon Cooper. He was bitten by his neighbour’s dog, leading to his first scientific breakthrough, the doggie death-ray. Which, sadly, he couldn’t build because Santa wouldn’t bring him enriched uranium.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 ira_flatow You know, I’d really like to hear it from Dr. Hofstadter, if it’s okay with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper What a surprise. Did you invite me back just so you could ignore me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 ira_flatow Actually, I didn’t invite you. You came in, you took a seat, and I’m not comfortable with confrontation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, this interview is supposed to be about me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Well, that seems like a snooze. Even for public radio.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 penny You know, if we did a shot every time they said something embarrassing, this would be one hell of a drinking game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 amy_farrah_fowler A little early for alcohol, isn’t it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 sheldon_cooper You know, I don’t just say smart things about science. I also yodel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode10 amy_farrah_fowler I’ll get the vodka.
