TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 amy This is nice, that we all get to eat together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard Absolutely.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 amy Hmm. Can we maybe put the phones down and have an actualhuman conversation?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 sheldon We can, but thanks to Steve Jobs, we don’t have to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny Guys, guys, you’re never gonna believe this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard What happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny I just got a part on a TV show.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 amy Congratulations.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard What? That’s great. Guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 howard Oh, yeah
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 sheldon Yay, Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 amy What’s the show?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny Um, NC… II… or, you know, NCSTD… I don’t know, it’s, it’s, you know, it’s the one with the letters and I’m gonna be on it!
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard That’s amazing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 howard What’s your part?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny Um, I play a customer in a diner and I flirt with Mark Harmon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 raj Ooh, Mark Harmon, he’s a dreamboat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard So it, it’s just flirting?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny Well, yeah. Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard Uh, no reason. I just think it’s sexier when things are left to the imagination.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 amy He’s wrong.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 raj So I read a study that says a man with a dog is three times more likely to get a woman’s phone number.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard Is it true even when the man lets his dog lick peanut butter off his tongue?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 raj I don’t see why not. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 howard If you’re really desperate to meet women and like having food eaten out of your mouth, I could set you up with my mom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 sheldon Why is that funny? That’s just unhygienic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard It’s a joke.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 sheldon I don’t think so. I believe that a joke is a brief oral narrative with a climactic humorous twist. For example, uh, Wolowitz’s mother is so fat that she decided to go on a diet, or exercise, or both. See? The twist is that people don’t usually change. Well, they don’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny Hey, guys, don’t forget, my episode’s on TV tomorrow night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 howard We’ll be there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 raj Can we bring anything?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny Oh, that’s so sweet of you, but I was gonna steal food from here. You know, my treat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 sheldon Wait, if Howard’s mother is coming, then you should also steal marbles. Because she’s obese, and hippos are obese, and in the popular board game Hungry Hungry Hippos, they eat marbles. Maybe I need to dumb these down for you. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 sheldon Leonard, do you think I’m funny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard No. Do you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 sheldon I think I’m hysterical.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard I take it back. That was funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 sheldon The philosopher Henri Bergson says it’s funny when a human being behaves like an object. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard I bet that bit killed at The Chuckle Hut.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 sheldon Oh, he didn’t perform stand-up comedy, he was a philosopher.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard You know, I think we’re zeroing in on your problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 sheldon Perhaps I’ll spend some time developing a unified theory of comedy, which will allow me to elicit laughter from anyone at any time. Unless they’re German, ’cause that’s a tough crowd.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard Are you set on people laughing with you? ‘Cause if you’re cool with at you…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 sheldon I don’t get it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 bernadette Raj, when you said you were gonna bring a date to watch Penny’s thing tonight, I didn’t think you meant Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 howard Really? I never for a second thought it’d be anything else.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 raj I almost met someone last night, but I blew it. I was walking Cinnamon and this girl introduced herself, but she was so cute I panicked and said, wouldn’t it be easier if instead of talking we could just sniff each other’s butts?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 bernadette Well, Stuart’s cute in his own way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 stuart When I was a baby, my mother called me her little possum.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 raj Are possums cute?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 stuart Not at all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 howard If you’re so intimidated by talking to attractive girls, maybe you should practice by talking to regular people.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 raj You mean like fatties and uggos?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 bernadette Or maybe just stop talking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 howard I’m serious. Go to the mall, talk to anybody, practice, that way when you eventually do talk to a cute girl, it won’t be so scary.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 bernadette Or just keep dating the possum.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 voice_on_television Parsa doesn’t have those kind of resources.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 second_voice No, and that’s why he had Erin Pace rewire it…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard I’m so proud of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny We haven’t even gotten to my scene yet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard I know, but you’re going to be a TV star and you haven’t left me yet. That takes guts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 sheldon I don’t know about you, but I’m very uncomfortable with all this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 amy Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 sheldon I’ve never seen this show before and now I’m starting with episode 246? It’s unnatural.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 amy Just think of the first 245 as the prequel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 sheldon All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny Okay, shh, guys, guys, this is it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 man_on_tv I guess it’s you and me, kid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 mark_harmon_on_tv What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 woman_on_tv I’m trying to make peace.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 mark_harmon_on_tv We’re good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 woman_on_tv Good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 mark_harmon_on_tv Really? Because…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny Are you kidding me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard What’s wrong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny Well, the diner scene. Where’s my diner scene?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 sheldon Well, don’t ask me. Until I see the prequel, I’m lost.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny No, there was supposed to be a big scene with me and Mark Harmon, but it’s gone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 bernadette What happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny They must’ve cut it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard Oh, Penny, I’m, I’m sorry. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 howard That stinks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 raj I’m sure you were great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny This doesn’t make any sense. I mean, I, I thought I did a, a really good job, I… Excuse me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 sheldon I’ve been studying how to make people laugh. They say that comedy is tragedy plus time. Let’s tickle some ribs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny No, Dad, I don’t think they cut me out of the show because I was too pretty. No, I don’t need you to come out and kick Mark Harmon’s ass. Daddy, I gotta go. I love you. Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard How you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny Ugh, this is such a disaster. My parents had all my relatives over. They got one of those six-foot sandwiches, and got my brother a day pass out of rehab and now he’s missing and the sandwich is missing, and they’re probably in Mexico by now. So humiliating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard You still got the part. That’s a huge accomplishment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny Yeah, but this was supposed to be my break, okay? People were gonna see me in this show and it was gonna lead to bigger things. More auditions, more parts. Now none of that’s gonna happen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard Honey, you only had, like, three lines. That wasn’t gonna happen anyway.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny Unbelievable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard Oh, come on, no, that’s not what I meant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny Then what did you mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard I don’t, look, you know, words don’t always have to mean things.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny I think you meant that you don’t believe in me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard Nope. Uh, uh, I might not know what I meant, but I know that I didn’t mean that. Not this guy. Oh, no way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny I want you, right now, to give me your 100% honest opinion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard Right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny Do you think I have what it takes to really make it as an actress?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny So you think I’ll be on TV and in movies and win awards.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard Honestly?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny Yes, honestly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard I don’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny How could you say that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard I don’t know, I got all confused when you said honestly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard Look, do I think that you are talented and that you are beautiful? Of course I do. But isn’t Los Angeles full of actresses who are just as talented, just as beautiful? All right, look, we’ll come back to that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny No, please. Don’t stop, go on. Tell me how I’m gonna be a waitress for the rest of my life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard That is not what I said. Look, I think you’re really good. I truly do. But this is an incredibly hard thing that you’re shooting for. I mean, the odds of anyone becoming a successful actor are like a million to one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny Wow, thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard Should’ve let Sheldon come.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 sheldon This is interesting. Apparently, a key component in some forms of humour is the element of surprise. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 amy Well, that makes sense. The prefrontal cortex is responsible for planning and anticipation, and patients with brain lesions on their…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 sheldon BRAIN LESIONS!
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 amy Sheldon, you scared me. That wasn’t funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 sheldon Or maybe you have a stick up your prefrontal cortex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 amy Okay, the notion that you can read a few books and come up with a definitive theory of comedy is absurd. I mean, humour is a complex neurological… Okay, that’s pretty good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 sheldon Excellent.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 stuart How about her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 raj No. No pretty girls. The point is to talk to regular people and work our way up to pretty girls.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 stuart Fine. How about that old lady with the walker?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 raj That depends. On any level, do you think she’s hot?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 stuart We’ll find somebody else.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 sheldon Kumquat?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 amy I guess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 sheldon Ointment?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 amy Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 sheldon Now, would you say ointment is more, equal to, or less funny than kumquat?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 amy I don’t think I want to go out with you anymore.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 sheldon Will you please stop joking around? I’m trying to figure this out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 amy Sheldon, how many words are you gonna go through?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 sheldon All of them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny You didn’t get your part cut.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 voice_on_tv All right, baby, here’s the deal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny And you didn’t get your part cut. Yep, bunch of old guys rocking out in a band, all with erectile dysfunction, you didn’t get your part cut!
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard Hey. Can we talk?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny We can, but the part of Penny might get cut.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard That was really crappy of me. What you’re trying to do is hard, but people do make it, and I really do believe you could be one of them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard And to show you how much I believe in you, I kind of got you an audition.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny Are you serious? For what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard The new Star Wars movie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny What? How did you manage that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard There’s this thing online, you put yourself on tape and just send it in, anyone can do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny Come on Leonard, this is just a PR stunt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard So? Even if it is, you have a huge advantage because you’re an actual actress. Most of the people doing this are just weirdoes and nerds. Wolowitz sent his in two days ago.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny Really, let it go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard Look, maybe it is a long shot, but sometimes long shots happen. Luke Skywalker was only given one chance to destroy the Death Star. He had to get a torpedo into an exhaust port that was only two meters wide, but with the help of The Force, he… wow, I can feel you hating me right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 stuart How about that lady in the sweat suit, speed-walking?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 raj Yeah, she seems friendly and easy to… never mind, she’s gone. You know, maybe talking to people is too hard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 stuart We could go over to that department store, practice on the mannequins.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 raj I don’t know. They’re dressed very stylishly. They’re probably stuck-up. This is ridiculous. The next person that walks by, no matter who it is, they’re the one. We’re gonna die here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 amy Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 bernadette Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 howard Where’s Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 amy He’s home trying to use science to determine the basis of humour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 bernadette That’s interesting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 amy It’s exhausting. Do you have any idea how hard it is to laugh at a knock-knock joke that starts with knock-knock-knock, Amy, knock-knock-knock, Amy, knock-knock-knock, Amy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 bernadette If you want him to stop, sometimes the easiest thing to do is just fake a laugh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 howard Fake a laugh? Do you ever do that with me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 bernadette No, of course not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 howard Well, I’d be able to tell anyway.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 bernadette I don’t think you would.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 howard Please, I’ve made plenty of girls laugh, sometimes just by asking them out. Yeah? Well, I fake my orgasms.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard Yes, how much for a hundred long-stemmed red roses? Really? How much for three?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard Yeah, I’ll call you back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny Look, I know you were just trying to help with your Star Wars thing. I didn’t mean to call it idiotic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard Well, I don’t think you called it idiotic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny Oh. Sorry, I meant to. Anyway, um, I was just upset with myself. I wasn’t mad at you. I just feel like everything is falling apart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard Come on. It’s okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny No, it’s not okay. Look at me, okay? I took a temp job as a waitress forever ago, and I’m still doing it. I can’t quit, because guess what? I can’t do anything else. And I finally get my big break, and it goes away. I’m such a mess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard No, you’re not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny Really? ‘Cause this morning at Starbucks, a pair of old underwear fell out of my pant leg. And it wasn’t the only one in there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard Okay, listen to me, this is just a minor setback.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny No, it’s not, okay? I’ve been out here for, like, ten years. I’ve nothing to show for it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard Well, you have me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny You’re right. I do have you. Mm. Let’s get married.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny Ooh. Leonard Hofstadter, will you marry me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard Um…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny Did you seriously just say um?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard Look, you know I love you but, but you’re, you’re drunk and sad and feeling lost.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny Okay, so, so you don’t want to marry me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard That is not what I said.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny No, forget it. I take it back. Offer’s off the table.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 sheldon Who’s in the mood to laugh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard Really not a good time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 sheldon But I used science to construct the perfect joke.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny I’m gonna go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard Penny, don’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 penny No, no, I just need to be alone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 sheldon So, a sandwich, a rabbi and yo mama walk into a bar. Where are you going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard To my room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 sheldon Should I follow you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 sheldon Leonard, wait.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 sheldon I forgot to tell you the sandwich is promiscuous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 stuart How about those guys on that bench over there? They look pathetic. I bet we could talk to them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 raj That’s a mirror.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 stuart Oh, yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 security_guard Hey, fellas, mall’s closing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 raj Sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 security_guard Yeah. Good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 raj Uh, excuse me. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 security_guard Yeah?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 raj Uh, do, do you like being a mall security guard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 security_guard It’s all right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 raj Okay, nice talking to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 stuart Smooth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 sheldon Can’t sleep?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 sheldon Would you like to talk about it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard Penny proposed, and I didn’t say yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 sheldon Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard That’s a good question.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 sheldon Does that mean the relationship is over?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard I don’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 sheldon Why don’t you ask her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard Because I’m afraid to know the answer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 sheldon Well, I’m sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard That’s it? You’re not gonna make some dumb joke or some inappropriate comment?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 sheldon No. You’re my friend, and, I’m sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 leonard Did you just put a kick me sign on my back?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 sheldon No. That wouldn’t be funny at all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 howard Star Wars audition, take one, starring Howard Joel Wolowitz, real-life astronaut. Vader is here, now, on this moon. I felt his presence. He’s come for me. He can feel when I’m near…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 bernadette How many times do I have to tell you to replace the toilet paper when it’s empty?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 howard I’m in the middle of something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode12 bernadette So am I.
