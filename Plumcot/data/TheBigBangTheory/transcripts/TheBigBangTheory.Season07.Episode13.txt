TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 sheldon_cooper It’s an outrage.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 sheldon_cooper The university, they think they can do whatever they want. We just have to sit there and take it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter You need to let it go, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 sheldon_cooper You work tirelessly for someone, and this is what you get.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Oh, my God, they’re just making you use your vacation days.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 sheldon_cooper But I don’t want a vacation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Okay, listen, I don’t mean to diminish what you’re going through, but I’m a little distracted right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Oh, this again? So, Penny proposed, you didn’t say yes, and now you think you may have lost her love forever. How does this compare to me being forced to relax for a few days?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter It doesn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter I’m gonna go talk to Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 sheldon_cooper I’m going to go inside, put on my coziest pajamas, curl up with a good book and wait for this nightmare to be over. Penny. Sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 penny Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 penny Look, I’m sorry I didn’t text you back. I just needed some time to think.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 penny Yeah. Come in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Look, if you want to break up, just say it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 penny Leonard…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter No, no, no, no. I take it back. Don’t say it. Just, just hate me, but stay with me. It worked for my parents.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 penny Listen, I don’t want to break up with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Oh. Oh, okay. Good, good. So, it’s cool if I cry a little?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 penny Yeah, I probably wouldn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 penny Look, you did the right thing last night. I was a mess. I was just frustrated because my career is going nowhere.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Look, I get it, and I want you to know that I support whatever you want to do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 penny Great, because I’ve been thinking, if I really want this acting thing to work, I need to focus all my energy on it. And to do that, I should quit waitressing at The Cheesecake Factory.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Wow. That, that’s a big step.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 penny I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter So, well, before making any rash…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 penny I already quit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter And I support you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Come on, take me to work with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter No. You’re on vacation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Please. What if there’s a big breakthrough in science today and I’m not there to see it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Do you really think there’s gonna be a breakthrough without you there to do it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 sheldon_cooper No. I was just tricking you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Leonard, wait. Take me with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Please.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Too bad. I’m coming with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Oh, Sheldon, stay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 sheldon_cooper But.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter I said stay. I’m going to work. Do not follow me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski Hey Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 stuart_bloom Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski Sorry. Did I startle you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 stuart_bloom Yes, but at this point, pretty much any customer does. What can I do for you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski Well, I need a little help. I accidentally destroyed one of Howard’s comic books this morning, and was hoping I could replace it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 stuart_bloom Wow. What happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski Batman got his ass kicked by my curling iron.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 stuart_bloom Well, don’t let The Riddler know that. It’s a comic book joke. Or maybe it’s not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski Do you have this one?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 stuart_bloom Uh, well, it’s, it’s pretty rare. Can you give me a few days to track it down?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski Ooh, I was kind of hoping to get it before Howie comes home from work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 stuart_bloom Oh. What’s the hurry?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski Well, he’s always saying I should be more careful with my curling iron, and it seems like a dangerous precedent to let him think he can be right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 stuart_bloom Well, I’ll do what I can, but I can’t make any promises.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski You know, I do work at a pharmaceutical company. If you can make this happen today, I can hook you up with anxiety medication, antidepressants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 stuart_bloom Really? Do you have any of these?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Hello, Mr. Rat Brain. Not so bitey without the rest of the rat to back us up now, are we?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Anybody home?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Hey, what brings you guys here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 raj_koothrappali Well, we were just on our way to lunch and wanted to see if you’d like to join.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Why? Because Sheldon’s not here this week, and you don’t think I have any other options? I’m just kidding. I’ll get my purse.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 bert_kibbler Hi, Amy. I, oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t know you had any company.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler That’s okay. Uh, Bert, this is Howard and Rajesh. Guys, this is Bert.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 raj_koothrappali Hey. Good to see you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 bert_kibbler Anyway, I wanted to show you this tourmalinated quartzthat we got in the lab.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler This is so pretty. Bert works for the geology department.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 bert_kibbler Yeah. You know what, uh, geologists and Bon Jovi have in common?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 howard_wolowitz You’re both into rock?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 bert_kibbler Yeah. Well, see ya.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, you forgot your quartz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 bert_kibbler Oh, it’s okay. I want you to have it. Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler He’s nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Yeah, he’s nice because he likes you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler What?! No, he doesn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 raj_koothrappali He brought you a pretty rock.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler So? He does that every day. Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 howard_wolowitz You know, if you’d rather skip lunch and hang out with your boyfriend Bert, it’s totally okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler He’s not my boyfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 raj_koothrappali Are you sure? He’s tall, pale and awkward. That sounds like your type.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Should someone as lonely as you really be making fun of me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 raj_koothrappali Yeah, grow up, Howard. God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler What do I do? I don’t want to hurt his feelings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Maybe the problem is he thinks you’re available. Does he know you’re dating Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler I guess it hasn’t come up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 howard_wolowitz There you go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 raj_koothrappali And does Sheldon know you’re dating Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler I’m sorry. Who are you dating?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 raj_koothrappali Yeah, knock it off, Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 penny Oh. Hey, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 penny You okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 sheldon_cooper I’m on vacation. What do you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 penny Why are you sitting in the stairwell?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Leonard told me to stay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 penny Oh. Well, good boy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Where are you going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 penny Oh, I have a ton of errands to run. I need to make copies of my headshot, send them off to agents and sign up for a new acting class.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Well, have fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 penny Okay. You want to come with me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 penny Come on, boy. Come on. Let’s go. Let’s go. Get in the car. Come on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 stuart_bloom All right, thanks a lot. They have one at Capital Comics.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, that’s great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 stuart_bloom No, it’s not. I hate that place. Guy who owns it is a jerk. He’s always making me feel bad about myself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, that’s terrible. What’s the address?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 stuart_bloom You know, why don’t I just take you there? That way, I can make sure he doesn’t rip you off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, thanks, but I don’twant you to close up. I mean, won’t you lose business? Sorry. That was mean.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Penny really quit The Cheesecake Factory?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 howard_wolowitz So, what is she doing today?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter I don’t know. She already thinks I don’t support this, so if I call, it might look like I’m checking up on her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 raj_koothrappali Well, do you support this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Of course I do. She’s a great actress. I’m proud she’s taking this risk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler That’s nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter You bought that? Great. I got to call her before I forget how I said it. Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 penny Hi. What’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Oh, how’s it going? You taking Hollywood by storm?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 penny Actually, I’m at The Cheesecake Factory.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter You got your job back. That is great news. I didn’t want to say anything, but you are making the right choice. To plunge yourself into debt right now would be literally insane.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 penny Yeah. I’m just returning my uniform.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter And I support you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 Before we begin your guided meditation, close your eyes and picture yourself in a peaceful environment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Okay. I’m inside the CERN super collider.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 Now, take a deep, relaxing breath in through your nose. And let it out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Wow. Didn’t see that coming.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 In.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Let me guess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 And out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 sheldon_cooper What was I gonna do? Two ins in a row? Where’s my lemonade?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 penny I didn’t get it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 sheldon_cooper A fitting swan song to your career as a waitress, to forget my order one last time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 penny Do you think quitting my job was a mistake?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Do you see me drinking lemonade?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 penny No. I’m serious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Why do you ask?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 penny Because Leonard just pissed me off. Am I being an idiot or not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 sheldon_cooper No, I don’t think you are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 penny Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 sheldon_cooper The best way to achieve a goal is to devote 100% of your time and energy to it. When I decided I was going to be a physicist, I didn’t take some other job in case it didn’t work out. Which wasn’t easy because there was a lot of pressure from Ms. Pearson for me to be chalk monitor that year.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 penny Thank you. I needed to hear that. Why can’t Leonard understand it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Because he’s not like us, Penny. We’re dreamers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 penny Yeah, I need to start cracking the window when I leave you in the car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 bert_kibbler Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Hello, Bert.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 bert_kibbler So, anyway, there’s this big, uh, rock and mineral show next week in Santa Monica.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Listen, um, Bert, before you say anything else, I, I have a boyfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 bert_kibbler Oh. This is awkward. You thought I was gonna ask you to go with me to the mineral show.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Weren’t you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 bert_kibbler Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler That’s very nice of you, but I do have a boyfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 bert_kibbler That’s what you all say. You just don’t want to go out with me because I have an off-putting personality.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler No, that’s not true. My boyfriend has an off-putting personality, too. Like, way worse than you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 bert_kibbler Don’t worry. I’m used to it. I mean, I’m big and weird and funny-looking and no one ever wants to do anything with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Don’t say that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 bert_kibbler It’s okay. I know I’m a monster.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler No, Bert, come on. I’d love to go to the mineral show with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 bert_kibbler Sweet. It’s a date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler No, it’s not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 bert_kibbler Too late.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski Wow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 stuart_bloom Yeah. Haven’t seen this many people in my store since that Korean church bus crashed through my front window.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 jesse Hey, Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 stuart_bloom Jesse.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 jesse Haven’t seen you in forever. Look how grey you’ve gotten.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 stuart_bloom My hair’s exactly the same colour as always.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 jesse No, I was talking about your skin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 stuart_bloom Look, uh, my friend here needs a comic book.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 jesse Ooh, and she went into your store by mistake. Good thing there was no one there to see you. What do you need? Oh, yeah, yeah. I got this. Right over here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 stuart_bloom Even you, Sweatpants?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 captain_sweatpants Free popcorn.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 jesse Can I offer you a coffee? Espresso? Latte?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski No, thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 jesse How about you, Stu? Mocha? Scone? Directions to the nearest soup kitchen?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 jesse I’m just kidding. He knows where the soup kitchen is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 stuart_bloom It’s on Merton Avenue.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t think I like the way you’re treating my friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 jesse Sorry. You want the book or not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski Not from you. Let’s go, Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 stuart_bloom You know something, Jesse? You may have a successful business and the kind of pink complexion that comes with good nutrition, but I have something more important.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 jesse What’s that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 stuart_bloom Friendship. Which I would trade in a heartbeat for all of this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 howard_wolowitz The mineral and rock show? That would be awful even without Bert.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler So what am I supposed to do now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 raj_koothrappali Prepare your uterus for his gigantic offspring?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler This isn’t funny. I’m gonna have to tell him the truth, that even if I didn’t have a boyfriend, I wouldn’t be interested in him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Oh, I’ve heard those words so many times. From Linda Nosenchuck, Tammy Rosenworcel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 raj_koothrappali Padma Kapur, Neha Chowdury.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Marci Grossman, Lisa Mazzarino.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 raj_koothrappali Megan Pincus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Tammy Cho.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 raj_koothrappali Oh, who was that girl from our Starbucks?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Arlene Russel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 raj_koothrappali Yes. Arlene. She wrote no way on both our cappuccinos.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Poor Bert. That guy’s got a rough afternoon ahead of him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Well, how would you want a girl to tell you she wasn’t interested?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 raj_koothrappali I guess, uh, I’d like her to sit me down, look me in the eye and say, I was wrong. I love you. And then maybe she could touch me in a special way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 howard_wolowitz That’s how you reject a guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Okay, I don’t have time for this. I’m just gonna go find him and be brutally honest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 howard_wolowitz No, don’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 raj_koothrappali He’ll be so upset. He’ll probably climb up the Empire State Building and start swatting at planes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 howard_wolowitz You want us to talk to him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Really? You would do that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 raj_koothrappali Sure. We’ve both been in his shoes. We’ll let him down with compassion and respect.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Let’s go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 raj_koothrappali So we tell him she’s a lesbian, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Of course we tell him she’s a lesbian.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 penny And hold three, two, one. Very good. Now let’s try Warrior 2. And hold.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 sheldon_cooper I’ve read that there are great yogis who have such mastery over their bodies they can draw water in through their genitals.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 penny Yeah, well, I don’t think we’re gonna get to do that today.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Too bad. It seems like a good way to drink a milk shake without getting brain freeze.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Oh, hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 penny And now we go to Reverse Warrior.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter How did she get you to do yoga?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Well, to be honest, I thought she said Yoda.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 penny I’m helping him relax because, unlike you, he supports me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Oh, how many times do I have to say it? I support you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 penny Sheldon, take a break.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Namaste.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 penny Okay, if you support me, what was with that phone call?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Fine. I’m not sure you should have quit. But if you care so much what I think, why didn’t you ask me before you did it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 penny Oh, so now I need your permission? Would you have asked me before you quit your job?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Yes. I thought we were in the kind of relationship where we make decisions together. If I’m wrong, then maybe we need to talk about the kind of relationship we’re actually in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 penny Yeah, well, maybe we do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 sheldon_cooper I’m willing to if you guys are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Can we please have some privacy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Y, No. I’m as much a part of this relationship as you two, and I think it’s high time we put all our cards on the table. For example, where is this going? Are you two ever getting married? And, if so, where will we all live? Have you thought about that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 penny Okay, wait. What are we doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter For some reason, we’re planning a future where we both live with Sheldon forever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Good. Now we’re getting somewhere.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 penny Look, I know you think I’m being reckless, and you might be right, but I need to take this shot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Yeah, no kidding. Despite what it says on her résumé, she is no longer 22.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter I swear, I am on your side.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 penny You keep saying you’re on my side, but you don’t act like it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 sheldon_cooper He does that to me, too. Why do we put up with it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Listen, I could never do what you’re doing, okay? I would be terrified.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 penny Well, it’s scary for me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 sheldon_cooper I’m fine with it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter My point is, just because I couldn’t do it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t. And I’m proud of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 penny Okay. Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Well, to celebrate this reconciliation, let’s all share a milk shake. Uh, Penny, you’ll need a straw.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 jesse You’re back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski Yes, I am, there’s a few more things I want to say to you. Stuart’s store is just fine, and he’s a much nicer person than you are, and if you still have that comic, I’d like to buy it right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 jesse No problem. Oh, you want a latte while you wait?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski No, I don’t want a latte. I want a cappuccino and a blueberry scone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 jesse I only have chocolate chip.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski Well, that sounds even better.
