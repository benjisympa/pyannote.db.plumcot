TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler Item 28, your pet name for me. Time’s running out on this. You need to make a decision.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 sheldon_cooper I submitted you a notarised list.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler I’m sorry, but Gollum and Flakey are not acceptable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Well, you don’t like Princess Corncob, you don’t like Fester, you’re just impossible to please.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler We’ll come back to that one. This brings us to the final item in our annual State of the Relationship Summit. Item 29, Valentine’s Day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Ah, the worst for last. Hmm. Classic Flakey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler Before you get upset, I believe I’ve come up with a way for us to celebrate the occasion that we both can enjoy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 sheldon_cooper People usually start a meeting with a joke, but you go ahead, end with one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler I propose we spend a weekend at a bed-and-breakfast in Napa Valley.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 sheldon_cooper I hate every word in that sentence. Including in, at, we and a.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler Come on, Sheldon. Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 sheldon_cooper For starters, a bed-and-breakfast forces you to eat with strangers at your table.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler One step ahead of you, Bernadette and Wolowitz are going with us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Oh, very well. What are the sleeping arrangements? We’ve only been dating for three years. If we were to share a room, people might talk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler I got you your own room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 sheldon_cooper What if my room has a claw-foot bathtub?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler It doesn’t. I know it makes you feel like you’re bathing inside a monster.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Look, I appreciate the effort, but I’m still unclear how this trip is supposed to be enjoyable for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler We’re going to have Valentine’s Day dinner on a fully functioning vintage train.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Vintage? Be specific.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler An Alcoa FA-4 diesel locomotive leading a train of meticulously restored 1915 Pullman first-class coaches.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Wow. I’m feeling the urge to hug you. And one, and two, all right, Gollum, we’re good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 bernadette_rostenkowski Are you sure you guys don’t want to come with us to Napa? You could probably still get a room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 penny No, I think we’re just gonna have a quiet weekend at home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Plus, I’m not sure it’s a great idea to take Penny to where wine comes from. What? It’s a joke. Oh, come on. We bust on each other. I wear dorky glasses, you might have a problem, it’s all for laughs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 penny That would really piss me off if I didn’t have a buzz going on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Howard, which pocket watch will you be wearing for dinner on the train?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 howard_wolowitz I’m sorry, what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Oh, I’m afraid if we wear the same pocket watch, it will be embarrassing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 howard_wolowitz I don’t own a pocket watch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Oh, my. Well, then my apologies for bringing up this sore spot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Since you two are gonna be around for Valentine’s, would you mind watching Cinnamon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 penny You have Valentine’s plans? Which came out sounding way more surprised than I meant. Here, let me try that again. You have Valent… See? I can’t do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 raj_koothrappali I don’t have plans which is why I booked time on the big telescope that night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler Well, an evening looking at the stars, that’s still kind of romantic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Except I’ll be alone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler I’m trying to put lipstick on a pig here. Work with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter We’d be happy to watch Cinnamon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 penny Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Thank you. Oh, and I’d like for at least one of us to see some action, so if you guys happen to have sex, it’s cool if she stays in the room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 penny Hey, same goes for the two of you with Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler What do you think, Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 sheldon_cooper It’s magnificent. This is going to be the best Valentine’s Day ever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler I’m so glad you like it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 sheldon_cooper I’m prepared to say I love it, as soon as I confirm there are no hobos aboard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Okay. Raj, I got it. Bye. That was your daddy. He wanted me to say that he misses… Why am I doing this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 penny Happy Valentine’s Day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Ooh, flowers and chocolates? Somebody’s trying to get me out of my panties.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 penny Don’t be surprised if you find five chocolates missing and three gross coconut ones with a bite taken out. It came that way when I bought it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Got you a little something, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 penny Aw, jewellery. Oh, my God, Lakers tickets?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter It gets better. Instead of me, you can take someone who will actually enjoy it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 penny Aw. You are the best boyfriend ever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Thank you. Seriously, please don’t make me go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 penny Should we take this little party to the bedroom?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Mm, don’t have to, we have the whole place to ourselves.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 penny Oh, that’s true.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter In fact, if you want, we can do it right here on Sheldon’s spot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 penny That is the least sexy thing anyone’s ever said to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter To the bedroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 penny Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 waiter And for the entrée, tonight’s special is a seafood risotto. Do you have any questions?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Uh, I do. Uh, does this train car have the original link-and-pin coupler or the Miller Hook and Platform?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 waiter I’m sorry, I meant questions about the food.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Oh, of course. Um, is the seafood risotto being served on a train car with the original link-and-pin coupler or the Miller Hook and Platform?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler Uh, I think we’re gonna need a minute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 man_in_seat_behind#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 Fun fact, it’s neither. They actually use the AAR type E coupler. If you listen carefully when the locomotive disconnects, you’ll hear the characteristic click-pshht-thunk of the knuckle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Get out of town.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Fun fact, I’m gonna jump off this train.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Hey, Cinnamon, guess who just did it human style.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 penny Oh, my God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter It’s a little late, but I’ll take it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 penny No, Cinnamon ate the chocolates. That’s really bad for dogs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Oh, crap. What are we gonna do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 penny We gotta get her to a vet right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter I don’t have a vet. I have a podiatrist, an optometrist, an allergist, a dermatologist, a urologist. You’d think I’d have a vet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 penny Okay. There’s one not far from here. Come on. Let’s go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Okay. Koothrappali was right. We should have let her watch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Do another one, do another one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 Okay. Here’s my impression of the Amtrak Acela barreling down the Eastern Corridor. Wch-wch-wch-wch-shhhh. Wch-wch-wch-wch-shhhh. Wch-wch-wch-wch-shhhh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 I’ve been on that train. And I just was again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler See if you guys can guess this one. Bang. Splat. Thud.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 sheldon_cooper How many trains have you been on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 Tons. A box fell on my head at UPS six years ago. Now I just collect disability and ride trains.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Wow. Your life’s amazing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 Not always. A box fell on my head at UPS six years ago. Now I just collect disability and ride trains.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler Why do I even try?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 bernadette_rostenkowski I’m gonna fix this right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Okay. Just make it look like an accident.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 bernadette_rostenkowski Excuse me. You are at Valentine’s dinner with your girlfriend. Now get back over there and be with her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 sheldon_cooper You’re right. That was insensitive of me. I have to go back to my table now. You should join us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 bernadette_rostenkowski Great. Now there’s two of ’em.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 yvette How much chocolate did she eat?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 penny A whole box.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Well, to be fair, you ate a lot of it before you gave it to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 penny So the point is I may have saved her life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 yvette I’m sorry, is this a joke to you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter No. Maybe to her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 yvette How big a box of chocolate was it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 penny Uh, something like this. I don’t know. It came free with a full tank of gas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Really? Do you know how much those Lakers tickets were?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 penny Do you know how much gas is?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 yvette Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 penny Sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Oh, my God, Cinnamon, are you okay? I can’t believe you two. You do whatever it takes to save her life. If she needs new organs, I’ll buy any dog necessary and scrap them for parts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 yvette You’re the owner?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Owner, father, soul mate, and if anything happens to her, your worst nightmare.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 yvette Well, she’s not throwing up, which is a good sign. So, I’m gonna take her in back, put her on fluids and give her something to absorb the toxins.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Okay. Okay, thank you. Oh, if she’s scared, you can sing to her. She likes Katy Perry. Oh, but don’t do Firework, that gets her all riled up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 yvette Got it. Should have been a dentist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 Okay, what was the best four-ten-four U.S. Locomotive ever built?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Trick question. There never was one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 Or was there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 sheldon_cooper What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 In 1944, the Pacific Railroad built number 6131, which rearranged the drivers and cylinders, solving the problem of the Q-1, creating a duplex-drive four-four-six-four.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 sheldon_cooper In what world is a four-four-six-four a four-ten-four?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 howard_wolowitz A world I don’t want to live in. Seriously, I no longer want to live in this world.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 Hold on to your conductor’s hat. You crank the second and third axles, creating a pair of internal connecting rods, and boom, four-ten-four. If you think about it, the Q-2 was like the four-ten-four America never made.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 sheldon_cooper I may never stop thinking about it. Amy, what are the odds we run into this guy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 waiter Better than you think.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 You know, if you ask nicely, they’ll let you visit the engine room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 sheldon_cooper I never want this day to end.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler It’s feeling like it never will.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Come on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 Hey, did I tell you what happened to me at UPS?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 raj_koothrappali As if Valentine’s Day wasn’t bad enough, you try to kill my dog? And with cheap chocolate, no less?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 penny It wasn’t cheap. It was free.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter We’re really sorry. It was an accident.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 penny Yeah, we weren’t even out of the room that long.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Oh, no, come on. It was a while. It was a while.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Oh, is Cinnamon gonna be okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 yvette She’s responding well. We just want to keep her a little longer for observation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 raj_koothrappali All right. Uh, would, would it be okay for me to see her? We’re usually in bed by now, and I want her to know that I’m here. Yes, we sleep together, and sometimes we spoon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 yvette It’s okay. I sleep with my dog, too. We’re not supposed to let people in back, but I think I can make an exception.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 yvette Come on. By the way, I sang her Katy Perry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Oh, yeah?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 yvette And I don’t care what that obnoxious parrot back there says. I crushed it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 penny I think there’s something going on between the two of them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Maybe, but you also think nine minutes isn’t a while, so what do you know?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 howard_wolowitz You okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler Why? Because my boyfriend’s off playing choo-choo with some weirdo?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Well, to be fair, they’re both weirdos.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler I don’t know what made me think tonight would be any different.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 bernadette_rostenkowski Well, just the fact that you got him up here still says a lot. To be honest, I bet Howie 200
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 howard_wolowitz I’m going to the Lego store to get a big-ass R2-D2.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 bernadette_rostenkowski See? It’s not just Sheldon. They’re all idiots.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 howard_wolowitz She’s right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 bernadette_rostenkowski So, your boyfriend’s a fixer-upper. Most of them are. I mean, look at this guy. You think he came like this? When I met him, he was a hot, goofy mess. Now, he’s been to space. That’s all me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 howard_wolowitz I had a little to do with it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, sure you did. Who’s Mama’s big space man?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 howard_wolowitz I am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter They’ve been in there, like, half an hour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 penny Yeah, for future reference, that’s a while.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter How long should we stay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 penny I don’t know. I’m kind of hungry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter I saw a Thai place next door.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 penny Oh. Okay. Oh. Oh. Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter How’s she doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 penny How is everything?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 raj_koothrappali She’s gonna be okay; they’re gonna let me take her home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 penny Oh, good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 yvette So I want you to keep a close eye on her for the next 24 hours. Here are a few warning signs to look out for, and if you see any of them, don’t hesitate to call.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Oh. Thank you for taking such good care of my little girl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 yvette My pleasure. Have a nice night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Yes, thank you for all your help.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 penny Yeah. I’m sorry if you didn’t think we were taking it seriously. We love animals.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 yvette Oh, do you guys own any pets?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 yvette Good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 howard_wolowitz I love you so much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 bernadette_rostenkowski I love you, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 bernadette_rostenkowski Sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 You guys missed a pretty great time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 sheldon_cooper The conductor and I have the same pocket watch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 It was crazy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Dare I say loco? Oh, and, Amy, guess what? The conductor said as soon as he gets off work, he can come back to the bed and breakfast and play his banjo for us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler Okay. I need to speak to my boyfriend in private, like, right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 howard_wolowitz There’s a car with a glass roof. Want to go look at the stars?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, that sounds so romantic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, give it a rest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 bernadette_rostenkowski Let’s go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler Why are you still here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Excuse me. I think you’re being a little rude.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler I’m being rude? You’ve been rude to me this entire evening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 sheldon_cooper How is that possible? I’ve hardly spoken to you since we got on the train.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 I’m detecting a little friction between you two, and I don’t want to be a third rail. Get it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 sheldon_cooper I get it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler Leave.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 sheldon_cooper What is your problem?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler It’s Valentine’s Day. We’re supposed to be having a romantic weekend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Oh, really? Because I remember you saying that this trip was going to be something we could both enjoy. Did you mean that, or were you just trying to trick me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler Fine, it’s true. I deserve romance, and I didn’t know how else to make it happen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Well, if you want romance, then let’s have romance. Oh, look, there’s wine. Mmm. Grape juice that burns. Uh, now let’s gaze into each other’s eyes, hmm? You blinked. I win.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Let’s see. What’s next? Oh, kissing’s romantic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler That was nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Good. Um, the conductor said if I come back to the engine room, he’d show me how to bring the train through a crossing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler Okay, have fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Do you want to come with me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler Really? I do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 Hey, guys, wait up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 raj_koothrappali There you go. All cozy wozy. Here, let’s see what the doctor says to keep an eye out for. Hmm. Rajesh, I was dreading Valentine’s Day. Thank you for spending it with me. Yvette. Cinnamon, she-she gave me her phone number. If I’d known it was that easy, I would have considered poisoning you months ago. Oh, what should I say? Oh, I know. I’ll point out her name’s Yvette, and that she’s a vet. That’s hysterical. She’ll love it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Oh, hey. You’re back. How was your trip?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 sheldon_cooper It was wonderful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Great. What did you do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 sheldon_cooper I made a new friend who likes trains as much as I do, uh, I kissed Amy on the lips, and, uh, the conductor played his banjo for me. Good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I’m gonna need more details.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Oh, well, my new friend’s name was Eric. Um, Amy lips tasted like the brownie we had for dessert. Oh, and the banjo-playing conductor was missing a finger, but he made up for it with his can-do attitude.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter No, hang on. Hang on. Are all those things equal to you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Hmm. It never occurred to me to pick a favourite.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Well, give it a go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 sheldon_cooper I can’t answer that without collecting additional data.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Additional data. You dog.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode15 sheldon_cooper I’m not sure how listening to other nine-fingered banjo players makes me dog, but all right.
