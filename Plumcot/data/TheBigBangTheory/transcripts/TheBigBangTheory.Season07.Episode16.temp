TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 howard I’m thinking about growing a goatee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 raj Oh, actually that’s a Van Dyke. A goatee is just hair on the chin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 leonard Oh. Wait, then what is it if you just have hair up here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 raj You mean a moo-stache?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 leonard Moo-stache.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 howard He said it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 raj Ha-ha, very funny. Make fun of the foreign guy. For your information, there are four times as many Indians as there are Americans, so the way we say it is right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 howard Say what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 raj Moo-stache.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 leonard Moo-stache.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 howard He said it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 bernadette Guys, you’re being childish.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 sheldon Yeah, she’s right. You’re grown men, the kind who are perfectly capable of growing your own moo-staches.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 amy Hey, you were funny on purpose, good job.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 penny Hi. Sorry I’m late, I was at an audition.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 leonard Oh, I’m sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 sheldon You’ll get ’em next time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 penny How about instead of assuming I failed, you ask me how it went?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 leonard Sorry. How did it go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 penny Just shut up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 raj Here, you can have your seat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 penny No, no, no, stay there. I’m fine on the floor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 bernadette Have you guys ever thought about getting a dining room table?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 amy Yeah. You actually do have room for one up there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 raj Oh, sure, I sit on the floor for years, no one cares. The pretty white girl’s there ten seconds, and suddenly we’re all running to IKEA.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 sheldon No one is running anywhere. We’re not getting a dining room table.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 leonard I know you don’t like change, but it’s not a terrible idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 penny Yeah, you guys never use that space up there. Why not get a table?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 sheldon Do you want the long answer or the short answer?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 howard Hey, how come we never get that option?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 sheldon Chaos theory suggests that even in a deterministic system, if the equations describing its behaviour are non-linear, a tiny change in the initial conditions can lead to a cataclysmic and unpredictable result.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 penny Translation?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 leonard Waah. I don’t want a table.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 leonard Hey, Penny and I are gonna go shop for a dining room table. You want to come with us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 sheldon You know, I’d love to, but, um, I’m too busy falling back in love with Windows 98.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 leonard Seriously? You haven’t used this desk in years. The second I want to get rid of it, you’re up here working?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 sheldon I can’t talk right now, I have several thousand updates to install.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 leonard Are you really gonna sit here all day?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 sheldon Think of me as Arthur Dent in Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, lying in front of the bulldozers to protect his home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 leonard If you’ll recall, the Vogon fleet blew up the Earth anyway.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 sheldon It’s a made-up story, Leonard, I don’t even know why you’re talking about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 leonard I’m putting all this stuff in storage. We don’t need any of it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 sheldon You, how can you say that? You show me one thing in here we can live without.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 leonard Oh, hang on. Check your in-box.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 sheldon Wait. Is this really worth it? We’ve lived together for years with nary an argument.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 leonard Huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 sheldon But we start talking about a table, and suddenly we’re at each other’s throats.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 leonard Nary an argument? Nary?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 sheldon Well, that means not one, or not any. Maybe instead of a table, you should buy a dictionary. Well, I don’t know if I won that, but at least he’s upset.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 howard Check it out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 raj Magic wand TV remote?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 howard Yeah, I can control all sorts of stuff.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 raj Did Bernadette think it was cool?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 howard Not when I said mute and pointed it at her face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 raj Oh, uh, let me try. Uh, channelis changeroni. This might be my second favorite brown magic wand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 howard Well, that’s the last time I play with that. I have to take this. Hello? 00:04:24,137
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 raj Uh, off. And on. And the Oprah Network. This is so much better than watching TV like a muggle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 howard Okay. Thank you. We’ll be in touch. You’re not gonna believe this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 raj What’s going on? Oh. Wait. On. And off. What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 howard That was NASA. They want me to go back up to the space station.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 raj Wow. What did you tell them?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 howard I told them I’d be honoured.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 raj A second trip to space, I’ll miss you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 howard And I’m gonna miss you, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 raj And I just want you to know, I’m happy to look in on Bernadette while you’re gone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 howard Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 raj And if anything were to happen to you, we will name our first born son Howard. I’m just kidding. We’ll name him Dalib, after my grandfather.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 penny Ooh, this one looks nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 leonard No. Sheldon doesn’t like reclaimed wood.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 penny Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 leonard He’s afraid the original owners will come back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 penny Yeah. Well, Sheldon’s not here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 leonard Well, he is here. So unless you want to dig him out with a bone saw and a melon baller, there’s nothing I can do about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 penny All right, sweetie, you’re paying for this table, and it’s your apartment, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 leonard I know, but…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 penny No buts. You got to stop letting him boss you around.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 leonard You’re right. I mean, he decides what TV shows we watch, what food we eat, who my favourite hobbit is. I wanted Frodo, but we can’t both have Frodo, so guess who’s stuck with Samwise Gamgee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 penny See? Right there. You’re a grown man, you should be able to pick whichever hobbit you want. Wish you wouldn’t, but one problem at a time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 leonard You make a lot of sense. I like this table, and I’m getting it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 penny Really? This one?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 leonard That one? Damn right I like that one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 bernadette Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 howard Good news. Someone in this room gets to take a ride on a rocket.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 bernadette Fine. Can I at least shower first?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 howard No, not that. Although you already agreed to it, so no take-backs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 bernadette What are you talking about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 howard Sit down. NASA called. The telescope mount I installed on the space station got damaged, and they want me to go back up and fix it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 bernadette Wow. Well, what did you say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 howard What do you think I said? I said yes. Why do you look surprised?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 bernadette Well, it’s just, after last time, I didn’t think you’d ever want to go back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 howard Are you kidding? It was the greatest experience of my life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 bernadette Really? ‘Cause I kind of remember a lot of complaining and wishing for it to be over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 howard I think you have me confused with what’s gonna happen when you get out of that shower.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 leonard Hey, all set. What do you think? There’s plenty of room for everybody, a view out the window.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 sheldon My spot on the couch has a great view of a window. Sometimes I can see space battles through it. It’s called a TV.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 penny Give it a chance, Sheldon, you might actually like it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 sheldon You’re absolutely right. Nope.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 penny Well, you can’t say he didn’t give it a fair shot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 sheldon So, when can we get rid of it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 leonard We’re not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 sheldon What about the roommate agreement? It specifically states that any changes in furnishing have to be approved by the Furnishing Committee. Which only sits on alternate years. Yeah, and by the way, it sits over there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 penny Come on, that is ridiculous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 leonard She’s right, a committee that important should meet more often.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 penny That’s not what I’m saying.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 leonard Oh. This is the thing about me standing up to him and not letting him run my life?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 penny Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 leonard That.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 sheldon Okay. I think we’ve found the problem here. It’s not the table at all. It’s you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 penny Me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 leonard Well, it’s always me, take one for the team.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 sheldon I have spent years turning this lump of clay into an acceptable conduit for my will, and then you came along and reshaped him, with your newfangled ideas and your fancy genitals.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 penny Are you gonna let him talk to me like this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 leonard Fancy sounds like a compliment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 penny Okay, I have not tried to change Leonard. That’s just what happens in relationships. Look how much Amy’s changed you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 sheldon That’s not true.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 penny Oh, please. When I first met you, you were incapable of touching another human being. Now you’re holding hands, you’re going on dates, you even made out with her on a train.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 sheldon She told you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 penny Of course she told me, it’s the most interesting thing that’s ever happened to her in her entire life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 leonard You’re too close to it, but Amy has had a huge impact on you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 sheldon You’re right. Without realizing it, I’ve allowed that woman to alter my personality.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 leonard Mm, Sheldon, you didn’t have a personality, you just had some shows you liked.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 sheldon No. No, I’ve changed. Like the frog who’s put in a pot of water that’s heated so gradually he doesn’t realize he’s boiling to death.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 penny Or you’re the frog who’s been kissed by a princess and turned into a prince.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 leonard Or you’re just a tall, annoying frog.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 sheldon Excuse me. I have to break up with my girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 penny Oh, Sheldon, wait.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 sheldon No. You’ve opened my eyes to the truth. Amy has made me a more affectionate, open-minded person. And that stops now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 leonard Well, we should call her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 penny Yeah, mm-hmm. Amy, it’s Penny. Hey. Just a little heads-up. Leonard bought a dining room table. Yeah. Sheldon’s breaking up with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 sheldon Amy? Amy? Amy? I’ll get right to the point. I think we need to end this relationship, so just sign this with your finger, and, uh, please don’t cry on my iPad, I didn’t get AppleCare.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 amy I’m not surprised you want to end the relationship. I’m a little surprised you didn’t get AppleCare. Anyway, enjoy your life. Where do I sign?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 sheldon At the bottom. I must say, I’m relieved you’re not making more of a scene out of this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 amy Oh, I’ve already moved on. Besides, this breakup has nothing to do with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 sheldon It doesn’t?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 amy Of course not. This is just Leonard trying to take the focus off that dreadful table by sowing discord in our relationship. He’s manipulating you like he always does.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 sheldon Wait, wait, now, hang on. You think he manipulates me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 amy All the time. And he knew that, as your girlfriend, I wasn’t gonna stand by and let him bring a table into your apartment. I mean, a table? Come on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 sheldon It is hideous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 amy Well, thankfully, I won’t have to see it, ’cause I won’t be your girlfriend anymore. Amy Farrah Fowler. Why, yes, I would like to take a survey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 sheldon Wait. You were really gonna stand by me against the dining room table?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 amy Of course I was.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 sheldon Wait. How do I know that you’re not manipulating me right now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 amy I think if I were manipulating you, you’d be smart enough to see it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 sheldon How do I know you’re not saying that as part of the manipulation?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 amy I think you’d be smart enough to see that, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 sheldon Okay. I’m sorry I gave you such a hard time, I just had to be sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 raj It’s pretty exciting that NASA wants to send Howard back up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 bermadette Yeah, exciting. Can I ask you something?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 raj Course.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 bernadette He hated that entire experience. Does it make me an awful wife if I don’t think he should do it again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 raj Not at all. He’s forgotten how miserable he was the entire time he was up there. It’s like me in those moments when I miss India.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 bernadette So you’ll talk to him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 raj Why me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 bernadette Well, I’m his wife, I don’t want to ruin it for him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 raj That’s the dynamic, I’m the fun one, you’re the buzzkill.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 bernadette Since when am I the buzzkill?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 raj Do you think this is cool?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 bernadette No, I think it’s stupid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 raj Aha.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 bernadette You’re right, it’s great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 sheldon Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 leonard Oh, hey. You guys didn’t break up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 sheldon No. Sorry to disappoint you, but Amy pointed out that you were only trying to manipulate me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 amy Which you also figured out by yourself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 sheldon Which I also figured out by myself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 penny Well, I’m glad you’re still together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 sheldon Yeah, okay, you can stop trying to make this about our relationship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 amy Which is stronger than ever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 sheldon Which is stronger than ever. This is about you trying to change my environment, which was perfect the way it was.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 howard But it got the way it was through change. The-the-the spot that you love to sit in, that no one else can sit in, only exists because, despite your objections. I bought this couch. Me. So explain why that change was bad and this change was good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 sheldon Um.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 amy You don’t need to explain yourself to him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 sheldon I don’t need to explain myself to you!
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 amy You’re sick of his nonsense and ready to move in with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 sheldon Keep the table. We don’t use that space.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 amy Damn it, I got cocky.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 howard Hey, Bernie. I’m home. Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 bernadette Hi, honey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 howard What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 bernadette Maybe you should have a seat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 howard Um, okay. I know my mom’s not dead, there’d be balloons.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 raj Um, okay. First off, know that we all love you and cherish you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 mike_rostenkowski Well, I wouldn’t…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 bernadette Daddy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 mike_r You’re great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 mike_massimino Can I say something?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 raj Oh, of course.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 mike_m Hey, Fruit Loops.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 howard Massimino? Why are you here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 mike_m Well, I heard you were thinking about going back up to the space station, and as someone who’s been there with you, well, you know how astronauts need to have the right stuff?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 howard Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 mike_m The stuff you have is wrong.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 howard You don’t think I did a good job up there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 mike_m You did a fine job. It’s just, you were scared and miserable the whole time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 bernadette I think what we’re all trying to say is, you don’t seem to be remembering how traumatic the experience was for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 raj Like how women often forget the pain of childbirth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 mike_r Like a woman. Great analogy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 howard Fine, maybe I was a little scared.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 mike_m You peed in your space suit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 howard You’re supposed to do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 mike_m Not during the fitting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 mike_r Son, do I need to remind you what you asked me to do before you went up last time?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 howard Hang on. That was just me joking around.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 mike_r You wanted me to shoot you in the foot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 howard Come on, how is that not a joke? You got to get me out of this. Shoot me in the foot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 bernadette Don’t forget all the other astronauts picking on you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 raj And how you threw up in zero gravity, and it floated back in your mouth. And you threw up again. And so on and so on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 mike_m That was funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 howard Okay, so I wasn’t exactly John Glenn up there, but I’ve changed. I’m a different man now. Yeah, and I’m a little insulted that you guys don’t think I can handle it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 mike_m You know you’re gonna have to go through survival training again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 howard Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 howard You’ve got to get me out of this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 doctor What do you want me to do? You’re perfectly healthy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 howard Check my blood pressure again. I can get it higher. just give me a second. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 mrs_wolowitz Hello?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 howard Hi, Ma. How are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 mrs_wolowitz How I am is not dead, but you wouldn’t know that, because you don’t love me enough to pick up the phone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 howard Go, go, go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 mrs_wolowitz For all you know, I could have slipped in the tub and drowned. That’s what happened to your Aunt Ida.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 doctor Wow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 raj Howard, I’m so sorry your blood pressure was off the charts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 howard Oh, me, too. I mean, the doctor was willing to fudge the results, but it just seemed so darned dishonest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 leonard But the mission wouldn’t be for at least a year. Isn’t that enough time to get your blood pressure under…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 howard Look, my blood pressure’s too high, okay? Drop it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 penny You know, my aunt changed her diet, and in a few months, she…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 howard Went to space? I don’t think so. Now, pass the soy sauce. Hey, not the green one, the red one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 penny Sheldon, Amy, will you please come join us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 bernadette Yeah, it’s fun up here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 leonard So why are you trying to ruin it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 sheldon No, thanks. We’re fine. I mean, if you people want to eat at the table, then that’s what you should do. I like eating down here because this is how we’ve always done things. But if those days are gone, they’re gone. It just makes me sad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 bernadette Now I feel bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 leonard Oh, don’t anthropomorphize him, he’s got big eyes, but his feelings are not like ours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 bernadette No, it just seems silly for us to sit in two groups.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 leonard Well, it’s not silly if you think of that group as being led by a big, evil baby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 bernadette Look at Amy down there. Should we go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 penny Yeah, let’s go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 leonard But Penny, this was your idea. You said that I should stand up to him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 penny Forget it, Leonard. It’s over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 leonard Fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 amy Rajesh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 raj Screw that! I sat on the floor for seven years. I’m staying right here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 bernadette Come on, Raj, it’s not the same without you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 raj Fine. But no more making fun of how I say tings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 howard You mean tings like moo-stache?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode16 sheldon Well, isn’t this nice. Sometimes the baby wins.
