TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 amy Should you really be sitting in Sheldon’s spot?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj He’s in Texas, he’ll never know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny I wouldn’t be so sure about that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard Yeah, he has a very sensitive butt. Well, it’s true. Once I saw him sit on a bunch of loose change and add it up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj Have you heard from Howard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 bernadette I did. His talk at NASA went great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny Sheldon didn’t heckle him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 bernadette No, in fact, he was so well-behaved, Howie bought him a Buzz Aldrin bobble head and astronaut ice cream.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 stuart Hey, guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 amy Oh, hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 bernadette Hi, Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj Hey, Stuart!
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 stuart How’s it going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj Good. Sheldon’s out of town, so we can do whatever we want. We even ordered from the Thai place he doesn’t like.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 stuart Oh, how is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny Disgusting. Do not tell him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard What do you guys want to do tonight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 amy I don’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 bernadette Well, I told Howie if I wasn’t busy, I’d spend the night at his mom’s. So for God’s sake, think of something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj Stuart? Are you okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 stuart No, I don’t feel so…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard Oh, my God, Stuart?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny Oh, my God, you guys need to do something!
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj Stuart?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard Calling 911.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj Well, it’s too late.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard What do you mean it’s too late?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj He’s been murdered by someone in this room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny Oh, my God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard Oh, come on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj Welcome to another classic Koothrappali murder mystery dinner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 amy I’m leaving.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj You can’t leave. You’re a suspect in the mysterious murder of Stuart Bloom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 bernadette I didn’t know his last name was Bloom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 amy Yeah, it’s Bloom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny Are you really gonna lie on the floor and pretend to be dead all night?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 stuart What do you think I was gonna do at home?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny Are you gonna make us pretend to be a bunch of lame characters with silly accents?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj Lame characters with silly ac…, what kind of actress are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny You’re right, I’m sorry. Sounds like fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny That kind of actress. This sucks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard Come on, guys. Raj put a lot of effort into this. And that’s great. It’s not sad, it’s great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 amy I think it might be fun to be someone else tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj Actually, you’re all just gonna be yourselves.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 amy Oh, ugh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 bernadette All right, if I’m doing this, I’m playing to win, so just to be clear, if we’re ourselves, that means one of us killed Stuart?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj Very good, Bernadette. You are a regular Byomkesh Bakshi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 bernadette What is that, like, the Indian Sherlock Holmes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj Or is Sherlock Holmes the English Byomkesh Bakshi?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 amy According to Wikipedia, Sherlock Holmes came first.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj Great, everyone’s a Byomkesh Bakshi. Now, here are some secret facts about each of you, including whether you are the murderer. Throughout the game, feel free to ask each other questions to uncover clues.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny Got it. Hey, who’s the murderer?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj Any question but that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny Sorry. Hey, who’s not the murderer?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 stuart Bernadette, can you not stand so close to me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 bernadette What do you care? You’re dead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 stuart Suit yourself. But I can kind of see up your skirt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon Thank you for my bobble head.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard Thank you for not making fun of me during my speech.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon It wasn’t easy. Was it Buzz?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard We can’t show up to your mom’s empty-handed. We should bring something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon I already am. I’m bringing the gift of knowledge.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard Oh, boy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon Despite what her Bible says, recent archaeological studies indicate that although camels are referenced in the Old Testament, they didn’t exist in the Middle East until hundreds of years later.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard I was gonna say we pick up a cake or a pie. But an insult to her faith is always thoughtful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 bernadette So, what happens next?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj I can’t tell you that. But perhaps the killer dropped a fun and imaginative clue somewhere in the apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny Ooh, I’m gonna check the fridge, and see if there are any clues inside a beer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 amy Hey, I found something. It looks like a little man with a briefcase.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard Oh, no, no. That’s Clarence Darrow. It’s from a game Sheldon made up called Chutes and Lawyers. You slide down a chute and then work your way back up through the appellate system.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj Well, unlike that, my games are much more fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny Okay, can I ask you something? Why do you like making us do this stuff?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj Well, I guess it goes back to when I was a fat kid in India, and didn’t have any friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 bernadette I didn’t know you were fat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj Yeah, I was. I was 200 pounds by the time I was in middle school. Kids were mean. Cows may be sacred there, but it doesn’t help if you look like one. Anyway, I was pretty lonely, so I had to make up my own stories and games, and I promised myself if I ever made any friends that, that I would play those games with them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 amy That is so sweet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard I’ve seen old pictures of you. You were never a fat kid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj No, I was svelte as a gazelle. A gazelle blessed with a flair for storytelling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 bernadette Hey, what about this? It looks like a receipt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 amy What’s it for?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 bernadette For a cup of coffee. But it’s dated 20 years from now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj From the future? How fun and imaginative.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard So one of us came back from the future to murder Stuart?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj Correct.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard Does the gazelle with a flair for storytelling know he’s just ripping off Terminator?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj Does the smart-ass know that Terminator was actually ripped off from an Outer Limits script called Demon With a Glass Hand, by Harlan Ellison?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard Oh, does the gazelle know that according to Harlan Ellison, it was not ripped off from Demon With a Glass Hand, but was ripped off from another Outer Limits script he wrote called The Soldier?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny I’m gonna need another clue.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard Okay, give me the flowers and pie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon But if we show up and you’re holding them, she’ll think they’re only from you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard They are only from me. You said the gift of you was enough.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon Yes, but now that I’ve seen what the gift of me with flowers and pie looks like, there’s no going back. Boy, I can’t wait to see the look on her face. We’re leaving right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard What’s wrong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon Nothing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard What? Sheldon, tell me what’s going on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon I saw my mommy with a naked man and she was trying to be a mommy again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard You ready to talk about it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon I’m not nearly drunk enough. Okay. Do you have any idea what it’s like to see your mother ravaging someone?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard Does a brisket count? I’m sorry, buddy, that’s rough. But didn’t she know we were coming?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon No. I wanted to surprise her. What am I supposed to say to her after something like this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard Well, did she see you in the window?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard Then don’t say anything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon I have to. How can we ever hope to have a healthy relationship if I don’t tell her how disappointed I am, and that I’ll never forgive her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard Well, don’t do it on the phone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon No, I’m just going to tell her I’m coming so she can give that good time Charlie the heave-ho.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard That’s some tough talk, I may need to cut you off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon Yeah, maybe you better, I took a pretty big sip.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard Look, she’s a grown woman. And, and your dad’s been gone a long time. Maybe this is none of your business.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon I beg to differ. I used to live in those genitals. And if someone wants to move into my old room, I should at least get a vote.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj Okay, murder suspects, Leonard has found the time machine the killer must’ve used. You’re all inside it, and we hurtle through the very fabric of time. And welcome to 20 years in the future. Hey, you guys just time-travelled. Stop looking so bored.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny Well, my beer isn’t flat and my rack’s not saggy. So far, the future’s great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 stuart Hey, can I go to the bathroom?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj Fine, just try not to look too alive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 stuart That’s my jam.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 bernadette So one of us went back in time to kill Stuart?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 amy But why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj Perhaps this will help. Here are some facts about yourselves in the future that might contain a clue.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 amy Hey, I won the Nobel Prize in physiology, then I used the money to buy Stuart’s comic book store, and close it down so Sheldon would pay attention to me. Not the worst idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny Hey, I’m a famous actress living in London.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard Hmm, I’m a professor at Stanford.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny Hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 bernadette So I guess you two are making it work long distance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj Oh, no. In this game, as your careers both took off, you drifted apart. Kind of like how future me lost touch with you guys after I became boy toy for the wrinkled, but still flexible, Madonna.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 amy What does your card say, Bernadette?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard Uh, uh, uh, hang on. Do you think we’d really drift apart if we both became successful?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny Of course not. If I became a famous actress and had to move, you would just come with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard But if I get a chance to be a tenured professor, I might not have that much choice in where I end up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny Yeah, but if I become a successful actress, we wouldn’t need the money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard Well, you don’t go into science for the money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 bernadette Speak for yourself. Last month, my company both invented and cured Restless Eye Syndrome. Ka-ching, ya blinky chumps.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny So, wait, if my career took me somewhere else, you might not go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 amy Dun, dun, dun. He started it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj Okay, okay, guys, new back stories. Uh, Penny and Leonard, you two lovebirds are super successful and living in New York. Uh, you’re an actress, you’re a professor and you have three beautiful kids.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard Great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny Really? You think I’m putting this body through three kids?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon Okay, let’s do this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard Good luck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon You, aren’t you gonna come with me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard While you confront your mother about her sex life? I’d rather go back to that bar in ass-less chaps.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon Mother? Mother? Mother?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 mrs_cooper Shelly, I’m so glad you’re here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon I saw you having naked sex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 mrs_cooper What are you talking about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon Earlier, I came here to surprise you. I looked in the window and I saw you with a man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 mrs_cooper Oh, Shelly, I’m so sorry. Come in. Um, maybe we should sit down and talk about this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon Can you recommend a surface you haven’t had coitus on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 mrs_cooper That’s not funny. Maybe we should sit at the table. Well, I’m sure that, uh, you have a lot of questions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon Who was he?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 mrs_cooper His name is Ron. I met him at my prayer group.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon How long have you been involved with him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 mrs_cooper A few months.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon And of those few months, how long have you been a demented sex pervert?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 mrs_cooper That is no way to speak to your mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon Perhaps not. But it is a way to speak to a woman who quoted the Bible to me my whole life, and then desecrates one of Ethan Allen’s finest sofas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 mrs_cooper I will give you one opportunity, young man, to apologize.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon Or what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 mrs_cooper Or I will send you to your room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon That’s ridiculous. I am a grown man. I am a professional scientist. And I currently occupy the moral high ground.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 mrs_cooper Go to your room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon But I occupy the moral high ground.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 mrs_cooper Go to your room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon But I’m a professional scientist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 mrs Go to your room!
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon I’m a grown man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj Can we please get back to the game?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard In a minute. I don’t understand why any success you have in acting is more important than any I have in science.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny Okay, if you do something cool in science, you might change the world. If I become a famous actress, I’m not gonna tell you why movie stars are the best. They just are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 amy I’m surprised you guys never talked about this stuff.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard Like you and Sheldon have everything figured out?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 amy Actually, our relationship agreement covers a wide array of scenarios, including career changes, financial instability, intelligent dog uprising. FYI, we plan on selling out the human race hard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny In 20 years, who knows what’ll happen with any of us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 stuart I think you and Leonard will be together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny You do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 stuart Yeah. I think you’re the best couple I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard Aw.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny That’s so sweet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 bernadette What the hell?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 amy Excuse me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny Ah-da-da-da-da, let the dead man talk. So, why do you think that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 stuart Uh, well, I feel like you guys make each other better. Penny brought Leonard out of his shell. And it seems like Leonard makes Penny think more deeply about the world. I don’t know. Together, you two kind of make one awesome person.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny Aw, Stuart. Now I feel bad for murdering you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj Oh, come on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 bernadette Penny did it, I win. Suck it, jackasses.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard Hey, can I come in?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon Apparently any man is welcome in this house. Why not you? I thought you were waiting in the car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard That was an hour ago, Sheldon. A Jew sits in front of a house in Texas that long, For Sale signs start to go up. I take it things didn’t go smoothly with your mom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon No. I’m not sure how we’re going to get past this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard You know, I, I sort of went through something like this myself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon Howard, we’ve all seen your mother naked. That woman needs to learn how to tie a robe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard I’m talking about when my mom started seeing someone a couple of years after my dad left.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon I didn’t know she did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard Yeah, she was dating this guy, and I was kind of a jerk to her about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon What did you do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard Well, let’s just say it was the most vicious bar mitzvah speech in the history of Temple Beth El. Anyway, she broke up with him. And she’s basically been alone ever since. She never said it, but I always felt I was the reason why.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon I’m sorry. Although, based on your story, you absolutely were the reason why.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard All I’m saying is you might not want to get in the way of your mom’s happiness.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon You may have a point. I love my mother. Even if she fornicates like a demonic weasel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard And the healing begins.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 mrs_cooper Hello. Are you ready to discuss this calmly, like adults?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon I am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 mrs_cooper Shelly, I’m sorry that you saw what you saw. I know that this is hard for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon I think what most upsets me about it, Mother, is the hypocrisy. Doesn’t this contradict all the religious rules you’ve been espousing your whole life?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 mrs_cooper You’re right, it does, and it’s something that I’m struggling with these days.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon Then why are you doing it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 mrs_cooper Because I’m not perfect, Shelly. And that man’s booty is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon Well, this is confusing for me. But I don’t want to stand in the way of your happiness. So, I’ll condemn you internally while maintaining an outward appearance of acceptance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 mrs_cooper That is very Christian of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon Mother, if you’re going to conduct your life in this fashion, then I should let you know that the world has changed since you were a young woman. You know, it’s not all sock hops, soda jerks and segregation anymore.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 mrs_cooper How old do you think I am?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon My point is that you’re going to need to be careful. You used to be protected by your pre-Enlightenment mythology, but now you’re going to need a stronger friend named latex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 mrs_cooper Are you having the sex talk with me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon Well, someone has to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 mrs_cooper Oh, dear Lord.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon No, don’t look to Him. He’s mad at you right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny Oh, come on, don’t pout. I’m sorry I ruined your game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj I’m not pouting, I’m brooding. Which is how sexy men pout.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 amy It actually was kind of fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj You’re just saying that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 amy Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 bernadette I liked the time travel element.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj Thank you. I thought it was inspired.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard It was. By Terminator.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 bernadette Well, I hope 20 years from now, we really are all still together and still friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny Definitely.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard Of course. Well, hey, how about this? Whether we’re friends, not friends, scattered around the world, no matter what, let’s all promise to meet in front of this building exactly 20 years from tonight at 8:00 p.m. and have dinner like we always do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 bernadette Aw.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny I love it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard Putting it in my phone right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny Yeah, me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 stuart My phone doesn’t have a calendar. So I’ll just write it on my hand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj And it’s done.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny Yup, we’re all in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard All right, I’ll see you guys in 20 years.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 stuart I knew it.
