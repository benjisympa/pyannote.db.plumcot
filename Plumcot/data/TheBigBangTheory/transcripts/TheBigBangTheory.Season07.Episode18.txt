TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler Should you really be sitting in Sheldon’s spot?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj_koothrappali He’s in Texas, he’ll never know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny I wouldn’t be so sure about that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, he has a very sensitive butt. Well, it’s true. Once I saw him sit on a bunch of loose change and add it up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj_koothrappali Have you heard from Howard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 bernadette_rostenkowski I did. His talk at NASA went great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny Sheldon didn’t heckle him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 bernadette_rostenkowski No, in fact, he was so well-behaved, Howie bought him a Buzz Aldrin bobble head and astronaut ice cream.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 stuart_bloom Hey, guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 bernadette_rostenkowski Hi, Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj_koothrappali Hey, Stuart!
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 stuart_bloom How’s it going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj_koothrappali Good. Sheldon’s out of town, so we can do whatever we want. We even ordered from the Thai place he doesn’t like.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 stuart_bloom Oh, how is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny Disgusting. Do not tell him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter What do you guys want to do tonight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler I don’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 bernadette_rostenkowski Well, I told Howie if I wasn’t busy, I’d spend the night at his mom’s. So for God’s sake, think of something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj_koothrappali Stuart? Are you okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 stuart_bloom No, I don’t feel so…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Oh, my God, Stuart?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny Oh, my God, you guys need to do something!
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj_koothrappali Stuart?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Calling 911.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj_koothrappali Well, it’s too late.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter What do you mean it’s too late?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj_koothrappali He’s been murdered by someone in this room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny Oh, my God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Oh, come on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj_koothrappali Welcome to another classic Koothrappali murder mystery dinner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler I’m leaving.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj_koothrappali You can’t leave. You’re a suspect in the mysterious murder of Stuart Bloom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 bernadette_rostenkowski I didn’t know his last name was Bloom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler Yeah, it’s Bloom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny Are you really gonna lie on the floor and pretend to be dead all night?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 stuart_bloom What do you think I was gonna do at home?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny Are you gonna make us pretend to be a bunch of lame characters with silly accents?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj_koothrappali Lame characters with silly ac…, what kind of actress are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny You’re right, I’m sorry. Sounds like fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj_koothrappali Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny That kind of actress. This sucks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Come on, guys. Raj put a lot of effort into this. And that’s great. It’s not sad, it’s great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler I think it might be fun to be someone else tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj_koothrappali Actually, you’re all just gonna be yourselves.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, ugh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 bernadette_rostenkowski All right, if I’m doing this, I’m playing to win, so just to be clear, if we’re ourselves, that means one of us killed Stuart?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj_koothrappali Very good, Bernadette. You are a regular Byomkesh Bakshi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 bernadette_rostenkowski What is that, like, the Indian Sherlock Holmes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj_koothrappali Or is Sherlock Holmes the English Byomkesh Bakshi?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler According to Wikipedia, Sherlock Holmes came first.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj_koothrappali Great, everyone’s a Byomkesh Bakshi. Now, here are some secret facts about each of you, including whether you are the murderer. Throughout the game, feel free to ask each other questions to uncover clues.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny Got it. Hey, who’s the murderer?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj_koothrappali Any question but that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny Sorry. Hey, who’s not the murderer?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 stuart_bloom Bernadette, can you not stand so close to me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 bernadette_rostenkowski What do you care? You’re dead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 stuart_bloom Suit yourself. But I can kind of see up your skirt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Thank you for my bobble head.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard_wolowitz Thank you for not making fun of me during my speech.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon_cooper It wasn’t easy. Was it Buzz?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard_wolowitz We can’t show up to your mom’s empty-handed. We should bring something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon_cooper I already am. I’m bringing the gift of knowledge.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard_wolowitz Oh, boy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Despite what her Bible says, recent archaeological studies indicate that although camels are referenced in the Old Testament, they didn’t exist in the Middle East until hundreds of years later.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard_wolowitz I was gonna say we pick up a cake or a pie. But an insult to her faith is always thoughtful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 bernadette_rostenkowski So, what happens next?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj_koothrappali I can’t tell you that. But perhaps the killer dropped a fun and imaginative clue somewhere in the apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny Ooh, I’m gonna check the fridge, and see if there are any clues inside a beer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler Hey, I found something. It looks like a little man with a briefcase.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Oh, no, no. That’s Clarence Darrow. It’s from a game Sheldon made up called Chutes and Lawyers. You slide down a chute and then work your way back up through the appellate system.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj_koothrappali Well, unlike that, my games are much more fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny Okay, can I ask you something? Why do you like making us do this stuff?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj_koothrappali Well, I guess it goes back to when I was a fat kid in India, and didn’t have any friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 bernadette_rostenkowski I didn’t know you were fat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj_koothrappali Yeah, I was. I was 200 pounds by the time I was in middle school. Kids were mean. Cows may be sacred there, but it doesn’t help if you look like one. Anyway, I was pretty lonely, so I had to make up my own stories and games, and I promised myself if I ever made any friends that, that I would play those games with them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler That is so sweet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter I’ve seen old pictures of you. You were never a fat kid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj_koothrappali No, I was svelte as a gazelle. A gazelle blessed with a flair for storytelling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 bernadette_rostenkowski Hey, what about this? It looks like a receipt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler What’s it for?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 bernadette_rostenkowski For a cup of coffee. But it’s dated 20 years from now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj_koothrappali From the future? How fun and imaginative.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter So one of us came back from the future to murder Stuart?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj_koothrappali Correct.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Does the gazelle with a flair for storytelling know he’s just ripping off Terminator?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj_koothrappali Does the smart-ass know that Terminator was actually ripped off from an Outer Limits script called Demon With a Glass Hand, by Harlan Ellison?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Oh, does the gazelle know that according to Harlan Ellison, it was not ripped off from Demon With a Glass Hand, but was ripped off from another Outer Limits script he wrote called The Soldier?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny I’m gonna need another clue.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard_wolowitz Okay, give me the flowers and pie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon_cooper But if we show up and you’re holding them, she’ll think they’re only from you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard_wolowitz They are only from me. You said the gift of you was enough.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Yes, but now that I’ve seen what the gift of me with flowers and pie looks like, there’s no going back. Boy, I can’t wait to see the look on her face. We’re leaving right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard_wolowitz What’s wrong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Nothing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard_wolowitz What? Sheldon, tell me what’s going on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon_cooper I saw my mommy with a naked man and she was trying to be a mommy again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard_wolowitz You ready to talk about it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon_cooper I’m not nearly drunk enough. Okay. Do you have any idea what it’s like to see your mother ravaging someone?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard_wolowitz Does a brisket count? I’m sorry, buddy, that’s rough. But didn’t she know we were coming?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon_cooper No. I wanted to surprise her. What am I supposed to say to her after something like this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard_wolowitz Well, did she see you in the window?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon_cooper No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard_wolowitz Then don’t say anything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon_cooper I have to. How can we ever hope to have a healthy relationship if I don’t tell her how disappointed I am, and that I’ll never forgive her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard_wolowitz Well, don’t do it on the phone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon_cooper No, I’m just going to tell her I’m coming so she can give that good time Charlie the heave-ho.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard_wolowitz That’s some tough talk, I may need to cut you off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Yeah, maybe you better, I took a pretty big sip.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard_wolowitz Look, she’s a grown woman. And, and your dad’s been gone a long time. Maybe this is none of your business.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon_cooper I beg to differ. I used to live in those genitals. And if someone wants to move into my old room, I should at least get a vote.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj_koothrappali Okay, murder suspects, Leonard has found the time machine the killer must’ve used. You’re all inside it, and we hurtle through the very fabric of time. And welcome to 20 years in the future. Hey, you guys just time-travelled. Stop looking so bored.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny Well, my beer isn’t flat and my rack’s not saggy. So far, the future’s great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 stuart_bloom Hey, can I go to the bathroom?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj_koothrappali Fine, just try not to look too alive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 stuart_bloom That’s my jam.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 bernadette_rostenkowski So one of us went back in time to kill Stuart?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler But why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj_koothrappali Perhaps this will help. Here are some facts about yourselves in the future that might contain a clue.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler Hey, I won the Nobel Prize in physiology, then I used the money to buy Stuart’s comic book store, and close it down so Sheldon would pay attention to me. Not the worst idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny Hey, I’m a famous actress living in London.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Hmm, I’m a professor at Stanford.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny Hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 bernadette_rostenkowski So I guess you two are making it work long distance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj_koothrappali Oh, no. In this game, as your careers both took off, you drifted apart. Kind of like how future me lost touch with you guys after I became boy toy for the wrinkled, but still flexible, Madonna.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler What does your card say, Bernadette?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Uh, uh, uh, hang on. Do you think we’d really drift apart if we both became successful?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny Of course not. If I became a famous actress and had to move, you would just come with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter But if I get a chance to be a tenured professor, I might not have that much choice in where I end up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny Yeah, but if I become a successful actress, we wouldn’t need the money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Well, you don’t go into science for the money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 bernadette_rostenkowski Speak for yourself. Last month, my company both invented and cured Restless Eye Syndrome. Ka-ching, ya blinky chumps.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny So, wait, if my career took me somewhere else, you might not go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler Dun, dun, dun. He started it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj_koothrappali Okay, okay, guys, new back stories. Uh, Penny and Leonard, you two lovebirds are super successful and living in New York. Uh, you’re an actress, you’re a professor and you have three beautiful kids.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny Really? You think I’m putting this body through three kids?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Okay, let’s do this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard_wolowitz Good luck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon_cooper You, aren’t you gonna come with me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard_wolowitz While you confront your mother about her sex life? I’d rather go back to that bar in ass-less chaps.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Mother? Mother? Mother?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 mary_cooper Shelly, I’m so glad you’re here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon_cooper I saw you having naked sex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 mary_cooper What are you talking about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Earlier, I came here to surprise you. I looked in the window and I saw you with a man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 mary_cooper Oh, Shelly, I’m so sorry. Come in. Um, maybe we should sit down and talk about this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Can you recommend a surface you haven’t had coitus on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 mary_cooper That’s not funny. Maybe we should sit at the table. Well, I’m sure that, uh, you have a lot of questions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Who was he?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 mary_cooper His name is Ron. I met him at my prayer group.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon_cooper How long have you been involved with him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 mary_cooper A few months.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon_cooper And of those few months, how long have you been a demented sex pervert?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 mary_cooper That is no way to speak to your mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Perhaps not. But it is a way to speak to a woman who quoted the Bible to me my whole life, and then desecrates one of Ethan Allen’s finest sofas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 mary_cooper I will give you one opportunity, young man, to apologize.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Or what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 mary_cooper Or I will send you to your room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon_cooper That’s ridiculous. I am a grown man. I am a professional scientist. And I currently occupy the moral high ground.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 mary_cooper Go to your room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon_cooper But I occupy the moral high ground.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 mary_cooper Go to your room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon_cooper But I’m a professional scientist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 mrs#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 Go to your room!
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon_cooper I’m a grown man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj_koothrappali Can we please get back to the game?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter In a minute. I don’t understand why any success you have in acting is more important than any I have in science.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny Okay, if you do something cool in science, you might change the world. If I become a famous actress, I’m not gonna tell you why movie stars are the best. They just are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler I’m surprised you guys never talked about this stuff.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Like you and Sheldon have everything figured out?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler Actually, our relationship agreement covers a wide array of scenarios, including career changes, financial instability, intelligent dog uprising. FYI, we plan on selling out the human race hard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny In 20 years, who knows what’ll happen with any of us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 stuart_bloom I think you and Leonard will be together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny You do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 stuart_bloom Yeah. I think you’re the best couple I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Aw.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny That’s so sweet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 bernadette_rostenkowski What the hell?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler Excuse me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny Ah-da-da-da-da, let the dead man talk. So, why do you think that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 stuart_bloom Uh, well, I feel like you guys make each other better. Penny brought Leonard out of his shell. And it seems like Leonard makes Penny think more deeply about the world. I don’t know. Together, you two kind of make one awesome person.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny Aw, Stuart. Now I feel bad for murdering you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj_koothrappali Oh, come on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 bernadette_rostenkowski Penny did it, I win. Suck it, jackasses.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard_wolowitz Hey, can I come in?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Apparently any man is welcome in this house. Why not you? I thought you were waiting in the car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard_wolowitz That was an hour ago, Sheldon. A Jew sits in front of a house in Texas that long, For Sale signs start to go up. I take it things didn’t go smoothly with your mom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon_cooper No. I’m not sure how we’re going to get past this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard_wolowitz You know, I, I sort of went through something like this myself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Howard, we’ve all seen your mother naked. That woman needs to learn how to tie a robe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard_wolowitz I’m talking about when my mom started seeing someone a couple of years after my dad left.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon_cooper I didn’t know she did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard_wolowitz Yeah, she was dating this guy, and I was kind of a jerk to her about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon_cooper What did you do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard_wolowitz Well, let’s just say it was the most vicious bar mitzvah speech in the history of Temple Beth El. Anyway, she broke up with him. And she’s basically been alone ever since. She never said it, but I always felt I was the reason why.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon_cooper I’m sorry. Although, based on your story, you absolutely were the reason why.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard_wolowitz All I’m saying is you might not want to get in the way of your mom’s happiness.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon_cooper You may have a point. I love my mother. Even if she fornicates like a demonic weasel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 howard_wolowitz And the healing begins.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 mary_cooper Hello. Are you ready to discuss this calmly, like adults?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon_cooper I am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 mary_cooper Shelly, I’m sorry that you saw what you saw. I know that this is hard for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon_cooper I think what most upsets me about it, Mother, is the hypocrisy. Doesn’t this contradict all the religious rules you’ve been espousing your whole life?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 mary_cooper You’re right, it does, and it’s something that I’m struggling with these days.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Then why are you doing it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 mary_cooper Because I’m not perfect, Shelly. And that man’s booty is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Well, this is confusing for me. But I don’t want to stand in the way of your happiness. So, I’ll condemn you internally while maintaining an outward appearance of acceptance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 mary_cooper That is very Christian of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Mother, if you’re going to conduct your life in this fashion, then I should let you know that the world has changed since you were a young woman. You know, it’s not all sock hops, soda jerks and segregation anymore.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 mary_cooper How old do you think I am?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon_cooper My point is that you’re going to need to be careful. You used to be protected by your pre-Enlightenment mythology, but now you’re going to need a stronger friend named latex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 mary_cooper Are you having the sex talk with me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Well, someone has to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 mary_cooper Oh, dear Lord.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 sheldon_cooper No, don’t look to Him. He’s mad at you right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny Oh, come on, don’t pout. I’m sorry I ruined your game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj_koothrappali I’m not pouting, I’m brooding. Which is how sexy men pout.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler It actually was kind of fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj_koothrappali You’re just saying that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 bernadette_rostenkowski I liked the time travel element.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj_koothrappali Thank you. I thought it was inspired.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter It was. By Terminator.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 bernadette_rostenkowski Well, I hope 20 years from now, we really are all still together and still friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny Definitely.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Of course. Well, hey, how about this? Whether we’re friends, not friends, scattered around the world, no matter what, let’s all promise to meet in front of this building exactly 20 years from tonight at 8:00 p.m. and have dinner like we always do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 bernadette_rostenkowski Aw.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny I love it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Putting it in my phone right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny Yeah, me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 stuart_bloom My phone doesn’t have a calendar. So I’ll just write it on my hand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 raj_koothrappali And it’s done.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 penny Yup, we’re all in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter All right, I’ll see you guys in 20 years.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode18 stuart_bloom I knew it.
