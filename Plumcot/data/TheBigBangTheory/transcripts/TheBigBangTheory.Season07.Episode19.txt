TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Boy, do I have to urinate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter If only there were a solution to that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Seriously. I feel like I’ve got a fish tank in my pelvis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter So go to the bathroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 sheldon_cooper I can’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Because I’m trying to decide between getting an Xbox One or a PS4. Oh, pee, why’d I say that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Forgive me for asking a stupid question, but why are you being stupid?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 sheldon_cooper I’m not being stupid. I’m employing the work of Dutch researcher, Mirjam Tuk, who found that people with full bladders make better decisions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Why did I pee before I decided to move in here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 penny Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Hey. Oh, how’d the audition go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 penny I killed it. I was even able to cry real tears right on the spot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Oh, that’s great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 penny I know. Next time I get pulled over for a speeding ticket, here come the waterworks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Here come the waterworks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Aren’t you gonna ask?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 penny What is this, my first day?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski Can I get your opinion on something that happened at work today?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 penny Yeah, sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler Of course.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski Okay, well, I did something that will either make me look like a lovable goof or a horrible monster damned to spend eternity in hell.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler I’m sure it’s lovable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 penny I’m gonna go with monster. What do you got?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski Well, there’s this lady in our office who’s retiring, and they were passing around one of those big cards for us to sign.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski But no one told me she was in a horrible car accident over the weekend and what I was signing was not a retirement card but was actually a get well card.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 penny I’m liking my odds here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski So on the card, in the hospital, next to the woman who’s clinging to life are the words, “Hey, Vivian. You deserve this. And at least with you gone, no one will steal my yoghurt out of the fridge.”
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski “LOL.” Smiley face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, my gosh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski “P.S. Good luck wherever you wind up.”
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 penny Oh. Why didn’t I put money on this? Hey, that’s my agent. If I got the part, it’s still the second best thing I’ve heard all day. Hello?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski Am I a terrible person?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler No. No, it was a mistake.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski Am I a terrible person that it crossed my mind that she might die and never see the card?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler Now I think you’re flirting with the line. Good news?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 penny No, I didn’t get it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski I’m so sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler You’ll get offered something soon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 penny I kind of did. The part in that awful horror movie I passed on came back around. Apparently, it’s mine if I want it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski Are you gonna take it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 penny I don’t know what to do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler Maybe you’ll get hit by a car and die. LOL, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 raj_koothrappali Hey. Emily, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 emily_sweeney Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 raj_koothrappali I, I don’t know if you remember me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 emily_sweeney From the dating Web site. Your friend e-mailed me because you were afraid to, then you tracked me down and acted like a lunatic?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 raj_koothrappali Yes, Rajesh Koothrappali. Look, uh, I just, I wanted to say I’m sorry. Okay? You were, like, the coolest person I ever found online, and I got really nervous and I, I just blew it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 emily_sweeney Uh, don’t worry about it. And if it makes you feel any better, you’re not the weirdest guy I’ve met off the Internet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 raj_koothrappali Well, give me a chance, you don’t even know me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 emily_sweeney All right, here’s your chance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 raj_koothrappali Ah, really? Thank you. Fate has given me a rare second chance, and I swear to Vishnu I’m not gonna blow it. Or normal words followed by a charming smile.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 sheldon_cooper So, first there was PlayStation, aka PS1, then PS2, PS3 and now PS4. And that makes sense. You’d think after Xbox, there’d be Xbox 2. But no, next came Xbox 360. Hmm? And now, after 360, comes Xbox One. Why one? Maybe that’s how many seconds of thought they put into naming it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler Can you get the butter, please?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 sheldon_cooper You know, however, with the Xbox One, I can control my entire entertainment system using voice commands. Up until now, I’ve had to use Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler Then get the other one. Pass the butter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Get? Hang on. I don’t feel like you’re taking this dilemma seriously.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler Fine, Sheldon. You have my undivided attention.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Okay, now, the PS4 is more angular and sleek-looking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler No way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Yeah, well, it’s true. But the larger size of the Xbox One may keep it from overheating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler Well, you wouldn’t want your gaming system to overheat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 sheldon_cooper No, see? Well, you absolutely would not. And furthermore, the Xbox One now comes with a Kinect included.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler Included?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Yes. Not sold separately. Although the PS4 uses cool new GDDR5 RAM, while the Xbox One is still using the conventional DDR3 memory.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler Why would they still be using DDR3? Are they nuts?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 sheldon_cooper See? That’s what I thought. But then they go and throw in an ESRAM buffer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler Whoa, whoa. Wait a second. Who’s they?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Xbox.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler You’re kidding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 sheldon_cooper No, I am not. And this ESRAM buffer should totally bridge the 100-gigabit-per-second bandwidth gap between the two RAM types.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler This is a nightmare. How will you ever make a decision?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler Please pass the butter!
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 penny Okay, it’s not me, right? This script is terrible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 penny Okay. Sometimes I feel like I can control the killer gorilla instinct inside of me, but then I see these bananas and I just want to eat them and then kill people. What am I gonna do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Well, for starters, I wouldn’t eat the bananas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 penny No, come on. This is serious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Uh, uh, does it at least pay well?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 penny Less than I was making at The Cheesecake Factory.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter What does your agent think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 penny She’s thinking of taking a job at The Cheesecake Factory.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter You know what, why don’t you just do it? You’ll go have fun for a few weeks, make some money, and who knows what it might lead to?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 penny Okay, look, here, page 58. I oil-wrestle an orang-utan in a bikini.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Just to clarify, which one of you is wearing the bikini?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 penny Both of us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter So it’s a family film.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Thank you again for dinner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler You’re welcome.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler Uh, it’s date night. Aren’t you, uh, forgetting something?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Oh, of course. Did I mention the PS4 controllers light up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Well, they do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 raj_koothrappali And then after coffee, we went for a walk and she told me she always thought people from India were exotic and mysterious. So, with my mouth, I said, we’re just like anybody else, but with my eyes, I said, straight up, Red, hop on my flying carpet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter So, are you gonna see her again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 raj_koothrappali Yeah, we have plans this weekend. And if it’s a clear night, I’m gonna lay some romantic astronomy on her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 penny Okay, like what? Show me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 raj_koothrappali I can’t do that to Leonard. This is some powerful panty-dropping stuff.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter You have my blessing. Go for it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 raj_koothrappali Okay. Penny, two of the brightest stars in the night sky are Altair and Vega. And it is said they were deeply in love but forever separated by the celestial river of the Milky Way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 penny Oh, that’s sad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 raj_koothrappali It is. But once a year, on the seventh day of the seventh month, Vega cries so hard that all the magpies in the world fly up and create a bridge with their wings so the two lovers can be together for a single night of passion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 penny Wow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Okay, that’s enough.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Quick poll, PS4 or Xbox One? Raj?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 raj_koothrappali Uh, Xbox One.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 penny Huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter PS4.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Wolowitz?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Both great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Bernadette?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski I like the Wii.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Thanks, Grandma.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 raj_koothrappali Oh, my goodness.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter What’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 raj_koothrappali I just got an e-mail from my ex-girlfriend Lucy. She misses me and wants to get together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Two women at the same time? Nice job, playa.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 penny Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Was it the two women thing or the playa? It was the playa.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 raj_koothrappali What am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to choose between Emily and Lucy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Why do you have to choose? Date both of them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 raj_koothrappali I can’t date two women at once. Zero women, that’s my sweet spot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 penny Unless you’re sleeping with one of them, seeing other people isn’t a big deal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 raj_koothrappali But what if one of them asks me what I was up to the night before and I was with the other one? Then, what, do I lie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski@howard_wolowitz Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski What do you mean, yes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 howard_wolowitz What do you mean, yes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski Were you seeing other women when we started dating?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 howard_wolowitz No. Were you seeing other men?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Were you seeing other men?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Aren’t you gonna ask me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 penny Come on, really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Thank you so much for letting us pick your brain.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 wil_wheaton Yeah, happy to help. So, what’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 penny Well, I’m having an impossible time getting my career off the ground, and I got offered a role in this crappy horror movie, and I just don’t know if I should take it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 wil_wheaton Well, I have certainly taken some jobs that I’ve been embarrassed by.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 penny I wouldn’t exactly call Star Trek embarrassing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 wil_wheaton I wasn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 penny Me, either.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter So, what do you think, is there a professional downside to doing it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 wil_wheaton Well, it’s tricky. You want to take projects that you’re excited about, but sometimes you also have to pay the bills. When you’re on the set working on something that you just know in your heart is bad, not Star Trek.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 penny Yeah, beam me up. I love it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 wil_wheaton Anyway, those jobs can be soul-crushing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 penny That’s what I’m afraid of.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 wil_wheaton So, I was in Stand By Me when I was a kid, and it was a huge success. The terrible movies I did came after that. I mean, imagine how that feels.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Sounds rough.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 wil_wheaton I’m telling you, this business is brutal. To this day, I hate going on auditions. Okay, I walk in, and I can just feel them thinking, he was such a cute kid, what happened to him? And then I don’t get the job, and I can never find out why. Honestly, I get so depressed, there are entire weeks that I can’t even get out of bed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Okay, this was helpful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 raj_koothrappali Any news on your co-worker who’s in the hospital?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski Poor thing, she was in surgery for 18 hours. She’s alive, but she’s still in critical condition.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 raj_koothrappali Oh, no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski The one bit of good news is they put her in a medically induced coma before she read the card. So, you know, silver linings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 howard_wolowitz Were you like this when I married you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Don’t worry about it, buddy. Okay, bye. That was Wil, he’s feeling a lot better. Apparently, he’s 12-down in the TV Guide crossword puzzle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 raj_koothrappali Did he help you make a decision about the movie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 penny No. Did you figure out what you’re gonna do about the two girls?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 raj_koothrappali As a matter of fact, I did. I’ve spent so many years living in fear, saying no to new experiences, but from now on, I’m gonna say yes, yes to love, yes to adventure, yes to life. Whatever it may be, the answer’s going to be yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 howard_wolowitz He’s gonna die alone, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 leonard_hofstadter Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 penny Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 bernadette_rostenkowski Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler I’m proud of you, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 sheldon_cooper You know, I’m proud of me, too. I’ve done all my research, I conducted an informal poll, and I’ve arrived at the rock-solid certainty I’ve made the right choice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler Well, that’s got to be a good feeling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Oh, it is. Although.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, crap.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 sheldon_cooper I had the same feeling when I made my dad buy a Betamax instead of a VHS.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler You were just a little kid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Yeah, a little kid who picked the wrong format to record The MacNeil/Lehrer Report. Now I also was certain that HD DVD would win out over Blu-ray.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler How old were you then?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Old enough to know better. You know, and now that I think about it, I stood in front of a case of iPods and I bought a Zune.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler What’s a Zune?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Yeah, exactly. It’s an MP3 player brought to us by the makers of Xbox.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler No, what are you doing? No, no, pick that back up. You know it’s good. You did the research.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 sheldon_cooper But what if I’m wrong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler You know what? How about I buy it for you? How about I buy you both?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 sheldon_cooper You know I only have one slot available in my entertainment centre.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler Then I’ll buy you a new entertainment centre.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Well, yeah, okay, sure. But which one?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler How about this? I’ve heard that if you flip a coin, it will tell you how you actually feel. Because you’ll either be disappointed or excited by the outcome.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Interesting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler So, heads it’s PS4, tails it’s Xbox One.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 sheldon_cooper All right, I’ll try.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler What is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 sheldon_cooper A quarter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler Could have given it back to me. That was a choice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 raj_koothrappali You look, you look really pretty tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 emily_sweeney Thanks. I love that jacket.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 raj_koothrappali Thank you. Thanks, thanks. I’m sorry. I can’t do this. My, my ex-girlfriend e-mailed me, and I’m seeing her Saturday, And I’m glad you like it, it’s from J. Crew.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 emily_sweeney I don’t understand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 raj_koothrappali My friends told me it was okay to see more than one person at a time, but it, it feels like I’m being deceitful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 emily_sweeney Are you getting back together with her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 raj_koothrappali No. I, I have no idea. What would you do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 emily_sweeney Uh, usually on first dates, I talk about music and stuff, but I was promised weird, so let’s do this. How serious were you two?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 raj_koothrappali Well, to be honest, we only went on four dates, hugged twice, kissed once, and there was a handshake loaded with sexual innuendo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 emily_sweeney Wait, so, a girl you never slept with sent you an e-mail and you felt so guilty about it that you had to tell me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 raj_koothrappali Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 emily_sweeney That’s kind of adorable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 raj_koothrappali Are you, are you sure? Because this is the part of the night where I’ve said something stupid and the girl usually leaves.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 emily_sweeney I’m still here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 raj_koothrappali Yeah, but now you make me wonder what’s wrong with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 emily_sweeney We just met. You don’t need to tell me about other people you’re seeing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 raj_koothrappali Really? Because I’m dating two women is basically the only cool thing I can say about myself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 sheldon_cooper On the one hand, the Xbox One has a better camera, but the PS4 has a removable hard drive. Thoughts?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler I can’t feel my legs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 store_assistant#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 Oh, I’m sorry, guys, but the store closed five minutes ago.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 sheldon_cooper But I haven’t decided yet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 store_assistant#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 You’ll have to come back tomorrow. The registers are closed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler Let’s get you some food. You, You’ll feel better after you eat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 sheldon_cooper Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 amy_farrah_fowler What-what do you want, like, Thai food? A burger?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 sheldon_cooper I don’t know. Hey, look, a quarter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 costume_guy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 How’s that feel?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 penny Great. Not like regret at all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode19 wil_wheaton Penny? We’re working together. Awesome.
