TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 leonard I got to tell you, the more I read about the primordial gravity wave discovery, the more excited I get.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 raj I know. Being an astrophysicist right now is like being a rock star.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard Only without the sex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 raj Yeah, literally, none of it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 leonard What do you think about it, Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon Meh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 raj Are you kidding me? This may be the biggest scientific breakthrough of our lifetime. How can you, as a theoretical physicist, not care about this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon Maybe it’s because I’m not an elitist. What I’d like to know is, how does this gravity wave breakthrough help the man on the street? You know? Who’s looking out for Joe six-pack and all his quantum physics concerns?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 leonard Oh, my God, you’re jealous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon Why would I be jealous?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 leonard Oh, I don’t know. Maybe because the origin of the universe just got proven, the Higgs field just got proven, and you’ve been working on string theory for the last 20 years and you’re no closer to proving it than when you started.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon Yeah, well, I’ve had a lot on my plate. We happen to live in a golden age of television.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 barry Excuse me, fewwas. Sowwy for eavesdwopping, but there actually was some big stwing theowy news today out of the Hadwon Cowwider.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon Really? Did they find evidence to support extra dimensions or supersymmetry?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 barry No, but they did find evidence that you’ll bewieve anything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon Why would you do that? You’re a string theorist as well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 barry Incowwect. I am a stwing pwagmatist. I say I’m gonna pwove something that cannot be pwoved, I appwy for gwant money, and then I spend it on wiquor and bwoads. Water.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon Do you think he’s right? Am I wasting my life on a theory that can never be proven?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard Maybe. But how great is Game of Thrones?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny Hey, you’re up early.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon I couldn’t sleep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny I told you those Walking Dead pillowcases were a bad idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon No, that’s not it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny Is something bothering you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon Yes, but you wouldn’t understand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny Oh, come on, try me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon All right. I’ve devoted the prime of my life to string theory and its quest for the compactification of extra dimensions. I’ve got nothing to show for it, and I feel like a fool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny Okay. I get it. I mean, not all the jibberjabber in the middle, but I know what it’s like to put your heart and soul into something and get nothing out of it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon You mean your acting career?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon Your relationship with Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon Your failed attempt to go back to college?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny No. I’m saying you and string theory sound like a relationship, and I know what it’s like to be in one and realize it’s never gonna turn out the way you want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon I said Leonard, you said no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny I’m talking about other guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon Okay. Well, what do you do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny You have to have the courage to end the relationship. You know? Break it off, shake hands, walk away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon I don’t know if I can do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny I know it’s hard, honey, but in the end, that’s how you grow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 leonard Penny, have you seen my good inhaler?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon Break it off, shake hands, walk away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 leonard Hey, how’s dating two women going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 raj Um, kind of hit a bump. When I was honest and told Emily she wasn’t the only person I was seeing, it went great. So I tried the same thing with Lucy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard And?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 raj She had mixed feelings. But when I said, Emily was cool with it. Emily’s the best. Why can’t you
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 leonard Women. Who knows what’ll set ’em off?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 raj At least now I can focus all my energies on just one girl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard I hope I get to meet her as soon as possible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 raj Why the rush? She isn’t going anywhere.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard She is. But I like that attitude.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon Gentlemen, is anybody interested in my old string theory books?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 raj You’re really going to do this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon I am. Yeah, Penny pointed out that what I’m going through is essentially a breakup. And according to Cosmopolitan magazine, one of the most effective techniques for moving on is to get rid of all reminders of the relationship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard You’re reading Cosmo?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon Yes. As it turns out, there’s an article on how to get over a breakup in literally every issue. Anyway, it suggests that I set these on fire, but the smell of burning books reminds me of church picnics in East Texas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard What’s this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon Oh, that’s just a doodle of a hyperelliptic Riemann surface.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 leonard Oh, yeah. Wasn’t that the basis of your postdoc fellowship?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon It was. This seemed so elegant at the time, but now I realize I was just a simple country boy seduced by a big city theory with variables in all the right places.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 raj It’s going to be okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon I know. As hard as this is, I have to move on. I can’t keep postulating multidimensional entities and get nothing in return. I have needs, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard So, you and Emily still together?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard I spoke to Bernadette. She’s free tomorrow night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 raj Oh, okay, great. But if we’re really gonna do a double date, then we have to go over some ground rules about Emily.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard Like when it turns out she’s made of rubber, I don’t say anything?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 raj She’s very real.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard Oh, that’s what it says on the box. Right next to dishwasher safe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 raj See? This is exactly the kind of thing I’m worried about you saying in front of her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard I promise I’ll be on my best behaviour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 raj You better be. No jokes about how close I am with my dog. Or the truth about how close I am with my dog.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard You got it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 raj No jokes about the year I took ballet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard You took ballet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 raj God, you never listen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 leonard Are you sure you want to do this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon The magazine articles suggest that one of the ways to get over a breakup is a new look.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 leonard What about your old look, well-groomed ventriloquist doll?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny Oh my God, I do look like that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon You stop it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny So, how do you want me to cut it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon Oh, how about Bill Gates meets Nikola Tesla?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 leonard So, business in the front, science in the back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny Or I don’t cut it and maybe just style it a little.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon Oh, I’m in your hands. Do a good job and I’ll tell you Cosmo’s ten dynamite tips to enjoy your PMS.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny Can you keep him quiet? Maybe jangle some keys in front of him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 leonard That doesn’t work any more. He just thinks I’m taking him to the doctor. So, now that you’re no longer invested in string theory, what are you gonna pursue?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon Oh, there are so many exciting areas. Black holes, dark matter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny Oh, Leonard was telling me about dark matter, but I didn’t really understand it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon Don’t feel bad. Neither does he.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny Okay, what do you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon Have you ever even seen a picture of Tesla?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 leonard It actually looks good, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny Doesn’t it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 leonard Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon I suppose I could see myself in a scientific boy band. Of course, I’d be the dreamy one and the smart one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 amy Sorry I’m late. What did you do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny I gave him a new look. It’s cute, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 amy Yeah, it’s cute. That’s the problem. I don’t need other girls to see him walking around like sex on a stick.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon She’s right. I’m too hot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 bernadette I’m excited to meet Emily.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard Me, too. I just hope he doesn’t blow it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 bernadette Why would you say that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard Because he’s Raj, that’s his thing. Beckham can bend it, Ralph can wreck it, Raj can blow it. Look, I don’t want it to happen, but odds are he’s gonna find a way to… Oh, crap, I know that girl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 bernadette How?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard In a bad way, very bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 raj Hey, guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard Whatever you hear tonight, just remember I love you. Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 raj Emily, these are my good friends, Howard and Bernadette. Guys, this is Emily.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 emily Nice to meet you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 bernadette Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 emily Have we met before?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard Uh, no. I, I don’t, I don’t think so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 emily You sure? You look familiar.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard Well, you sure don’t. You I know, you I know, you? Total stranger. Even if you had yummy candy, I would not get in your van.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 emily Did you go to that spin class on Green Street?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard That must be it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 raj Since when do you go to spin class?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard Wow. Now who doesn’t listen?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 amy Sheldon, your food’s getting cold. What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon Oh, looking through my textbooks for a new field of inquiry. Why do we have a geology book? Leonard, did you throw a children’s party while I was in Texas?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny Wait. What’s wrong with geology?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon Let me put this in a way you’ll understand, Penny. You remember how you explained to me that the Kardashians aren’t real celebrities? Well, geology is the Kardashians of science.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon Have you considered studying standard model physics?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon You want me to give up string theory for something that’s less advanced? You know, why don’t you break up with Penny and start dating a brown bear?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny Like you could get a brown bear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 leonard Hey, I’ve got a good job. I could buy salmon. You don’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 amy Maybe you could make your new field of study the calculation of nuclear matrix elements.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon Oh, please. If I wanted to take up a fad, I’d get a tramp stamp.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 leonard What about loop quantum gravity?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon Oh, Duchess, look at me. My quantum gravity’s positively loopy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny Who’s the duchess?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 leonard One of the people that lives in his head.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 amy I hope he’s this distraught if he ever breaks up with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 leonard Well, if he does, I’ll see if my bear has a friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny Sheldon, have you ever considered not rushing into something new? I mean, why don’t you take your time, enjoy your freedom? Maybe something new to study will find you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon That’s actually not bad advice. You know, I didn’t seek out string theory. It just hit me over the head one day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 amy How does that happen?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon A bully chased me through the school library and hit me over the head with the biggest book he could find.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny Okay, how about we toast your newfound freedom?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon Ah, normally I refrain from alcohol, but since my cerebral cortex is twiddling its proverbial thumbs, why not soak it in grape juice that’s been predigested by a fungus?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny And you wonder why other children beat you with books. Cheers!
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 bernadette Emily, what do you do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 emily I’m a dermatology resident at Huntington Hospital.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 raj Mmm, and you know what that means. Someone’s skin’s about to be softer than ever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 emily This is making me crazy. I know I know you from somewhere.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 raj Oh, uh, Howard was an astronaut. Maybe that’s where you saw him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 emily Wow. That’s amazing. What was that like?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard It was the most incredible experience of my life. Up there in the space station, you’re…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 emily Oh, my God, I remember.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard Can I finish my astronaut story?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 emily It was four years ago.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard Please don’t say it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 emily We were set up on a blind date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard Please don’t say it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 emily You came to my apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard You’re saying it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 raj Wh, what happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 bernadette Yeah, what happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard Okay, I’ll say it. I was on the way to pick her up. My stomach felt a little funny. When I got there, I asked if I could use her bathroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 bernadette Please don’t say it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard One roll of toilet paper and 20 minutes later, I was so humiliated, I snuck out the window and never saw her again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 emily You know what else I never saw again, my security deposit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard I’m sorry. I tried to unclog it, but you didn’t have a plunger, and water was spilling out everywhere.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 emily Right, just water.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard Look, I have felt terrible about this for years, and I’m glad I have the opportunity to tell you just how sorry I am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 emily It’s fine. All my friends love this story. They call you Clogzilla.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 raj Get it? Because you clogged up her bathroom like a radioactive monster!
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard Yeah, yeah, I get it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 bernadette Howie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard Well, hey, it’s not like cotton candy comes out of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 amy Come on, let’s get you to bed. You’ve had a lot to drink.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon No more than Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 amy That’s what I’m saying.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Empty room. Empty room. Empty room. If somebody says come in, I’m gonna freak out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 bernadette So, Emily, why did you decide to specialize in dermatology?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 emily I like cutting people with knives, and all the other jobs where you get to do that are illegal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 bernadette You’re kidding, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 raj She’s scary, but it’s a cute scary.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard Can I say just one more thing? I had some kind of food poisoning that day. Sure, in retrospect, gas station sushi, maybe not the best choice. Nor was climbing out your window and running away. But I think we can all understand how humiliating that was, and I’d really appreciate it if we could move on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 bernadette Howie, we moved on a long time ago.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard I’m just saying…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 bernadette We moved on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard Okay. Fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 bernadette How’s your soup?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard Ah, it’s all right. They could’ve filled the bowl a little more. Excuse me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 bernadette Where are you going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard I need some fresh air.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 emily Been there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon Oh, no. What have I done?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 leonard How you feeling?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon Not so good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 leonard Are you gonna introduce me to your friend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon It’s not my friend. Nothing happened.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 leonard I don’t know. I heard you reading pretty loud last night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon Oh, dear Lord. Where’s Amy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 leonard After she put you to bed, she went home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon Oh. I should call her and apologize. Oh, no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon Apparently, I called Stephen Hawking last night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 answerphone First new message.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon Hawkman. It’s your old buddy Sheldonoscopy. How come you didn’t pick up the phone? Oh, right. My bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard You’re awful quiet. Everything okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon Not really. I had a bit of an embarrassing evening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard Ugh. Me, too. What happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon I drank alcohol and may have left an unfortunate voice mail for Stephen Hawking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard I wouldn’t worry about it. He’s got a pretty good sense of humour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon Oh, I hope so. What happened to you last night?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard Oh, well, turns out I’d already met the girl Raj is seeing when I did a number on her bathroom. And that number was two.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon Well, you know, I’ve always been a fan of a story told by Attar of Nishapur, about a king who assembled a group of wise men to create a ring that would make him happy when he was sad. And that ring was inscribed with the phrase, this too shall pass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 barry Hey, Cooper. I heard you dwunk-dialed Stephen Hawking last night? Classic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard Get out of here, Barry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 barry Whatever you say, Cwogziwwa.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon Clogzilla. That’s pretty funny. I don’t think that’s gonna pass.
