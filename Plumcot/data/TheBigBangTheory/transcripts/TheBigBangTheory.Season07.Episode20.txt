TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter I got to tell you, the more I read about the primordial gravity wave discovery, the more excited I get.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 raj_koothrappali I know. Being an astrophysicist right now is like being a rock star.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Only without the sex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 raj_koothrappali Yeah, literally, none of it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter What do you think about it, Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Meh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 raj_koothrappali Are you kidding me? This may be the biggest scientific breakthrough of our lifetime. How can you, as a theoretical physicist, not care about this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Maybe it’s because I’m not an elitist. What I’d like to know is, how does this gravity wave breakthrough help the man on the street? You know? Who’s looking out for Joe six-pack and all his quantum physics concerns?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Oh, my God, you’re jealous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Why would I be jealous?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Oh, I don’t know. Maybe because the origin of the universe just got proven, the Higgs field just got proven, and you’ve been working on string theory for the last 20 years and you’re no closer to proving it than when you started.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Yeah, well, I’ve had a lot on my plate. We happen to live in a golden age of television.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 barry_kripke Excuse me, fewwas. Sowwy for eavesdwopping, but there actually was some big stwing theowy news today out of the Hadwon Cowwider.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Really? Did they find evidence to support extra dimensions or supersymmetry?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 barry_kripke No, but they did find evidence that you’ll bewieve anything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Why would you do that? You’re a string theorist as well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 barry_kripke Incowwect. I am a stwing pwagmatist. I say I’m gonna pwove something that cannot be pwoved, I appwy for gwant money, and then I spend it on wiquor and bwoads. Water.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Do you think he’s right? Am I wasting my life on a theory that can never be proven?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Maybe. But how great is Game of Thrones?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny Hey, you’re up early.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper I couldn’t sleep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny I told you those Walking Dead pillowcases were a bad idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper No, that’s not it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny Is something bothering you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Yes, but you wouldn’t understand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny Oh, come on, try me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper All right. I’ve devoted the prime of my life to string theory and its quest for the compactification of extra dimensions. I’ve got nothing to show for it, and I feel like a fool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny Okay. I get it. I mean, not all the jibberjabber in the middle, but I know what it’s like to put your heart and soul into something and get nothing out of it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper You mean your acting career?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Your relationship with Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Your failed attempt to go back to college?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny No. I’m saying you and string theory sound like a relationship, and I know what it’s like to be in one and realize it’s never gonna turn out the way you want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper I said Leonard, you said no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny I’m talking about other guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Okay. Well, what do you do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny You have to have the courage to end the relationship. You know? Break it off, shake hands, walk away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper I don’t know if I can do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny I know it’s hard, honey, but in the end, that’s how you grow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Penny, have you seen my good inhaler?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Break it off, shake hands, walk away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Hey, how’s dating two women going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 raj_koothrappali Um, kind of hit a bump. When I was honest and told Emily she wasn’t the only person I was seeing, it went great. So I tried the same thing with Lucy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard_wolowitz And?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 raj_koothrappali She had mixed feelings. But when I said, Emily was cool with it. Emily’s the best. Why can’t you
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Women. Who knows what’ll set ’em off?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 raj_koothrappali At least now I can focus all my energies on just one girl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard_wolowitz I hope I get to meet her as soon as possible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 raj_koothrappali Why the rush? She isn’t going anywhere.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard_wolowitz She is. But I like that attitude.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Gentlemen, is anybody interested in my old string theory books?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 raj_koothrappali You’re really going to do this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper I am. Yeah, Penny pointed out that what I’m going through is essentially a breakup. And according to Cosmopolitan magazine, one of the most effective techniques for moving on is to get rid of all reminders of the relationship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard_wolowitz You’re reading Cosmo?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Yes. As it turns out, there’s an article on how to get over a breakup in literally every issue. Anyway, it suggests that I set these on fire, but the smell of burning books reminds me of church picnics in East Texas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard_wolowitz What’s this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Oh, that’s just a doodle of a hyperelliptic Riemann surface.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Oh, yeah. Wasn’t that the basis of your postdoc fellowship?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper It was. This seemed so elegant at the time, but now I realize I was just a simple country boy seduced by a big city theory with variables in all the right places.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 raj_koothrappali It’s going to be okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper I know. As hard as this is, I have to move on. I can’t keep postulating multidimensional entities and get nothing in return. I have needs, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard_wolowitz So, you and Emily still together?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard_wolowitz I spoke to Bernadette. She’s free tomorrow night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 raj_koothrappali Oh, okay, great. But if we’re really gonna do a double date, then we have to go over some ground rules about Emily.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Like when it turns out she’s made of rubber, I don’t say anything?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 raj_koothrappali She’s very real.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Oh, that’s what it says on the box. Right next to dishwasher safe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 raj_koothrappali See? This is exactly the kind of thing I’m worried about you saying in front of her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard_wolowitz I promise I’ll be on my best behaviour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 raj_koothrappali You better be. No jokes about how close I am with my dog. Or the truth about how close I am with my dog.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard_wolowitz You got it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 raj_koothrappali No jokes about the year I took ballet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard_wolowitz You took ballet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 raj_koothrappali God, you never listen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Are you sure you want to do this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper The magazine articles suggest that one of the ways to get over a breakup is a new look.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter What about your old look, well-groomed ventriloquist doll?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny Oh my God, I do look like that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper You stop it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny So, how do you want me to cut it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Oh, how about Bill Gates meets Nikola Tesla?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter So, business in the front, science in the back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny Or I don’t cut it and maybe just style it a little.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Oh, I’m in your hands. Do a good job and I’ll tell you Cosmo’s ten dynamite tips to enjoy your PMS.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny Can you keep him quiet? Maybe jangle some keys in front of him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter That doesn’t work any more. He just thinks I’m taking him to the doctor. So, now that you’re no longer invested in string theory, what are you gonna pursue?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Oh, there are so many exciting areas. Black holes, dark matter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny Oh, Leonard was telling me about dark matter, but I didn’t really understand it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Don’t feel bad. Neither does he.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny Okay, what do you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Have you ever even seen a picture of Tesla?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter It actually looks good, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny Doesn’t it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper I suppose I could see myself in a scientific boy band. Of course, I’d be the dreamy one and the smart one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler Sorry I’m late. What did you do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny I gave him a new look. It’s cute, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler Yeah, it’s cute. That’s the problem. I don’t need other girls to see him walking around like sex on a stick.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper She’s right. I’m too hot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski I’m excited to meet Emily.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Me, too. I just hope he doesn’t blow it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski Why would you say that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Because he’s Raj, that’s his thing. Beckham can bend it, Ralph can wreck it, Raj can blow it. Look, I don’t want it to happen, but odds are he’s gonna find a way to… Oh, crap, I know that girl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski How?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard_wolowitz In a bad way, very bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 raj_koothrappali Hey, guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Whatever you hear tonight, just remember I love you. Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 raj_koothrappali Emily, these are my good friends, Howard and Bernadette. Guys, this is Emily.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 emily_sweeney Nice to meet you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 emily_sweeney Have we met before?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Uh, no. I, I don’t, I don’t think so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 emily_sweeney You sure? You look familiar.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Well, you sure don’t. You I know, you I know, you? Total stranger. Even if you had yummy candy, I would not get in your van.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 emily_sweeney Did you go to that spin class on Green Street?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard_wolowitz That must be it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 raj_koothrappali Since when do you go to spin class?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Wow. Now who doesn’t listen?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, your food’s getting cold. What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Oh, looking through my textbooks for a new field of inquiry. Why do we have a geology book? Leonard, did you throw a children’s party while I was in Texas?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny Wait. What’s wrong with geology?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Let me put this in a way you’ll understand, Penny. You remember how you explained to me that the Kardashians aren’t real celebrities? Well, geology is the Kardashians of science.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Have you considered studying standard model physics?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper You want me to give up string theory for something that’s less advanced? You know, why don’t you break up with Penny and start dating a brown bear?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny Like you could get a brown bear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Hey, I’ve got a good job. I could buy salmon. You don’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler Maybe you could make your new field of study the calculation of nuclear matrix elements.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Oh, please. If I wanted to take up a fad, I’d get a tramp stamp.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter What about loop quantum gravity?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Oh, Duchess, look at me. My quantum gravity’s positively loopy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny Who’s the duchess?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter One of the people that lives in his head.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler I hope he’s this distraught if he ever breaks up with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Well, if he does, I’ll see if my bear has a friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny Sheldon, have you ever considered not rushing into something new? I mean, why don’t you take your time, enjoy your freedom? Maybe something new to study will find you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper That’s actually not bad advice. You know, I didn’t seek out string theory. It just hit me over the head one day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler How does that happen?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper A bully chased me through the school library and hit me over the head with the biggest book he could find.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny Okay, how about we toast your newfound freedom?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Ah, normally I refrain from alcohol, but since my cerebral cortex is twiddling its proverbial thumbs, why not soak it in grape juice that’s been predigested by a fungus?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 penny And you wonder why other children beat you with books. Cheers!
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski Emily, what do you do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 emily_sweeney I’m a dermatology resident at Huntington Hospital.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 raj_koothrappali Mmm, and you know what that means. Someone’s skin’s about to be softer than ever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 emily_sweeney This is making me crazy. I know I know you from somewhere.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 raj_koothrappali Oh, uh, Howard was an astronaut. Maybe that’s where you saw him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 emily_sweeney Wow. That’s amazing. What was that like?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard_wolowitz It was the most incredible experience of my life. Up there in the space station, you’re…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 emily_sweeney Oh, my God, I remember.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Can I finish my astronaut story?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 emily_sweeney It was four years ago.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Please don’t say it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 emily_sweeney We were set up on a blind date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Please don’t say it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 emily_sweeney You came to my apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard_wolowitz You’re saying it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 raj_koothrappali Wh, what happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, what happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Okay, I’ll say it. I was on the way to pick her up. My stomach felt a little funny. When I got there, I asked if I could use her bathroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski Please don’t say it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard_wolowitz One roll of toilet paper and 20 minutes later, I was so humiliated, I snuck out the window and never saw her again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 emily_sweeney You know what else I never saw again, my security deposit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard_wolowitz I’m sorry. I tried to unclog it, but you didn’t have a plunger, and water was spilling out everywhere.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 emily_sweeney Right, just water.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Look, I have felt terrible about this for years, and I’m glad I have the opportunity to tell you just how sorry I am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 emily_sweeney It’s fine. All my friends love this story. They call you Clogzilla.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 raj_koothrappali Get it? Because you clogged up her bathroom like a radioactive monster!
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Yeah, yeah, I get it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski Howie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Well, hey, it’s not like cotton candy comes out of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler Come on, let’s get you to bed. You’ve had a lot to drink.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper No more than Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler That’s what I’m saying.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Empty room. Empty room. Empty room. If somebody says come in, I’m gonna freak out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski So, Emily, why did you decide to specialize in dermatology?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 emily_sweeney I like cutting people with knives, and all the other jobs where you get to do that are illegal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski You’re kidding, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 raj_koothrappali She’s scary, but it’s a cute scary.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Can I say just one more thing? I had some kind of food poisoning that day. Sure, in retrospect, gas station sushi, maybe not the best choice. Nor was climbing out your window and running away. But I think we can all understand how humiliating that was, and I’d really appreciate it if we could move on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski Howie, we moved on a long time ago.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard_wolowitz I’m just saying…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski We moved on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Okay. Fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski How’s your soup?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Ah, it’s all right. They could’ve filled the bowl a little more. Excuse me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski Where are you going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard_wolowitz I need some fresh air.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 emily_sweeney Been there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Oh, no. What have I done?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter How you feeling?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Not so good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Are you gonna introduce me to your friend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper It’s not my friend. Nothing happened.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter I don’t know. I heard you reading pretty loud last night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Oh, dear Lord. Where’s Amy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter After she put you to bed, she went home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Oh. I should call her and apologize. Oh, no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Apparently, I called Stephen Hawking last night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 answerphone#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 First new message.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Hawkman. It’s your old buddy Sheldonoscopy. How come you didn’t pick up the phone? Oh, right. My bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard_wolowitz You’re awful quiet. Everything okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Not really. I had a bit of an embarrassing evening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Ugh. Me, too. What happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper I drank alcohol and may have left an unfortunate voice mail for Stephen Hawking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard_wolowitz I wouldn’t worry about it. He’s got a pretty good sense of humour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Oh, I hope so. What happened to you last night?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Oh, well, turns out I’d already met the girl Raj is seeing when I did a number on her bathroom. And that number was two.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Well, you know, I’ve always been a fan of a story told by Attar of Nishapur, about a king who assembled a group of wise men to create a ring that would make him happy when he was sad. And that ring was inscribed with the phrase, this too shall pass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 barry_kripke Hey, Cooper. I heard you dwunk-dialed Stephen Hawking last night? Classic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Get out of here, Barry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 barry_kripke Whatever you say, Cwogziwwa.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Clogzilla. That’s pretty funny. I don’t think that’s gonna pass.
