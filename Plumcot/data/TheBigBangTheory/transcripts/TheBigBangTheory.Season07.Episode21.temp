TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 penny So, we’re about to shoot this scene in the movie where the killer ape DNA is slowly taking over my body.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 leonard Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 penny But I realize they’re gluing fur everywhere except my cleavage. So, I asked the director why and he says, it’s important to the story that my boobs be the last things to turn ape.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 leonard It’s sweet that he thinks there’s a story.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 penny Oh, and there’s not even a bathroom on set. I have to go to the gas station across the street. I mean, I was dressed like half an ape and still not even close to the most disgusting person in there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 sheldon Leonard, I could use your assistance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 leonard Sure. What’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 sheldon Well, now that I’ve given up string theory, I’m struggling to find my next area of focus. So, in your professional opinion, which of these areas do you think is the most promising?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 leonard Huh, well, I think there’s some really innovative stuff going on in dark matter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 sheldon That’s helpful. Okay. Of these four areas…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 penny Sheldon, what did we say about being a nicer friend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 leonard Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 penny Leonard, what did we say about being a gullible weenie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 sheldon It is just so frustrating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 penny ‘Cause you’re trying too hard. You need to do something else, get your mind off it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 leonard Hey. How about we bring back Anything Can Happen Thursdays?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 penny Hey, that’s good. Why’d you guys stop doing that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 leonard You made fun of us. Said it was stupid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 penny Yeah. Sounds like me. Come on, Sheldon. What do you say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 sheldon All right. I officially reinstate Anything Can Happen Thursday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 leonard Great, what do you want to do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 sheldon I don’t know. What do you want to do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 penny I don’t know. What do you want to do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 leonard I’m starting to remember the problem with Anything Can Happen Thursdays.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 sheldon Hmm, what can we do that’s fun?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 leonard What can we do that’s different?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 penny What can we do that’s free?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 sheldon Oh, got it. We order a pizza.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 penny Are you kidding? That’s what you always do. Think harder.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 sheldon You’re right. You’re right. Got it. We order calzones, cut them open, eat them like pizza. All right, all right, I’ll shake the brain bush one more time, see what falls out. Got it. There’s a live-action role-playing group that meets every Thursday night in Griffith Park and re-enacts battles from Lord of the Rings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 penny Uh, tell me more about this calzone idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 leonard You know what? Why don’t we just ease into this. Let, let’s go for a walk and, and, and see if we find a new restaurant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 sheldon Any chance that restaurant is near Griffith Park?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 leonard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 sheldon All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 leonard Raj and Howard are at Howard’s mom’s, but should we call the girls and see if they want to come?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 penny No. Bernadette’s working late.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 sheldon Amy’s sick.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 leonard Aw. What’s wrong with her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 sheldon Well, she talks a lot. She always wants to hold hands.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 leonard That’s not what I meant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 sheldon Well, if you were referring to her illness your question should have been, what ails her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 leonard What ails her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 sheldon Oh. Who knows?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 penny Come on, anything can happen. We can push him down the stairs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 howard Hey. Thanks for coming to hang out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 raj No problem. How’s your mom feeling?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 howard Okay, but she’d feel better if she took her medicine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 raj You know, when Cinnamon won’t take her medicine, I hide it in a piece of cheese.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 howard Good idea. We can wrap the pill in cheese, feed it to Cinnamon, and then my mom can eat Cinnamon. So what do you feel like doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 raj I was thinking we could watch a DVD.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 howard Well, my mom doesn’t have a lot to choose from. Unless you want to watch the video of her colonoscopy. Spoiler alert, 20 minutes in they find a prune pit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 raj Actually, how do you feel about watching House of 1000 Corpses?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 howard A straight-up gore-fest? You hate this stuff.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 raj I do, but for some reason, Emily loves it and wants to watch it with me tomorrow, so I thought if I start with you first, then I could act cool about it with her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 howard That’s actually not a bad plan. I can sit through the colonoscopy now, but that first time I was like, oh my God, a prune pit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 raj Uh, so, you’ll watch it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 howard Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 raj You’re a good friend. I owe you one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 mrs_wolowitz Howard. Help me get out of the tub.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 raj Not that one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 sheldon So, we’re just randomly choosing a restaurant without researching it online?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 penny Yep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 sheldon Great. You know, this is how Anything Can Happen Thursday turns into It Won’t Stop Coming Up Friday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 leonard Hey, how about that Asian fusion place?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 sheldon Fusion and Asians? I’m trying not to think about science.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 penny What the hell? What? She’s not working late.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 sheldon And Amy doesn’t look sick.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 penny Why would they lie to us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 sheldon That’s a good question. Amy and Bernadette. Amy and Bernadette. Amy and Bernadette. Why did you lie to us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 raj Hey. Listen to this. Murder, cannibalism and satanic rituals are just a few of the thousand plus horrors that await.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 howard I just helped my mom out of the tub, so, I’m one slippery horror ahead of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 raj You’re a good son. I don’t know how you do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 howard Beach blankets, my friend, it’s all about beach blankets.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 raj All right, let’s get this over with. Ew, it’s got someone’s hair on it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 howard Oh, yeah, you’re gonna do great with this movie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 penny You’re not working late. Why did you lie to me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 sheldon And Amy, you told me you were sick, but you look just as pale and tired as always.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 amy I’m sorry, I just needed a break from hearing you obsess about what to do after string theory.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 bernadette We kind of just wanted one night where we didn’t have to hear about how miserable you are making this movie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 amy But none of that means we don’t love you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 penny I haven’t been complaining that much about the movie. Have I?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 leonard I also love you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 penny Well you know what? Maybe I need a break from all of you. Come on, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 sheldon Where are we going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 penny We’re gonna have Anything Can Happen Thursday, you’re gonna tell me all about your science stuff and I’m gonna complain about my movie, and we’re gonna support each other because that’s what friends do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 sheldon Okay. ‘Cause if I had to pick now, I’d probably go with dark matter because…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 penny Shut up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 penny What’s wrong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 sheldon I don’t understand my food. Chinese noodles with Korean barbecue in a taco.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 penny It’s fusion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 sheldon My mother would lock her car doors if she had to drive through this hodgepodge of ethnicity.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 penny Think I’ve been complaining too much about the movie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 sheldon Not at all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 penny Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 sheldon But to be fair, when you talk, most of what you say sounds like, wah, wah, wah, clothes, wah, wah, wah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 penny Hey, I don’t understand why you’re not upset with Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 sheldon I am. So much so that I’m gonna bring her here for dinner on our next date night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 raj Okay. So, in the last 20 minutes, we’ve seen a crazy woman kissing a fetus in a jar. We’ve seen a guy cut in half and sewn to a fish.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 howard And the brutal dismemberment of a rotisserie chicken by my mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 raj On the bright side, she didn’t even notice the pill. Why does Emily like this stuff? Do you think there’s something psychologically wrong with her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 howard What difference does it make?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 raj What do you mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 howard Oh, come on, she could have a freezer full of ex-boyfriend’s body parts and you’d still go out with her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 raj I do like that the ex-boyfriend’s out of the picture.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 amy I feel so bad about lying to Sheldon. How am I gonna make it up to him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 bernadette I’d tell you what I do with Howard, but I don’t think dressing up like a Catholic schoolgirl is gonna work with Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 leonard He’d probably give you homework.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 amy Did you lie to Howard about tonight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 bernadette Of course.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 amy And you don’t feel guilty about it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 bernadette Between Penny’s gorilla movie and Howard’s gorilla mother, I had no choice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 leonard Thankfully Penny and I have a relationship based on honesty. What? I don’t lie to her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 bernadette Oh, we know you don’t lie to her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 penny Thank you. Hey, maybe the answer to your career question is in one of these.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 sheldon Penny, there’s only one cookie with something in the middle that solves life’s problems, and that’s an Oreo. Or a Nutter Butter, if you’re in a pinch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 penny Come on, open it. I bet it says something great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 sheldon This is Asian fusion. For all you know, there’s a tiny Chihuahua in here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 penny Fine, I’ll go. Hmm. People turn to you for guidance and wisdom. Yeah, that’s a good one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 sheldon No, it’s not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 penny How is that not good?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 sheldon Turn to you for wisdom? Clearly, that cookie is mocking you. You’d never hear that kind of sass from a Nutter Butter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 penny Uh, since you’re paying for dinner, I’ll let that slide. Open yours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 sheldon Have you ever paid for a meal?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 penny Not with money. Read.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 sheldon Your warm and fun-loving nature delights those around you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 penny Oh, try again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 howard Let me get this straight. So, he kills this girl’s father, cuts off the guy’s face, and is wearing it as a mask while he makes out with her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 raj I’m just gonna say it. That’s not okay. Why can’t I be in a relationship with a girl who likes The Sound of Music?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 howard Raj, you are the girl in the relationship who likes The Sound of Music. Hey, Penny. What’s up? No, Bernie’s working late. Really? Thanks for telling me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 raj What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 howard I’m having sex with a Catholic schoolgirl tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 penny Oh, I think I see our next stop.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 sheldon You can’t be serious. If I wanted to waste my time on nonsense, I’d follow Leonard on Instagram.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 penny No, come on, tonight we are trying new things.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 sheldon Oh. That’s a lot of incense. Or someone set a hippie on fire.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 bernadette Yeah, honey, I’m still stuck at work. Really? Penny said that? Okay, it’s true. I’m sorry. I’ll see you at home. Yeah, yeah, I’ll put it on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 leonard You and I never just hang out like this. Why is that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 amy I know, it’s weird, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 leonard Yeah. We should do it more often.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 amy Oh, no. I mean, this is weird right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 leonard Ah, it’s Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 amy Is she still mad?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 leonard Oh, doesn’t seem like it. She got Sheldon to go to a psychic with her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 amy A psychic? He considers them not just mumbo jumbo, but extra-jumbo mumbo jumbo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 leonard Well, Penny can be very persuasive. She’s gotten me to do a lot of things I wouldn’t normally do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 amy Because she has sex with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 leonard Yeah, she does.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 amy Can I confess something? Once in a while, I get a little jealous of how close Penny and Sheldon are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 leonard Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 amy I mean, not in a romantic way. It’s just, she really has some sort of connection with him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 leonard Well, well they’ve known each other a long time, and Penny grew up around horses, so she knows how to approach him without making him skittish.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 amy Don’t get me wrong, I’m glad they’re friends. I just wish he’d be that comfortable around me already.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 leonard Well, it took him a long time to get comfortable around me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 amy Really? What did you do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 leonard Something terrible in a former life? I don’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 bernadette I gotta go. Penny ratted me out. FYI, she’s getting you a watch for your birthday with money she took out of your wallet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 sheldon I don’t mean to be rude or discourteous, but before we begin, I’d just like to say there is absolutely no scientific evidence to support clairvoyance of any kind. Which means, and again, no insult intended, that you’re a fraud, your profession is a swindle, and, uh, your livelihood is dependent on the gullibility of stupid people. Again, no offence.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 penny All right, Sheldon, just ask your question.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 sheldon Okay, I just did. What was it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 penny Oh, for God’s sake. Look, he’s a physicist who’s trying to figure out what his next field of study should be.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 sheldon For your information, I was asking her about the next Star Trek movie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 penny Okay, I can answer that one, I’ll be bored.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 psychic All right, why don’t we begin? Your spirit guides are telling me that there’s a woman in your life you’re having problems with.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 sheldon That’s an easy guess. I’m clearly an annoying person and have problems with both genders.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 psychic Yes, you clearly are. But I’m seeing a specific woman that you’re in a romantic relationship with.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 penny Oh, oh, here we go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 psychic Does she have dark hair?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 penny Yes, yes, your spirit guides are on fire.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 sheldon The majority of people have dark hair. Even you, at one time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 psychic Does she work in a similar field to you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 sheldon Ha. The opposite. She’s a neurobiologist, and I’m a theoretical physicist. My spirit guides can go suck an egg.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 psychic They’re telling me that you have difficulty being close with her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 penny Oh, he does. He so does. What should he do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 psychic He should give himself to this relationship. Once he does, all his other pursuits will come into focus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 penny Sheldon, do you hear that? I mean, Amy is the key to your happiness.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 psychic Exactly. Personally and professionally. Everything will fall into place once you commit to her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 sheldon You know what this is? Yeah, and I reserve this word for those rare instances when it’s truly deserved. This is malarkey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 penny Wow, you really struck a nerve. I’ve never heard him use the M word before.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 raj Here we go, House of a 1,000 Corpses.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 emily Now, just so you know, I was a nanny for three years, so if you get scared, I can totally change your diaper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 raj Actually, I have to tell you something. These kind of movies really aren’t my thing, so, last night, I watched it just to see what I was getting myself into.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 emily Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 raj And I have to be honest, I thought it was disturbing and weird, and it made me wonder what it says about someone who enjoys it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 emily I wonder that, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 raj Then, why do you watch these things?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 emily Can I tell you something without you judging me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 raj Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 emily They kind of turn me on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 raj And play.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 sheldon Hello. I didn’t expect you this evening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 amy Well, I was just feeling so bad about lying to you the other night, I wanted to make it up to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode21 sheldon And how do you propose to do that? Unless you have Gravity on Blu-ray under that skirt, I don’t know where you’re going with this.
