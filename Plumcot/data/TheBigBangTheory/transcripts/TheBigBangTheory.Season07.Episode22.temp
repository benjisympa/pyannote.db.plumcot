TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 sheldon Gentlemen, Star Wars Day is rapidly approaching. We should finalize our plans.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 penny What? That’s a real thing? What is it, Star Wars Christmas?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 howard No. Don’t be ridiculous. That’s Wookiee Life Day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 penny So, when is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 leonard Uh, well, it’s not May the fifth, and it’s not May the third. It’s May the fourth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 sheldon Get it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 raj May the fourth be with you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 leonard May the force be with you. Get it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 penny Oh, no. This face wasn’t because I didn’t get it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 sheldon Come in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 leonard Hey, you got a second?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 sheldon Yes. Actually, I’m glad you’re here. I’m working on the Star Wars Day schedule. Now, I have a window built in after Phantom Menace for complaining, but I’m worried an hour won’t be enough time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 leonard Sheldon, I’ve got some bad news.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 sheldon What is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 leonard I just read online that Arthur Jeffries passed away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 sheldon Professor Proton is dead?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 leonard Sorry, buddy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 sheldon What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 leonard Comforting you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 sheldon Your heart might be in the right place, but your head, chest and arms certainly aren’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 leonard Anyway, the, the funeral’s on Sunday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 sheldon But, that’s Star Wars Day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 leonard Yeah, um, of all the things about this that are sad, that might not be number one. You okay? I know he meant a lot to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 sheldon I’m fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 leonard Okay. Yet he cried when they changed the Raisin Bran box.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 professor_proton This, uh, this is something interesting boys and girls. After an owl eats, he spits up part of his meal that he can’t digest, in the form of a pellet. Is, isn’t that a hoot? We’ll be right back after I fire my writers. Oh, shut up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 amy Watching your old friend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 sheldon Hmm. Yes. Look at him, Amy. It’s such a shame. Struck down in the prime of my life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 amy Do you want me to go to the funeral with you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 sheldon Oh, I’m not going to the funeral.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 amy Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 sheldon All those people blowing their noses. You can’t tell the sick from the sad. Mm. I’ll be at home celebrating Star Wars Day, as planned.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 amy Are you sure you don’t want to go say good-bye?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 sheldon Amy, mourning the inevitable is a complete waste of time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 amy And watching a bunch of goofy space movies you’ve seen hundreds of times isn’t?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 sheldon If we were in a physical relationship, you just lost sex tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 penny Hey, guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 raj Hey, Penny. Happy Star Wars Day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 penny Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 raj Can I make you breakfast? Admiral Ackbar’s Snack Bar is open for business.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 penny No, thanks. Leonard and I are just going to the funeral.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 howard You sure. Not even coffee? We have R2-Decaf. Maybe a nice Cafe Au Leia?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 raj And if you’re not in the mood for coffee I can always make you a Chai Tea-3PO.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 penny Oh, I get it, like C3PO. What happened to me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 raj Hey, uh, Sheldon, you want anything?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 sheldon Uh, no, thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 howard You’re being so quiet. Are you upset or are you just rebooting?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 sheldon I’m fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 penny Sweetie, are you sure you don’t want to come with us to the funeral?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 sheldon Oh, I appreciate the offer, but Arthur is gone and there’s nothing I can do about it. When Darth Vader struck down Obi-Wan, did Luke cry like a baby and go to his funeral?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 penny No, he blew up the Death Star. Why do I know this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 sheldon Arthur Jeffries was a scientist. I’m sure he didn’t care about silly superstitions like funerals. You know, if he were here, I think he’d say enjoy Star Wars Day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 leonard He was 84, he’d say where’s my pudding?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 raj Before you go, at least let me pack you some Attack of the Scones for the road.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 penny Oh, like Attack of the Clones. We are leaving right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 amy Arthur passing away was harder on Sheldon than he’s ready to admit. Really hoping this will cheer him up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 bernadette Me, too. Although, it might’ve been thoughtless of us to bake a Death Star cake.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 amy No, it combines two of Sheldon’s favorite things, chocolate chips and the ability to destroy a planet at the push of a button.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 bernadette Well, anyway, it’ll be a nice surprise for the boys. And Howie doesn’t think I take his interests seriously, so hopefully this will keep him fooled for a while.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 amy Okay, let’s get the fondant and start decorating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 bernadette This is pretty cool. You don’t see too many spherical cakes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 amy I wonder why that is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 penny I have a confession to make.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 leonard Hmm?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 penny I’ve never been to a funeral before.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 leonard Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 penny I just never knew anyone that died. I had a pet pig when I was a kid. I mean, when he died, we didn’t have a funeral, we had a barbecue.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 leonard Yeah, we won’t be eating Arthur tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 penny I didn’t know him very well, but I still really liked him. It’s weird that he’s just gone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 leonard I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 penny I feel like I want to cry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 leonard Oh that’s, that’s fine. Go ahead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 penny I can’t do it with you staring at me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 leonard Sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 penny No, I’m dry. You’re a big crybaby, you start, I’ll join in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 leonard I am not a crybaby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 penny Toy Story 3?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 leonard The toys were holding hands in a furnace. Look, Arthur lived a full life. And he inspired a lot of people. Sure, he, he was my childhood hero, but the fact that I got to work with him, side by side, before he died was, it was, it was a gift.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 penny It was a gift. Thank you for being the emotional one in this relationship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 leonard I got your back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 penny Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 raj Ugh, let’s get this over with.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 howard Since we all agree Episode I isn’t our favourite, maybe we just skip it this time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 sheldon Howard, I think you of all people should avoid espousing the principle that if something is not our favourite we should just get rid of it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 raj You know, I heard of this way of watching the movies called the Machete Order, where you watch Episodes IV and V, then skip Episode I, watch II and III as a flashback, and then finish with VI.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 howard Okay, so you’d lose most of Jar Jar, all the trade route talk and the boring senate hearings, which are like watching C-SPAN with monsters.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 sheldon Get rid of the trade route part? Then how would Palpatine get Chancellor Valorum kicked out of office? How would he get himself elected? How? Can we get through one holiday without you saying something ridiculous?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 raj It was just a suggestion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 sheldon Well, you know what else was just a suggestion? Why don’t we change the Raisin Bran box? Hmm? And you know who got hurt by that? Every single person who eats breakfast.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 raj Wow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 howard I think he’s taking this Professor Proton thing pretty hard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 raj Should we try to console him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 howard Or should we respect his privacy in this moment of grief?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 raj By staying here and watching the movie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 howard That’s what good friends would do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 howard Well, at least without Sheldon here, we got to start with Episode IV.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 raj Mm, true. I do feel guilty about him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 howard Me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 raj Maybe we should see how he’s doing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 howard Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 raj But after the cantina scene.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 howard Obviously.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 sheldon Look at Arthur, cracking up at a joke I told him. I’ll never hear that laugh again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 arthur You never heard it that time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 sheldon Arthur. I thought you were dead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 arthur I am. Oh, it, it’s fantastic. I mean this, this is the longest that I’ve gone without running into a men’s room in, in, in years.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 sheldon Why are you here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 arthur I don’t know. I was, I was hoping I was going to haunt my ex-wife.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 sheldon I know why. You’ve come to me because you’re my Obi-Wan.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 arthur I’m, I’m not, I’m not familiar with that. Is, is, is that an, an Internet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 sheldon Wow. Uh, you’re dead, so I’m going to let that slide. Obi-Wan Kenobi is a character from Star Wars. After his physical demise, he comes to Luke Skywalker as his mentor in spirit form.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 arthur Well, that, that clears that up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 sheldon You must be here to give me advice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 arthur Well, this, this is weird. Most, most of my robes open in, in the back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 sheldon Those are your Jedi robes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 arthur Oh, wait. What, what, what is, what is this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 sheldon Be careful with that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 arthur Oh. Oh. Oh, neato. I’m, uh, I’m going to need a Band-Aid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 leonard So, what did you think of your first funeral?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 penny Well, I don’t want to be a jerk, but it was kind of a bummer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 leonard Yeah, well, when I die, you can rent a bounce house.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 penny You think about dying?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 leonard Mm. Well, I think more about if I’d have any regrets.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 penny What would you regret?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 leonard Mm, you know, that I didn’t travel more, take more risks, learn another language.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 penny You know Klingon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 leonard That’s true.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 penny No, I meant that as a regret.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 leonard I just thought of one more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 penny What’s that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 leonard I regret not saying yes when you asked me to marry you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 penny Well, it just wasn’t the right time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 leonard Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 penny And this is also not the right time. Do not propose.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 penny I know that face. That’s your propose face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 leonard I was not gonna propose. It’s already two to one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 penny What’s two to one?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 leonard I proposed twice, you proposed once. Two to one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 penny Oh, my. It’s not a contest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 leonard I don’t know what you’re upset about. I’m the one who’s losing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 penny Okay. Fine. Would you feel better if I propose so you could turn me down again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 leonard Yeah, I think I would.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 penny Okay. Leonard, will you marry me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 leonard Hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 penny No, don’t you dare. You reject me right now and tie things up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 leonard It’s just such a big decision. I don’t want to have any regrets.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 amy Did you ever watch Professor Proton when you were a kid?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 bernadette No. My dad controlled the TV, so unless someone was a Texas Ranger, Jake or the Fatman, we didn’t see it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 amy I never watched him, either, but he seems to be the reason that Sheldon got interested in science.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 bernadette Not me. I got into science ’cause I was always the smallest kid in school, so I thought if I became a scientist, I could invent a formula that made me taller.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 amy That’s cute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 bernadette Yeah, I thought it was working for a while, but then I found out my brother was just lowering the pencil marks on the door frame. How about you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 amy Oh, I guess it must have been back when I was in the Girl Sprouts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 bernadette Girl Sprouts?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 amy My mom made it up as an alternative to the Girl Scouts. She didn’t want me selling cookies on some street corner like a whore.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 bernadette How did that get you into science?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 amy Oh, I went to the library and took out a book on biology to see what whores did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 leonard On the one hand, if I say yes…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 penny This isn’t funny anymore. Just say no so we’re done with this. Will you marry me or not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 leonard Ooh, interesting. Did you just propose to me again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 leonard Really? Because I just heard will you marry me? That’s two proposals, one day. Sounds like someone wants to spend the rest of her life telling people how to spell the name Hofstadter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 penny You know what? Fine. Do whatever you want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 leonard Hey. Penny, don’t get upset. Here. I love you, but, no, I will not marry you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 penny Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 leonard Now, about that second proposal. On the one hand…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 arthur Where, where, where are we?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 sheldon This is the swampland of Dagobah. It’s where Luke was trained in the ways of the Jedi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 arthur Oh. Too bad. I thought it was Florida.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 sheldon When Obi-Wan came to Luke on this very spot, he gave him all sorts of helpful advice. So, um, what do you got for me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 arthur Um, always, get, get a prenup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 sheldon That’s it? I thought there’d be more of a reason why you’re here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 arthur Well, why, why do you think I’m here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 sheldon I suppose it has something to do with your recent passing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 arthur Is, is this the, the first time you’ve lost, you know, someone close to you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 sheldon Oh, no. No. I’ve already had to say good-bye to 11 Dr. Whos.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 arthur Yeah, I’ve, I’ve outlived a few of my doctors, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 sheldon Of course, my grandfather died when I was five. My father died when I was 14.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 arthur I’m, I’m sorry about that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 sheldon And now you’re gone, too. It’s like all the men I’ve looked up to have gone away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 arthur Well, you know, it’s, it’s okay to, to be sad about them. Just, just make sure, you know, you appreciate those who, who are still there for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 sheldon But I do appreciate them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 arthur Well, then, what am I doing in a swamp dressed like Friar Tuck? Appreciate them, Sheldon. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 leonard Hey, buddy. Heard you’re having a rough day. You all right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 sheldon I’m okay. How was the funeral?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 leonard It was nice, you know. A lot of people showed up, told some great stories about him. Did you know that Arthur’s son is a high school sci…? Hey, the guys are about to start Jedi. You want to go watch?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 sheldon I do. After I make them go back and watch one through five first.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 leonard Sheldon, that, that’ll take us all night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 sheldon That’s true. Oh, it’s a good thing I had a nap.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 howard Boy, some of the physical comedy with Jar Jar is a little tough to watch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 leonard At least they toned him down in the second one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 penny Yeah, he is pretty stupid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 raj Hey, we can say it. You can’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 amy Hey, guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 bernadette Happy Star Wars Day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 sheldon Wow. A Death Star cake.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 amy Yeah. We were hoping it might cheer you up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 bernadette And even though it meant we had to miss the movies, we could still be part of the fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 howard Well, you didn’t miss anything. We just started over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 bernadette Son of a bitch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 sheldon You’re back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 arthur Yeah, apparently, um, I’m here whenever, when, whenever you need me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 sheldon That’s nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 arthur May, maybe for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 sheldon Why do I need you now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 arthur Well, as near as I could tell, you, you fell asleep watching Star Wars, and now you’re, you’re dreaming you’re watching Star Wars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 sheldon So?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 arthur I mean, don’t, don’t you see a problem there? I mean, how, how you’re spending your limited time on Earth?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 sheldon Not at all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode22 arthur Okay, good luck to you.
