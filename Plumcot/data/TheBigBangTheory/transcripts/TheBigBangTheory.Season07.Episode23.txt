TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski Almost there. You’re doing great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Thanks for lifting my spirits. Next time, try lifting the box.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Please hurry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 debbie_wolowitz I don’t need a treadmill.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 howard_wolowitz The doctor says you need to get exercise.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 debbie_wolowitz I get plenty of exercise.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Crushing my will to live isn’t exercise.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 raj_koothrappali If she isn’t gonna use it, then why are we doing this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 howard_wolowitz She’ll use it. All I need is to rig it with a fishing pole and a HoneyBaked Ham.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 raj_koothrappali All right. Now what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski We set it up in Howie’s old room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Do you know how to set it up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Please, I’m an MIT-trained engineer. I think I can handle… Ma, look out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 debbie_wolowitz Aaaaah! I told you this thing would kill me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 raj_koothrappali So she’s gonna be laid up for at least six weeks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Poor Mrs. Wolowitz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 amy_farrah_fowler Should we do something for her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 sheldon_cooper I know. Let’s go see the new Spider-Man movie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, we’re talking about your friend’s mother. She got hurt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 sheldon_cooper I thought that subject had run its course, so I changed it. It’s called reading the room, Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 penny Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Hey, how were things on the set?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 penny Uh, pretty good, actually.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 raj_koothrappali So the movie’s not as bad as you thought?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 penny Oh, no, it is, but I decided instead of complaining about it, I’m just gonna go in every day and give it my all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 amy_farrah_fowler Good for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 penny Thanks. There’s no reason why I shouldn’t be the best bisexual go-go dancer slowly transforming into a killer gorilla anyone’s ever seen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter I don’t know. The bisexual gorilla go-go dancer in Schindler’s List is tough to beat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Ah, very good. Because a gorilla go-go dancer of any sexual preference would be out of place in a film about the Holocaust.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter It only gets funnier when you explain it, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 sheldon_cooper I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Okay, she’s all settled in the guest room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski Maybe we should get one of those machines to help her up the stairs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 howard_wolowitz You mean a forklift?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski Howie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 howard_wolowitz I’m sorry. I just can’t deal with this right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski Taking care of your own mother? How can you say that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Bernie, she’s gonna be off her feet for six to eight weeks. Are you prepared to feed her, wash her and take her to the toilet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski I would do it for my mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Yeah, of course you would, you’re a loving person. I’m what my people would call a putz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski Look, I’m not crazy about the idea, but what other choice do we have?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 howard_wolowitz We get a nurse. Preferably someone from a third world country who’s used to suffering and unpleasant smells.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski You’d hire a total stranger to take care of the woman who raised you? That’s so cruel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Not if we pay them well and let them listen to the music of their homeland.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 debbie_wolowitz I need to tinkle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Sounds like a job for a loving person. Would you like me to play some Polish music while you carry her to the toilet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski You are a putz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 howard_wolowitz As advertised.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Thanks for coming with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Thanks for inviting me after everyone else said no. Aren’t you gonna get 3-D glasses?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 sheldon_cooper I brought my own. No sense in risking bridge-of-nose herpes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Is that a real thing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Well, until they invent nose condoms, I’m not finding out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Emily, Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 emily_sweeney Oh, hey, Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Uh, this is my friend, Sheldon. Sheldon, this is Emily.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Oh, yes, you’re the dermatologist. I went for a walk yesterday without sunscreen. Do you see anything on my forehead that I should be concerned about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 emily_sweeney Um, you know what? I better go. My movie’s about to start.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Are you here alone?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 emily_sweeney No, not really.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 raj_koothrappali What do you mean, not really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 Hey, should we get our seats?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 emily_sweeney Yeah. It was nice seeing you. Um, I’ll call you later.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Yeah, okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 sheldon_cooper That was awkward, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Uh-huh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Is it because she’s dating you but was out with that other fellow?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Good. I thought she saw something on my forehead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 director#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 And action.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 wil_wheaton Please don’t shut me out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 penny Go away. Just go away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 wil_wheaton I swear, I will find a way to turn you back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 penny What gave you the right to mix my DNA with that of a killer gorilla?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 wil_wheaton I was trying to save your life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 penny Life? What life? Look at me, I’m a monster. And now I have blood on my hands, or paws. I don’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 wil_wheaton You can’t give up. I love you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 penny I love you, too. But I’m afraid I love killing more. Like, one day, I might actually try and kill you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 director#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 And cut. All right. All right, let’s set up for the next scene.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 penny Actually, you know what? Can we do one more? I think I could do it better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 director#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 Let’s just move on. No one cares.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 penny Well, I care. I mean, look, if we’re gonna do this, why not try and make it something we’re actually proud of?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 director#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 Look, sweetie, this movie is garbage, but you should be happy about that, ’cause if it was a good movie, you wouldn’t be in it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Whoa, whoa, hang on. There’s no need to insult her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 director#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 And who are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter I’m her boyfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 director#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 Isn’t she too hot for you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter A little, yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 director#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 Well, boyfriend, get off my set.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 penny You can’t do that. He’s with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 director#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 You know what? You can get off my set, too. You’re fired.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 penny What? You can’t fire me. I’m the star. I’m the girl that goes bananas. It says so on the poster.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 director#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 Yeah, but we just shot the last scene where we see your face. So from now own, the star of the movie is whoever wears this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 wil_wheaton Hey, if you’re gonna fire her, then you have to fire me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 wil_wheaton Wow, that fell apart really fast.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Thanks for skipping the movie. I couldn’t sit in that theatre for two hours wondering about Emily and that guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Oh, quite all right. After my forehead melanoma scare I’ve learned not to sweat the small stuff. Well, sorry, I don’t have all the ingredients to make chai tea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 raj_koothrappali You don’t have to make me anything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 sheldon_cooper No, I do. You’re upset about Emily and you’re Indian. I need to make you chai tea. Now, I have all the ingredients except cardamom seeds. Do you happen to have any on you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Sorry, I left them in my turban.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Oh, I’ll make English breakfast tea. They destroyed your culture. That’s close enough. You know, I’m curious, why are you so upset about seeing Emily with another man?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Wouldn’t you be upset if you saw Amy out with someone else?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Can’t happen. We have an ironclad relationship agreement which precludes her from physical contact with anyone other than me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 raj_koothrappali But you don’t have sex with her, either.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Slick, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 raj_koothrappali To be truthful, Emily and I haven’t dated that long, and we never agreed to be exclusive to each other.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Have you had intercourse?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 raj_koothrappali No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Well, stick to your guns. There will be a lot of pressure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 debbie_wolowitz I’m hungry again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 howard_wolowitz It’s like the world’s fattest cuckoo clock.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski You know, you’re always talking about having a baby someday. This is exactly what it’s gonna be like.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 howard_wolowitz No, it’s not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski Come on. The constant fussing, eating, pooping, burping, drooling. We’re even waiting for the day when she can finally walk on her own.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Maybe you’re right. Anything she finds on the floor goes right in her mouth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski I’m just telling you now, if we do have kids, don’t expect me to do all the work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Hey, I’m a very paternal person. I’d be excellent at taking care of a baby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 debbie_wolowitz I’m still hungry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 howard_wolowitz I’m coming, you big baby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 penny You know, the only thing worse than doing a movie where they glue monkey hair to your ass is getting fired from a movie where they glue monkey hair to your ass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 wil_wheaton Forget it, man, it’s crap. You just move on to the next thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 penny Yeah, well, it’s easy for you to say. You used to be famous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 wil_wheaton Hey. I just lost a job for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 penny All right, I’m sorry, you’re famous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 wil_wheaton Penny, it’s not about being famous. It’s about the art. It’s about the passion we have for our craft. I have an audition for Sharknado 2. If I book this, I am totally gonna pay you back for this beer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 penny God, what am I doing with my life?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter You having second thoughts about acting?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 penny You were on set, you saw what it was like.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, but it’s not always that bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 penny Oh, really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter What about when you did, uh, Anne Frank at that cute little theater?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 penny It was over a bowling alley.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, but there was ample parking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 penny Are you done?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter And you were so good in the TV commercial.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 penny It was for haemorrhoid cream.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter And I got itchy and swollen just watching you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 penny Leonard, you are really not cheering me up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Come on. How can you be sad when you’re going home with all five-foot-six of this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 penny Hmm. You think you’re five-foot-six, that’s funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 raj_koothrappali I don’t understand it. I’m a nice guy, I have a great job, I’m well-educated, come from a good family. Why don’t women want to be with me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 sheldon_cooper An interesting question. Well, good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 raj_koothrappali What? Don’t send me home. I can’t be alone right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 sheldon_cooper That’s your problem. You can’t be alone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 raj_koothrappali What do you mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 sheldon_cooper How many women have you had dates with?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Eleven.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 sheldon_cooper How many of those women did you think would become your perfect companion?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Eleven. Wait. Do I count the 200-pound Sailor Moon girl that Howard and I had a threesome with at Comic Con?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 raj_koothrappali I’ll stick with eleven. She liked Howard better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Well, now do you see the problem?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Maybe. I, I don’t know.It’s late, I should, I should go. Look, I do get what you’re saying. Instead of desperately clinging to any woman who will go out with me, I need to work on my fear of being alone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 sheldon_cooper I was trying to suggest chemical castration, but it’s my bedtime, so whatever gets you out the door. Good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski Howie, I’m back!
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Shh, I just got her to sleep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski Sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 howard_wolowitz What took you so long? The grocery store is a few blocks away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski They only had regular yoghurt. I had to go to a different store to get the extra-fat kind your mom likes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Then why do I smell coffee on your breath?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski So what? After two days of taking care of her, excuse me for stopping to get a mocha.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 howard_wolowitz A mocha? Well, it must be nice to be queen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski Queen? I’ve been killing myself here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Well, whose fault is that? I wanted to get a nurse, but you were all, I’m nice, I want to take care of people.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski I’m glad I got that mocha. And you know what else I’m glad about? I bought you a brownie and I ate it in the car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 debbie_wolowitz Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Thanks a lot. Now I have to go rub her belly again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 emily_sweeney Thanks for letting me come over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Of course. Please, come in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 emily_sweeney I just wanted to say how sorry I am about tonight, and I want to make sure that we’re okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Uh, look, you and I haven’t made any commitments to each other.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 emily_sweeney I know. I just felt like I needed to explain. The guy I was with did my last tattoo, and he’s been asking me out for months. I finally said yes just to get it over with.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 raj_koothrappali It’s okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 emily_sweeney Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Well, I mean, yeah, it freaked me out a little, but that’s my issue, not yours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 emily_sweeney Wow. If I saw you out with another woman, I’d be pretty upset.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Thank you. Not just for being upset, but for believing that could happen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 emily_sweeney Just so you know, I’m not seeing anyone else.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Well, me, neither.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 emily_sweeney Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Okay. Please. So, uh, you, you have tattoos?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 emily_sweeney Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 raj_koothrappali I don’t. I have a hole in my belly button that may or may not have been a piercing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 emily_sweeney That’s cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 raj_koothrappali It’s a piercing. So, uh, how many tattoos?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 emily_sweeney One on my shoulder, one not on my shoulder and one really not on my shoulder.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 raj_koothrappali It’s, uh, been a long time since I’ve seen a girl’s really not her shoulder.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 emily_sweeney Well, how about you show me your piercing and I show you my tattoos?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 raj_koothrappali But, uh, before I take my shirt off, I just need like ten minutes to do some crunches.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 penny Oh, my God. What a day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Can I get you anything?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 penny No. I need to start making some smart decisions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter With your career?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 penny With my life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Like what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 penny I don’t know. We could get married.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Come on, be serious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 penny I am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Why? Because I’m a, a smart decision?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 penny Well, yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter So I’m like a bran muffin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 penny What? No, that’s not what I’m saying.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter No, it’s exactly what you’re saying. I’m the boring thing you’re choosing because I’m good for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 penny What does it matter? The point is, I’m choosing you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Well, it matters a lot. I don’t want to be a bran muffin. I, I want to be a Cinnabon, you know? A strawberry Pop-Tart. Something you’re excited about even though it could give you diabetes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 penny Sweetie, you can be any pastry you want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter No, no. No, it’s too late. I’m your bran muffin. Probably fat-free and good for your colon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 penny You know what? Forget it. I never should’ve brought it up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter You know I want to marry you, but you’re only doing this because you got fired and you’re feeling sorry for yourself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 penny Okay, it may look that way, but getting fired from that movie was the best thing that could have happened to me, okay? I finally realize I don’t need to be famous or have some big career to be happy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Then what do you need?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 penny You, you stupid Pop-Tart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Oh. Then I guess I’m in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 penny Really? You guess you’re in?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Not like, I guess I’m in. Like I guess, I’m in!
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter So is that it? Are, are we engaged?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 penny Yeah, I think so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 penny What’s wrong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter I’m not sure. Just feels a little anticlimactic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 penny Yeah, it kind of does, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Oh, I know. This might help.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 penny Where did you get a ring?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter I’ve had it for a couple years, not important. Penny, will you marry me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 penny Oh, my God, yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter This would have been so much more romantic if you didn’t have monkey hair on your finger.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 howard_wolowitz How you feeling?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski Last night was a little rough, but I think we’re gonna get through this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 howard_wolowitz I’m proud of us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski Me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 debbie_wolowitz Where’s my pancakes?!
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 foreign_nurse#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 Coming, Mrs. Wolowitz!
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski You were right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Welcome to Team Putz.
