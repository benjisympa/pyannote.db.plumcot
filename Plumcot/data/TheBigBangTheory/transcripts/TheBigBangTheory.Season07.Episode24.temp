TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard How’s your mom holding up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 howard She’s doing okay, but we just lost another nurse.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 amy How many is that now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 howard Two, and I know what you’re thinking, she’s eating them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 bernadette She’s just so impossible, they keep quitting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon So, who’s watching her now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 howard A bowl full of M&M’s with a few Ambien tossed in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 raj What up, guys?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 all Hello, hey!
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard Okay. Well, now that everyone’s here, Penny and I have some big news. We’re engaged.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 raj And I thought me having sex with Emily was gonna be the big news.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard Hey, hey, what the hell?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 bernadette You guys propose all the time. This never happens.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 penny You’re right! Yay!
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 raj Boy, I’m so hungry today. I wonder why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 howard Because you had sex the other night?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 raj You know what? That may be it. By the way, it isn’t like riding a bike. Like, I fell off a few times.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard Hey, buddy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard You okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon I just got called into President Siebert’s office. The university won’t let me switch my field of study to inflationary cosmology. They’re forcing me to continue with string theory.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 howard Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon He said it’s why they hired me, it’s, it’s what my grant was designated for, and that everybody has to do things they don’t want to do. He then gave an example of something he had to do, even though he didn’t want to, which was look at my stupid face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard That’s a rude thing to say, out loud.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon It’s an outrage. Honestly, I’m tempted to leave the university.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 howard You know, if you’re really serious about that, I hear there are some exciting opportunities in home care for the old and fat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard Whatever you do, just don’t make any rash decisions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon I don’t know. I am really aggravated.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 raj When I’m feeling low, I have sex with a girl. But that’s just me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 howard Oh, come on, give her a chance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 nurse No. Life, it is too short.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 bernadette I know you’ve only been here a day and a half, but you’re like part of the family. I don’t think the service is gonna send any more people.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 howard Yeah, maybe it’s time we just release Ma back into the sea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 bernadette That’s not helpful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 howard Well, then, we may need to get used to the idea that we’re gonna be living here the next few months.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 bernadette But we have jobs. We can’t baby-sit her 24 hours a day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 howard Well, what if we use our vacation time?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 bernadette I wanted to go to Hawaii, not hell.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 howard I don’t know what else we can do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 bernadette Howie, I love you, and as your wife, your mother is every bit as much my problem as she is yours, so, I want a divorce.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 mrs_hofstadter Hello, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard Hi, Mom. I have some exciting news.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 mrs_hofstadter I’m listening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard Before I tell you, will you promise to try and be happy for me and keep any concerns you have to yourself?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 mrs_hofstadter No. Let me save you all of your hemming and hawing. Sheldon already told me that you and Penny are engaged.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard I hate that you talk to him more than you talk to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 mrs_hofstadter Would you like for you and me to talk more?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard You know what? It’s probably fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 mrs_hofstadter In any event, while I’ve had my misgivings about Penny, Sheldon spoke very fondly of her, and if she is good enough for him, then she’s good enough for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard I’m your son. What about the fact that she’s good enough for me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 mrs_hofstadter Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard Thanks, Mom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 mrs_hofstadter Leonard, would it make you feel better to hear that your mother approved of your life choices?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard Yes, it would.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 mrs_hofstadter Yeah. Well, you should work on that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 penny No, Mom, it’s the same guy I’ve been going out with for the past two years. Yeah, the scientist. Well, it’s complicated. I mean, he works with lasers and atomic magnets. No, I did not see it coming. No, we did not set a date. No, I am not pregnant. Yeah, this is a first for our family. All right, tell Dad I love him. I gotta go. All right, bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 amy Atomic magnets?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 penny Shut up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 bernadette Sorry I’m late. The leaf blower broke, so I had to hand-dry my mother-in-law.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 penny You want some wine?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 bernadette Thanks. Little warning before you jump into this marriage business. You’re not just marrying him, you’re marrying his family.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 penny I think Leonard’s mom’s okay with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 bernadette It doesn’t matter if she’s okay with you. The question is, can she go to the bathroom by herself? Hit me again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 amy So, what are the living arrangements gonna be?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 penny Well, haven’t really talked about it yet, but I figure at some point, I’ll move in with him, or he’ll move in with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 amy Well, with you not working, that makes financial sense.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 bernadette You’re not working. How would you like a job in home health care?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 penny Not a chance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 bernadette Please. I’m desperate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 bernadette I’ll pay you anything you want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 penny Okay, then, yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 penny No, keep your money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 bernadette I could’ve ridden a bull longer than that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard What you working on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon I’m writing an appeal to the Faculty Senate, so that I can move on from string theory.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard Oh. How’s it going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon You tell me. Dear Esteemed Colleagues, as you may know, I have requested to change my field of study. My decision to do so is, I believe, in the best interest of science. At your convenience, I’d be happy to explain it to you in words you’ll understand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard It’s nice that you called them esteemed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon You’re right. I’ll take that out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard So, listen, there was something I was hoping to float past you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon Mm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard Now that Penny and I are engaged, I thought we might want to talk about our living arrangements.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon Of course. She’s spent many nights here, and you’re worried about preserving the myth of her virginity before the wedding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard I’m not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon Good, because not only has that ship sailed, if it hit an iceberg, countless men would perish.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard Actually, this is about where she and I are going to live.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon What do you mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard Well, well, we might want to live together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon Oh, yeah, well, I’ve already given this some thought, and I’m willing to let Penny live with us one day a week for a trial period. Now, obviously, not when she’s made cranky by the shedding of her uterine lining.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard That’s very sweet. But we were thinking more of us maybe living together with… not you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon I don’t understand. How could we all live together if I’m not there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard Look, I, I know this is, this is change, and that sounds scary.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon Where are you going to go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard I don’t know. We just started to think about this. Maybe I’ll move in with Penny, or maybe she and I’ll take this place, and you can move across the hall.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon Move across the hall? Did you take a marijuana?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard No, I did not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon Did you get hit on the head with a coconut?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon Well, then, I’m all out of guesses. What? Me move across the hall. Why would you even suggest such a thing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard Because I love Penny, and want to give her the life she deserves.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon I see. You’re putting your future bride’s happiness above mine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard Well, yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon Wow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon How dare the university force me to go back to string theory?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 amy They just don’t appreciate you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon Yeah, and on top of that, Leonard has the audacity to suggest that now that he and Penny are engaged, he may not want to live with me any more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 amy Here, I made you some Strawberry Quik.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon I have real problems here, Amy. I can’t be mollified with a beverage designed for children. Mmm, yummy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 amy You know, this might work out for the best. I mean, you’re always complaining about what a terrible roommate Leonard is. Like how he turns up the thermostat when you’re not there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon Ugh, it’s like walking into the Amazon. And not the good Amazon with one-day shipping. The awful one with birds and snakes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 amy You hate the sound of all those keys on his key chain.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon Four keys! Who does he think he is, a warden?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 amy See? Maybe you’ll love living alone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon I don’t know. Perhaps.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 amy And if it turns out you don’t, you and I could live together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon You and… oh, sure, and while we’re at it, why don’t we get engaged, too? Why don’t we get a little house, start a family? Enjoy our sunset years together? Do you hear yourself, woman?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 amy Sheldon, it was just a thought.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon No. Here’s a thought. You’re not moving in, Leonard’s not moving out, everything stays exactly the way it is. And by the way, I saw you make this Strawberry Quik with syrup, you’re supposed to use the powder.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 amy It tastes the same.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon No. The syrup tastes better and I don’t like it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 penny This is so sweet. You never cook for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard Well, you cook for me all the time and, ugh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 penny If you don’t like my cooking, why haven’t you ever said anything?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard It’s hard to talk with so much heavy chewing to do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 penny Sorry. I’ll get better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard I know you’ll try. So, should we talk about setting a date?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 penny Well, I’d like to pick one that works with my brother’s schedule.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard Okay. And when would that be?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 penny Uh, 12 to 18 months from now, depending on good behaviour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 amy Hi, is Sheldon here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard No, I thought he was with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 amy He was, but he stormed off and now he isn’t answering his phone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard What happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 amy He was really angry that you suggested he move out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 amy I also mentioned that he and I could live together but he was too mad at you to realize what a great idea that is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard Well, he’s been having a couple of tough days. I’m sure he’s fine. He probably just needs a little alone time to decompress.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 amy You’re probably right. So, what are you guys doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 penny Well, Leonard cooked for me and now we’re just having a nice dinner, you know, as a newly engaged couple.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 amy That’s nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard Anyway, as I was saying, Sheldon probably just needs a little alone time. ‘Cause that’s important. Not just for him, but for most anybody, really.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 amy Don’t I know it. What is that, polenta?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 penny Amy, get out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 amy Right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 stuart Hey, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon What happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 stuart I was cooking in the back room last night and the hot plate caught on fire.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon And you couldn’t put it out?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 stuart I was across the street at the do-it-yourself car wash, taking a shower.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon So when will you reopen?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 stuart Um, I don’t know. I’m waiting to hear back from the insurance company.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon So, tomorrow?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 stuart I don’t mean to be rude, Sheldon, but, uh, my life is kind of falling apart right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon Your life? The university is making me do string theory and my girlfriend loves me so much she wants to live with me. And now, the place I need to go when I’m sad is damp and smells funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 stuart Well, sorry I let you down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon No. I do not accept this. Everything is changing and I hate it. It stops now. I’m helping you get back on your feet. I would like to purchase this comic book, please.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 stuart That’ll be $2.99.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon Really? It’s soaking wet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 stuart Fine, a dollar.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon Can you break a twenty?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 stuart No, I only have hundreds.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon You know what? I don’t always recognize sarcasm, but I do right now, and I don’t appreciate it. I’m sorry for your loss. But you’re not the only one whose day has been a disaster.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 stuart That could have killed me. I can’t catch a break.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard I haven’t heard from Sheldon in a while. You think he’s okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 penny Oh, I’m sure he’s fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard I’m gonna see where he is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 penny How?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard Oh, I know his password, so I can track his phone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 penny You do that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard Not always, but ever since he wandered off at the swap meet chasing a balloon, I get worried.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 penny He can take care of himself. Look, we went over stranger danger and gave him that whistle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard That’s weird.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard He’s at the train station.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 penny So? He loves trains.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard It’s dark out and he’s alone, I don’t like it. Let’s go get him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 penny It’s sweet how you look out for him. You’re a good guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard It’s not just that. My mother would kill me if I let something happen to him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 raj Dude, I’m so sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 howard Don’t take this the wrong way, but did you do this for the insurance money?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 stuart No. God, you sound like the police, the firemen, my parents, my therapist and the insurance company.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 raj We’re here for you, man. Whatever you need, okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 stuart Uh, actually, I was wondering if I could crash at your place for a few nights.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 raj Sure, of course. Oh, actually, Emily was gonna spend the night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 stuart You slept with her? Nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 raj Well, I can’t take all the credit. She let me do it to her, but, uh, but I can always call her and cancel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 howard Hang on. I know a place you can stay and earn some money at the same time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 stuart Great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 howard I just have to warn you, it’ll involve humiliation, degradation and verbal abuse.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 stuart So what’s the catch?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon You tracked my phone?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon Boy, you chase one balloon for three miles.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 penny We were worried about you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon Don’t be melodramatic. I’m just getting on a train and leaving forever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard Seriously? You don’t even have a change of clothes or a toothbrush.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon My plan is to stop at malls and buy what I need. It’s called living off the land.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard Okay, I know you’re upset and there’s a lot of stuff going on, but it’s nothing we can’t work out. Come on, let’s get you home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon No. I’ve reached my breaking point. I need to leave. Now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 penny And go where?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon It doesn’t matter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard So a few things don’t go your way and your best decision is to ride the rails like a hobo?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon I suppose it is. Except I have a credit card. And I refuse to carry my laptop at the end of a stick. And I’d sooner die than eat beans out of a can.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard Come on, come home with us and tomorrow I’ll, I’ll take you to Legoland.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon Legoland is not the solution to everything. And it’s too much of a scene since that movie came out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard Then what can I do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon Leonard, I am overwhelmed. Everything is changing and it’s simply too much. I need to get away and think.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard Oh, come on, you know you’re overreacting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 penny Leonard, hang on. Just come here. Maybe we need to let him go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard What? Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 penny It might be good for him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard You know he can’t take a trip like this by himself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 penny He’s a grown man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard No, he looks like a grown man. You’ve seen Freaky Friday, sometimes little kids end up in big person bodies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 penny Leonard, we can’t protect him forever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard I know, but…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 penny He’ll be okay. You taught him well, Padawan.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon Good Lord. Padawan’s the student, not the teacher.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 penny Seriously, let him go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard Sheldon, if you really need to do this, I’m not gonna stand in your way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon I do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard Okay. Good luck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 penny Be safe and call us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon I will.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard Bye, buddy. Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon Yes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard I’m gonna miss you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 sheldon Of course you are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard He just made that easier.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 penny Mm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 stuart Hey. What are you guys still doing here? I got this, go. Go home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 howard You sure?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 stuart Yeah, she’s fed, she took her pills, she’s all tucked in and watching TV.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 bernadette So, she’s not too much for you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 stuart Are you kidding? I love her, she’s great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 mrs_wolowitz Stewie, you gonna watch Wheel of Fortune with me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 stuart Coming, Debbie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 howard You call her Debbie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 stuart She insisted. So, hey, guys, thank you so much. This job is a dream come true.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 howard Was that a little weird?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 bernadette Yeah. I don’t know why, but something about it feels unnatural.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 howard Okay, let’s go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 bernadette Yep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 amy Okay, Sheldon, thanks for checking in. Talk to you tomorrow? Oh, okay, bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard He’s okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 amy Actually sounds like he’s doing pretty well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 penny I really think this is gonna be for the best.
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 leonard Me, too. And he was able to take a sabbatical from…
TheBigBangTheory.Season07.Episode24 amy How could you let him go?
