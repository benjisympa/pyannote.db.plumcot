TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Excuse me. Is it at all possible that you’re knitting a pair of pants? Oh, well, no, you’re understandably terrified. But, you know, allow me to explain. 45 days ago, um, I embarked on a railroad journey of healing because my university was making me do string theory, and my favorite comic book store burned down, and when my room mate got engaged, my girlfriend wanted to move in with me, which was no doubt a ploy just to see my, well, excuse my language, but my bathing suit parts. Uh, sir, may I use your phone?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 man I don’t think so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Yeah, well, I understand that I’m half naked, but there is a reasonable explanation. While I slept in my sleeper car, all my possessions were stolen. Now, typically, I wear pyjamas, but I recently adopted a hobo lifestyle and pyjamas are the sleep-pants of the Man. I’ll have you know, Mahatma Gandhi wore no pants and a nation rallied behind him. My good man, now, before you walk away, I know that I may appear deranged, but I am, in fact, a world-renowned physicist. Ask me the difference between a boson and a fermion. Go ahead, ask. Bosons have integer spin, fermions have half-integer spin. My legs are getting cold. Why won’t anybody help me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 penny Hi. Want to do yoga with me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Um, let me just have some coffee first, and then I’ll have the strength to tell you how much I won’t be doing that. Hello?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Hello, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Hey, buddy. Good to hear your voice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Uh, I’m in Kingman, Arizona, and, uh, I need you to come pick me up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter I’d love to. I’m just about to do yoga with Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Leonard, I’m at the police station. I was robbed. They took my phone, my wallet, my iPad, everything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Oh, my God, are you okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 sheldon_cooper No, I’m not okay. Uh, I’m wearing borrowed pants, I don’t have I.D., and one of the officers here won’t stop calling me chicken legs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Okay. Uh, I’ll, I’ll come get you. What’s the address?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 penny Hey, what’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter He got all of his stuff stolen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 penny Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 sheldon_cooper 2530 East Andy Devine Avenue,
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Hurry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, hang tight. Hey, do you want me to bring anything?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Oh, yes, please. A pair of pants. And my toothbrush. Yeah, and my mail. And a really good comeback for chicken legs, because “I know you are, but what am I?” was met with stony silence.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter I’ll be there as soon as I can.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 penny Is he okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, he’s fine, he’s just a little rattled.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 penny Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Feel like driving to Arizona with me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 penny I can’t, I have that job interview.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Oh, right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 penny Besides, I don’t need six hours of your hair is different, why did you change your hair? I’m holding my breath until your hair grows back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter All right, fine. Hey, can you think of a reason I shouldn’t invite Amy to come with me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 penny Nope.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Come on, you didn’t even try.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Thanks for the lift.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 howard_wolowitz What’s wrong with your car?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 raj_koothrappali I’m having my windows untinted.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Got a hot girlfriend now. I want the haters to know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 howard_wolowitz What are you talking about? No one’s paying attention to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Wow. How’s that Hater-Ade taste, bro? Hey, this isn’t the way to work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 howard_wolowitz I just want to pop in and make sure Ma’s okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 raj_koothrappali I thought Stuart was looking after her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 howard_wolowitz He was, but now that her cast is off, he moved out. And honestly, I’m kind of glad. It was getting a little weird.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 raj_koothrappali How so?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 howard_wolowitz I don’t know, they’re, chummy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Like us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 howard_wolowitz No, not like us. Creepy chummy, like you and your dog.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 raj_koothrappali She feeds him out of her own mouth?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 howard_wolowitz I mean, he calls her Debbie, she calls him Stewie and they’re all giggly around each other. And believe me, when food goes in that mouth, it does not come out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 raj_koothrappali So are you worried because he’s replacing you as a son or are you worried because he’s becoming her lover?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 howard_wolowitz First of all, no one can replace me as a son. I’m her little matzo ball. And secondly, my mother is well past having any kind of sex life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Okay, okay. Although many older women lead vibrant, active…
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 howard_wolowitz I said well past it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Excuse me, Officer Hernandez? Any leads on the person who stole my belongings?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 officer_hernandez Not yet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Well, perhaps I can help. Sherlock Holmes always says when you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, have, have you tried doing that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 officer_hernandez Nope.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Well, maybe you should. There’s lots of books called Sherlock Holmes, and there’s no books called Officer Hernandez.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Thanks again for coming. Six hours was gonna be a long drive by myself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 amy_farrah_fowler My pleasure. And I’m not angry at all that my boyfriend was in trouble and called you instead of me. I love that,
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, time’s gonna fly by.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 penny I haven’t been on a job interview in years. I’m really nervous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 bernadette_rostenkowski Don’t be. You are built for pharmaceutical sales. You’re cute, you’re flirty and started that like there were gonna be three things.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 penny I don’t have any experience in sales. Unless you count the bikini car wash I did in high school. But you already made me take that off my résumé.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 bernadette_rostenkowski This job is a lot like being a waitress, except instead of pushing the fish tacos ’cause they’re about to go bad, you’re just pushing our antidepressants before the FDA finds out they may cause rectal bleeding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 penny They do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 bernadette_rostenkowski Maybe. But like our lawyers say, the world is full of things that can cause a rectum to bleed. Anyway, I talked you up to Dan. He’s the guy who’ll be interviewing you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 penny Oh, I really appreciate this. I just hope I’m not in over my head.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 bernadette_rostenkowski You’ll be fine. Just be yourself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 penny I wish I felt more confident.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 bernadette_rostenkowski Penny, I wouldn’t have put you up for this job if I didn’t think you could handle it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 penny Oh, thank you, but maybe I should cancel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 bernadette_rostenkowski It’s too late to cancel. You’re going.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 penny But I don’t know anything about pharmaceuticals.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, I understand. You want to do something you’re already good at. I know. Why don’t I get you a job at the Sitting Around All Day Wearing Yoga Pants Factory?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 penny They’re comfortable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Ma, I hope you’re decent. Raj is here. You just started seeing naked women again, and I don’t want you to be confused about where the boobs should be.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 stuart_bloom Oh, hey, guys. What are you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Uh, what are you doing here? I thought you moved out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 stuart_bloom Oh, yeah, I was going to, and then Debbie and I got to talking over dinner the other night. I didn’t have any place to go, she likes having me around, so we both said, why leave? at the same time. It was precious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 howard_wolowitz It’s not that precious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 raj_koothrappali I’d like to back you up, but it sounds like it was pretty precious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 debbie_wolowitz Stewie, I can’t find my glasses.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 stuart_bloom Be right there, Deb Deb. They’re probably on her head.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Or in her neck. Listen. You staying here seems like something she would’ve talked to me about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 stuart_bloom Well, maybe if you called your mother more often, you’d know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 raj_koothrappali It wouldn’t kill you to pick up the phone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Any word on my stolen items?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 officer_hernandez We’re doing everything we can.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 sheldon_cooper You know, Sherlock Holmes liked to use cocaine to sharpen his focus. But I’m sure those Cool Ranch Doritos are doing the trick.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Leonard. Oh, I’m so happy to see you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 amy_farrah_fowler Are you okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Oh, I’m fine. Why did you come?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 amy_farrah_fowler What do you mean, why did I come? You’re my boyfriend. I haven’t seen you in over a month. I just drove six hours to help you out. Don’t you have anything to say besides why did you come?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 sheldon_cooper I do, but, I feel uncomfortable saying it out loud in front of these police officers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 amy_farrah_fowler Fine. Whisper it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Shotgun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter So, Sheldon, tell us about your trip. Where’d you go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Where didn’t I go? I went to New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Denver, Seattle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter How were they?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Oh, I have no idea. I never left the train station.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Hang on. You travelled across the entire country and never left a train station?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Why would I? That’s where all the cool trains are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter I’m sorry, so you never went outside?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Or had a single piece of fruit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 dan So, why do you think you’d make a good pharmaceutical sales rep?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 penny Well, I’m a people person. People like me. Some of my favourite people are people. I feel like I’m saying people a lot. People, people, people. Okay, I’m done.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 dan You sure?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 penny People. Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 dan Good. So, how do you feel your previous job experience has prepared you for a career like this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 penny Uh, well, as a waitress, sales was a big part of my job. I mean, believe me, I convinced a lot of very large customers, who should not be eating cheesecake, to have more cheesecake. I mean, one of those chubsters even had an insulin pump.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 dan Uh-huh. I have an insulin pump.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 penny People.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 howard_wolowitz It’s weird, right? A grown man in his thirties living with my mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 raj_koothrappali That is weird. I thought he was, like, 45.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Come on, you don’t think it’s a little odd?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 raj_koothrappali I don’t know. I mean, she’s lonely. He needs a place to stay. I doubt there’s any funny business going on. And even if there was, who cares? They’re both adults.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Who cares? You wouldn’t care if I slept with your mom?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 raj_koothrappali You know what? You’re my best friend, and she’s in a bad marriage. I give you my blessing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 howard_wolowitz This is stupid. I’m just gonna call my mother and be honest with her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 raj_koothrappali ‘Cause that’s what little matzo balls do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 stuart_bloom This is Debbie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 debbie_wolowitz And this is Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 together#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 Just kidding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 stuart_bloom Leave a message.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 raj_koothrappali This is the part where you talk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 dan All right, let’s say a physician was prescribing one of our competitor’s drugs. How would you convince them to switch to ours?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 penny Um, any chance his car needs to be washed by a girl in a bikini? No. Okay, I’m really sorry for wasting your time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 dan Don’t worry about it. Thanks for stopping by.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 penny Okay, thanks. Um, I’m sorry, listen, could you do me a favour and not tell Bernadette how badly I blew this interview? She’ll get upset. And honestly I’m a, a little terrified of her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 dan Wait, wait. You’re scared of Bernadette?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 penny Yeah, kind of.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 dan I thought it was just me. Everyone thinks she’s so nice with that squeaky little voice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 penny I know, but she’s kind of a bully.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 dan Wll, she is. I didn’t even want to meet you, but, uh, I was too scared to say no to her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 penny Me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 dan Yeah, yeah. One, one time, I had, I had to tell her we were cutting the, the research funding for one of the drugs she was developing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 penny What happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 dan I couldn’t do it. She’s still working on it. Oh, we’re not gonna tell her about this, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 penny Oh, my God, no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 sheldon_cooper At the hot dog stand in the Denver train station, Heinz ketchup. At the hot dog stand in the Salt Lake City train station, Heinz ketchup. At the hot dog stand in the Indianapolis train station?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter I don’t care.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Wrong. Hunt’s. Hey, Amy, what do you say? You ready to move on to the mustard round?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 amy_farrah_fowler Have you not noticed that I’ve been sitting back here quietly stewing for the past two hours?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 sheldon_cooper I just thought you were bad at the game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 amy_farrah_fowler I’m mad at you. How could you just go away like that without even saying good-bye, and then call Leonard for help instead of me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Amy, may I please have a moment of privacy to speak with my roommate?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 amy_farrah_fowler We’re in a moving car. What do you expect me to do? Stick my fingers in my ears?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Well, I was thinking put your head out the window like a dog, but that’ll work. Please? This’ll be quick. Leonard? As soon as we get home, I want to have coitus with Amy. Okay, she can’t hear. The reason I called you is because I didn’t want Amy to know I couldn’t make it on my own.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter What’s the big deal?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Oh, of course it’s no big deal to you. You idolize me, and nothing could ever knock me off that pedestal you put me on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Well, yeah, it’s true. You, you are a god to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 amy_farrah_fowler Can I stop now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Just tell her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 sheldon_cooper I called Leonard because I failed. And I didn’t want you to think less of me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 amy_farrah_fowler You were worried about that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, it’s okay with me that you’re not perfect.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Can I have one more moment with Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 amy_farrah_fowler Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Amy just hurt my feelings. I want to break up with her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Now, I never thought I’d say this, but I’m kind of excited to see Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 bernadette_rostenkowski I never thought I’d say this, but Penny got a job today.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 howard_wolowitz She did?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 bernadette_rostenkowski Well, the only reason she got it is ’cause the guy who interviewed her loves me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 howard_wolowitz What do you want?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 stuart_bloom I, uh, kind of got the feeling you might not be okay with me staying at your mom’s.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 howard_wolowitz You’re right, I’m not. I think it’s weird.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 bernadette_rostenkowski Howie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 howard_wolowitz It is. He’s a grown man. He’s just gonna live there rent-free? How is that gonna motivate him to get off his butt and get a job? I mean, do you even have a plan?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 stuart_bloom Hey, you’re not my father, okay? And besides, your mother and I were talking…
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Your mother and I? You’re not my father.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 stuart_bloom I didn’t say I was your father.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Well, I didn’t say I was your father.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 bernadette_rostenkowski Okay, calm down. You’re not his father, he’s not your father. Nobody’s anybody’s father.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 stuart_bloom I, I’m sorry you don’t like my life choices, but it’s my life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Well, it’s my house, it’s my rules.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 stuart_bloom Oh, oh, okay, Dad, if I mow the lawn, can I have my allowance?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 bernadette_rostenkowski Hey, don’t you take that sarcastic tone with him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 stuart_bloom I don’t have to listen to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Don’t talk to her like that. That is my mother. Wife. My wife. I said my wife.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 stuart_bloom You know what? This isn’t getting us anywhere. When you’re ready to apologize, you know where to find me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Yeah, in my house.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 stuart_bloom That’s right, sucka.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 sheldon_cooper I wish I’d never gone on that trip. I feel no better now than when I left.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 amy_farrah_fowler But you still accomplished something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Yeah. If you had told anyone that you were going away on a train by yourself across the country, do you know what they would have said?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 sheldon_cooper That I couldn’t do it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Exactly. Right after they said yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 amy_farrah_fowler But you did do it. So what if it didn’t all go your way? That’s what makes it an adventure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 sheldon_cooper That’s a good point. You know, I’m a lot like Gandalf the Grey. He fought the Balrog and emerged stronger than ever as Gandalf the White. I was robbed of my phone and pants, and I, too, came back stronger. And whiter, too, ’cause I wasn’t in direct sunlight for six weeks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 amy_farrah_fowler See? This trip was good for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Indeed. I was the world’s smartest caterpillar. And then after pupating in our nation’s railway system, I’ve burst forth as the world’s smartest butterfly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Butterfly could’ve gotten himself home from Arizona.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Yeah, I feel renewed. I’m ready to deal with any changes that come my way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 all@ Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 penny Hey, look who’s back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Your hair is different. You changed your hair. I can’t take this. I’m out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Would you like to see pictures from my trip?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 penny I thought your phone got stolen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Yeah, it did, but luckily all my photos got backed up to the Cloud.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter And you thought they all had a silver lining.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Here, day one, uh, this was the seat I was going to sit in but didn’t because there were cracker crumbs on it. As it was first class, I suspect Ritz. This is the train bathroom. This is the Imodium I took so I would never have to use the train bathroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 penny I cannot believe you travelled the entire country and never left the train station.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode01 sheldon_cooper I know. You know, I almost died in a fire in Des Moines, but I stayed put. FYI, that’s when the Imodium gave out.
