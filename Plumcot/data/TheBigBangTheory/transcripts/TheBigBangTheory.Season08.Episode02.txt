TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I recently read that during World War Two, Joseph Stalin had a research program to create supersoldiers by having women impregnated by gorillas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 howard_wolowitz What a sick use of science.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Hey, as long as the baby’s healthy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler I wonder if Stalin considered any other animals.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Hippos are the deadliest creature. A half-human, half-hippo soldier would be pretty badass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Yes, but when they’re hungry-hungry, you can stop them with marbles.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Yeah, the correct animal for interspecies supersolider is koala. You would wind up with an army so cute it couldn’t be attacked.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 raj_koothrappali But half-man, half-owl could fly…
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper The answer is cuddly soldiers with big flat noses. Moving on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 howard_wolowitz So, Penny, when’s the new job start?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 penny Next Monday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski Did you get a chance to look over the materials I gave you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 penny Uh, not yet, but I will.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski Great. When?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 penny I said I’ll get to it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I’m sensing awkwardness, am I right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Swish.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t want to be pushy, but you’ve never done pharmaceutical sales before. It seems like you could use this time to get a head start.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 penny Well, the first few weeks will be all training. They’ll tell me everything I need to know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski But imagine how impressed they’d be if you showed up already familiar with the material.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 penny Okay, so what, you want me to be like a teacher’s pet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski Couldn’t hurt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Mm, I don’t know. Who here has ever been hurt because they were the teacher’s pet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper It was like the rest of the class wanted Ms. McDonald to forget the quiz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Mrs. Davis. Guess who?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 janine_davis Dr. Cooper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper That’s right, good job. Hello. Uh, you wanted to see me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 janine_davis Yes. Uh, welcome back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Thank you. I assume you’d like to reopen our dialogue about the university forcing me to continue with string theory?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 janine_davis You mean the dialogue that went, please, no, please, no, please, no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper That’s the one. I believe you went last, so, uh, please?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 janine_davis Dr. Cooper, while you were away, we came up with a solution that would allow you to change your field of study.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Wow. Pouting and running away actually worked. I must say, that may not be a lesson you want to reinforce with me. So, um, what is the solution?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 janine_davis Currently, you’re being paid under a grant to specifically research string theory. If we promote you to junior professor, you’ll be able to choose whatever field of research you’d like.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper But if I’m a professor, then I’ll have to teach a class.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 janine_davis That is correct.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper So your solution is to promote me and pay me more money so that I can impart my knowledge to the next generation of scientists?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 janine_davis Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper You people are sick.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 penny Hey. Ready to go to lunch?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Just give me a minute. I’m stimulating the pleasure cells of this starfish. I just need to turn it off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 penny What happens if you don’t?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Then I have to sit through lunch knowing this starfish is having a better day than I am. Is Bernadette meeting us at the restaurant?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 penny Uh, no. Actually, I didn’t invite her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler How come?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 penny Well, ever since she helped me get this job, she won’t stop bugging me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Well, I think she just wants you to do well, and she’s worried that you won’t ’cause you were just a stunningly poor waitress.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 penny That is not true.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler I’m still waiting on my mini corndogs from two years ago.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 penny I told you, they’ll be right out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Okay, so no Bernadette.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 penny Well, you saw her the other night. Am I wrong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler No, I just, I feel kind of uncomfortable talking about her like this. Usually when someone’s being talked about behind their back, it’s me and it’s right in front of my face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 penny I’m sorry. I just need a little break from her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler I understand. You know, there is some research that indicates that sharing negative attitudes about a third party can be a powerful bonding force between two friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 penny So, what are you saying?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler I’m saying, in the spirit of science, what is that little skank’s problem?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 raj_koothrappali So, I’ve been trying to come up with a cute couple’s nickname for me and Emily. What do you like better? Emippali or Koothrapemily?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Why is it your last name and her first name?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Oh, well, her last name is Sweeney, and something just didn’t seem right about Koothrapeeney.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Hey, how’d it go with human resources?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Awful. They’re allowing me to move on from string theory, but they made me a junior professor and are requiring me to teach a class.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 raj_koothrappali I don’t understand. Why is it bad that you have to teach?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper What a stupid question.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter The kids are gonna love him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I can’t believe I have to waste my time babysitting a bunch of grad students who probably think dark matter is what’s in their diapers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter This might not be that bad. Uh, you like telling people they’re wrong.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Wrong, Just because I enjoyed that one doesn’t mean I always do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 raj_koothrappali You enjoy giving people grades.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper A valid point, but unoriginal. B-minus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 howard_wolowitz And you love the sound of your own voice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Yeah, well, of course I do. Listen to it. It’s like an earful of melted caramel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Look, most importantly, this will let you move on and study dark matter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper It is true that many of my heroes have taken students under their wings. Feynman, Einstein, Professor X. Humorously, in the case of Professor X, some of his students actually had wings. That’s rich. I’ll use that one to lighten the mood after my entire class fails the midterm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Measuring starfish serotonin levels in response to one point two molar stimulation of pleasure cells. You like that, don’t you? That’s right, say my name.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Hey, what’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski Not much. You want to get a drink later? Just the two of us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler No Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski Not tonight. I’m a little frustrated with her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Because you got her the job and you think she should be working harder to prepare for it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski So it’s not just me. You see it, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler I do, I see it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski It’s driving me crazy. Just this afternoon, I saw on Instagram that instead of studying, she went out to lunch and got a manicure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler That’s outrageous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler If she doesn’t do well, this could reflect poorly on you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski Exactly. Does she not realize it or does she not care?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler I don’t know. The important thing is I am here for you so we can mutually disparage this unpleasing third party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Hey. We just wanted to see how your class was going. Where is everybody?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper There is no class.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Did you send everyone to the principal’s office already?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper No one signed up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Well, that’s not your fault.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I called the department secretary to see what happened. Apparently, I have a reputation for being obnoxious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Hey, Sheldon, I’m sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper No, it’s fine. Now I can devote all my time to dark matter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Aw, you brought cookies for everyone?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Oh, yes. Fig Newtons. I was going to ask them which scientist both helped to develop calculus and had a famous cookie named after him? And then after someone said Newton, I was going to tell them they’re wrong. The cookies are named after a town in Massachusetts. And then I’d throw the cookies away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Hey, what if I took your class?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Why would you do that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, why would you do that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 raj_koothrappali What’s wrong with you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 howard_wolowitz I’m thinking about getting my doctorate, and he wants to teach. Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Oh, Howard. I appreciate the gesture, but this is a graduate-level physics class. I don’t think you’d understand a single thing I was talking about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Ask why not again, I’ve got an answer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Sheldon, I’m more than smart enough to take your class.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper How would you determine the ground state of a quantum system with no exact solution?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 howard_wolowitz I would guess a wave-function and then vary its parameters until I found the lowest energy solution.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Hmm. Do you know how to integrate X squared times E to the minus X, without looking it up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 howard_wolowitz I’d use Feynman’s trick, differentiate under the integral sign.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Okay. Um, what is the correct interpretation of quantum mechanics?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Since every interpretation gives exactly the same answer to every measurement, they are all equally correct. However, I know you believe in the Many Worlds Interpretation, so I’ll say that. Now do you think I’m smart enough?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Oh, come on. You might’ve gone to school for a couple more years than me, but guess what, engineers are just as smart as physicists.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper You take that back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 howard_wolowitz No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler So, after drinks with Bernadette, I get home, and Penny calls to complain about her. And then while I’m talking to Penny, I get a text from Bernadette.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I am trying to prepare my lesson plan for Howard. Why are you telling me this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Because it’s taken 15 years, but high school is finally awesome. I love them both, but I’m in the centre now, and I love that even more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Amy, please. I am trying to figure out a way to intellectually emasculate a dear friend of mine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler But I’m just…
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Not now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler You better watch that attitude, buddy. You’re dating the popular girl now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Hmm. You’re up late.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Oh, I’m working on my lesson plan for Wolowitz. He is going to be so lost. Look at this section over here. Even I don’t really understand it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, why are you doing this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I’m a teacher, Leonard. It’s my job.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter No, I mean, why are you going to so much trouble to prove that you’re smarter than Wolowitz?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Oh, it’s no trouble, it’s actually a pleasure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter You want to know what I think? I think the idea that someone could be as smart as you, or even smarter, scares the pants off you, and you can’t deal with it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Interesting point. You’re suggesting that I have emotional issues below my consciousness which drive my behaviour, thus causing me to lash out at anything or anyone that threatens my intellectual superiority.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Might be something to think about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Howard’s allergic to peanuts. How can I use that against him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Okay, now that everyone’s here, we can begin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Before we do, I just talked to Leonard. And if you’re gonna spend all your time trying to belittle me by making this class unnecessarily hard, then I’m out. But if you’re interested in making a sincere effort to be a good teacher, then I’m willing to give this a shot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I suppose that’s a fair request. There’s no reason we both can’t benefit from this experience.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Okay. Well, then, uh, first things first. Um, are you familiar with the Brachistochrone problem?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 howard_wolowitz I am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Good. And how it relates to the calculus of variations?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 howard_wolowitz It’s an inverted cycloid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Wonderful. Now, what about Euler-Lagrange theorems?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 howard_wolowitz That’s where I’m a little fuzzy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Ha! I knew it. All right. We have a lot of information to cover before your first test. Which, by the way, is in eight minutes. The good news is I’m grading on a curve, so you’re pretty much guaranteed a C.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 howard_wolowitz All I do is win, win, win no matter what.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Everybody hands go up, up and they stay there!
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 howard_wolowitz If you’re gonna be a crappy teacher, then I’m gonna be a crappy student. Uh, uh, Ludacris going in on the verse. ’cause I never been defeated and I won’t stop now…
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Will you stop it. This is a classroom. This is not American Bandstand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Now, where was I? Let’s see. Oh, yes. Over here. You… What are you doing now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Making a straw.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 howard_wolowitz So I can shoot you with a spitball.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper You’re not going to do that, and I’ll tell you why. This is an institution of higher learning, I am your professor, and you’re going to treat me with the prop… You shot your spit in my mouth!
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Is that gonna be on the test? Because I don’t think I can do that again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Hey, girlfriend. Can I get a what what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Close enough. Um, I was just calling to see what you were up tonight. Thought maybe we could hit up Color Me Mine, maybe sneak in some Pinot Greej. Whatevs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 penny Uh, thanks, but I think I’m gonna stay in and go over the stuff Bernadette gave me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Oh. Oh, I hear you. Try and get that nag off your back, right? I mean, you’re not a bicycle, why’s she riding you like that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 penny No, I think she was just trying to help. Plus, I really want to do well at this job. So…
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Okay, good luck. And call me later, you know, if you decide she’s a bitch or something. Hey, girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski Hey, Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Tonight. You, me, Color Me Mine. Maybe we sneak in some Pinot, make it Color Me Wine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski That sounds fun, but I promised Penny I’d come by and help her study.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Oh. Well, good luck getting her to do that. She’s probably off getting another manicure. You remember when she did that? You remember?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski I was probably being too hard on her. We talked, we’re good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Oh. Great. I’m happy for you guys. You know, when the two of you aren’t getting along, it puts me in a really weird position.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski Well, don’t worry, everything’s back to normal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler You mean, like, where she’s nice to your face? Okay got it. Bye. Hey, boyfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Can’t talk. Spitball. Probably gonna die.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Well?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, I promise. Your uvula does not have an STD.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Are you sure? It just doesn’t feel as innocent as it used to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 howard_wolowitz You reported me to human resources?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper You violated the sanctity of my mouth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Well, I dropped your class, so I hope you’re happy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I told you you weren’t smart enough to take it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 howard_wolowitz I’m smart enough, Sheldon. Asking me a bunch of questions about a topic I’m not familiar with doesn’t prove anything. I could do the same to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Yeah, try me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Okay. You enjoy making fun of engineering so much, how do you quantify the strength of materials?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Young’s modulus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Is that right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Yeah. Okay, how do you prevent eddy currents in a transformer?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Laminate the core material.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Come on, give him a hard one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 howard_wolowitz That was a hard one. All right. How does the flow rate in a pipe depend on its diameter? You don’t know, do you? What’s the matter, smart guy? Don’t know Poiseuille’s law?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Thank goodness I got it. Now I can quit checking my stool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski Okay, what are the potential side effects for our erectile dysfunction drug?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 penny Headaches, dizziness and nausea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 penny Those are also the side effects of having a 75-year-old man with an erection climb on top of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski Want to stop here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 penny Uh, no. I can keep going.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski Nah, you got this. Let’s go for a drink. I’ll call Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 penny Okay, good. She seemed like she really wanted to go out tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Hey, girl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Okay, next question, for the Butterfinger. How long is a galactic yea
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 raj_koothrappali 250 million years.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Okay, this one is for a Cadbury Creme Egg.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Oh! It’s not even Easter time. This is crazy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Which Archimedean solid has 20 regular triangular faces, 30 square faces, 12 pentagonal faces, 60 vertices and 120 edges?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 all@ The Rhombicosidodecahedron.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter We are so smart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Why didn’t girls like us in high school?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Because we were awkward and weird and couldn’t play sports!
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Right again.
