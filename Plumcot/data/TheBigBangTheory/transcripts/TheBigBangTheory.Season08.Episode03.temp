TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 howard So, how does this game work? I just throw it, like a real ball?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 leonard Yeah, just nice and easy, right over the plate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 howard All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 raj You suck, Wolowitz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 howard What’s that about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 raj I’m heckling you. It’s a beloved part of baseball.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 sheldon He’s right. And given that you’re probably still waiting to be picked for a game that was played in fifth grade, I’m sure you do suck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 penny Hi. What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 leonard Baseball.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 penny Okay, this is not what I meant when I said go outside and play.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 leonard He’s practicing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 penny For what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 howard The Angels wanted an astronaut to throw out the first pitch, so guess who they called?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 penny What, you? Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 howard Well, a lot of people who weren’t available, but then me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 penny That’s so cool. Congratulations. I guess that makes you the athlete of the group.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 sheldon Well, not just him. May I remind you that you’re talking to the seeker, beater, chaser and water boy of the third place Griffith Park Quidditch team.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 penny I know. Watching your boyfriend run around with a broomstick between his legs isn’t something you forget.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 leonard C’mon now, throw one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 howard All right, here we go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 raj You look like a jackass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 howard Cut it out. You’re hurting my feelings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 leonard Now you know why we’re not outside.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 sheldon Did you enjoy my lecture?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 amy No, and neither did our waiter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 sheldon Well, if you’re going to serve Cornish game hen, you should either be familiar with the history of Cornwall or be prepared to learn it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 amy It’s hard to argue with that. And I know because I saw a sad man with a pepper mill desperately try and fail.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 penny Hey, how was dinner?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 sheldon Good, I had Cornish game hen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 leonard Oh, that poor waiter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 amy Sheldon, how about tomorrow night we see a movie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 penny You guys are going out two nights in a row?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 sheldon I missed a number of date nights while I was on my train trip, and I’m contractually obligated to make them up under the terms of the Relationship Agreement.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 penny That’s so hot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 amy It’s better than hot, it’s binding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 sheldon If you’re free tomorrow night, I’d love to have you join us on a double date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 penny Aw.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 amy You are aware that a double date doesn’t count as two dates.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 sheldon Oh. Well, then come or don’t. I don’t care.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 bernadette I can’t believe you’re sore.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 howard Hey, even professional pitchers need a rubdown after the game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 bernadette But they throw an actual ball. You were throwing air at a TV.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 howard For your information, I also gave Leonard one hell of a high five.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 bernadette I’m kind of surprised you agreed to do this in front of a stadium full of people.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 howard They’re doing Space Day and NASA asked me. I felt like I couldn’t say no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 bernadette Okay. Well, if you want, I could help you practice. I played a lot of softball growing up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 howard Thank you, that would be great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 bernadette Great. And while we’re at it, maybe we could butch up your run for when you head out to the mound.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 howard What’s wrong with the way I run?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 penny Sheldon, I’m surprised you’d choose to go to a pub.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 sheldon At our committee meeting, Amy made a motion for a picnic in a park, but I tacked so many amendments on that thing it sank like a lead balloon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 amy I then suggested a pub.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 sheldon Yeah, which I was initially sceptical of until I saw online that they serve Yorkshire pudding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 leonard You don’t even like Yorkshire pudding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 sheldon No, it’s yucky, but informing people about the history of Yorkshire is yummy, yum-yum.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 amy After a lively debate, that proposal passed by a two-zero margin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 leonard Nice to see a busy couple keep the spark of bureaucracy alive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 sheldon Ignore them, Amy. They’re just jealous because they’ll never have a relationship as good as ours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 penny Isn’t this when he says bazooka or something?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 sheldon I wasn’t making a joke, I was merely stating fact. Amy and I have a superior relationship to yours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 leonard You don’t honestly think that, do you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 sheldon Leonard, I assumed you knew. The ranking of relationships in our circle by quality is me and Amy, Howard and Bernadette, Raj and his girlfriend, Penny and Chardonnay, Penny and you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 leonard There isn’t any ranking. And if there were, we wouldn’t be at the bottom of it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 penny Yeah, and actually, I drink Sauvignon Blanc.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 leonard That’s the part you have a problem with?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 penny Relax.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 amy There they go, fighting again. You’d never hear her talk that way to Sauvignon Blanc.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 raj So you never played baseball as a kid, not even Little League?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 howard Well, I was going to, but the day of tryouts I found my dad’s Playboy collection. Threw my arm out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 bernadette All right, the pitcher’s mound in Major League Baseball is sixty feet, six inches away from home plate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 howard Great. You take this and say when to stop. How much further?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 bernadette Keep going.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 howard How about now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 bernadette I’ll let you know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 howard Are you saying stop and we’re just too far away to hear you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 bernadette Okay, stop.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 howard Are you kidding me?!
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 bernadette That’s sixty feet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 howard There’s no way this is sixty feet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 bernadette I’m looking at it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 howard You realize this isn’t one of those times I want you to exaggerate how long something is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 leonard Okay, I got to, I, I, I, I got to ask. What makes you think that your relationship is so wonderful and ours isn’t?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 sheldon For starters, we enjoy spending time together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 leonard So do we. And I’ve seen you guys ignore each other for hours doing totally different things.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 sheldon It’s called parallel play.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 leonard Yeah, toddlers do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 sheldon Not as well as we do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 leonard You believe this guy? He has to be the best at everything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 penny So what? Why do you even care?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 sheldon Oh, listen to them. Not even married and the honeymoon’s over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 leonard Whatever. You can’t even go on a date without checking your relationship agreement.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 sheldon If you’ve got a problem basing a relationship on a contract, I’d like to tell you about 13 plucky colonies that entered a relationship agreement called the U.S. Constitution. And it may not be cool to say so, but I think that love affair is still pretty hot today.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 amy It’s a good thing I’m not wearing flag underwear right now, ’cause there’s about to be a fire.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 bernadette Okay, it’s not that hard. You just look to where you want to throw it, step towards where you want to throw, and throw it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 howard That’s your help? That’s like saying here’s how you fly a plane, get in the airplane, know where you want to go and fly it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 bernadette Just throw the ball. Let’s see what we’re working with.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 raj Come on Howard, fire it in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 bernadette Throw the damn ball!
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 amy So when do you guys plan on getting married?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 penny Uh, we’re not sure. But I want to wait long enough to prove to my mother I’m not pregnant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 sheldon May I have one of your fries?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 amy Of course. Can I have a bite of your burger?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 sheldon Absolutely not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 leonard Some perfect couple. He won’t even share his food with her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 sheldon It has avocado on it. She’s allergic to avocado. Are you so jealous of our relationship you want Amy to die?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 leonard I’m not jealous. I just think it’s silly for you to compare relationships like they’re something that can be quantified.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 sheldon Everything is quantifiable. That French fry? A seven. Spider-Man? A nine. The number nine? Oddly, only a four.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 leonard How ridiculous is he?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 penny A hundred.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 leonard Sheldon, you’re just assigning random numbers to things based on your opinion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 sheldon No, I’m not. French fries have three variables, crispiness, saltiness and shape. Which is why a curly fry only gets a two. If I wanted curls for dinner, I’d order a clown wig.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 penny Well, a relationship is more complicated than a French fry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 sheldon Not according to the work of Berscheid, Snyder and Omoto.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 penny Oh, what did those rascals do now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 amy They developed the Relationship Closeness Inventory, which predicts the stability of a couple based on behaviour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 sheldon Yeah, not to be confused with the French Fry Goodness Inventory. That’s pure Cooper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 leonard So, this is accurate?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 sheldon It’s been around for 25 years, and has been extensively corroborated by other researchers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 penny Well, kind of takes the romance out of relationships.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 sheldon Kind of? It does it perfectly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 amy Sheldon and I got an eight-point-two out of ten.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 leonard Fine. We’ll take it right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 penny No, don’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 penny Just don’t take it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 leonard Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 penny ‘Cause it’s stupid. Who cares what number it is?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 leonard Come on. It’ll be fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 penny I said I don’t want you to. I’m getting another drink.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 leonard Sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 amy I’m gonna let you count this as two dates. They’re a lot of work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 bernadette Think he’s getting any better?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 raj Yup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 howard That was a close one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 bernadette Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 raj Is it too late for him to cancel?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 bernadette I think so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 howard Heads up! Watch out!
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 leonard Are you mad at me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 penny No, stop being stupid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 leonard Um, whew? Is this about the test, or is this about us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 penny Look, I don’t need a score on a test to make me worry about something I’m already worried about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 leonard What are you worried about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 penny That we’re engaged and have nothing in common, and it scares me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 leonard Yeah, that scares me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 penny It does?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 leonard Sometimes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 penny Well, that’s not good. You being blindly infatuated with me was the rock we were building this relationship on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 leonard Okay, well, this might make you feel better. Uh, we’re both scared that our marriage will be a disaster, and so, that’s something that we have in common. Also, we both think I’m not funny. Huh? See, you’re not laughing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 mike Hey, Froot Loops, what’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 howard Hey, Mike. Listen, NASA asked me to throw out the first pitch at an Angels game. You got any advice?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 mike Yeah. Don’t do it. What else you up to?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 howard Why shouldn’t I do it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 mike There’s no upside. If you do well, no one cares. And if you screw up, you’re an idiot on YouTube forever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 howard But it’s for a good cause. What about all the kids that’ll be there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 mike That’s what I’m telling you. Kids are the worst. My own daughter tweeted I have a giant nose.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 howard Well, maybe I’ll do a good job.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 mike I don’t know. In space, you couldn’t even toss me a pen, and that was in zero gravity.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 howard Okay, thanks for the pep talk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 mike Anytime, Froot Loops. Give your wife a hug for me. She’s so much cuter than you, I don’t know how you ever got her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 bernadette He’s so nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 penny Hey, sorry about that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 amy No, we’re sorry. We never should have been comparing relationships in the first place.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 sheldon Why? We won. You know, I say, next, we take on Koothrappali and his dog. Really give ourselves a challenge.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 leonard I just want to say one more thing about this. Just because Penny and I are very different people does not mean that we’re a bad couple.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 sheldon The answer is one simple test away. Hmm? You know, it’s like when I thought there was a possum in my closet. Did I sit around wondering? No, I sent Leonard in with a pointy stick and a bag.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 leonard I killed his Chewbacca slippers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 penny Let’s just take the test.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 leonard No, no, no, I don’t want to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 penny Oh, well, ’cause you know we’re gonna do bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 leonard Because it doesn’t matter. I don’t care if we’re a ten or a two.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 sheldon Or a one. A one is possible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 leonard Marriage is scary. You’re scared, I’m scared. But it doesn’t make me not want to do it. It, it just makes me want to hold your hand and do it with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 penny Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 amy It would make me so happy if you said things like that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 sheldon We got an eight-point-two. Trust me, you’re happy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 raj Mmm, I love how they put a waterfall at centre field. It really ties the whole stadium together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 penny Look at you, talking sports.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 leonard This is fun, huh? We get to see our friend throw out the first pitch, have a hot dog, watch the game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 sheldon Whoa. Nobody said anything about watching the game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 amy Sheldon, what did you expect?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 sheldon I expected to see Howard throw the baseball, finish my hot dog, and hightail it across the street to Disneyland just in time for Mickey’s Soundsational Parade.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 amy I’ll tell you what. If we stay, I’ll buy you cotton candy and a bobblehead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 sheldon Who’s the bobblehead of?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 amy Does it matter?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 sheldon No, as long as it bobbles.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 bernadette Howie, I am so proud of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 howard Thanks. I’m proud of me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 man You ready?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 howard Let’s do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 man All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 howard Wish me luck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 bernadette Go get ’em.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 stadium_announcer Ladies and gentlemen, in honour of Space Day at Angel Stadium, the first pitch will be thrown out by NASA astronaut Howard Wolowitz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 howard Thank you. Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 penny Can he really throw a ball?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 leonard On our Quidditch team, he…
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 penny Yeah, that’s a no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 howard I have a message for the young people here today. When I was asked to throw the first pitch, a little voice in my head said I couldn’t do it. So, I practiced and practiced, and you know what? That little voice was right, but then I remembered that I’m not an athlete. I’m a scientist. So, today’s first pitch will be delivered to home plate by science. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, I present to you a working prototype of the Mars Rover. And here’s the wind-up, and the pitch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 bernadette Why is it going so slow?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 howard ‘Cause I’m an idiot who didn’t think this through.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 sheldon Okay, new plan. We go to Disneyland, play hide and seek on Tom Sawyer’s Island, and then come back and see the end of the pitch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 howard Okay, while we’re waiting for the ball to arrive, here’s some fun facts about Mars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 man_in_crowd You suck, Wolowitz!
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 sheldon He makes a valid point.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode03 howard Okay, booing isn’t gonna make it go any faster.
