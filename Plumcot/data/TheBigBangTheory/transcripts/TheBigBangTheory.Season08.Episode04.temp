TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 leonard Have you guys heard about this research team that’s trying to transgenically manipulate chicken DNA to create some sort of chicken dinosaur?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 sheldon Oh, I think that sounds wonderful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 howard What? You’re afraid of both dinosaurs and chickens.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 sheldon Yes, but tell me a dinosaur chicken salad sandwich wouldn’t hit the Mesozoic spot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 raj Hey, guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 howard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 sheldon Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 raj We still on for tomorrow night?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 leonard Yeah. I’m excited to finally meet your girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 sheldon Speaking of which, according to a recent study out of Oxford University, when someone takes on a new romantic partner, that person loses one or two close friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 howard Since when do you read social science?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 sheldon I go to the bathroom like everybody else.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 raj Why would I lose friends just because I started dating someone?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 leonard Yeah, you didn’t lose anyone when you met Amy. Yeah, well, no, this study refers to romantic partners. Not the way I would categorize the two of us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 raj You guys kiss and hold hands.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 leonard I’ve seen him do it. It’s not romantic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 raj Look, I’m not the kind of guy who drops his friends just because he’s in a relationship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 leonard What happens if she doesn’t like us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 raj Well, hey, you’re my dear friends. You’ll get a Christmas card for a couple of years, and then you’re dead to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 amy So, Howard, is Stuart still living with your mom?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 howard I don’t want to talk about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 bernadette But he’s going to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 howard My mom got him cable. In my whole life, growing up in that house, no cable. Do you know how many HBOs that leech had my mother get him? Seven. Seven HBOs. Seven.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 bernadette Long story short, they have seven HBOs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 raj Hey, guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 sheldon Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 raj Emily, you know almost everybody here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 emily Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 raj And this is Leonard, this is Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 emily Oh, it’s so nice to meet you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 leonard Nice to finally meet you, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 emily Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 leonard Wow, Raj, you were not lying about her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 raj I told you she exists.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny Hey, I hear you’re a dermatologist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 emily Uh, yeah, I’m a resident at Huntington Hospital.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 sheldon Oh, I like their emergency room. Yeah, even if it turns out you don’t have Dengue fever, they still let you take a lollipop.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 bernadette You know, Penny just started training to be a pharmaceutical sales rep. Maybe she can practice on you some time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny Oh, it would be great to practice on a real doctor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 emily Yeah. I’m sure that’d be fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 sheldon I have some odd freckles on my buttocks. Can I make an appointment for you to look at them?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 emily Um, okay, I guess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 amy I’m with him three years, nothing. She’s with him two minutes, and he’s taking his pants off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 bernadette Last night was fun. What did you think of Emily?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny I don’t know. I kind of got the sense she didn’t like me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 bernadette Did she say she didn’t like you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny Of course not. No one ever says they don’t like you straight to your face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 amy We have led different lives.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 bernadette You guys just met. Why would she feel that way?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny It’s just this vibe I got.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 bernadette I’m sure you’re worried about nothing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny Yeah. You’re probably right. I used to think my high school P.E. teacher didn’t like me, but it turned out, she liked me a little too much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 bernadette Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny Yeah. It was fine. We went to a Melissa Etheridge concert, I got an A, it all worked out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 bernadette When you go to Emily’s office to practice, you’ll see. It’s fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny Yeah, I hope you’re right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 amy You really went your entire life without anyone saying I hate you to your face?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 amy I’d say it now, but look at those cheekbones.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 sheldon I miss Stuart’s place. All this loud music and exposed brick. What, is this a comic book store, or a rave at the third little pig’s house?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 howard Yep, I wish Stuart would reopen. I hate this place, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 leonard Okay, him I believe because he’s an 80-year-old man in a 15-year-old’s tee shirt. But you’re just upset about Stuart and your mom and all their HBOs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 howard Yes, I am. You know, I can’t even watch Game of Thrones now without thinking of mother saying, Stuart, which one is Thrones?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 raj You know, he might not reopen. He didn’t get a lot of money from the insurance company.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 sheldon Oh, boy, if there is one thing that gets my goat, it’s those dad-gum insurance companies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 leonard Why? Because they won’t get off your lawn? Is Stuart trying to get a loan, or, or find investors?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 howard All I know is, he’s got my mother buying four-ply toilet paper. I mean, four-ply. If his butt is so delicate, why doesn’t he just use an angora rabbit?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 sheldon For starters, they shed and bite.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 leonard Hey, here’s a thought. Why don’t we put up the rest of the money that Stuart needs?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 raj So, we’d be, like, owners of a comic book store?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 leonard It’s kind of a dream come true.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 howard That does sound fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 raj Ooh, maybe we could come up with a business plan to compete with this place.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 sheldon I’ll give you a plan right now. Step one, open comic book store. Step two, start rumour this comic book store gives you genital warts. Step three, buy a big bag to put the money in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 leonard It’s not that bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 emily Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny Thank you so much for letting me practice my sales pitch on you. I really appreciate it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 emily Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny Um, I brought coffee. I wasn’t sure what you like, so I got a regular, a cappuccino and a Chai tea. Since you like Raj, I thought you might be into that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 emily Thanks. If we could get started. I’m a little busy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny Oh, yeah, sure. Let me just get out my materials. Leonard gave me this briefcase. He used to carry it around in high school. You can still see the dent where they whacked him with it. Okay, I would like to talk to you about our new birth control pill, Femevra.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 emily Great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny So, Femevra’s triphasic design provides balanced hormonal exposure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 emily All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny It has also been shown to cause significantly fewer side effects than other oral contraceptives. Although it can cause acne, which, if you ask me, kind of increases its effectiveness as a contraceptive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 emily Funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny Okay, I’m sorry. Did we get off on the wrong foot? Because since the other night, I kind of feel like you might have a problem with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 emily No, it’s fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny Are you sure, because it doesn’t seem fine?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 emily Okay. If you really want to talk about this, I do have a problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny Oh, my God. Tell me, what did I do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 emily Look, it’s nothing. It’s just, Raj told me that a while ago, you two hooked up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny What? Oh, why would he say that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 emily Did it not happen?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny Well, I wouldn’t exactly call it a hook-up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 emily Did you kiss?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 emily Were you naked?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 emily So, it was a hook-up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny No. Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 sheldon So, what are some ways we could set our comic book store apart from the competition?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 leonard Oh, kids buy comic books. It would be great to figure out a way to get more kids in the store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 howard You know, when I was a kid, I loved going there, but I could never get a ride.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 raj Ooh, what if we got a van and drove around and picked kids up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 sheldon Nice. You mean, like at parks and schools?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 howard Toy stores, puppet shows.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 leonard Hold on. So, your idea is to get a van and cruise the streets looking for kids to pick up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 sheldon Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 leonard And are you gonna use candy to lure them in?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 raj We are now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny You told Emily we hooked up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 raj Um, well, in my defence, I tell everybody.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny Why would you say that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 raj We were having a conversation about past lovers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny We weren’t lovers. Come on. Everyone knows we didn’t sleep together. We got drunk and fooled around. Why couldn’t you just leave me out of it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 raj Well, we were being honest. You would leave me out of the conversation with the next guy if you dumped Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 leonard Why say it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 raj Well, I would never leave you off my list, and not just because, without you, we’re playing fast and loose with the word list.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny Well, good job. Now she hates me. Ugh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 raj Great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 sheldon On the bright side, that Oxford study was right. One friend down. I wonder who you’re going to lose next.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 raj You, okay? It’s you. You’re, you’re next.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 sheldon No. You’re crazy about me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny I don’t know what Emily’s so upset about anyway. Even if I had slept with him, so what? Everyone has a past.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 amy Hmm-hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny Almost everyone has a past.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 bernadette Come on, look how pretty you are. I’m sure this isn’t the first girl to hate you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny It’s not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 bernadette And I’m sure you can turn it around.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny How? You can’t force someone to like you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 amy What if you just hang around and act like her friend until you wear her down? I mean, next thing you know, you’re in her home, you’re eating her food, drinking her wine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny No, that won’t work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 amy You’re right. Cheers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 bernadette Oh, I know. Why don’t you use your sales training to go back down there and sell yourself?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 bernadette Yeah. But instead of selling a drug, you’d be selling Penny. it’s cute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny It’s stupid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 bernadette Well, maybe people would like you more if you didn’t crap all over their ideas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 amy I’m gonna go with Penny on this one. Then again, why wouldn’t I? I mean, we go way back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny Oh, my God. I didn’t used to like you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 amy Shh. Amy’s here now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 sheldon You know, the more I think about it, the more intrigued I am about having our own store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 howard We’ll get to see all the new stuff before it hits the shelves.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 sheldon And we’ll get to have fun interactions with our customers. Like, this isn’t a library, buy it or get out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 howard You say things like that all the time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 sheldon Yes, but as a store owner, I’ll finally have a good comeback to, You don’t work here, shut up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 leonard Uh, do you know how Penny told Raj he should have left her off his list?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 howard Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 leonard Well, do you think when she and I had that conversation, she left people off her list?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 sheldon I’m sure she did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 leonard Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 sheldon Because if she hadn’t, she’d still be wading through the list.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 leonard Will you stay out of this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 sheldon If only Penny had said that once in a while.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 howard Hey, what difference does it make? You’re the one she wants to marry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 leonard That’s true.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 howard Yeah, and I’m not sure that complete honesty is always the best thing for a relationship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 sheldon Yeah, he’s right. Once, in a moment of candour, I told Amy that her hair reminded me of a duck caught in an oil spill. She stormed out. Which was sad, because we were playing Scrabble, and I had all the letters to spell persimmon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 leonard Why are you even part of this conversation? You don’t know anything about women.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 sheldon I know that if I had a wife or a fiancée, I’d ask her first before I invested money in a comic book store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 howard He’s right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 sheldon Yeah, well, of course I am. I was also right about her hair. It did everything but quack.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 leonard There’s something I wanted to run past you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny What’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 leonard Mm, the guys and I were thinking about investing in Stuart’s comic book store. Is that okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny Why are you asking me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 leonard Well, you know, we’re engaged, and it’s kind of a big deal financially. It seems like something we should talk about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny Oh. Well, would you consider mounds of credit card debt kind of a big deal financially?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 leonard Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny Huh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 howard Mm. So, me and the guys were talking about this great investment opportunity.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 bernadette Nope.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 howard But you didn’t hear what it was.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 bernadette I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 howard Oh, come on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 bernadette Fine. What is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 howard It’s to help reopen the comic book store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 bernadette Nope.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 howard Well, hear me out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 bernadette Howard, you know we’re saving up for a house.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 howard I know, but all the guys are doing it. We’re splitting it four ways, so it’s really not that much money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 bernadette It just seems like a risky investment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 howard I get that. I, okay, look, the real reason this is important is, before my dad left me and my mom, he used to take me to the comic book store. It was one of the few things we did together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 bernadette Oh. Howie, I had no idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 howard Well, I don’t like to talk about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 bernadette Oh, baby. That story’s made up, isn’t it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 howard That’s how much buying a comic book store means to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 sheldon I’d like your honest opinion on something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 amy Of course.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 sheldon Now, before I start, I need you to know that I’m very excited about this, and anything you say that isn’t enthusiastically supportive will throw our entire relationship into question. So, keep an open mind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 amy I’m feeling a little backed into a corner, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 sheldon Perfect. Now, I’m considering investing in Stuart’s comic book store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 amy Interesting. Can you see how a grown man, an accomplished scientist, who invests in a store that sells picture books about flying men in colourful underwear might be wasting both his financial and intellectual resources?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 sheldon No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 amy Then I think it’s a terrific idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 sheldon Great. Wait till you hear about our van.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 raj Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 raj Thanks for inviting us over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny Oh, thank you for coming.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 emily Uh, listen, Penny, before you start, I just want to apologise for being so rude the other day in my office.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny No, no. No need to apologise.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 raj Excuse me, can I say something? I just love both you guys, and I want you to get along. And when I say love I meant as a friend. And, uh, way too soon, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny Okay, sit down. Listen, Emily, what happened between me and Raj was a long time ago.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 raj It was, and I may have made it seem like a bigger deal than I should have.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny Yeah, and Leonard and I are engaged now, and I’m just hoping we can put this whole thing behind us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 emily Mm. I’d like that, too. Yeah, I thought I’d be okay with it, but then I saw how pretty you are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny Oh, that’s so sweet. I mean, look at you, you are gorgeous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 raj It’s true, you’re both gorgeous. Kind of says something about the man who could bed you both. You get why I’ve been alone most of my adult life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 stuart So, what brings you by?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 howard Well, I don’t need a reason, it’s my house.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 stuart Technically, it’s your mom’s house, but we certainly want you to feel welcome.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 howard I’m always welcome.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 stuart Mm, just try and call first.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 bernadette Okay, let’s get down to business. Howie was thinking about putting up some money to help you reopen the store, but before that happens, I have a few questions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 stuart Oh. I appreciate the offer, but actually your mother already gave me the money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 howard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 stuart Yeah. I told her it was too much, but she said she was happy to help out her bubala.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 howard Excuse me. Ma, you are cancelling that cheque, and Stuart is not your bubala, I’m your bubala. You can’t have more than one bubala.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 stuart I don’t know who he’s talking to. She’s at Target, buying me shirts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 raj I’m so glad we could work this all out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny Yeah, me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 emily You know, we should have dinner one night with you and Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny Oh, we would love that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 raj Great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny Okay, good night, guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 emily All right, night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 penny Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 emily_and_penny I hate her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 raj I’m really disappointed we’re not gonna have our own comic book store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 leonard I know. I was looking forward to it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 sheldon It would’ve been so nice to have a place that was ours, where we could just sit and read comics in peace.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 howard With comfy seats.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 raj And snacks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 sheldon Well, I guess it was too good to be true.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode04 leonard Yeah.
