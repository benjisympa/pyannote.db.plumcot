TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 raj Hey, I read that someone invented a way to convert your footsteps into electromagnetic energy so you can charge your cell phone while walking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 leonard We had that idea years ago. How come we never did anything with it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 howard Probably because we left the diagram of it in the restaurant, and none of us wanted to walk back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 sheldon I know the real reason you never made progress with that idea. You thought of it September 22nd, 2007. Two days later, Penny moved in, and so much blood rushed to your genitals, your brain became a ghost town.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 leonard That’s not what happened.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 sheldon I remember it distinctly because I had just composed my annual poem commemorating the anniversary of Dr. Seuss’s death.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 howard No one wants to hear it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 sheldon Why, die. Why did he die? Old, told. I was told he was old.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 leonard Penny is not the reason I didn’t pursue that idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 sheldon Oh, really? Since meeting her, what have been your greatest accomplishments?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 raj Easy. Sleeping with Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 howard Getting Penny to go back out with him after she dumped him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 raj Tricking Penny into getting engaged.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 howard And a few weeks ago, he almost did a pull-up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 leonard I think someone owes me an apology.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 sheldon Well, don’t feel bad. I think we’ve all been distracted since the girls entered our lives.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 howard You admit Amy’s a distraction?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 sheldon Oh, very much so. Listen to this. This is from two days ago. Hi. Hope you’re having a good day. Who has time for this constant sexting?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 leonard Well, maybe we have lost our focus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 howard It wouldn’t kill us to get together and brainstorm ideas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 raj Ooh, we could have one of those retreats.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 leonard Like our own science retreat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 howard My cousin has a cabin out in the woods.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 sheldon I’m not going to a cabin in the woods. Did you see the movie Cabin in the Woods?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 leonard Then we’ll go to a hotel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 sheldon A hotel? Did you see The Shining?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 raj We could go up to Big Bear and get a house on the lake.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 sheldon Did you see The Lake House?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 raj Nothing bad happens in The Lake House.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 sheldon Yeah, well, no, not to them. To me. Time traveling mailbox. The only time that traveled was an hour and half of my life down the toilet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 leonard Fine. Then we’ll just stay here and do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 sheldon Well, you didn’t suggest a beach house.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 leonard You would go to a beach house?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 sheldon Well, good Lord, no, have you seen Jaws?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 penny Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 leonard Hey. So, the guys and I are talking about having kind of a science retreat this weekend. I just wanted to know if that’s okay. You and I had talked about going to brunch on Sunday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 penny Want to go to Vegas this weekend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 amy Of course I do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 penny Bernadette? Girl’s weekend. Vegas. You in?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 bernadette Hell, yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 penny Yes. I’ll check flights.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 bernadette I’ll check hotels.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 amy I’ll check my underpants. I’m so excited, I think I peed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 leonard They seem okay with it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 raj Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 leonard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 howard Hey. I didn’t think you’d make it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 raj Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 howard Well, ’cause you have a steady girlfriend now, and we assumed you’d have to stay home to lower the food down to her in the pit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 raj For your information, Emily is working tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 sheldon Yeah, one would assume, on getting out of the pit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 leonard Okay, let’s focus. The girls are gone, we have 48 hours. There are no distractions. Let’s change the world.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 sheldon Thinking caps on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 howard Here we go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 raj Ooh, this is exciting. We’re innovating. I feel like we’re in the Facebook movie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 howard Oh. I never saw that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 sheldon Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 raj Oh. It’s wonderful, and I swear I’m not saying that because Justin Timberlake is in it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 sheldon Yeah, I have it on Blu-ray. We should watch it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 raj Cool. I’ll make the popcorn.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 leonard Guys, in 30 seconds, we went from let’s change the world to let’s watch TV.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 sheldon I’m sorry. Is that a no?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 howard Okay. No. Leonard’s right. We’re here to focus. Didn’t we used to have a list of all our ideas?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 leonard I, I think I still have it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 sheldon I did not get a clear answer. I’m gonna set this down now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 leonard Ah, here it is. Whoa. I haven’t looked at these in years. Robot girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 howard Mm, that was mine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 leonard Robot prostitute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 howard Also mine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 sheldon Wait. I’m confused. Why would you need both a robot girlfriend and a robot prostitute?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 howard There’s just some things you don’t do with your robot girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 raj Boy, when you met Bernadette, the field of robotics really took a hit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 leonard Okay, let’s just skip all the inventions you can have sex with. All right, no, here we go, ergonomic heated seat cushion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 howard No, it vibrates. Keep going.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 leonard You know, let’s just come up with something new.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 sheldon You know, a number of significant innovations have been inspired by science fiction. The, the geosynchronous satellite from Arthur C. Clarke. The Motorola flip phone, that came from Star Trek. And I’ve long suspected that the idea of an African-American president was stolen from the movie Deep Impact.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 raj Hey, the future they show in Back to the Future II is only a year away. A lot of the things in that movie haven’t been invented yet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 leonard How cool would that be if we could make one of those a reality?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 sheldon If we could figure out the scientific basis for Marty’s hover board, that would have universal application.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 leonard Well, it’s, it’s possible at absolute zero, but we would have to remove the temperature restrictions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 raj Oh, I have an idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 sheldon I think I have the same one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 howard We got to watch Back to the Future II.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 raj I’ll make the popcorn.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 penny So, where should we go first?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 amy Ooh. There’s a cover band in the lounge.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 penny Nah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 amy But they play Barry Manilow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 amy But they’re called Fairly Manilow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 penny Oh. Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 amy Great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 bernadette Well, what do you want to do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 penny Well, we’re in Vegas. I want to go downstairs, get a bucket of margaritas, dance until I vomit all over a roulette wheel and watch it go everywhere.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 amy What if we don’t want to vomit?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 penny Oh, you will. That’s why they give you the bucket. Uh-oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 amy What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 penny It’s my boss. They moved my field ride up to Monday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 amy What does that mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 penny It means instead of having a week to study, I only have two days.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 bernadette That sucks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 amy Can you start in the morning?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 penny Uh, it’s kind of a lot. You know, let me do a little tonight, and I’ll catch up with you guys later.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 bernadette You sure?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 penny Yeah, it’s okay. Go ahead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 amy So, um, now that Penny’s not coming…
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 bernadette We’re not seeing Fairly Manilow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 amy Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 howard Hold on. Pause. Something doesn’t make sense. Look, in 2015, Biff steals the sports almanac and takes the time machine back to 1955, to give it to his younger self. But as soon as he does that, he changes the future, so the 2015 he returns to would be a different 2015, not the 2015 that Marty and Doc were in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 leoanard This is Hot Tub Time Machine all over again. If future Biff goes back to 2015 right after he gives young Biff the almanac, he could get back to the 2015 with Marty and Doc in it. Because it wasn’t until his 21st birthday that 1955 Biff placed his first bet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 sheldon Wait. Whoa, whoa. Is placed right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 leonard What do you mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 sheldon Is placed the right tense for something that would have happened in the future of a past that was affected by something from the future?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 leonard Had will have placed?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 sheldon That’s my boy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 leonard Okay, so, it wasn’t until his 21st birthday that Biff had will have placed his first bet and made his millions. That’s when he altered the timeline.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 sheldon Yeah, but he had will haven’t placed it!
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 howard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 sheldon Unlike Hot Tub Time Machine, this couldn’t be more simple. When Biff gets the almanac in 1955, the alternate future he creates isn’t the one in which Marty and Doc Brown ever use the time machine to travel to 2015. Therefore, in the new timeline, Marty and Doc never brought the time machine…
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 leonard Wait. Is brought right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 sheldon Marty and Doc never had have had brought?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 leonard I don’t know. You did it to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 sheldon Oh, I’m going with it. Marty and Doc never had have had brought the time machine to 2015. That means 2015 Biff could also not had have had brought the almanac to 1955 Biff. Therefore, the timeline in which 1955 Biff gets the almanac is also the timeline in which 1955 Biff never gets the almanac. And not just never gets. Never have, never hasn’t, never had have hasn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 raj He’s right. Also, what kind of name is Biff? Sounds like when you pop open a can of Pillsbury dough. Biff.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 howard Oh, that stuff is so good wrapped around cocktail weenies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 leonard Guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 sheldon Do you know that the word wiener comes from the German name of the Austrian capital Vienna, or Wien?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 raj Do you know if you look at Austria on a map it actually looks like a wiener?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 leonard Guys, what are we doing? We sent the girls away so we could focus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 sheldon I don’t think it worked.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 amy Maybe after this, you’ll be in the mood for some Manilow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 bernadette I think after this, I’ll be dead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 amy Look at us out, while Penny’s in the room studying.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 bernadette I’m proud of her. This is a great opportunity. It’s nice to see her take it seriously.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 amy It is. But enough about Penny. Let’s talk about us. We’re looking good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 bernadette We are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 amy Better than good. I mean, look at you. Your body’s bangin’.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 bernadette Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 amy Don’t Amy me. We’re always talking about how hot Penny is. Come on, scientist to scientist, how big are those Hadron Colliders?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 bernadette You’re embarrassing me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 amy Oh, don’t be embarrassed. I’ll show you the divot in my spine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 bernadette What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 amy No, no, it’s okay. I was born with it. If you put a double-A battery in there, it makes my leg kick.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 leonard All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 sheldon Oh, this is already better. There are far fewer distractions in here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 raj Plus, this is where our minds are conditioned to focus on work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 leonard So, I’ve been thinking about the hover boards, and maybe there’s a way we could use Maglev technology.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 howard Or if we could figure out a way to supercool the materials, we could utilize quantum coupling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 sheldon Well, I wonder if anyone’s tried that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 raj Go online and look it up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 howard Oh, I can’t argue with him. It’s right there on the screen. Austria does look like a wiener.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 raj That’s nothing, dude. Go check out how hung Florida is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 leonard I’m sure Mrs. Florida’s walking funny. Can we get back to work?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 sheldon Yeah, he’s right. Oh, here’s a thought. What if we use some form of operant conditioning techniques to keep us from getting off topic?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 howard Like behavior modification?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 sheldon Yeah, exactly. Did you know those techniques were used to actually teach pigeons to play ping-pong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 raj That cannot be true.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 raj Hey, it was match point.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 leonard Some psychologists perform operant conditioning with punishment. Maybe we can come up with a punishment for straying off topic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 raj Not getting to see who wins at pigeon ping-pong comes to mind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 howard We could snap a rubber band on our wrists every time we get sidetracked.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 sheldon Mmm, not bad. You know, in medieval times, idle chatter was punished with a device called the scold’s bridle. It’s an iron cage that’s locked around the head and pierces the tongue.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 leonard If only we had one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 sheldon Oh, I’ll check Amazon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 bernadette Housekeeping.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 amy We had a complaint about somebody pooping on a party in there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 bernadette It was us the whole time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 amy Why’d you tell her? It was working.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 bernadette Was it working?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 penny Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 bernadette Oh, I’m so sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 penny You guys look like you’re having fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 amy We’re having the best time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 bernadette Guess who won a hundred dollars playing craps.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 penny That’s a dollar.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 bernadette Then guess who wildly overtipped a cocktail waitress.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 amy Hey, Penny, hey, let’s go. We found a place that has Australian male strippers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 bernadette We want to see if they twirl their junk in the other direction.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 penny That sounds so great. But I have a little more studying to do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 amy Can you believe this nerd?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode05 bernadette Come on.
