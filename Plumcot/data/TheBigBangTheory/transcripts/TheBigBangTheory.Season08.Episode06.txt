TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 bernadette_rostenkowski I like your suit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 penny Oh, thanks. Got a couple new outfits for work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 howard_wolowitz How does it feel knowing your fiancée’s job is to go out and flirt with doctors, looking like that, while you sit here, you know, looking like this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter She doesn’t flirt with doctors.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 penny Yeah. It’s all very professional.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 amy_farrah_fowler You know when you bend over, I can see down your shirt?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 penny Okay, good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 bernadette_rostenkowski Speaking of new careers, how are things going with dark matter, Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Oh, yeah, I’d have to say it’s the most exiting time in the history of the field.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh. What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 sheldon_cooper I started doing it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 raj_koothrappali You know, the government funded the biggest experiment yet to detect dark matter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I’ve read about that, they’re sending research teams down into abandoned salt mines.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 raj_koothrappali You know, Sheldon, if we apply to be one of those teams, we could be on the ground floor of something big, not just for theoretical physics but for astrophysics as well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 penny Wait, hang on, you guys are gonna work in a mine?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 penny You had a panic attack when we went through the car wash.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Perhaps the emotion you’re referring to was shock at you having something cleaned.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter I think what Penny meant is, the thought of you two in a mine is kind of funny, it’s like a cat riding a Roomba.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 bernadette_rostenkowski Maybe they could ride around in one of those mine carts that go ee-oo-ee-oo-ee-oo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, it’ll help them get away when they see a g-g-ghost.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 raj_koothrappali Yup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 sheldon_cooper I miss the old days when I couldn’t tell.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter So, one of my favourite video games of all time is called Shadow of the Colossus, and it was only for PlayStation 2, but then they came out with a new version for PS3 with better graphics. I finally got the chance to play it, and for some reason, it just wasn’t as good as the first one. Or something about yoga.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 penny I’m sorry, I was thinking about work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Well, I was just saying that there was this video game…
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 penny Yeah, that’s when I started thinking about work. Uh, listen, I’ve got some good news.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 penny This is for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Huh. What is this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 penny Well, you know how they gave me the company car? Didn’t make sense to have two, so I sold the other one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter The one I gave you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 penny Yeah. And there’s your money back, and now we’re even. How great is that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Uh, yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Nothing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 penny Oh, come on, Leonard, I know the car was a thoughtful gesture and I really appreciate it, but it doesn’t make sense to have both.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter You’re right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 penny What should I have done? Taken a picture of us in the car and put it in a pink frame with puffy paint around it that says best fiancé ever?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Doesn’t sound that bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 penny Well, good, because that’s what I did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Aw, oh, thank you. That is so sweet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 penny Well, it’s not that sweet, I paid for the frame with your money and then got a massage.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter You know what, you don’t have to give me this. You keep it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 penny Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter The car was a gift, it was something you needed. I was happy to help you out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 penny And I really appreciate it, but now I don’t need it, so here you go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Well, this is silly, so you don’t need the car, but you could use it to buy yourself something else, like a new purse to put all this money in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 penny Sweetie, I can buy my own stuff. I have a good job now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter I know, and I’m proud of you, but that doesn’t mean I can’t do something nice. Like this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 penny Okay, I don’t want this to turn into a fight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter I don’t, either.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 penny Great. Thank you. Can you pass the salt, please?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Sure. In my mind, that broke the tension with comedy and led to sex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 raj_koothrappali Hey, Sheldon, you busy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 sheldon_cooper I’m always busy. This mind is capable of advanced multitasking. You know, currently, I’m attempting to solve the Penrose conjecture, I’m composing my Nobel acceptance speech for when I’ve solved the Penrose conjecture, and I’m wondering how mermaids have babies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 raj_koothrappali Don’t they lay eggs on a rock?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Now I’ve got room for another thing. What do you want?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 raj_koothrappali So, I did a little research on what the conditions are like in the mines, and the guys might be right, sounds pretty rough down there. For starters, it’s very humid, and about a hundred degrees.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Well, I’m from Texas and you’re from India, we’re no strangers to the fragrant armpit. Next.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 raj_koothrappali It’s also a live mine, so there’ll be dynamite explosions going off in the distance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Yeah, I have a lactose intolerant roommate with a taste for ice cream. Next.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 raj_koothrappali Oh, you have to be down there for 12 hours at a time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Yeah? We have to be somewhere.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 raj_koothrappali Well, there’s no toilets, we’ll have to do our business in a bucket.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 sheldon_cooper So it’s settled, we’re not doing it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 raj_koothrappali Look, I get it, but before we pass up on an incredible opportunity, I was thinking about when Howard was training to go to space, they put him in a simulated environment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Interesting. You’re suggesting that we recreate the conditions of the mine to see if we can handle it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 raj_koothrappali Exactly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Very well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 raj_koothrappali So where should we do it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Well, I’ll just Google hot, dark and moist, see what comes up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 raj_koothrappali Uh, Sheldon…
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Oh, there, well, look, there’s all kinds of videos.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Hey, you got a sec?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 penny Hi. Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter I was hoping we could talk about the money again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 penny Oh, sweetie, just forget about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter No, no, no, no, hear me out. I know things got a little weird last night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 penny Well, leaving an envelope full of cash on my dresser after sex would count as weird.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Well, I think I came up with a pretty good solution.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 penny Mm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Why don’t we just put the money in a joint account? It’ll be our first money together. We can use it for the wedding, the honeymoon, whatever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 penny You know what, that’s great. I love that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, of course you do, I’m not just a genius in bed. You sure are, baby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 penny You two want to be alone?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter I want you to know I get why you don’t want the money, you’ve got this new job, you’re excited about being financially independent, and I am nothing but proud of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 penny Oh, thank you so much. It feels so good to hear you say that. And I want you to know that I get this job kind of changes the balance in our relationship, and I’m trying to be sensitive to that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 penny Well, I just think that maybe you’re a little hung up on the money because I’m less reliant on you now, and that’s a little scary.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Hmm. Maybe. Or maybe I tried to do something nice and maybe you had a problem with it because of your control issues.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 penny Control issues?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Maybe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 penny Or, maybe now that I’m no longer an out-of-work actress who can’t pay for her own dinner, that makes you a little insecure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Well, I can’t believe you’d say that. You know how insecure I am about my insecurities.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 penny You know what? I’m sorry. It’s stupid to fight over money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I’m sorry, too. We’re about to share the rest of our lives together. It’s our money, who cares who has it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 penny Ugh, You’re right, who cares? Mm. Get that money out of my back pocket or I will break your fingers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 raj_koothrappali Huh. All this time I never knew there were steam tunnels down here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 amy_farrah_fowler Most universities have them. When I was an undergrad, I spent three days in one pledging a sorority.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 raj_koothrappali Did you get in?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 amy_farrah_fowler No. They forgot I was there. But it really opened up my pores.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Well, according to my research, the steam tunnels below this access point should be the closest analog to the mines.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 raj_koothrappali This is gonna be so much more accurate than the steam room at the gym.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Plus, there’s almost no chance we’ll see any of our coworkers half naked.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 raj_koothrappali Or totally naked. I love Howard, but the dude needs a little shame.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 sheldon_cooper All right, Amy, this walkie-talkie is yours. If we run into any problems, I’ll contact you. And if anything bad happens, what’s the rule?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 amy_farrah_fowler Save you first; come back for Raj only if there’s time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 raj_koothrappali We’re going to be fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, I’m really impressed you’re willing to try this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Well, admittedly, this brushes up against my well-known aversions to heat, small places, going below floor-level, dampness, hatches, ladders, darkness, echoes, and eliminating in Home Depot buckets. That last one is quite new, but I have a feeling that’s gonna rocket to the top of the list.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 raj_koothrappali I’m sweating already.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Yeah, as the person beneath you, allow me to say, I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 raj_koothrappali How hot is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Uh, let’s see. 704? No, wait, it’s on clock. Uh, the real answer isn’t much better. 102 degrees.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 raj_koothrappali Well, that’s what we wanted. This is as hot as the mines will be.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 sheldon_cooper True. Sheldon’s Mine Simulation Log, entry one. Koothrappali’s restating of the obvious is already getting on my nerves.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Thanks again for having us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 howard_wolowitz Oh, of course. What did you guys want to talk about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 penny Well, you know, now that we’re engaged, we had some questions about how you handle money as a couple.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 bernadette_rostenkowski I told you they weren’t gonna ask us to swing with them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 howard_wolowitz I didn’t think they were going to. I just wanted to have a way to say no without hurting Leonard’s feelings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Well, nailed it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 howard_wolowitz So what did you want to know?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 penny Well, do you guys ever fight over money?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 bernadette_rostenkowski Sure, sometimes. I mean, it can be a little awkward since I make so much more money than Howie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 howard_wolowitz You didn’t have to say so much more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 bernadette_rostenkowski Well, I didn’t have to, but for the sake of accuracy I felt that I should.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 howard_wolowitz I brought a lot of significant assets into the relationship, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 bernadette_rostenkowski Like what? Your incomplete set of Star Trek collector plates?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 howard_wolowitz For your information, I just bought the last one I needed on eBay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 bernadette_rostenkowski Without asking me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 howard_wolowitz There were only three minutes left in the auction and it was a mint condition Scotty from a smoke-free home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 bernadette_rostenkowski How much, Howie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 howard_wolowitz Not a lot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 bernadette_rostenkowski How much?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 howard_wolowitz Let’s not talk about this in front of our friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 bernadette_rostenkowski Was it more or less than falconry school?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 howard_wolowitz For the tenth time, that was a Groupon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Like I would swing with him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 raj_koothrappali How you feeling?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Good. Little claustrophobic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 raj_koothrappali Let’s set up the equipment. It’ll help take your mind off of it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Miners often sang mining songs to keep their spirits up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 raj_koothrappali Do you know any mining songs?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Just the hits. Where it’s dark as a dungeon, and it’s damp as the dew.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 raj_koothrappali That’s pretty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Where the dangers are double, and the pleasures are few. Where the rain never falls and the sun never shines, yes, it’s dark as a dungeon way down in the mine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 raj_koothrappali It’s a little more bleak than I thought.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Well, I pray when I’m dead and the ages shall roll, that my body will blacken and turn into coal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 raj_koothrappali Getting kind of grim.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Then I’ll look from the door of my heavenly home, and pity the miner that mines my poor bones.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 raj_koothrappali Okay. How ’bout a little Miley Cyrus next?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Who’s he?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 howard_wolowitz Talk about wasted money. What about the late fees on our credit card because somebody didn’t pay the bill on time?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 bernadette_rostenkowski Well, maybe I would have paid it if I wasn’t also doing everything else around here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 howard_wolowitz Oh, you’re saying I don’t do anything around here. Look at my chore chart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter She made him a chore chart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 penny I see it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 howard_wolowitz Do the dishes. There’s a star right there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 bernadette_rostenkowski That was a pity star. Putting water in the roasting pan and leaving it in the sink is not doing the dishes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 howard_wolowitz That pan had to soak and you know it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 bernadette_rostenkowski Well, don’t come crying to me when you don’t get your allowance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 howard_wolowitz It’s not an allowance. It’s a stipend, and we said we weren’t gonna call it an allowance in front of my friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter I usually don’t like lemon bars, but these, these are really good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 raj_koothrappali So, as Hannah Montana, Miley was a world-famous pop star. But then she would take off her wig and go to school like a normal girl. Which, I don’t have to tell you, at that age, is its own headache.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 sheldon_cooper That’s preposterous. How would she go unrecognized just by wearing a wig?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 raj_koothrappali But you’re okay with Superman concealing his identity with a pair of glasses?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 sheldon_cooper He doesn’t just put on a pair of glasses. He combs back his curlicue and affects a mild-mannered personality.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 amy_farrah_fowler You guys doing okay down there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 sheldon_cooper I told you to use the walkie-talkie!
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 amy_farrah_fowler You guys doing okay down there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Please keep this channel clear for emergencies. Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 amy_farrah_fowler I’m going to the vending machine. Do you want anything?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 sheldon_cooper This is a simulation. We have to survive on the supplies we brought.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 amy_farrah_fowler Okay, just checking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 raj_koothrappali We should have asked her to get some Funyuns.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 sheldon_cooper You’re not going to have Funyuns when we’re a mile below the surface of the Earth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 raj_koothrappali What if we brought them down with us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 sheldon_cooper We’ll take some Funyuns.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 amy_farrah_fowler Anything else?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Some York Peppermint Patties, a couple of Dr. Peppers, and run to Best Buy and see if they have a portable DVD player and season one of a show called Hannah Montana.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 raj_koothrappali Have her get season two. Season one, it was still finding itself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 bernadette_rostenkowski Sorry you guys had to see that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 penny Oh, don’t apologize.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Yeah. It just makes it a lot harder to pretend it never happened.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 bernadette_rostenkowski Money’s a sensitive subject for Howie because of the difference in our income.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 penny It really bothers him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 bernadette_rostenkowski Well, sure. There’s still a lot of pressure on guys to be providers. So even though he’s happy for me, it’s just a little tough on him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 penny Uh-oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 penny Well, if I do well in sales, I could end up making a lot more money than you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Not a problem. I grew up with a mother who emasculated my father financially and in every other aspect of his life, so really, it’s what I think love looks like.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 bernadette_rostenkowski I’ll be right back. I’m gonna go check on him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 penny Maybe it’s a good thing we came here. It’s like a lesson in what not to do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Yeah I don’t want something dumb like money to come between us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 penny It won’t. Let’s just promise to figure this kind of stuff out before we get married.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 howard_wolowitz Why are you being so bossy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 bernadette_rostenkowski Why are you being a baby?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 howard_wolowitz I’m not a baby. I’m a grown man, and I made the bed. Now where’s my star?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 leonard_hofstadter Should we go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 penny Hang on. I want to see if he gets the star.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 raj_koothrappali Oh, this heat is brutal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 sheldon_cooper As someone from the tropical subcontinent of India, you should know that fanning yourself in a humid environment only raises your body temperature.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 raj_koothrappali Huh. That does explain why the servants used to look so hot while they were fanning me. Let’s get our minds off how uncomfortable we are. We could take some more simulated instrument readings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 sheldon_cooper My major focus at the moment is keeping my claustrophobia at bay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 raj_koothrappali How’s that going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 sheldon_cooper You tell me. I feel like I can’t breathe, and I am tempted to crack you open and suck the air right out of your lungs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 raj_koothrappali Sheldon, if this is too much, we can stop.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 sheldon_cooper We’re not stopping.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 raj_koothrappali You don’t have to bite my head off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 sheldon_cooper I apologize. I just, I’m plagued by an internal struggle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 raj_koothrappali If you would just use the bucket, you’d be so much more comfortable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 sheldon_cooper My struggle is emotional.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 raj_koothrappali Oh. Is it Amy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 sheldon_cooper It’s dark matter. When I entered the field of string theory, I was a prodigy. I rose to a position of respect, and I assumed my career would continue on that upward trajectory. Now here I am in my 30s, I’m back at square one. And, frankly, it’s frightening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 raj_koothrappali Sheldon, you know what I think of when I’m scared? Voyager.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Voyager the space probe or Voyager the Star Trek TV show?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 raj_koothrappali The space probe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 sheldon_cooper Good. Because I am too hot and tired to go on about how much I hate Voyager the TV show.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 raj_koothrappali By the time I was born, Voyager 1’s mission was supposed to be over. It had seen Jupiter and Saturn and all their moons, but it kept going. When I left India for America, I was never more scared in my life. I had no idea what lay ahead. Whenever I feel that way, I think about how Voyager is still out there somewhere beyond our solar system, going further than anyone ever thought it could. Don’t leave. You can do this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, is everything okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 sheldon_cooper It’s too late for Koothrappali. Let’s go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 amy_farrah_fowler 11 minutes. That’s longer than I thought.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 raj_koothrappali They’re in my shirt. They’re in my shirt. They’re in my shirt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode06 penny Okay, this is definitely the most fun thing we can do with the money.
