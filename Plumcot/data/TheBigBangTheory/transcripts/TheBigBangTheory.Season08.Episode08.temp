TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard Oh, hey, oh, we ran into your mom at Benihana last night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard Oh, yeah, she loves that place. Every time they flip a shrimp in the air, she practically leaps out of her seat to catch it. That’s why I don’t take her to SeaWorld.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard I know you-you don’t want to hear it, but she was there with Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard That’s fine. I don’t care.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 rajj It doesn’t bug you when they go out on dates?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard They’re not dating. They’re just two friends who went out to dinner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 raj And then went back to the home they share where they probably fell asleep in the matching pajamas she got them because they both just love penguins.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard Hey, lots of people wear matching pajamas who aren’t dating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 raj Like who?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard Like you and your dog.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard Don’t rule out the dating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard Fine, it bothers me. You happy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon You think you’ve got problems. The gibbon is the only member of the ape family not classified as a great ape.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard How is this helpful?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon All the non-human apes are classified as great apes except one. That means taxonomists created the entire category of lesser ape just to single out the poor gibbon as the weird kid on the playground. Now there’s a hairy little fellow with a genuine beef.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard But the gibbon doesn’t know what it’s categorized as. It doesn’t even know it’s called a gibbon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon True. Sorry, kid, you’ve got it worse than a gibbon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 bernadette We brought snacks for movie night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Oh, great. I don’t suppose you also brought napkins, clean bowls, utensils and a roll of toilet paper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 bernadette Right here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Ah, You guys are the best.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy What’s with the clothes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Well, with all the new stuff I bought for work, I needed to make room in my closet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy I meant why are they folded? But whatever. Ooh, what’s this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny That, believe it or not, is my prom dress.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 bernadette Wow, you still have it? I just assumed it was balled up in the corner of a barn somewhere.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny What kind of teenager did you think I was?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 bernadette Slutty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy Easy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny The word is popular.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 bernadette How was your prom? Did you go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy No, but I was on clean-up crew.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Aw, that’s sad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy No, it was okay. The DJ let me dance one slow song with my mop before he shut down. Whenever I see a bucket of dirty water, I still hear Lady in Red.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 bernadette My prom was pretty terrible, too. I was so excited about my date, but it turned out he only asked me ’cause he liked my friend. He spent the whole night talking about her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy Okay, we get it, you had a friend and a date. Stop bragging.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Doesn’t matter. Prom is silly anyways.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 bernadette Easy for you to say; you probably went with the captain of the football team.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny No. I just made out with him a little while his date was puking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy My date would’ve had to clean that up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 bernadette Ooh, I have an idea. Maybe we can have, like, a prom do-over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy Oh, that would be so much fun. We could decorate the roof and make the guys wear tuxedos.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 bernadette Ooh, and get our hair done, and slow-dance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Okay, guys, trust me, as someone who’s been to, like, seven proms, it is never as good as you want it to be.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy You went to seven proms?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Yeah, let’s see. Uh, four Under the Seas, two Enchanted Evenings, and one Night to Remember that I cannot remember for the life of me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 raj Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard Hey, where’s Bernadette?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard She and Amy are out dress shopping for their prom thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 raj Oh, yeah, I got that Evite. Ever since I saw Pretty in Pink, I’ve wanted to go to an American prom. But then I saw Carrie, and I did not want to go to an American prom. But then I saw Never Been Kissed, and I’m back on the prom bandwagon. This prom thing’s been a real roller coaster.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard Bernie’s really excited. I could tell because her voice got so high, the beagle next door started howling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 raj Did you go to your prom?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon No. I had a date with a proper education. Instead of a tuxedo, I dressed myself in good habits. Instead of spiked punch, I enjoyed the intoxicating flavour of knowledge. Instead of dancing in a gym, I shook my bootyto the seductive rhythms…
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Okay, okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 shldon …of AP Calculus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 raj How come you’re not shopping with Amy and Bernadette?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard Let me guess, you think the whole idea is lame?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Well, who cares what I think? What do you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard Hmm, to be honest, it’s kind of a dream come true to go to even a fake prom with a woman as beautiful as you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Ugh, thanks a lot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Well, now I can’t blow this thing off without being a bitch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 raj That sounds like a yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 bernadette Ooh, every single person RSVP’d yes. This is so exciting. Isn’t this exciting?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard Yep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 bernadette Look, even Stuart’s bringing a date. I wonder who it is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard You know exactly who it is. He’s gonna bring my mom. Why did you even invite him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 bernadette Because he’s our friend, and you two need to get along. And why can’t he take your mom? You took her to your prom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard I didn’t take her, she was a chaperone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 bernadette I saw a picture of you two dancing together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard What was I gonna do? They were playing our song. I can’t take this anymore.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 stuart Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard Stuart, we have to talk. This thing with you and my mom, I hate it. It’s making me crazy. You and I were friends for years, and now you’re bringing my mother to a party I’m going to? What the hell?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 stuart I’m not bringing your mother, I have a date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard Oh, so now you’re cheating on my mother?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 stuart Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you talking about? There’s nothing weird going on with me and your mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 mrs_wolowitz Stewie, your bath is getting cold!
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 stuart I got to go, bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon Penny? Penny? Penny? Penny? Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny You knocked more than usual.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon Next time I might be in a rush, it’s good to have a few in the bank.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Okay, what’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon I’d like to discuss this party that Amy and Bernadette are throwing. Since you and I are both reluctant to go, I think I’ve come up with a perfect way for us to enjoy it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Great, how?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon We pretend we’re aliens. I’m not the best at reading facial cues, but I’m gonna say that you love it and want to hear more. Now, in the beloved novel Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, an alien named Ford Prefect pretended to be human in order to blend in so that he could write an entry about Earth for The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, which is a travel book within the actual book, which is also called The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Okay, just one question. What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon My point is, pretending to be an alien is a valuable coping mechanism I’ve used many times. I did it the first time I went to see you in a play. You had no idea Commander Umfrumf of Ceti Alpha Three was in the audience. Oh, don’t worry, he gave you seven thumbs up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Here’s a question, as an alien pretending to be human, are you planning to engage in any post-prom mating rituals with Amy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon There are post-prom mating rituals?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Not always. Unless your date drives a van with an air mattress, then always.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon Well, if it’s part of the prom experience, then I’m open to it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny You’re kidding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon I may be an alien, but I have urges. If Amy wants to copulate by firing her eggs into space, well, then, I will happily catch them with the reproductive sac on my upper flermin. I’m not the best at reading facial cues, but I can see that you’re a little turned on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard You know, if you’re not gonna learn how to do this, they make some pretty good clip-ons.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon Bruce Wayne doesn’t wear a clip-on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard Bruce Wayne doesn’t make his roommate tie it for him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon His name is Alfred, and, yes, he does.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard There, perfect.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon What, are you sure? It’s my first prom, I want to do it correctly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard I thought you were gonna pretend to be an alien.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon I was, but Penny didn’t want to. You didn’t want to. Bernadette, Amy, Koothrappali and Wolowitz didn’t want to. And even I knew it was weird to hire somebody.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard Was that a flask?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon Yes. I’ve decided to embrace all of the traditions associated with prom, including spiking the punch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard You’re gonna put alcohol in the punch?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon Oh, no, this is pomegranate juice. It’s all the fun of high school high jinks with the cell-protecting zip of antioxidants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard If you had ripped jeans and a leather jacket, you’d be like the toughest kid on the Disney Channel. So, anything else planned for tonight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon Oh, everything. Getting our picture taken, slow-dancing, being elected prom king. Pointing out that kings aren’t elected. It’s gonna be off the hook.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard And while you’re at it, I know that at this age your hormones are raging, but just because all your friends are having sex doesn’t mean you have to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon Why would you say that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard You know, ’cause, ’cause a lot of people lose their virginity on prom night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon Penny implied the same thing. Is this true?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard Just relax, it’s a joke. You don’t have hormones.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard Wow, you look amazing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Thank you, so do you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy Sheldon, you look so handsome.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Sheldon, doesn’t Amy look hot? That’s got to put some starch in the upper flermin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy What’s that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard Oh, it’s a scaly genital organ that grows between his shoulder blades. Try not to touch it when you’re dancing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon Excuse me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy Where are you going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon I can’t do this. And for your information, Leonard, the upper flermin doesn’t grow between my shoulder blades, it grows out of the belly button on my neck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard He’s right, I was thinking of the lower flermin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 raj Ooh, I’ll, uh, text Stuart, let him know we’re close.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 bernadette That’s a neat tattoo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 emily Oh, thanks, it’s Sally from Nightmare before Christmas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 bernadette Aw, that movie’s so cute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard Do you like her because you both have red hair?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 emily Uh, a little, but more that she’s covered in scars and can pull her own limbs off and sew them back on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 bernadette I like Cinderella.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 emily Did you know, in the original book, the sisters cut off their toes with knives in order to fit in the glass slipper?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 bernadette I like Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 raj Hey, here comes Stuart and his date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 emily Oh, she’s cute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard Oh, my God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 bernadette What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard That’s Jeanie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 bernadette That’s Jeanie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 emily Who’s Jeanie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard Don’t say it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 raj That’s Howard’s cousin that he had sex with.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard She is my second cousin. We were 15, I just said, don’t say it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 emily No, it’s okay. He told me that story a long time ago.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 raj It was our first date, there was an awkward silence. What was I supposed to say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Oh, it’s beautiful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard Oh, the girls really did a nice job.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Aw, I know I wasn’t into this before, but I’m so glad I get to take you to your first prom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard What makes you think I didn’t go to my prom? I went.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Well, who’d you go with?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard I took a little lady I like to call loneliness.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Aw.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard Oh, it’s all right. We ended up having a threesome with her friend humiliation, so…
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Well, if I would have been there and saw you alone, I would’ve asked you to dance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard No, you wouldn’t have.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Well, you don’t know that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard It was before my growth spurt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny What, that already happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard Very funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Well, you wouldn’t have asked me either.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard I would have asked you. In my head. On the way home. While I was having a good cry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy Sheldon, can I come in?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon I don’t think that’s a good idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon According to an online message board, I may be having a panic attack. SoccerMom09 had similar symptoms. But to be fair, the twins were a real handful that day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy You’re making me worry. What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon What’s going on is we’re about to go to a prom. And there’s a great deal of pressure on young couples like us to engage in what Mr. Bob Eubanks called making whoopee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy What pressure? All I said was you look handsome. Can you please open the door?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon It’s not just that. Leonard and Penny also made comments about it. And I’m not blind. Even I looked twice when I saw my posterior in these tuxedo pants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sceme The limo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 stuart So, I met Jeanie at your Aunt Gladys’. She passed me the Manischewitz, I took one look at this punim, and I almost plotzed on the kugel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 rajj Is this what I sound like when I talk about India?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard So, my mother’s okay with this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 jeannie Why would your mother have a problem with me and Stuart?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard ‘Cause they have a weird, inappropriate relationship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 jeannie Weirder than what you and I did in my dad’s Corolla?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 raj This is so messed up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 emily I know, I’m having the best time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard Why would you even come to this? Didn’t you know I’d be here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 jeannie It was a long time ago, Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 stuart And you’re only second cousins, who cares?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 bernadette So, you knew and you brought her anyway?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 stuart Oh, so she’s good enough for Howard, but not for me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 bernadette Yeah, go have weird relationships with your own mother and cousin. This is his turf.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Well, I might not have asked you to dance then, but I will ask you now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard There’s no music.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny I don’t care. We’ll make our own music.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard My God, who’s the dork now? Thank you for wearing your flats.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Thank you for wearing your heels.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard Look at me. Dancing with the prettiest girl at the prom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Want to take a picture of us and send it to your old friends in the chess club?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard I sent them a bikini shot of you years ago. This is nice. I kind of wish no one else was coming.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny I know, me, too. But it will be fun to have a prom without all the drama.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 bernadette Howie, get off of him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard Not until he stops humping his way up my family tree.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy Sheldon, this is silly. I’m not missing another prom. I’m going upstairs now. Good-bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon I really did think you looked pretty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy You did?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon Yes. So much so that I started to panic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy Well, you can relax. Just because you think I look pretty doesn’t mean we have to spend the night together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon Were you hoping we would because it’s prom?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy I’m always hoping. But tonight I just wanted to have a nice time with you. And maybe dance with someone who has arms.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon Thank you for understanding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy Of course I understand. Sheldon, there’s something else I’ve been wanting to say, but before I do, I just, I want you to know that you don’t have to say it back. I know you’re not ready, and I don’t want you to say it just because social convention dictates…
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon I love you, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy You said it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon There’s no denying I have feelings for you that can’t be explained in any other way. I briefly considered that I had a brain parasite. But that seems even more farfetched. The only conclusion was love. I know what’s happening. This is a panic attack. SoccerMom09 says to lie down with your feet elevated.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Just because I love you doesn’t mean girls are allowed in my room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 raj Okay. Here we go, say cheese. Iskip) Say cheese. Iskip) Say cousin. Iskip) Say…
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 stuart Oh, sorry. Hang on, sorry. Hey, Debbie. I, yeah, yeah, I’m here with Jeanie. Okay, but we’re just friends. It’s, yeah. I got to go.
