TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Oh, hey, oh, we ran into your mom at Benihana last night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Oh, yeah, she loves that place. Every time they flip a shrimp in the air, she practically leaps out of her seat to catch it. That’s why I don’t take her to SeaWorld.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter I know you-you don’t want to hear it, but she was there with Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard_wolowitz That’s fine. I don’t care.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 raj_koothrappali It doesn’t bug you when they go out on dates?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard_wolowitz They’re not dating. They’re just two friends who went out to dinner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 raj_koothrappali And then went back to the home they share where they probably fell asleep in the matching pajamas she got them because they both just love penguins.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Hey, lots of people wear matching pajamas who aren’t dating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Like who?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Like you and your dog.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Don’t rule out the dating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Fine, it bothers me. You happy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon_cooper You think you’ve got problems. The gibbon is the only member of the ape family not classified as a great ape.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard_wolowitz How is this helpful?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon_cooper All the non-human apes are classified as great apes except one. That means taxonomists created the entire category of lesser ape just to single out the poor gibbon as the weird kid on the playground. Now there’s a hairy little fellow with a genuine beef.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter But the gibbon doesn’t know what it’s categorized as. It doesn’t even know it’s called a gibbon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon_cooper True. Sorry, kid, you’ve got it worse than a gibbon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 bernadette_rostenkowski We brought snacks for movie night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Oh, great. I don’t suppose you also brought napkins, clean bowls, utensils and a roll of toilet paper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 bernadette_rostenkowski Right here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Ah, You guys are the best.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler What’s with the clothes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Well, with all the new stuff I bought for work, I needed to make room in my closet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler I meant why are they folded? But whatever. Ooh, what’s this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny That, believe it or not, is my prom dress.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 bernadette_rostenkowski Wow, you still have it? I just assumed it was balled up in the corner of a barn somewhere.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny What kind of teenager did you think I was?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 bernadette_rostenkowski Slutty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler Easy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny The word is popular.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 bernadette_rostenkowski How was your prom? Did you go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler No, but I was on clean-up crew.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Aw, that’s sad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler No, it was okay. The DJ let me dance one slow song with my mop before he shut down. Whenever I see a bucket of dirty water, I still hear Lady in Red.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 bernadette_rostenkowski My prom was pretty terrible, too. I was so excited about my date, but it turned out he only asked me ’cause he liked my friend. He spent the whole night talking about her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler Okay, we get it, you had a friend and a date. Stop bragging.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Doesn’t matter. Prom is silly anyways.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 bernadette_rostenkowski Easy for you to say; you probably went with the captain of the football team.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny No. I just made out with him a little while his date was puking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler My date would’ve had to clean that up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 bernadette_rostenkowski Ooh, I have an idea. Maybe we can have, like, a prom do-over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, that would be so much fun. We could decorate the roof and make the guys wear tuxedos.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 bernadette_rostenkowski Ooh, and get our hair done, and slow-dance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Okay, guys, trust me, as someone who’s been to, like, seven proms, it is never as good as you want it to be.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler You went to seven proms?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Yeah, let’s see. Uh, four Under the Seas, two Enchanted Evenings, and one Night to Remember that I cannot remember for the life of me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Hey, where’s Bernadette?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard_wolowitz She and Amy are out dress shopping for their prom thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Oh, yeah, I got that Evite. Ever since I saw Pretty in Pink, I’ve wanted to go to an American prom. But then I saw Carrie, and I did not want to go to an American prom. But then I saw Never Been Kissed, and I’m back on the prom bandwagon. This prom thing’s been a real roller coaster.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Bernie’s really excited. I could tell because her voice got so high, the beagle next door started howling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Did you go to your prom?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon_cooper No. I had a date with a proper education. Instead of a tuxedo, I dressed myself in good habits. Instead of spiked punch, I enjoyed the intoxicating flavour of knowledge. Instead of dancing in a gym, I shook my bootyto the seductive rhythms…
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Okay, okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon_cooper …of AP Calculus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 raj_koothrappali How come you’re not shopping with Amy and Bernadette?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Let me guess, you think the whole idea is lame?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Well, who cares what I think? What do you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Hmm, to be honest, it’s kind of a dream come true to go to even a fake prom with a woman as beautiful as you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Ugh, thanks a lot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Well, now I can’t blow this thing off without being a bitch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 raj_koothrappali That sounds like a yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 bernadette_rostenkowski Ooh, every single person RSVP’d yes. This is so exciting. Isn’t this exciting?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Yep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 bernadette_rostenkowski Look, even Stuart’s bringing a date. I wonder who it is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard_wolowitz You know exactly who it is. He’s gonna bring my mom. Why did you even invite him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 bernadette_rostenkowski Because he’s our friend, and you two need to get along. And why can’t he take your mom? You took her to your prom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard_wolowitz I didn’t take her, she was a chaperone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 bernadette_rostenkowski I saw a picture of you two dancing together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard_wolowitz What was I gonna do? They were playing our song. I can’t take this anymore.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 stuart_bloom Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Stuart, we have to talk. This thing with you and my mom, I hate it. It’s making me crazy. You and I were friends for years, and now you’re bringing my mother to a party I’m going to? What the hell?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 stuart_bloom I’m not bringing your mother, I have a date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Oh, so now you’re cheating on my mother?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 stuart_bloom Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you talking about? There’s nothing weird going on with me and your mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 debbie_wolowitz Stewie, your bath is getting cold!
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 stuart_bloom I got to go, bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Penny? Penny? Penny? Penny? Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny You knocked more than usual.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Next time I might be in a rush, it’s good to have a few in the bank.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Okay, what’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon_cooper I’d like to discuss this party that Amy and Bernadette are throwing. Since you and I are both reluctant to go, I think I’ve come up with a perfect way for us to enjoy it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Great, how?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon_cooper We pretend we’re aliens. I’m not the best at reading facial cues, but I’m gonna say that you love it and want to hear more. Now, in the beloved novel Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, an alien named Ford Prefect pretended to be human in order to blend in so that he could write an entry about Earth for The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, which is a travel book within the actual book, which is also called The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Okay, just one question. What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon_cooper My point is, pretending to be an alien is a valuable coping mechanism I’ve used many times. I did it the first time I went to see you in a play. You had no idea Commander Umfrumf of Ceti Alpha Three was in the audience. Oh, don’t worry, he gave you seven thumbs up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Here’s a question, as an alien pretending to be human, are you planning to engage in any post-prom mating rituals with Amy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon_cooper There are post-prom mating rituals?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Not always. Unless your date drives a van with an air mattress, then always.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Well, if it’s part of the prom experience, then I’m open to it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny You’re kidding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon_cooper I may be an alien, but I have urges. If Amy wants to copulate by firing her eggs into space, well, then, I will happily catch them with the reproductive sac on my upper flermin. I’m not the best at reading facial cues, but I can see that you’re a little turned on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter You know, if you’re not gonna learn how to do this, they make some pretty good clip-ons.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Bruce Wayne doesn’t wear a clip-on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Bruce Wayne doesn’t make his roommate tie it for him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon_cooper His name is Alfred, and, yes, he does.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter There, perfect.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon_cooper What, are you sure? It’s my first prom, I want to do it correctly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter I thought you were gonna pretend to be an alien.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon_cooper I was, but Penny didn’t want to. You didn’t want to. Bernadette, Amy, Koothrappali and Wolowitz didn’t want to. And even I knew it was weird to hire somebody.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Was that a flask?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Yes. I’ve decided to embrace all of the traditions associated with prom, including spiking the punch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter You’re gonna put alcohol in the punch?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Oh, no, this is pomegranate juice. It’s all the fun of high school high jinks with the cell-protecting zip of antioxidants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter If you had ripped jeans and a leather jacket, you’d be like the toughest kid on the Disney Channel. So, anything else planned for tonight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Oh, everything. Getting our picture taken, slow-dancing, being elected prom king. Pointing out that kings aren’t elected. It’s gonna be off the hook.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter And while you’re at it, I know that at this age your hormones are raging, but just because all your friends are having sex doesn’t mean you have to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Why would you say that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter You know, ’cause, ’cause a lot of people lose their virginity on prom night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Penny implied the same thing. Is this true?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Just relax, it’s a joke. You don’t have hormones.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Wow, you look amazing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Thank you, so do you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, you look so handsome.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Sheldon, doesn’t Amy look hot? That’s got to put some starch in the upper flermin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler What’s that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Oh, it’s a scaly genital organ that grows between his shoulder blades. Try not to touch it when you’re dancing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Excuse me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler Where are you going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon_cooper I can’t do this. And for your information, Leonard, the upper flermin doesn’t grow between my shoulder blades, it grows out of the belly button on my neck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter He’s right, I was thinking of the lower flermin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Ooh, I’ll, uh, text Stuart, let him know we’re close.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 bernadette_rostenkowski That’s a neat tattoo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 emily_sweeney Oh, thanks, it’s Sally from Nightmare before Christmas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 bernadette_rostenkowski Aw, that movie’s so cute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Do you like her because you both have red hair?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 emily_sweeney Uh, a little, but more that she’s covered in scars and can pull her own limbs off and sew them back on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 bernadette_rostenkowski I like Cinderella.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 emily_sweeney Did you know, in the original book, the sisters cut off their toes with knives in order to fit in the glass slipper?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 bernadette_rostenkowski I like Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Hey, here comes Stuart and his date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 emily_sweeney Oh, she’s cute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Oh, my God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 bernadette_rostenkowski What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard_wolowitz That’s Jeanie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 bernadette_rostenkowski That’s Jeanie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 emily_sweeney Who’s Jeanie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Don’t say it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 raj_koothrappali That’s Howard’s cousin that he had sex with.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard_wolowitz She is my second cousin. We were 15, I just said, don’t say it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 emily_sweeney No, it’s okay. He told me that story a long time ago.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 raj_koothrappali It was our first date, there was an awkward silence. What was I supposed to say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Oh, it’s beautiful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Oh, the girls really did a nice job.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Aw, I know I wasn’t into this before, but I’m so glad I get to take you to your first prom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter What makes you think I didn’t go to my prom? I went.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Well, who’d you go with?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter I took a little lady I like to call loneliness.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Aw.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Oh, it’s all right. We ended up having a threesome with her friend humiliation, so…
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Well, if I would have been there and saw you alone, I would’ve asked you to dance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter No, you wouldn’t have.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Well, you don’t know that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter It was before my growth spurt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny What, that already happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Very funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Well, you wouldn’t have asked me either.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter I would have asked you. In my head. On the way home. While I was having a good cry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, can I come in?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon_cooper I don’t think that’s a good idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon_cooper According to an online message board, I may be having a panic attack. SoccerMom09 had similar symptoms. But to be fair, the twins were a real handful that day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler You’re making me worry. What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon_cooper What’s going on is we’re about to go to a prom. And there’s a great deal of pressure on young couples like us to engage in what Mr. Bob Eubanks called making whoopee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler What pressure? All I said was you look handsome. Can you please open the door?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon_cooper It’s not just that. Leonard and Penny also made comments about it. And I’m not blind. Even I looked twice when I saw my posterior in these tuxedo pants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 scene The limo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 stuart_bloom So, I met Jeanie at your Aunt Gladys’. She passed me the Manischewitz, I took one look at this punim, and I almost plotzed on the kugel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Is this what I sound like when I talk about India?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard_wolowitz So, my mother’s okay with this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 jeanie Why would your mother have a problem with me and Stuart?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard_wolowitz ‘Cause they have a weird, inappropriate relationship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 jeanie Weirder than what you and I did in my dad’s Corolla?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 raj_koothrappali This is so messed up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 emily_sweeney I know, I’m having the best time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Why would you even come to this? Didn’t you know I’d be here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 jeanie It was a long time ago, Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 stuart_bloom And you’re only second cousins, who cares?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 bernadette_rostenkowski So, you knew and you brought her anyway?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 stuart_bloom Oh, so she’s good enough for Howard, but not for me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, go have weird relationships with your own mother and cousin. This is his turf.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Well, I might not have asked you to dance then, but I will ask you now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter There’s no music.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny I don’t care. We’ll make our own music.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter My God, who’s the dork now? Thank you for wearing your flats.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Thank you for wearing your heels.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter Look at me. Dancing with the prettiest girl at the prom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny Want to take a picture of us and send it to your old friends in the chess club?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 leonard_hofstadter I sent them a bikini shot of you years ago. This is nice. I kind of wish no one else was coming.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 penny I know, me, too. But it will be fun to have a prom without all the drama.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 bernadette_rostenkowski Howie, get off of him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 howard_wolowitz Not until he stops humping his way up my family tree.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, this is silly. I’m not missing another prom. I’m going upstairs now. Good-bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon_cooper I really did think you looked pretty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler You did?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Yes. So much so that I started to panic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler Well, you can relax. Just because you think I look pretty doesn’t mean we have to spend the night together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Were you hoping we would because it’s prom?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler I’m always hoping. But tonight I just wanted to have a nice time with you. And maybe dance with someone who has arms.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Thank you for understanding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler Of course I understand. Sheldon, there’s something else I’ve been wanting to say, but before I do, I just, I want you to know that you don’t have to say it back. I know you’re not ready, and I don’t want you to say it just because social convention dictates…
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon_cooper I love you, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler You said it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon_cooper There’s no denying I have feelings for you that can’t be explained in any other way. I briefly considered that I had a brain parasite. But that seems even more farfetched. The only conclusion was love. I know what’s happening. This is a panic attack. SoccerMom09 says to lie down with your feet elevated.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 amy_farrah_fowler Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 sheldon_cooper Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Just because I love you doesn’t mean girls are allowed in my room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 raj_koothrappali Okay. Here we go, say cheese. Iskip) Say cheese. Iskip) Say cousin. Iskip) Say…
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode08 stuart_bloom Oh, sorry. Hang on, sorry. Hey, Debbie. I, yeah, yeah, I’m here with Jeanie. Okay, but we’re just friends. It’s, yeah. I got to go.
