TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 amy This is an easy one. You love this guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon Me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 amy Come on, he’s an under-appreciated genius.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon Still think it’s me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 amy It’s not you. Now think, there’s a car named after him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon Of course there is. The Mini Cooper, ’cause it’s me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 amy How about this, he’s a poor man’s Sheldon Cooper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon Oh, Tesla.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 penny Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 amy Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon Hey, how did it go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 leonard Oh, not fun. The doctor shoved a camera up into my sinuses.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 penny Yeah, I watched. It was like the scary boat tunnel in Willy Wonka.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 amy Did they figure out what’s wrong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 leonard Yeah. It’s a deviated septum. The surgery to correct it is simple. He’s gonna do it next week.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon Why would you have surgery?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 leonard Because I can’t breathe. I snore, I get sinus infections.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 penny Yeah, back off, he’s all mine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon But you don’t have a life-threatening condition. Why would you take the risk of surgery?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 amy Sheldon, it’s a routine procedure, I’ve heard you complain about his snoring.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon Yes, for the first five or six years, but I’ve gotten used to it. It helps me sleep. He’s like my mucus-powered white noise machine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 leonard Sheldon, I’m gonna get the surgery, it’s no big deal. End of story.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon Very well. I’m done talking about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 leonard Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon I believe it was your turn in the game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 amy Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon Let’s see. Oh, this person is most famous for never having gotten his nose mutilated with elective surgery and never living the rest of his life in the shadows as a hideous, disfigured freak.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 leonard I think you could give a better clue.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon I don’t. I’m not even sure if that’s a person or a typo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 leonard Okay, why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon I’m listening to you snore. I’m wondering how I’ll ever sleep without it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 leonard If it helps you sleep, then why are you sitting here staring at me like the albino boogeyman?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon Really Leonard. Insults? After I spent two hours in your closet, waiting for you to fall asleep?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 leonard What’s your problem?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon If the surgery is successful, the snoring is gone. And if you die during surgery, the snoring is gone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 leonard It sounds like either way, I finally get some rest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon I have to be honest with you Leonard, I’m truly worried.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 leonard I told you, there’s nothing to worry about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon Well, I’ve been doing some research and I’ve learned that one in 700,000 people die from general anaesthesia.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 leonard Buddy, wh, do you realize that that also means 699,999 people don’t die?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon I suppose that’s true. You’re such a glass half-full kind of guy. I’m going to miss that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 raj Oh, so, my, uh, parents’ 40th anniversary’s coming up and I can’t think of a thing to get them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 howard Damn, can you imagine being married to someone for 40 years?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 bernadette Not anymore.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 raj Anyway, any ideas on a gift?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 bernadette Well, what are some of the things they like?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 raj They used to like going to the Mumbai Symphony, but last year my mom thought they were phoning it in. Then my dad said based on their love life, she should know about phoning it in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 bernadette He said that to her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 raj Well, they weren’t speaking at the time, so he had a servant say it to her. Oh, maybe I could make a gift for them. I know how much you guys love the coasters I made for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 bernadette They’re yours in the divorce.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 leonard Hey. What’re you working on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon Remember when I said if you went through with your surgery, there was a one-in-700,000 chance of dying?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 leonard Yeah?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon Well, I’ve been crunching the numbers, and so far, I’ve gotten your probability of death all the way to a sphincter-tightening one in 300.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 leonard Great timing. My check sphincter light just went on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon Leonard, what if you have an allergic reaction to the surgeon’s latex gloves?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 leonard I’m not allergic to latex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon Well, then why don’t you wear the rubber gloves I bought for you to do the dishes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 leonard For the same reason I don’t wear the apron or the hair net.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon Fine. What about epilepsy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 leonard I don’t have epilepsy, either.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon You don’t, but the surgeon might, hmm? And your carotid artery is just one shaky scalpel away from becoming the dancing fountain at Disneyland.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 leonard Sheldon, do you realize that driving is riskier than surgery?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon I do. I have the drive to the hospital right here. That is if you make it to the car without falling down the stairs. And don’t expect me to carry you, I do that enough in life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 leonard Buddy, I, I get that you’re worried about me and I, I appreciate that, but I’m not going to die.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon You don’t know that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 leonard Well, I do know that it won’t be from an asteroid strike.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon You know who else said that? Every cocky T. Rex currently swimming around in the gas tank of your car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 leonard If there was an asteroid strike, wouldn’t you die, too?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon I don’t know, I’m smart and scrappy, I think I’d find a way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 leonard Tell you what, the surgery’s not for a week, I’ll think about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon Thank you. And while you’re thinking about it, if you have the surgery in Nicaragua during monsoon season, I can practically guarantee your death.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 raj Yes. Okay. I, I understand. Of course, yes. I’ll call you tomorrow. Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 howard So I found this fencing school in Burbank that has a Jedi class. And if you’re cool being the only adults there, they said they are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 raj Dude, my parents just split up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 howard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 raj Uh, that was my dad on the phone. He moved out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 howard Oh, my God, I, I’m sorry. I mean, if you’re not up to it, we don’t have to go out, we can just hang here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 raj No, it’s fine. It’s not that big a deal. As long as they’re happy, I’m happy. And when I get to see them for the holidays, I’ll get to celebrate Diwali twice, one at each house. That’s double the Diwali.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 howard You sure you’re okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 raj I’m okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 howard You don’t look okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 raj How can I be okay? I come from a broken home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 leonard The doctor said I should be out of surgery by ten.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 penny Okay. And Sheldon really believes we’re at a public swimming pool?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 leonard He was so busy figuring out how many parts per million of urine we’d be floating around in, he didn’t even question it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon 18 parts per million. And he’s still doing it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 amy Don’t worry about that. I’m happy to take you to work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon Well, thank you. And Leonard never lets me have French toast sticks in the car. I can’t have syrupy fingers, but he can do the backstroke in a toilet bowl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 amy It’s nice they’re getting exercise.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon Although now that I think about it, Leonard would never go swimming in public without his swim shirt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 amy I’m sure he brought it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon No, but last year, at Magic Mountain, he got such a bad sunburn, we had to cut him out of it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 amy He probably got a new one. Finish your breakfast. Look, there’s an entire section of my dashboard that doesn’t have any syrup on it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon You’re acting odd. Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 amy I’m odd all the time, everyone knows that. Just last night I tried to see how many fava beans I could fit in my mouth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon Tell me the truth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 amy Twenty eight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon Come on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 amy Fifty six.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon Amy. What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 amy All right. Don’t get upset, but, an earlier appointment opened up for Leonard and he’s getting the surgery right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon I see. Take me to Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 amy Just go to work, he’ll be fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon Amy, he’s my best friend, and if you don’t take me, I’m going there anyway.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 amy Fine. It’s sweet that you care about him so much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon I do. And I wouldn’t be able to forgive myself if something happened to him and I wasn’t at his bedside to say I told you so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 penny We had a really nice swim.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon Oh, stop it. I assume this medical centre’s already treated the burns on your bottom from the recent pants fire.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 penny ‘Cause I’m a liar, liar?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon That’s for the fire marshal to determine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 penny You had to tell him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 amy He wore me down. And I was distracted, he has on extra baby powder today.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon Is he okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 penny He’s still in surgery.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon Very well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 penny He’s gonna be all right. That is sticky.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 amy Come on, let’s talk about something other than the surgery.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon That’s a good idea. Penny, did you and Leonard ever discuss funeral arrangements?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 penny I think she meant something a little happier.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon I suppose we could try to make it a celebration, but he died so young.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 howard Knock, knock.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 bernadette Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 raj Hey. What brings you by?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 bernadette Oh, muffin much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 howard Told you, not funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 bernadette He’s just not laughing because he’s feeling blueberry. Tough crowd.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 raj I’m sorry. This is very sweet. Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 howard So, how you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 raj Better. I guess the news just hit me a lot harder than I expected.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 bernadette Well, of course. I would be devastated if my parents split up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 howard Why? Your father barely speaks to your mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 bernadette Well, at least he stuck around, not like your dad, who just took off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 howard As you can see, we’re here to cheer you up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 bernadette Sorry, Raj. Do you have any sense of what happened with your folks?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 raj I think, over time, they started to resent each other, and instead of talking about the things that bothered them, they kept it bottled up, and the hate just grew.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 bernadette It’s a shame they spent all that time unhappy. But sometimes, there’s muffin you can do about it. You get it, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 penny Oh, it’s nice you got him that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon Oh, this isn’t for Leonard, no. Amy bought it for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 amy Stubbed his toe on the revolving door on the way in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon You know those confounded things make me dizzy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 amy Who told you to keep going around?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon There was a large plant in the lobby. It kept looking like the outside.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 penny Okay, listen, when Leonard comes out, he is not gonna feel great, so, please don’t give him a hard time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 amy Penny has a good point. This is like the man in the supermarket with the goiter on his neck. Whatever you’re thinking, just keep it to yourself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon It was like a grapefruit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 amy And I’m sure he knew that before you held a grapefruit up next to it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon Well, I’m not making any promises. Not only did Leonard take what I feel is an unnecessary risk, he deceived me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 penny Okay, the reason he deceived you is you were being a pain in the ass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon The reason I was being a pain in the B is because I was worried about him, and no one else was.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 penny Really? You won’t even say A?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon You bet your sweet B I won’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 penny Obviously, I care about Leonard. I’m gonna spend the rest of my life with him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon And I’m not? It’s an earthquake. I knew it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 penny Sheldon, it was just a little tremor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon A little tremor that turns routine sinus surgery into a frontal lobotomy. Oh, I don’t care for this at all. Oh, I need to see he’s okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 amy Sheldon, you can’t go back there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon Try and stop me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 amy Are you okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon Why didn’t you stop me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 bernadette Can I tell you something? This whole thing with Raj’s parents just got me a little worried about us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 howard What are you talking about? We’re fine. And Raj’s parents probably split up because of Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 bernadette What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 howard They always say the children aren’t to blame, but, come on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 bernadette I’m not joking, Howie. You heard what he said about his parents. It was the little things they kept bottled up. I don’t want that to happen to us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 howard How can I convince you it won’t?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 bernadette Well, is there anything about me you’re keeping inside?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 howard I’m not answering that. It’s a trap.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 bernadette So there are things you don’t like.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 howard And here I am in the trap. You just keep talking. I’m gonna chew my leg off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 bernadette Just tell me one thing that bothers you, and I promise I won’t get mad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 howard Okay. The truth is, sometimes, you’re too beautiful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 bernadette Oh. Howie, be serious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 howard Okay, okay. I really don’t like how your wings poke me when we sleep ’cause you’re an angel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 bernadette Okay, fine, maybe it was a bad idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 howard I just don’t think the secret to a happy marriage is going out of our way to criticize each other. Although, there are ways to improve our communication. One thing I learned when I was in couples therapy was…
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 bernadette Who were you in couples therapy with?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 howard Not important.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 bernadette Was it your mom?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 howard Not important.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 bernadette It was your mom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 howard Anyway, the therapist had us tell each other what we loved about one another.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 bernadette Oh, that’s so sweet. I want to do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 howard All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 bernadette Okay, um, I love that you make me laugh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 howard Thank you. And I love that you’re strong and independent.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 bernadette And yet, I still love when you hold a door for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 howard I love that I’m kind of a slob around here, and you’re okay with that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 bernadette Uh-huh. And I love that I work and do all the cleaning, and you’re okay with that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 howard See, I am. Isn’t this great?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 penny Come on, smile. This is gonna be my Christmas card.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon You know this is all your fault.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 leonard How is it my fault?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon I told you not to get the surgery.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 leonard Okay, first of all, the surgery was a success, and secondly, I didn’t even want you there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon Wow. I don’t know which hurts worse, my nose or my heart. Well, I’m done speaking to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 amy Don’t be like that. You two need to talk this out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 penny Yeah, ’cause you sound really funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 leonard Sheldon, I’m sorry I didn’t tell you about the surgery, but you were worried about nothing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon Oh, you’re hardly out of the woods, no. You still run the risk of infection, a blood clot, the possibility that an inattentive surgeon let a barn spider lay eggs in your nose. The minute you sneeze web, I’m moving out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 leonard I never thought I’d say these words, but come on, nose spider.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 penny Who are you kidding? You were so panicked Leonard was gonna die, you’ll never leave him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 amy Sheldon will move out eventually.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 penny Yeah, once he figures out how to work a door.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon I was not panicked, and I am not overly attached to Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 leonard You were so worried that you smashed your face trying to check on me. You love me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon Yeah. Tell me those aren’t the words of a man with a spider eating its way through his brain. Amy, you’re a neuroscientist. Crack his skull open, spray some Raid in there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 bernadette I love that you take pride in your looks, even when I have to pee in the morning, and you’re in there spending an hour on your hair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 howard I love that you’re too good to pee in the kitchen sink.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 bernadette I love that you have the confidence to speak, even without giving it an ounce of thought.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 howard And I love how your hair is always on the soap. It’s like washing myself with a hamster.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 raj Hey, guys. Sorry I am so late. I was on the phone with my mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 bernadette Oh, how is she?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 raj Pretty good. She bought the book Eat, Pray, Love and used it to set my father’s Mercedes on fire. So, what’s up with you guys?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 howard We’re just saying all the things we love about each other.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 raj Oh, like you and I did at couples therapy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 leonard Oh, what’d you get?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon Oh, I ordered it before your surgery. It’s the urn I was going to put you in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 penny Okay, that’s morbid. Send it back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon I can’t send it back, I had it engraved. Here lie the ashes of Leonard Hofstadter. He thought he was right, but his room mate knew better.”
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 leonard That’s funny. Boy, I’m gonna miss these painkillers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 penny Hey, why did you get two? I’m with stupid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode09 sheldon Oh, that one’s mine.
