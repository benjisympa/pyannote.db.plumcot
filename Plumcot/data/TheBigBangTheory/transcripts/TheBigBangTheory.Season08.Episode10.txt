TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Hello. I’m Doctor Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to Sheldon Cooper presents Fun with Flags, the final episode flagtacular. I knew it was coming. Still scary. Now, I’m sure you’re thinking, the final episode? Who will stand between us and flag ignorance?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 amy_farrah_fowler I know I was thinking that. Is this a show on flags or mind reading?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 sheldon_cooper But the truth is I can no longer balance a full-time career, a popular Internet show, and a girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 amy_farrah_fowler And he really does have one, you jerks on the comment board.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 sheldon_cooper So as they say, all good things must come to an end.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 amy_farrah_fowler After only 232 episodes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 sheldon_cooper 233 if we include the one somebody forgot to press record on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 amy_farrah_fowler You said you weren’t gonna bring that up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 sheldon_cooper And you said you pressed record. Anyway, please sit back, relax, and join us as we take our final lap, as indicated by the waving of this racing flag. And, of course, white flags can also represent surrender, the Stewards of Gondor, and the Japanese Minamoto clan, but I’m sure you remember that from episode sixty-two, White Flags, Who’s Wavin’ ‘Em and Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 amy_farrah_fowler That was a good one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 sheldon_cooper It was so good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 raj_koothrappali You know, I thought cleaning out a dead professor’s office was gonna just be boring, but then I found his dentures and realized it’s also gross.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Doesn’t Professor Abbott’s family want any of this stuff?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter I don’t think he had a family.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 raj_koothrappali That’s rough.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter I know. You can spend your whole life working, and at the end all that’s left are some papers in a box.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Makes you think. Oh, well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Hey. Hey, we’re supposed to look through all this stuff before we throw it away in case it’s important.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 howard_wolowitz I did. It’s all outdated or disproved.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 raj_koothrappali I don’t know. This old pen kind of proves gravity. When I tilt it, her bathing suit falls right off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Oh, my dad used to have a pen like that. I dated it all through sixth grade.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter It still feels weird just throwing away his work like this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Don’t feel bad. Someday someone will be throwing out your work, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter That someone was Sheldon, and the day was yesterday. Hey, look at this. Dear Roger, to be opened upon your first great discovery. Love, Mom. Wow, look at the date. He saved this fifty years and never got to open it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 howard_wolowitz That’s intense.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 raj_koothrappali Poor Roger Abbott.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Roger Abbott sounds just like Roger Rabbit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 raj_koothrappali Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott. Oh, my God, Leonard, I know he’s dead, but try it. It’s fun. Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 dan Penny. Oh, my rookie of the year.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 penny Oh, Dan. My boss who didn’t want to hire me and now’s a little hug machine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 dan Oh, look at you. Brand-new and already the third best sales rep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 penny Aw.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 dan Yes. Why don’t you come over to my table.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 penny I’ll be right there. Bernadette’s just parking the car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 dan Oh, good. Bernadette. Cute, sweet, vicious little Bernadette.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 penny Come on. She’s not that bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 dan Oh, yeah? At the company picnic she yelled at me and my grandson for losing the three-legged race. I mean, he still calls her that mean kid with the big boobies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 penny I know she can be a little intense, but, I swear, she is so sweet once you get past all the…
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski Hey, what are you talking about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 penny Oh. We were just talking about how much we love working with you. Isn’t that right? Dan?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Over the years here at Fun With Flags, we’ve had an opportunity to learn, laugh, wonder.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 amy_farrah_fowler And, yes, even shed a tear or two.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Like when you do a two-hour Fourth of July spectacular and it doesn’t get recorded.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 amy_farrah_fowler How many times do I have to say I’m sorry?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 sheldon_cooper How about four thousand. One for every domino I set up to make that American flag. Please enjoy these highlights.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Crikey, what flag do we have today?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 amy_farrah_fowler Australia, mate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 sheldon_cooper And now it’s time for the speed round of Flag or Not a Flag.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 barry_kripke Fwag, fwag, not a fwag, fwag, I am cwushing this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 amy_farrah_fowler Say, Betsy Ross, what you working on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 sheldon_cooper I have no idea. Because the story of me sewing the first American flag is unsupported poppycock.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 amy_farrah_fowler Then who did sew it, hmm?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Don’t ask me. I’m just a simple seamstress whose descendants are out to make a quick buck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Fancy a dip, my dear?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 amy_farrah_fowler I do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Wait, that purple flag indicates that marine pests, such as jellyfish, are present.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 amy_farrah_fowler Wow, that flag is a lifesaver.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 sheldon_cooper No. This is. Stop looking at my legs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 barry_kripke Not a fwag, fwag, fwag, not a fwag. Fwag. Ugh cwap.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 raj_koothrappali When stuff like this gets me down, you know what I like to do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Sing Hakuna Matata like an eight-year-old girl?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 raj_koothrappali Wrong, smarty-pants. It’s Everything Is Awesome from The Lego Movie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Look at these notebooks. They’re full of pages and pages of data. He clearly spent years on this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Mmm. It’s just columns of random numbers. Toss it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Well, but what if this was a potential breakthrough for him? What if, what if this is the thing that would’ve finally let him open that bottle of champagne?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 raj_koothrappali Maybe he didn’t know what to pair champagne with. Strawberries, caviar, oysters. All good choices. Yeah, that look right there is why people eat before they come to your parties.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter This has to mean something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Well, there’s no discernible pattern that I can see, but it shouldn’t be too hard to run the numbers and check.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Well, maybe we can get some time on the supercomputer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Sure. We could try multiple regressions with varying physical and experimental constants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Oh, we could run a pattern-matching algorithm against well-known unsolved physics problems.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Ooh, it might be a substitution cipher. We could start with basic cryptanalysis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 raj_koothrappali Or we could talk to this guy he used to share an office with.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Oh, let’s do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Because you don’t know how to do cryptanalysis, do you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Yeah, I’m not even sure if it’s the right word.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 penny So, Dan, you have a grandson. How old is he?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 dan Seven.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, yeah. I remember him from the picnic. He was the one crying like a wuss the whole time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 penny I heard he was being picked on by a mean kid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski Just builds character. Like my dad said, nobody likes a crybaby except their mommies and Democrats.”
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 dan I need another drink.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski What’s his problem?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 penny Oh, I don’t know. Maybe he didn’t like the fact that you called his grandson a wuss.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski Well, I didn’t think you were supposed to say sissy anymore.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 penny Okay, look, I know what a good person you are, but sometimes people think you might come off a little harsh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski What? I’m, like, the sweetest person I know. Look at me. I should be in a tree baking cookies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 penny Yes, but once in a while, people think you’re a little mean.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, yeah? You one of those people?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 penny No. No, no, no. I think the cookie thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 amy_farrah_fowler Action.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Welcome back. Our guest today is a returning fan favourite. He puts the reading in your rainbow, the Geordi in your La Forge, and the Kunta in your Kinte, Mr. LeVar Burton.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 levar_burton Thank you, Sheldon. Now, remember our deal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 sheldon_cooper You do this, I delete your contact information.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 levar_burton While?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 sheldon_cooper While you watch me do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 levar_burton Great. Happy to be back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Well, since you’re here, I’d like to get your opinion on something. In honour of Black History Month, I portrayed George Washington Carver in a loving tribute that my roommate called wildly racist. What do you think? Hi. My name is George.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 levar_burton Oh, hell, no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 sheldon_cooper You heard him, Leonard. No, it’s not racist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Are we sure this is the place?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 raj_koothrappali The doorman said this is the right building.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter I think if you’re pulling up your pants, you’re not a doorman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 Who is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Uh, I’ve been looking for a Professor Sharpe?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 professor_sharpe Hold on. Can I help you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Hi. We’re from the university. We’re trying to get some information about Professor Abbott.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 howard_wolowitz We were cleaning out his office and found these books full of numbers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Any chance you know what it is?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 professor_sharpe Yes, he was always working on this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 raj_koothrappali I was thinking it might be some sort of interstellar coordinate system, maybe an updated version of Hubble’s law. I keep seeing the number 90 repeating. That could be the angle of perturbation of a distant galaxy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 professor_sharpe It’s the number of calories in a yoghurt. That’s his food diary.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 professor_sharpe Yeah, he wrote down everything he ever ate. He was convinced that calorie restriction was the key to living forever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 raj_koothrappali Does it work?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Seriously?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 raj_koothrappali Well, he could have been hit by a bus. You don’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 professor_sharpe Sorry it’s not more interesting. On the bright side, you didn’t have to listen to his stomach growl for 35 years.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter So, was there anything that Professor Abbott worked on during his life that came close to an accomplishment?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 professor_sharpe To be honest, his research never amounted to anything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 raj_koothrappali You were his colleague. How did your research turn out? Great. Hey, this is the apartment you get when you win a Nobel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 raj_koothrappali Well, you could be very frugal. I’m getting a little tired of everybody’s sarcasm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski I’m not a bully. I mean, maybe I come off a little strong, but that’s only because my dad raised me to be tough and not to take crap from anybody.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 penny No. That’s fine, but there’s a difference between being tough and telling your friend her new pants look like a saggy diaper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski I did say that, didn’t I?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 penny Yeah, you did. I felt so self-conscious, I had to return them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski Where? To Babies R Us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 penny You’re doing it again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski Okay, sorry. Can we just go? I feel like everybody hates me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 penny Oh, come on, they don’t hate you, all right? They’re just a little intimidated. All you need to do is show everyone how sweet you really are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski I think I’d rather go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 penny No, come on. You are not going anywhere, all right? I am here for you, and we are gonna fix this together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 penny Even though your dress is ugly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Well, my little flag-keteers, it looks like the last episode of Fun with Flags is at an end. If I could, I would run each and every one of you viewers up a flagpole and salute you. And if you touched the ground, burn you. I’d like to take a moment to personally thank Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler, who you may or may not know is the first woman to co-host a flag or banner-related Internet info-tainment show.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 amy_farrah_fowler Take that, glass ceiling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 sheldon_cooper And if I may get serious for a moment, hosting this show has been one crazy ride. But with all its ups and downs, I wouldn’t give it up for the world. Except for now, when I’m giving it up. Before I sign off, I’d, uh, I’d like to share with you all one last use for a white flag. It’s good for times like this. Good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 amy_farrah_fowler Cut. Sheldon, that was beautiful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 sheldon_cooper If you didn’t press record…
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 amy_farrah_fowler I pressed it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Well, that’s it. That’s the end of Roger Abbott.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 raj_koothrappali And we still don’t know who framed him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter I still keep thinking about how an entire life can seemingly amount to nothing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 howard_wolowitz I guess the sad truth is, not everyone will accomplish something great. Some of us may just have to find meaning in the little moments that make up life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter That’s a nice way of looking at it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Yeah for you, not for me. I went to space. I’m covered.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter You know what? This bottle was meant to celebrate an achievement. Let’s make a pact. When one of us gets their first big breakthrough, we’ll celebrate by opening this bottle of champagne and toasting Professor Abbott.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 howard_wolowitz I love that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 raj_koothrappali Yeah, me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Then, of course, rubbing our success in Sheldon’s face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 raj_koothrappali Oh, well, that’s the best part.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Oh, yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski Dan, could I talk to you for a minute?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 dan Sure, go ahead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski Just want you to know I didn’t mean to be rude about your grandson.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 dan No, it’s okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski No, it’s not. Penny told me that everyone’s scared of me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 dan What? What? Why would she say that? You know she drinks, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski No, she’s right, and I just want you to know that from now on, I’m gonna be much more sensitive. I don’t want anyone walking on eggshells around me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 dan Oh, well, okay, then, uh, one thing I’ve been meaning to tell you is that the company is gonna stop paying for our coffee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski No problem. When does that start?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 dan Five months ago.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 dan Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski Who’s been paying for my coffee?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 dan All of us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 penny Yeah. It comes from the swear jar we put money in when you curse.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski What else don’t I know about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 penny Uh, well, you know your private bathroom?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 penny That was supposed to be for the whole floor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski You’re kidding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 dan No, no. It’s okay. It only really affected Wheelchair Kathy, and she’s back in the hospital now, so it all worked out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski I feel so bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 penny Well, then, maybe you shouldn’t have named her Wheelchair Kathy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, my God. I thought everybody liked me, but I’m just a monster.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 dan But a cute one, like that, uh, eyeball guy in Monsters, Inc.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski No, I’m the worst. I’m a terrible person.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 dan Come on, don’t cry. It’s okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski It’s not okay. How can I even work here anymore?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 penny Because this company needs you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 dan It’s fine. We don’t mind paying for the coffee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski I can’t let you do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 dan Maybe we could get you an espresso machine for your office.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski I guess that would be all right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 penny See? You don’t have to be mean to get what you want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski You’re right. Now where did we land on my bathroom?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter How come you’re up so late?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 sheldon_cooper I posted the last episode of Fun with Flags hours ago, and not a single person cared enough to comment. All that effort for nothing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Mm. I know how you feel. I spent the day throwing out a man’s entire career, and all that’s left is an old bottle of champagne and a naked lady pen that Raj took when he thought no one was looking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 sheldon_cooper It’s not the same thing. I don’t think you know how I feel at all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Sad?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Hmm. You do get me. Someone left a comment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Yeah. What did they say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Too bad your show is done. I kind of liked it. Leonard, did you hear that? Oh, the people are heartbroken. I can’t take this away from the world. Fun with Flags is back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Congratulations.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Let’s celebrate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, that wasn’t for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Oh, no, I’m not going to drink it. I just wanted to hear the pop. Yeah, I knew it was coming. Still scary.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 sheldon_cooper LeVar Burton? LeVar Burton? LeVar Burton?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 levar_burton Ugh. What are you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 sheldon_cooper You told me not to call, and I didn’t know how else to give you the good news. Fun with Flags is back, and you can be in the next episode.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 levar_burton Wil Wheaton said, get a gate. I don’t know why I didn’t get a gate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode10 sheldon_cooper You, at least listen to the premise. Since you were born in Germany, I thought we could talk
