TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 penny Hey, how are things going with your parents?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon You know, speaking of attorneys, if I ever needed a lawyer, I would not hire She-Hulk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 penny You know what? That was almost on topic. I’m gonna say good job, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 amy Wait, She-Hulk’s a lawyer?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard Yeah, she works at a law firm in New York.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon Yes, but she’s the only monster at the firm. Between you, me and the wall, I think she’s an affirmative action hire.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj Anyway, Dad’s gonna be here in town, so I won’t be able to do Christmas dinner this year.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 amy If you’re not up to hosting Christmas dinner, I’m happy to do it. You can even bring your father.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj That would be nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 amy I’ve always wanted to do a traditional Victorian Christmas. Parlour games, goose and figgy pudding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon Ugh. English pudding. You get yourself all excited for pudding, and here comes a cake with raisins in it. I’m not going.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 amy You’re going.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon Why do you hate me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 amy I don’t hate you. I love you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon Well, you call it love, but it has a lot of raisins in it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj Amy, good luck getting these guys excited about a dinner with a theme. I gave up when no one cared about my Tom Hanks-giving.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 bernadette I think a Victorian Christmas sounds nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard I agree.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 penny Me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj You guys suck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard You know the best part of working in the clean room? No allergies. Check it out. Oh, that, that, that’s a lot of oxygen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard We should get going to Amy’s.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard Can you believe there was a time when we would have needed an array of giant Cherenkov telescopes to detect cosmic particles? And here we are building our own multi-wire detector like a couple of badasses.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard I know. If we were still single, we’d be tripping over all that booty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard Ladies do love a man dressed like a kitchen garbage bag. Oh, no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard How the hell did a pigeon get in here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard You shut the loading doors, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard I thought you did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard Do you know what a disaster this is?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard You mean ’cause this room isn’t supposed to have dust in it, and we just let in a flying crap machine?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard What do we do? Should we call someone?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard And tell them that we compromised all the equipment? Let’s just get it out of here before anyone knows.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard Okay, how do we catch it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard Well, what if we turn off all the lights except for one, and it’ll come to it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard It’s not a moth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard Don’t yell at me. You’re not gonna get any good ideas out of me if you’re yelling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard Okay, so if I remain calm, I’ll get more gems like turn off the lights?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard Great, we’re turning on each other. That’s just what the bird wants us to do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 penny So, Dr. Koothrappali, long flight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 dr_koothrappali Twenty hours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 penny Oh, that’s rough.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 dr_koothrappali Not at all. Did you know that when you fly transcontinental without your wife, you don’t pray for the plane to crash?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj Can we please talk about anything else?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 dr_koothrappali Forgive me. How are you and Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 penny Oh, great. Everything’s good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 dr_koothrappali I see you got engaged.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 penny Yes, we did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 dr_koothrappali Let me tell you a story.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj Dad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 dr_koothrappali Sorry. I’m sure you won’t grow to hate each other.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj Hey, Leonard. What’s up? What? How did that happen? Yeah, okay. I’ll be there as soon as I can. Sorry. I have to run to the university.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 amy What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj There’s been a problem with an experiment. A bird got into the clean room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 dr_koothrappali You want me to come?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj Uh, no. You had a long flight. You stay here and relax.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 dr_koothrappali Relax. Easy for you to say. Your mother isn’t cleaning out your bank account. Forty years, the woman never cleaned a thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 penny You’re just gonna leave him here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 dr_koothrappali Relax, he says.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj Yup. Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 bernadette Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus, right down Santa Claus Lane. Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer pulling on the reins.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon Yeah, I appreciate the ride.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 bernadette Bells are ringing, children singing, all is merry and bright. So hang your stockings and say your prayers ’cause Santa Claus is coming tonight. Why’d you turn it off?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon Because in the last ten minutes, Santa came to town, kissed Mommy and ran Grandma over with a reindeer. I had a drunk uncle who did all those things. Nobody sings songs about him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 bernadette Maybe you’d like it more if you thought of Santa as a superhero and his power is bringing joy to children.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon My uncle was accused of that, too. It turned out to be legal in Oklahoma.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 bernadette Okay, new subject. Let’s talk about presents. What did you get Amy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon Oh, we’re not exchanging gifts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 bernadette Come on, Sheldon, you have to get her something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon Why should I? She knows that I don’t like Christmas, and yet, every year, she forces me to celebrate it. Not only am I going to this foolish dinner against my will, at the Christmas tree lot, there was mistletoe, and she kissed me under it in public. Like we were the stars of a Tijuana sex show.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 bernadette She’s just excited about the holidays.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon Yes, and she’s not taking my feelings into account at all. Maybe it’s time I teach her a lesson.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 bernadette How?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon Hmm. It’d have to be something heinous, something that makes her as miserable as she’s making me. Oh, I’ve got it. This is good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 bernadette What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon I’m going to buy her a present.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 bernadette Yeah, you’re gonna have to walk me through that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon With gift-giving, there’s an implied social contract. If I show up tonight with a present, and she doesn’t have one for me, she’ll feel terrible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 bernadette Then you’re both sad?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon Yes. Maybe she’ll feel so guilty, she’ll never make me celebrate the holidays again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 bernadette So your evil plot here is to buy your girlfriend a present?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon That’s right. So stay on my good side, or I’ll get you a little something, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard Okay, here’s the plan. I’m gonna put the food in the bag, and when he lands in the bag to eat it, we close it up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard A Slim Jim?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard It’s all I could find. It’ll work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard Sure. If the pigeon’s stoned or a trucker.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard Okay, well, what’s your plan?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard I told you my plan. Let’s call Building Services and get help.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard And admit that we contaminated the clean room?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard No, admit that you contaminated the clean room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard Why do you keep assuming it was me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard Because you do this kind of thing all the time, and then you try to cover it up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard Like when?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard What about when you flipped the Mars Rover, or lost Koothrappali’s dog, or almost drove off with that baby?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard Again, it looked like my car, and the baby didn’t even cry until his mother punched me with her keys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard Fine, put the Slim Jim in the garbage bag.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard Well, what if you said it without sounding so condescending?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard I can try, but your plan has the words garbage bag and Slim Jim in it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj Hey, what’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard Oh. Genius here wants to catch a bird with a garbage bag and a Slim Jim.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj Should have put it in the bag first.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 penny So, if you don’t mind me asking, do you think you might start dating again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 dr_koothrappali It’s much too soon for that. Why? Do you know someone?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 penny No, but if things don’t work out with me and Leonard, I’ll give you a call. Wait. How much do you talk about Star Trek?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 amy Okay, let’s get this Victorian party started. I’ve done some research about some traditional parlour games we can play.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 penny Like what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 amy Well, there’s a fun one called Ball of Wool. You take a ball of wool, and you put it right in the centre of the table. Then people sit on opposite sides of the table and try to blow the wool off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 penny Sorry. She’s taken, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard You know what I think your problem is? You’re jealous because you and I used to be best friends until Koothrappali came along.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard And you found somebody you could push around?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard Stay out of this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard You know, maybe I’m best friends with Raj because he doesn’t think he’s smarter than me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj Actually.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard I said, stay out of it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard No, no, no. No, Raj, go ahead, say what you were gonna say.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj All I’m gonna say is you guys need to stop this right now. It. it’s bad enough that my parents are fighting, now I have to hear the two of you? And who cares who’s smarter? If it’s Leonard or me or, you know, it’s Christmas, let’s say it’s Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard Well, if you’re so smart, you get the bird out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj No, you’re the one who let him in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard How do you know it wasn’t Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj Come on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 bernadette What about that sweater?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon No, it’s not good enough. It has to be perfect.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 bernadette I think the nicest gifts I’ve got from Howie show how well he knows me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon Hmm. Let’s see, what do I know about Amy? She loves medieval literature, Chaucer’s her favourite. And her eyes sparkle when she watches old French movies. I enjoy how harp music causes her fingers to dance as if she’s playing along.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 bernadette Wow, you really do love her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon I do. Now, let’s find the kind of gift that makes her feel small and worthless.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 amy You won.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 penny Certainly doesn’t feel like it, does it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 dr_koothrappali You know, my wife used to throw theme parties like this all the time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 penny Oh, I guess that’s where Raj gets it from.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 dr_koothrappali Well, he and his mother spent a lot of time together when he was young. I was always working.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 penny Hey, you know, Raj is dating a doctor who works a lot. Him and his mom have a type. You, you got to laugh at that, right? No? All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 santa All right, let me see if I’ve got this straight. A picture of you on my lap is a way to punish your girlfriend for making you celebrate Christmas?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon Correct.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 santa Santa thinks dating you may be punishment enough.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon There’s an argument for that. But I want to make sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 photographer Smile.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 santa Ho, ho. ho.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard Okay. On the count of three, I’ll shoot the fire extinguisher and get him airborne. Howard, you wave the blanket and guide him towards the exit. Raj, you hold open the curtain so he can fly out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard Are you sure a dummy like me can handle something as complicated as a blanket?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard Do you want the fire extinguisher?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard Yeah, I do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard Great. Here you go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard Okay. One, two, three.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj Uh, you have to take the pin out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard You miss the blanket now, don’t you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard On three. One, two, three.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj What did you do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard It was an accident. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard Relax, it wasn’t your fault.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard Uh, maybe it’s just stunned.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj Dude, it’s not breathing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard Oh, no. I killed it. Oh, not again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj What do you mean, not again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard When I was ten, I was playing in my backyard and sat on a blue jay. I mean, I tried to bring it back to life with electricity, but it just caught on fire. The worst part was it smelled delicious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard Uh, guys, I found an article here that says you can do CPR on birds.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard Great. Do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard I’m not doing it. You killed him, you do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj I’ll do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard No. I need to do it. This is on me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard Okay. Mouth over beak and light chest compressions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj Don’t blow too hard. If you pop him, I will vomit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard Anything?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard I am tasting a lot of Slim Jim.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard Wait, wait, his wing moved.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard Oh, he blinked his eyes. He’s alive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj It’s a Christmas miracle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard I might argue a Hanukkah miracle, but I’ll take it. Come on, little guy, let’s get you outside. Get the curtain.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj Someone should really close that loading door.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj Well, that’s that. The room’s compromised. They’ll have to change all the filters, probably shut it down for weeks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard You were right. Go ahead, call Building Services. Tell them it was my fault.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard No, we’re both to blame. You know, let me take the heat on this one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj Yeah, just leave me out of it. You know if they come here and see crap everywhere, they’re just gonna blame the Indian guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard Hey. I’m sorry, we’re still here. Is everything okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 penny It’s kind of boring. Although it did get exciting for a minute when Amy inhaled a wool ball. How much longer do you think you’ll be?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard I don’t know. There’s still a bird in here. We are gonna get in a ton of trouble.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 penny Honey, it’s Christmas Eve. Who even knows you’re in there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard No, our names are on the sign-in sheet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 penny So erase them and walk out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard I can’t do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard Can’t do what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard She says take our names off the sign-in sheet and leave.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard We can’t do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard_howard_and_raj Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way. Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh, hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj Mmm. Amy, that pudding was delicious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon If you like raisins.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 amy Thank you. And it’s figs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon Oh. Oh, in that case, it was pretty good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 bernadette You feeling okay? You hardly touched your goose.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard It smelled too much like blue jay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 dr_koothrappali Can I help you clean up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 amy Oh, you Heimliched a ball of wool out of me; you’re good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon Uh, what do you say we exchange gifts?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 penny Oh, Sheldon, we didn’t bring any.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard I thought you hate giving gifts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon Yeah, I do. Which is why I got Amy this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 amy You got me something?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon Oh, not just something, no. It’s from the heart, it’s holiday-themed, and I swallowed the gift receipt so you cannot return it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 amy Look at you on Santa’s lap. That’s so sweet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon Of course it is. It’s the perfect gift. How are you feeling right now? Guilty? Sad? Wishing you were Jewish?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 amy No, I love it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon Oh, really? Well, how about now? Happy holidays to my dear Amy. I hope you treasure this as much as I treasure you. And you got me nothing. Christmas is ruined. Let’s never speak of it again. Well, this was fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 amy Actually, I did get you something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon But what about our agreement?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 amy Well, you got me something. Here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon Cookies?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 amy They’re your Meemaw’s Christmas cookies. I called and got the recipe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon They’re perfect. It tastes like her hugs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 amy Merry Christmas, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon I can’t believe this. You’re happy, I’m happy. Well, maybe a holiday that’s all about giving isn’t so… Get your hand out of that box.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 amy Okay. The next game is called Hot Boiled Beans.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 penny Of course it is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 amy One person is sent out of the room while the others hide a small item. Then they invite the first person back by saying hot boiled beans and bacon for supper, hurry up before it gets cold.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj If you people think this is better than Tom Hanks-giving, you’re all crazy.
