TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 penny Hey, how are things going with your parents?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon_cooper You know, speaking of attorneys, if I ever needed a lawyer, I would not hire She-Hulk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 penny You know what? That was almost on topic. I’m gonna say good job, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 amy_farrah_fowler Wait, She-Hulk’s a lawyer?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Yeah, she works at a law firm in New York.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Yes, but she’s the only monster at the firm. Between you, me and the wall, I think she’s an affirmative action hire.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj_koothrappali Anyway, Dad’s gonna be here in town, so I won’t be able to do Christmas dinner this year.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 amy_farrah_fowler If you’re not up to hosting Christmas dinner, I’m happy to do it. You can even bring your father.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj_koothrappali That would be nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 amy_farrah_fowler I’ve always wanted to do a traditional Victorian Christmas. Parlour games, goose and figgy pudding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Ugh. English pudding. You get yourself all excited for pudding, and here comes a cake with raisins in it. I’m not going.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 amy_farrah_fowler You’re going.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Why do you hate me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 amy_farrah_fowler I don’t hate you. I love you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Well, you call it love, but it has a lot of raisins in it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj_koothrappali Amy, good luck getting these guys excited about a dinner with a theme. I gave up when no one cared about my Tom Hanks-giving.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 bernadette_rostenkowski I think a Victorian Christmas sounds nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard_wolowitz I agree.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 penny Me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj_koothrappali You guys suck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter You know the best part of working in the clean room? No allergies. Check it out. Oh, that, that, that’s a lot of oxygen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard_wolowitz We should get going to Amy’s.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Can you believe there was a time when we would have needed an array of giant Cherenkov telescopes to detect cosmic particles? And here we are building our own multi-wire detector like a couple of badasses.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard_wolowitz I know. If we were still single, we’d be tripping over all that booty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Ladies do love a man dressed like a kitchen garbage bag. Oh, no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard_wolowitz How the hell did a pigeon get in here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter You shut the loading doors, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard_wolowitz I thought you did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Do you know what a disaster this is?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard_wolowitz You mean ’cause this room isn’t supposed to have dust in it, and we just let in a flying crap machine?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter What do we do? Should we call someone?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard_wolowitz And tell them that we compromised all the equipment? Let’s just get it out of here before anyone knows.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Okay, how do we catch it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Well, what if we turn off all the lights except for one, and it’ll come to it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter It’s not a moth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Don’t yell at me. You’re not gonna get any good ideas out of me if you’re yelling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Okay, so if I remain calm, I’ll get more gems like turn off the lights?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Great, we’re turning on each other. That’s just what the bird wants us to do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 penny So, Dr. Koothrappali, long flight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 dr_vm_koothrappali Twenty hours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 penny Oh, that’s rough.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 dr_vm_koothrappali Not at all. Did you know that when you fly transcontinental without your wife, you don’t pray for the plane to crash?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj_koothrappali Can we please talk about anything else?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 dr_vm_koothrappali Forgive me. How are you and Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 penny Oh, great. Everything’s good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 dr_vm_koothrappali I see you got engaged.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 penny Yes, we did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 dr_vm_koothrappali Let me tell you a story.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj_koothrappali Dad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 dr_vm_koothrappali Sorry. I’m sure you won’t grow to hate each other.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj_koothrappali Hey, Leonard. What’s up? What? How did that happen? Yeah, okay. I’ll be there as soon as I can. Sorry. I have to run to the university.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 amy_farrah_fowler What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj_koothrappali There’s been a problem with an experiment. A bird got into the clean room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 dr_vm_koothrappali You want me to come?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj_koothrappali Uh, no. You had a long flight. You stay here and relax.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 dr_vm_koothrappali Relax. Easy for you to say. Your mother isn’t cleaning out your bank account. Forty years, the woman never cleaned a thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 penny You’re just gonna leave him here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 dr_vm_koothrappali Relax, he says.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj_koothrappali Yup. Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 bernadette_rostenkowski Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus, right down Santa Claus Lane. Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer pulling on the reins.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Yeah, I appreciate the ride.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 bernadette_rostenkowski Bells are ringing, children singing, all is merry and bright. So hang your stockings and say your prayers ’cause Santa Claus is coming tonight. Why’d you turn it off?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Because in the last ten minutes, Santa came to town, kissed Mommy and ran Grandma over with a reindeer. I had a drunk uncle who did all those things. Nobody sings songs about him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 bernadette_rostenkowski Maybe you’d like it more if you thought of Santa as a superhero and his power is bringing joy to children.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon_cooper My uncle was accused of that, too. It turned out to be legal in Oklahoma.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 bernadette_rostenkowski Okay, new subject. Let’s talk about presents. What did you get Amy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Oh, we’re not exchanging gifts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 bernadette_rostenkowski Come on, Sheldon, you have to get her something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Why should I? She knows that I don’t like Christmas, and yet, every year, she forces me to celebrate it. Not only am I going to this foolish dinner against my will, at the Christmas tree lot, there was mistletoe, and she kissed me under it in public. Like we were the stars of a Tijuana sex show.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 bernadette_rostenkowski She’s just excited about the holidays.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Yes, and she’s not taking my feelings into account at all. Maybe it’s time I teach her a lesson.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 bernadette_rostenkowski How?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Hmm. It’d have to be something heinous, something that makes her as miserable as she’s making me. Oh, I’ve got it. This is good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 bernadette_rostenkowski What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon_cooper I’m going to buy her a present.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, you’re gonna have to walk me through that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon_cooper With gift-giving, there’s an implied social contract. If I show up tonight with a present, and she doesn’t have one for me, she’ll feel terrible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 bernadette_rostenkowski Then you’re both sad?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Yes. Maybe she’ll feel so guilty, she’ll never make me celebrate the holidays again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 bernadette_rostenkowski So your evil plot here is to buy your girlfriend a present?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon_cooper That’s right. So stay on my good side, or I’ll get you a little something, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Okay, here’s the plan. I’m gonna put the food in the bag, and when he lands in the bag to eat it, we close it up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter A Slim Jim?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard_wolowitz It’s all I could find. It’ll work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Sure. If the pigeon’s stoned or a trucker.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Okay, well, what’s your plan?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter I told you my plan. Let’s call Building Services and get help.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard_wolowitz And admit that we contaminated the clean room?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter No, admit that you contaminated the clean room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Why do you keep assuming it was me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Because you do this kind of thing all the time, and then you try to cover it up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Like when?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter What about when you flipped the Mars Rover, or lost Koothrappali’s dog, or almost drove off with that baby?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Again, it looked like my car, and the baby didn’t even cry until his mother punched me with her keys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Fine, put the Slim Jim in the garbage bag.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Well, what if you said it without sounding so condescending?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter I can try, but your plan has the words garbage bag and Slim Jim in it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj_koothrappali Hey, what’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Oh. Genius here wants to catch a bird with a garbage bag and a Slim Jim.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj_koothrappali Should have put it in the bag first.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 penny So, if you don’t mind me asking, do you think you might start dating again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 dr_vm_koothrappali It’s much too soon for that. Why? Do you know someone?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 penny No, but if things don’t work out with me and Leonard, I’ll give you a call. Wait. How much do you talk about Star Trek?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 amy_farrah_fowler Okay, let’s get this Victorian party started. I’ve done some research about some traditional parlour games we can play.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 penny Like what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 amy_farrah_fowler Well, there’s a fun one called Ball of Wool. You take a ball of wool, and you put it right in the centre of the table. Then people sit on opposite sides of the table and try to blow the wool off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 penny Sorry. She’s taken, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard_wolowitz You know what I think your problem is? You’re jealous because you and I used to be best friends until Koothrappali came along.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter And you found somebody you could push around?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj_koothrappali Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Stay out of this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj_koothrappali Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard_wolowitz You know, maybe I’m best friends with Raj because he doesn’t think he’s smarter than me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj_koothrappali Actually.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard_wolowitz I said, stay out of it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter No, no, no. No, Raj, go ahead, say what you were gonna say.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj_koothrappali All I’m gonna say is you guys need to stop this right now. It. it’s bad enough that my parents are fighting, now I have to hear the two of you? And who cares who’s smarter? If it’s Leonard or me or, you know, it’s Christmas, let’s say it’s Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Well, if you’re so smart, you get the bird out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj_koothrappali No, you’re the one who let him in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard_wolowitz How do you know it wasn’t Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj_koothrappali Come on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 bernadette_rostenkowski What about that sweater?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon_cooper No, it’s not good enough. It has to be perfect.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 bernadette_rostenkowski I think the nicest gifts I’ve got from Howie show how well he knows me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Hmm. Let’s see, what do I know about Amy? She loves medieval literature, Chaucer’s her favourite. And her eyes sparkle when she watches old French movies. I enjoy how harp music causes her fingers to dance as if she’s playing along.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 bernadette_rostenkowski Wow, you really do love her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon_cooper I do. Now, let’s find the kind of gift that makes her feel small and worthless.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 amy_farrah_fowler You won.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 penny Certainly doesn’t feel like it, does it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 dr_vm_koothrappali You know, my wife used to throw theme parties like this all the time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 penny Oh, I guess that’s where Raj gets it from.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 dr_vm_koothrappali Well, he and his mother spent a lot of time together when he was young. I was always working.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 penny Hey, you know, Raj is dating a doctor who works a lot. Him and his mom have a type. You, you got to laugh at that, right? No? All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 santa All right, let me see if I’ve got this straight. A picture of you on my lap is a way to punish your girlfriend for making you celebrate Christmas?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Correct.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 santa Santa thinks dating you may be punishment enough.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon_cooper There’s an argument for that. But I want to make sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 photographer Smile.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 santa Ho, ho. ho.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Okay. On the count of three, I’ll shoot the fire extinguisher and get him airborne. Howard, you wave the blanket and guide him towards the exit. Raj, you hold open the curtain so he can fly out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Are you sure a dummy like me can handle something as complicated as a blanket?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Do you want the fire extinguisher?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Yeah, I do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Great. Here you go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Okay. One, two, three.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj_koothrappali Uh, you have to take the pin out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter You miss the blanket now, don’t you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard_wolowitz On three. One, two, three.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj_koothrappali What did you do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard_wolowitz It was an accident. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Relax, it wasn’t your fault.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Uh, maybe it’s just stunned.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj_koothrappali Dude, it’s not breathing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Oh, no. I killed it. Oh, not again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj_koothrappali What do you mean, not again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard_wolowitz When I was ten, I was playing in my backyard and sat on a blue jay. I mean, I tried to bring it back to life with electricity, but it just caught on fire. The worst part was it smelled delicious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Uh, guys, I found an article here that says you can do CPR on birds.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Great. Do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter I’m not doing it. You killed him, you do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj_koothrappali I’ll do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard_wolowitz No. I need to do it. This is on me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Okay. Mouth over beak and light chest compressions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj_koothrappali Don’t blow too hard. If you pop him, I will vomit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Anything?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard_wolowitz I am tasting a lot of Slim Jim.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Wait, wait, his wing moved.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Oh, he blinked his eyes. He’s alive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj_koothrappali It’s a Christmas miracle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard_wolowitz I might argue a Hanukkah miracle, but I’ll take it. Come on, little guy, let’s get you outside. Get the curtain.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj_koothrappali Someone should really close that loading door.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj_koothrappali Well, that’s that. The room’s compromised. They’ll have to change all the filters, probably shut it down for weeks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard_wolowitz You were right. Go ahead, call Building Services. Tell them it was my fault.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter No, we’re both to blame. You know, let me take the heat on this one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj_koothrappali Yeah, just leave me out of it. You know if they come here and see crap everywhere, they’re just gonna blame the Indian guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Hey. I’m sorry, we’re still here. Is everything okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 penny It’s kind of boring. Although it did get exciting for a minute when Amy inhaled a wool ball. How much longer do you think you’ll be?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter I don’t know. There’s still a bird in here. We are gonna get in a ton of trouble.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 penny Honey, it’s Christmas Eve. Who even knows you’re in there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter No, our names are on the sign-in sheet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 penny So erase them and walk out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter I can’t do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard_wolowitz Can’t do what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter She says take our names off the sign-in sheet and leave.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard_wolowitz We can’t do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard_wolowitz@leonard_hofstadter@raj_koothrappali Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way. Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh, hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj_koothrappali Mmm. Amy, that pudding was delicious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon_cooper If you like raisins.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 amy_farrah_fowler Thank you. And it’s figs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Oh. Oh, in that case, it was pretty good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 bernadette_rostenkowski You feeling okay? You hardly touched your goose.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 howard_wolowitz It smelled too much like blue jay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 dr_vm_koothrappali Can I help you clean up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, you Heimliched a ball of wool out of me; you’re good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Uh, what do you say we exchange gifts?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 penny Oh, Sheldon, we didn’t bring any.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 leonard_hofstadter I thought you hate giving gifts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Yeah, I do. Which is why I got Amy this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 amy_farrah_fowler You got me something?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Oh, not just something, no. It’s from the heart, it’s holiday-themed, and I swallowed the gift receipt so you cannot return it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 amy_farrah_fowler Look at you on Santa’s lap. That’s so sweet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Of course it is. It’s the perfect gift. How are you feeling right now? Guilty? Sad? Wishing you were Jewish?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 amy_farrah_fowler No, I love it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Oh, really? Well, how about now? Happy holidays to my dear Amy. I hope you treasure this as much as I treasure you. And you got me nothing. Christmas is ruined. Let’s never speak of it again. Well, this was fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 amy_farrah_fowler Actually, I did get you something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon_cooper But what about our agreement?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 amy_farrah_fowler Well, you got me something. Here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon_cooper Cookies?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 amy_farrah_fowler They’re your Meemaw’s Christmas cookies. I called and got the recipe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon_cooper They’re perfect. It tastes like her hugs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 amy_farrah_fowler Merry Christmas, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 sheldon_cooper I can’t believe this. You’re happy, I’m happy. Well, maybe a holiday that’s all about giving isn’t so… Get your hand out of that box.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 amy_farrah_fowler Okay. The next game is called Hot Boiled Beans.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 penny Of course it is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 amy_farrah_fowler One person is sent out of the room while the others hide a small item. Then they invite the first person back by saying hot boiled beans and bacon for supper, hurry up before it gets cold.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode11 raj_koothrappali If you people think this is better than Tom Hanks-giving, you’re all crazy.
