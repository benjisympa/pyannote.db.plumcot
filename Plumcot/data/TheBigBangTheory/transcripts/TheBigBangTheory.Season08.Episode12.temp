TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon What colour would you like to be?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 leonard Well, I’d like to be green, but you know you always take it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon That’s not true. Any colour’s fine with me. Yeah, I could be a-a combination of blue and yellow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 leonard Blue and yellow make green.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon Well, then it’s settled.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 penny Hi. Ready to go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon Oh, good news, we ordered lunch, so we can all stay here and play Lord of the Rings Risk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 amy Sheldon, we said that we would play games with you tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon Oh, no, we’ll still be playing it tonight, this game can easily take eight hours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 penny Sweetie, you really thought I’d want to do this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 leonard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 penny Well, did you tell him that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 leonard Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 penny Did you say it out loud with words?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 leonard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 penny I don’t want to spend the whole day playing a board game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon Yeah, well, you may change your mind when you hear that this is the new expanded edition which contains a more complete map of Middle Earth, now including the Haradwaith Territories.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 amy I will literally race you to the car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 leonard No, no, no, come on, don’t leave. Just try it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 penny No. We’re always doing what you guys want. Just once, it’d be nice if you did something we wanted.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon You want to be green?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 leonard You know, they really have tried to like a lot of the same stuff we’re into.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 penny Yeah, we do game nights and video game nights and we watch movies with director’s commentary.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 amy Oh, my favourite, George Lucas can talk all the way through Star Wars, I say one word and I’m banished to the kitchen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 penny Yeah, today Amy and I are deciding what we’re all gonna do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 leonard You got it, you girls are in charge.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 penny Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 amy Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon Fine. Now that we’re not playing, you can be green.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 leonard Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon And since you’re green this time, I can be it next time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 penny All right, let’s see. What’s something fun the guys would never take us to do? Oh, I know, we could go horseback riding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 amy I actually can’t. My hips don’t open wider than 22 degrees. I rode a very thin pony once. On the first bump, just popped right off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 penny All right, well, what do you want to do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 amy There’s a craft and folk art museum on Wilshire.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 penny Well, that’s Wilshire’s problem. Come on, you know, there, there’s got to be something fun we could do that the guys will hate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 leonard Hang on, why do we have to hate it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 penny Three words, Doctor Who convention.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 leonard I did not force you to go to that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 penny You walked out of the house in a fez and bow tie. I went so you didn’t get beat up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 leonard I wasn’t gonna get beat up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 penny You were, but somehow I held myself back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon You know what you could make us do? Ice-skating. The cold air will trigger Leonard’s asthma and it plays right into my well-known fear of getting flattened by a Zamboni.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 leonard Now you’re helping them find ways to make us miserable?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon Well, I’m sorry, Leonard, I’m a problem-solver, it’s what I do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 amy I actually can’t go ice-skating. I have unnaturally brittle ankles.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 penny Is there any part of your body that’s normal?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 raj Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 howard Will you please relax?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 raj I can’t take it, dude.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 bernadette You okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 raj No, I’m not okay. I feel like I’m gonna jump out of my skin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 bernadette I told you not to wax down there. It’s itchy when it grows back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 raj I’m worried about the New Horizons space probe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 bernadette What’s he talking about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 howard Nine years ago he was part of a team that launched a spacecraft to collect data about Pluto, and it’s finally close enough, so this morning it turned itself on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 raj We hope. The signal has to travel over three billion miles. So it’s gonna be hours before we know if it even survived.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 howard Now we get to see him flip out because he’s worried it was demolished by space ice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 raj Space ice is no joke. I can’t even watch Frozen anymore.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 amy Ooh, the philharmonic is playing Beethoven downtown.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon Before you say yes, it’s not the movie about the big dog.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 penny How come we can’t think of something we both want to do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 amy Because you always pick what we do and I just go along with it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 leonard Ah, interesting, we’re being accused of making you do things you don’t like, and here you are, doing the same thing to poor Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon You should point out the hypocrisy of that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 leonard That’s what I was doing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon Oh, that wasn’t clear. Try it again, but this time drive it home with how do you like them apples, Missy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 penny All right, keep thinking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon You’re making it too complicated. Why not stick to the basics? Go shopping for clothes while Leonard and I sit in those uncomfortable chairs and hold your purses, hmm? I know I’d hate that. Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 leonard Well, yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon Well, then, it’s settled?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 amy What do you say? Sounds kind of perfect.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 penny It does, somehow he managed to take all the fun out of it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon Well, once again, it’s what I do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 raj Oh, another two hours to go. The wait is killing me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 howard I know. I get it. When I was in the Soyuz capsule returning from the space station, plummeting toward Earth at 17,000 miles per hour…
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 raj Before you finish, is this a story about patience and waiting or just another reminder that you went to space?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 howard A story can do two things.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 raj Ugh, I feel like I’m gonna have a heart attack.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 howard You work in pharmaceuticals, don’t you have anything you can give him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 bernadette All I have is our new urine flow drug. Won’t help with his anxiety, but it’s so strong, when he pees he’ll fly around the room like he’s got a jet pack.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 raj I can’t stop thinking about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 bernadette You know, worrying won’t have any effect on what happens.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 raj I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 howard Maybe you need to do something more productive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 raj Okay. If I make this shot in the trash can, the probe will have arrived in perfect working order.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 howard So, in addition to being crazy, you’re resting the fate of the mission on your athletic prowess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 raj Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 howard The man who crashed his stationary bike.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 raj I didn’t crash it, okay? My playlist was too up-tempo, I got light-headed and I fell off. Okay. It all comes down to this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 howard You happy? Now you can relax.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 raj What kind of scientist are you? Everyone knows you got to make two out of three.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 leonard This isn’t so bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon That’s easy for you to say. Your chair’s not facing the lingerie section. Boy, that’s a lot of panties.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 amy You guys comfy? This might take a while.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon I don’t understand why women insist on making a big production out of buying clothes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 penny No, you’re right, we should do what you do. Have our mom send us pants from the Walmart in Houston.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon They have a man there who understands my personal style.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 penny Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 leonard Uh, I’ve got some bad news. There’s no cell service in here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon Oh. Well, that’s all right. There were plenty of ways to pass the time before smart phones were invented.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 leonard That’s true.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon I’ll look them up. Son of a biscuit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 leonard Sheldon, it’s fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon No, it’s not fine. What kind of store in the 21st century doesn’t at least have Wi-Fi? I’m going to call their corporate office. Son of a biscuit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon Let’s see, my armies are going to attack the Shire from Buckland. And I roll a five and a three.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 leonard Okay. And to defend, I roll two sixes. I win.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon Boy, double-sixes again. You know, if I hadn’t seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn’t believe it. I wonder how long we’re gonna be stuck here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 leonard I don’t know, but the girls do a lot for us. It’s the least we can do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon Oh, that’s true. I suppose it’s only fair we make compromises.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 leonard Look at you, being all mature.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon I don’t know why you’re so surprised. If there’s one thing I know about after living with you for so many years, it’s how to compromise.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 leonard I, I’m sorry? You make compromises for me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon All the time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 leonard On Earth? In our lives? That, that, that we’re living?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon Oh, yes. I, just yesterday, you had a, a big piece of lettuce stuck in your teeth at lunch. Did I say anything? No. I compromised and kept my mouth shut. Like you should’ve, because everyone was laughing at you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 leonard That is not a compromise. A compromise is me driving you everywhere because you refuse to learn how.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon Oh, I learned how. Amy taught me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 leonard What? Then. then why don’t you do it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon Uh, well, it’s scary. And sometimes I get the pedals mixed up. But, more importantly, driving me to work is one of the things that gives your life purpose. I can’t take that away from you, so what do I do? Oh, come on, I’m practically feeding you the answer. I compromise.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 raj Hey, uh, thanks for keeping me company.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 howard I’m happy to. I think getting out of the apartment will do you good. So, where we headed?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 raj If it’s okay with you, I’d like to go to temple.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 howard Buddy, trust me, you don’t want to convert to Judaism. I mean, I know I make it look cool, but it’s not all briskets and dreidels.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 raj I meant a Hindu temple.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 howard Oh. Okay. It’s not like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, right? Some bald guy with horns isn’t gonna rip my heart out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 raj Dude, that movie’s an imperialist fantasy that makes the followers of a beautiful and peaceful religion look like a bunch of bloodthirsty barbarians.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 howard You love that movie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 raj Yeah, it’s pretty great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 howard I’m surprised to see you suddenly get religious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 raj Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 howard Well, because I’ve known you for ten years and you’ve never gone to temple, you never talked about believing in God, and last Diwali I watched you eat two pounds of sacred cow at a Brazilian steak house.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 raj Religion is a very personal thing. I do go to temple, I just, I don’t talk about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 howard Yeah, but you’re a scientist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 raj So?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 howard So, as a scientist, you believe the way to understand the universe is through facts and evidence, and now you’re counting on some blue chick with a hundred arms to help you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 raj That is so offensive. Does everything you know about Hinduism come from Indiana Jones?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 howard No. There’s also Apu from The Simpsons.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 raj Well, lots of scientists believe in God. Okay? Newton, uh, Faraday, uh, Pascal, all were believers. Even Einstein was famous for attacking quantum theory on the grounds that God does not play dice with the universe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 howard Well, of course he believed in God. he slept with Marilyn Monroe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 raj Actually there’s no proof of that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 howard You believe in your religion, I’ll believe in mine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 amy How’s it going in there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 penny Uh, not really a great outfit for work, unless something opens up in the hookers and whores division. Hey, can I ask you something?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 amy Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 penny Do I really force you to do things you don’t want to?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 amy Yeah, but it’s okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 penny How is it okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 amy I promised myself, if I ever got friends, I’d do whatever they said. Really, I’m lucky you found me before a cult did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 penny Well, you know, that was a long time ago. You’re a different woman now. You’re smart, you’ve got great friends, you’ve got a boyfriend, you’re pretty, you have zero fashion sense, but, anyway, tonight we’re gonna do whatever you want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 amy Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 penny Absolutely. You name it, we’re doing it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 amy Basket weaving at the craft museum.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 penny Well, you named it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon Oh, here’s another one. I wish that the apple pancake mix was on the top shelf because it starts with an A, but I don’t put it there because I don’t want you breaking one of your little legs when you’re supposed to be making my breakfast.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 leonard Is it my turn to talk about the compromises I make?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon I wasn’t done, but go ahead. He said, compromising.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 leonard Because of you, I’m not allowed to adjust the temperature in my own home. I’m not allowed to whistle. I don’t wear shoes that might squeak.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon Well, you’re a physicist, not a circus clown.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 leonard Sheldon, do you realize I don’t live with the woman I love because of you? No other reason. Just you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon Is that true?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 leonard Yes, it’s true. The last time I brought it up, you had an emotional breakdown and got on a train and ran away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon Well, given my history on the subject, t seems a little reckless to bring it up now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 leonard You have no idea how much you inconvenience the lives of everyone around you. It’s exhausting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon You know what? You think you’re so tolerant, but the truth is you’re mean to me a lot. Yeah, you think that I don’t notice all those sarcastic comments and those eye rolls, but I do. Hmm? I have excellent peripheral vision. On a good day, I can see my ears.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 leonard Sheldon, I, I’m sorry if I hurt your feelings. I’ve been holding a lot of this in for a while.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon Well, I’m sorry, too. And if you want to live with Penny, then I think you should.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 leonard Do you mean that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon Yes. Yeah, just put on your squeaky shoes and eee-eee-eee your way out of my life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 leonard Come on, don’t get upset.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon I’m not upset. I’m just imagining a world without my best friend in it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 leonard Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon It’s okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 leonard I’m not leaving your world. I’m just talking about living across the hall.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon I understand. Either way, I want you to know that I’m aware of how difficult I can be. So I just want to say thank you for putting up with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 leonard Buddy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 penny How are you guys getting along? What? Why are there tears?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 leonard Everything’s fine. We just started talking about living arrangements.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 amy Are you crazy? You know he’s a flight risk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon That’s exactly what I told him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 penny Sheldon, we know this is a sensitive subject, and Leonard’s not gonna move out until you’re ready.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon Well, what if you did it gradually?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 leonard All right. How about we start with two nights a week I live with Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon How about one night and I let you whistle?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 leonard Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon When I’m not home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 leonard You got it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon There we go, compromising again. We really are the best.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 howard Here we go, my first Hindu temple.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 raj You see behind the fountain, that tower that looks like a pyramid? It’s called a Sikhara. It symbolizes the, the connection between the human and the divine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 howard Huh. I always thought it was mini golf.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 raj All right. Shall we?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 howard Yeah. Just, uh, is there anything I should know before I go in?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 raj Like what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 howard Like am I dressed okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 raj Really? So every other place you’ve been, you thought this was fine?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 howard I know you’re under a lot of pressure, so I’m gonna let that pass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 raj Sorry. You’re right. I’m so stressed. But you know what, whenever I walk into that temple I realize that whatever happens, it’s okay. We’re all part of an immense pattern, and though we can’t understand it, we can be happy to know that it’s, it’s working its will through us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 howard That’s nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 raj Whether you call it God or the universe or the self, we’re all interconnected, and that’s just a beautiful… Son of a bitch, that guy just dinged my car. S, seriously? You were just gonna drive away? Like my life isn’t hard enough right now. A space probe might be destroyed, my parents are going through an awful divorce, the guy who cuts my dog’s hair just gave her bangs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 howard Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 raj You saw her. She looks like Jim Carrey from Dumb and Dumber.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 howard Raj, you just got a text. The probe turned on. It’s fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 raj Oh, good. Namaste, Grandpa.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 leonard I thought this was gonna be boring, but it’s actually kind of fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 penny Don’t tell Amy that. We’ll be here every Sunday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 amy Sheldon, that really is an excellent basket.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon It’s not a basket. It’s a soldier’s helmet from 16th century China.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 amy Very nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 leonard Yeah, it looks great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon I saw that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 leonard Well, roomie, it’s only one night a week, but it’s a start.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 penny I know. I’m really proud of Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 leonard Yeah, I’m proud of him, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode12 sheldon Can you keep it down? Some of us are trying to sleep out here.
