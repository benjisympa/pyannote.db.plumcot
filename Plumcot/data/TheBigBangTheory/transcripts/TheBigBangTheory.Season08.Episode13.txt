TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Okay, we’re headed out, see you later.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Before you leave, could you test these noise-cancelling headphones?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Okay. Go ahead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Hello, can you hear me? Sheldon, I haven’t changed the filter in the water pitcher in two years.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 penny Uh, Bernadette’s nickname for you is the virgin piña colada.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Your George Lucas autograph is really a me autograph.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 penny Yeah, once I was too lazy to walk across the hall, so I used your toothbrush.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Ooh, and one time when you were asleep, Amy totally took off her… and that’s why you’re the best roommate ever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Aw, now I’m sad I didn’t hear it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 penny So what do you need the headphones for?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Well, I’ve been struggling for months to come up with a theory of dark matter that doesn’t make protons decay. I’m hoping to finally tackle it by optimising my work environment. See, I’ve got, uh, my tea is at the perfect sipping temperature. Uh, I have fleece-lined boxer shorts to keep my tushie toasty. And then, oh, last but not least, this inspirational cat poster improved with the reassuring face of physics renegade Richard Feynman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 penny Is that why you had to take him to Office Depot last night?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter I don’t want to talk about it. There, the place is all yours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 penny Yeah, have fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Oh, I will, nothing more fun than a paradigm-shifting evening of science.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 penny And you thought it was soaping me up in the shower.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Okay. Here we go. Proton decay. Proton decay. Proton decay. Proton decay. Proton decay. Proton decay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Hey, we’re home. Any progress?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper How could there be, with these constant interruptions?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 penny I love him, but if he’s broken, let’s not get a new one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter What are you doing? It’s time to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper I’m not going to work today. And would you like to know why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Ah, you’re upset because you spent the whole night working on dark matter and didn’t make a breakthrough, and now you’re worried you made a huge mistake switching fields, and you’re gonna sit around and sulk all day?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Like a big old baby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Call me if you need anything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper I’ve been cooped up in here too long. Maybe I need some fresh air.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 penny Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 penny Ugh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 penny Ugh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 penny Ugh, what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper You sounded in distress. I was worried something unpleasant was happening to you. Like a murder. Or spontaneous coitus with Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 penny Oh, I’m just doing this awful workout. I hate it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Well, if you hate it, then why are you doing it? Although I could ask the same question about coitus with Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 penny I don’t know, I guess I like that I hate it. It makes me work harder.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper And to clarify?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 penny The exercise, Sheldon. Shouldn’t you be getting ready for work?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper I’m not going. Would you like to know why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 penny Uh, you’re sad about not getting anything done last night, so you’re gonna sit around and pout about it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Boy, I’m not nearly as mysterious as I think I am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 howard_wolowitz I invented a game. You want to play?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 howard_wolowitz It’s called Emily or Cinnamon. I give you actual quotes I’ve heard Raj say, and you guess if he was talking to his girlfriend or his dog.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 raj_koothrappali Go ahead, make fun. You can’t embarrass me, I’ve got a beautiful girlfriend and a dog who loves me so much she drinks my bathwater.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Okay, who was he talking to, Emily or Cinnamon? I want you to know, the bed feels so lonely when you’re not in it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 raj_koothrappali I may not be liking this game so much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Cinnamon. Give me another one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Okay, Emily or Cinnamon? Check it out, I got us matching sweaters.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter We all got the Christmas card, Cinnamon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 raj_koothrappali You know, a man can care deeply about a woman and a pet. It’s not strange.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Ooh, Emily. I heard him say that to Emily. Hey, I thought you were staying home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Yeah, I was, but after talking to Penny, I realised something. I, first, she’s trying much harder to stay attractive in this relationship than you are. And second, the reason I may not be progressing in my research is I’ve created too pleasant of an environment for myself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 howard_wolowitz What do you mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper According to a classic psychological experiment by Yerkes and Dodson, in order to maximize performance, one must create a state of productive anxiety. So I’d like to ask you all to do something for me. Keep me on my toes. Just throw me off my game. Essentially, go out of your way to make my life miserable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Hold on. What’s in it for us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Well, I suppose…
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Okay, we’ll do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Done.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler 33 seconds. Okay, that’ll be our baseline.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper You know, I don’t want to tell you how to do your job, but when a mouse completes a maze, it gets a food pellet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler It also gets its brain plucked out with tweezers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper And his last meal was a food pellet? You’re a monster.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler All right, next, we’re gonna introduce an anxiety-inducing stimulus, measure your stress levels and see how it affects your problem-solving rate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Very well. And good luck, I’m a pretty laid-back guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Ready? Begin. Why’d you pop it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper I’m sorry, I was aiming for your heart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Look, I know you don’t like it, but that’s the point of the experiment. I need to irritate you to find your optimal anxiety zone. And you said no to tickling, polka music or watching me eat a banana.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Who eats them horizontally?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler My mother said that’s how good girls do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Perhaps this was a waste of time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, you’re a remarkable scientist. Just be patient, I’m sure you’ll find the breakthrough you’ve been looking for.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler And if you only do solid research instead of making a groundbreaking discovery, what does it matter?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Only do solid research? I come to you for help, and you insult me? I thought the least that you would do would be…
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Look, your anxiety levels are right in the zone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Really? Oh, that’s fantastic. Now, wait, they’re dropping. Why are they dropping?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Because you’re happy they’re elevated.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Oh, that is infuriating. Ooh, look, they went back up again. Terrific. Oh, no, they went back down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 raj_koothrappali All right, guys, what game do you want to play?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Let’s see. How about Emily or Cinnamon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 raj_koothrappali You know what? I think it’s a little weird that you remember me saying all these things. Maybe the truth is, you’re jealous of all my relationships.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Oh, maybe I am. Who wouldn’t want to be the girl, or possibly dog, to hear the words you’re so lucky, you have the shiniest hair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter That is a tough one. Uh, I know he brushes both of them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Gentlemen, I have figured out the perfect way for you to irritate me. I’d like you to be my intellectual sparring partners. From now on, when I make an assertion, I need you to challenge it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter So you just want us to disagree with whatever you say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 raj_koothrappali And you think that’s going to help?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Well, I don’t think that’s gonna help at all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Oh, no, it will. See, by keeping my mind engaged, I’ll become more focused.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Howard’s right, that’ll never work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Stop fighting me on the premise. It’s scientifically valid. I’m going to advance propositions, I just want you to challenge me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 raj_koothrappali I don’t think that’s what you want at all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Why, of course it’s what I want. Why would I say it’s what I want if it’s not what I want?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Because it is what you want, and it’s not what you said.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper I ask you for one simple thing, and you can’t even do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Yes, we can.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Yeah, well, then do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Nah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper You guys are the worst. Thank you, I think that was helpful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 penny So, whichever rep has the best sales for the quarter gets a trip for two to Hawaii.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler That would be so romantic for you and Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 penny Yeah, clearly you haven’t seen him on the beach walking around with his metal detector.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler If I were going to Hawaii, I’d spend all my time at the Keck Observatory. Did you know that the telescopes there have better resolution than the Hubble?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 penny Really? Want to go to Hawaii?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Ladies? Ladies? Ladies?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 penny Come in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Ladies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 penny What’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Well, as you may know, I’ve been experimenting with elevated anxiety levels, and I thought, what better way to increase my discomfort than to subject myself to an evening of tasteless uncensored crotch talk?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 penny What exactly do you think goes on here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Well, conversations that you wouldn’t be comfortable having in front of the opposite sex. You know, who has the best cervix. Which sanitary napkin is all the rage right now. Men’s buttocks, and how you want to pat and squeeze them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski We were talking about Penny’s job.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper And how difficult it is to do when she’s bloated, cranky and crampy? Continue.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 penny Sheldon, we are just people. We talk about the same things you guys talk about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper You talk about if werewolves can swim? See, Leonard says yes, but I say it depends on if the human could swim before he was bitten. What do you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 penny Let’s just talk about our periods.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler No, hold on. All canines instinctively know how to swim. Why wouldn’t a werewolf have the same abilities?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski Well, they’re not a hundred percent wolf. They’re a werewolf, that’s only part wolf. It’s like comparing apples to oranges.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Thank you. Oh, and technically, it’s apples that turn into were-oranges when the moon is full. Hey, this is fun. We should do it sometime when you aren’t all PMS’ing. Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter What is going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Oh. Uh, I need to keep my anxiety at the right level, so I’m using Darth Vader, the Joker, and Godzilla’s roar to keep me in that sweet spot. Uh, I tried including Taylor Swift in the mix, but turns out I love her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Well, at least listen to it through headphones. I’m trying to sleep. Good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Boy, Taylor was right, haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler You’ve been working so much lately, I’m glad you didn’t forget about date night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Of course.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Maybe you want to put the notebook away and talk to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper I can do both. My brain is working at optimal capacity. I can have a conversation with you and solve the dark matter proton decay problem at the same time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Fine. How was your day?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Oh, you said it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon. Sheldon, I’m worried about you. You’re not eating, you haven’t slept in days, and, to be honest, that cap is starting to smell.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper I know. It’s replaced Godzilla as my principle source of anxiety.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Okay, so it’s one vote Emily, one vote Cinnamon. Penny, you’re the tiebreaker.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 penny Say the quote again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 howard_wolowitz It’s just so perfect that we’re both Libras.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 penny Wow, this is hard. I’m gonna say Cinnamon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 penny Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 raj_koothrappali Come on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 howard_wolowitz That was the last one, I promise. We won’t play any more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 raj_koothrappali Thank you. ‘Cause if she ever found out, it would hurt her feelings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski Emily’s feelings?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 raj_koothrappali Yes, Emily. Whatever. Where’s Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 penny Date night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter That can’t be much fun for Amy. You know, at work today, he tried his first Red Bull.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski What happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter He chased a squirrel around the quad for a while and then threw up in my car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski Don’t you think you should make him stop all this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 howard_wolowitz I don’t know, he’s not really hurting anybody.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter You didn’t have to scoop vomit out of your glove compartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper He is getting a lot of work done. He had a pretty interesting take on proton decay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 raj_koothrappali Wow, if he cracks that it’s a game changer, guys. It’ll completely redefine our understanding of the physical universe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Hmm, it would. Okay, back to Emily or Cinnamon? How can such a little girl eat such a big steak?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, I want you to take that cap off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper That nagging tone is helping my anxiety, yeah. But if you could maybe just go ten percent less shrill, that’d really put the zip-a-dee in my doo-dah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler I’m sorry, but you know we agreed not to bring work to date night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper There you go, perfect.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, stop it, I’m not kidding. Take the cap off, and put the notebook away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper But after months of struggling, I’m finally making progress.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler You don’t need to drive yourself crazy in order to be productive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Or do I, hmm? Sir Isaac Newton wrote his Principia while convinced he was an armadillo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler That’s not true.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Yeah, well, maybe it is, maybe it isn’t. I have been hallucinating lately.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, this has to stop. You need to get some sleep and take care of yourself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Amy, I have gotten more done in the last few days than I have since I made the switch to dark matter. What if I stop doing this, and it all goes away?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Your thoughts and ideas come from you, not from your anxiety.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Hmm, perhaps. But I’m not taking the cap off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler It’s one thing to make yourself miserable, but you’re making everyone around you miserable, too. Now, I’m telling you for the last time, take the cap off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Oh, really? What if I don’t? And before you answer that, can I have my dessert?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper And then she threw me out. Me, her very own boyfriend. When all I’ve done is try to help humanity reach of the world we live in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 Yeah, well, women, what are you gonna do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper I knew you’d understand, Armadillo Isaac Newton.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 penny Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Here we are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Hey. What are you trying to pull? The president of science isn’t in here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter You lie down, he’ll be here in a minute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Okay. Hey, I thought you were trying to trick me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 penny Now, you just get comfortable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper No, no, comfort is the enemy. You know what’s comfortable? Slippers and blankets and panda bears. Imagine a panda bear with Richard Feynman’s face on it. Warm up the car, Leonard, it’s poster time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Maybe in the morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 penny Yeah, you get some sleep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper No, I don’t want to go to sleep, you can’t make me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 penny You’re right, we can’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Yeah, darn straight, you can’t. Try to tell a grown man to go to sleep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 penny Soft kitty, warm kitty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Little ball of fur.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper That’s not gonna work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 penny Happy kitty, sleepy kitty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 together#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 Purr, purr, purr.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter You know, he can be a lot of trouble, but when I see him lying here asleep like this, I just think how easy it would be to hold a pillow over his face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 penny Mmmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 howard_wolowitz You look like you got some rest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Oh, I’m feeling much better. And I’ve also been continuing to make progress without artificially raising my anxiety levels.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter I turned on the heat in my car and some vomit came out, so my levels, right up there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 raj_koothrappali Hey, guys. Mind if Emily joins us for lunch?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Yeah, no problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Of course not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 emily_sweeney So I hear you guys have been playing a little game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Well, um, we were just kidding around.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode13 emily_sweeney Well, you may think it’s funny that Raj is sweet and sensitive, but I think it’s sexy. Ugh, why is there dog hair in your mouth?
