TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 penny So, tell me about your day, how’s it going with the particle detector?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Wow, you remember that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 penny Yeah, I listen to what you say. You’re building a particle detector using superfluid helium.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter You know, when you talk like that, I want to take you right here on this table.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 penny And you know from past experience this table cannot support both our weight. So, how’s the detector going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Well, it’s tricky working with superfluids. Whatever container you put them in, they kind of creep up the sides and crawl out all on their own.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 penny Kind of like Sheldon’s ant farm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Exactly, except you don’t have a lunatic running around, yelling, I fed you sugar water, why are you biting me? Come on, this is boring, you really want to talk about this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 penny No, I do. I didn’t write superfluid helium on this napkin for nothing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Okay, well, this is cool. Uh, there’s a thing called superfluid vacuum theory, where empty space is imagined as a superfluid with all of its qualities, viscosity, density, surface tension…
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 penny Hey, if you’re pausing for dramatic effect, I’d keep it moving.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter No, no. People don’t talk about surface tension. If you imagine our three-space as the surface of an N-dimensional superfluid bubble… This is exciting. This is really exciting. I have to go find Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 penny Okay, well, if you find him, use the kitchen island, that coffee table will not support both of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Which means a spherical multidimensional superfluid shows the same negative-energy density as space-time. So what do you think? What do you think? So what do you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter What? Is it wrong? Have you seen it somewhere else?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter I know this isn’t my area, and I could never do the math like you can, but could this be something?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Well, you could have set Newton’s gravitational constant to one. And, ugh, the whole thing reeks of blueberry. You know I can’t stand these scented markers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter No one told you to taste them. Come on, is, is this good or not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper It’s good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper I like it. I think you’re on to something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter You do? You’re not messing with me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Not at all. In fact, I have got something for just such an occasion. I was starting to think I might never get a chance to give it to you. Good job.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter You’re giving me a sticker?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Not just a sticker. That is a sticker of a kitty saying me-wow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter I’m not a preschooler.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Fine, I’ll take it back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter I earned this. Back off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter You’re still awake?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper For a man whose last observation was our universe may be the surface of a multidimensional supercooled liquid, you’re still awake seems like quite the sophomore slump.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter You worked out all the math.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Oh, I did more than work out all the math. I wrote a paper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter You wrote a paper on my idea?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper I wrote a paper on our idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter When did my idea become our idea?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper When I mixed it with Sheldony goodness and cooked it in the Easy-Bake oven of my mind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter This is good. Our idea is really good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Well, the lightbulb in this oven is ridiculously bright.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter You know, if no one’s thought of this, yet, this could be a big deal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Only way we’ll know for sure is if we post it online to the pre-print server. I have it ready to go, but I wasn’t gonna do it without you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Wow, it’s all happening so fast. Should we just sleep on it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper We could, but we always run the risk of someone else beating us to the punch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter You’re sure it’s good?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper My name is right on there with yours. That is a surefire mark of quality. That might as well say directed by Joss Whedon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Okay, partner, let’s do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Come on. Click the mouse with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter One, two three.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 together#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 Click.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Well, we did it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Yes, we did, my friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Is your tongue blue?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper I don’t want to talk about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski Okay, movie night, what do you want to watch?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler Whatever happened to that ape movie you were in?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 penny Oh, God. Probably nothing. I think I saw the director twirling a sign outside the Verizon store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski Search for it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 penny What, no, why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski ‘Cause it would be fun to watch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 penny It would be humiliating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski Well, now we have two reasons.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler They have it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski Please, can we watch it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler Please?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 penny Fine, but I’m telling you, it’s terrible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler Have you even seen it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski Well, maybe it turned out better than you think.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 voice_on_tv#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 Bananas, get your fresh bananas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski Ho-ho, it really didn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, this is superfluid helium. Put this in your mouth, your tongue will freeze and break off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Does it smell like blueberries?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Then we’re probably okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 howard_wolowitz Hey, your paper got mentioned on the Quantum Diaries physics blog.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Really? What’d they say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 howard_wolowitz Uh, it’s basically a summary of the theory, but there’s a bunch of positive comments on the message board.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Let me see, let me see. One calls it insightful and innovative. We’re insightful and innovative.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Oh, nice to meet you, Mr. Insightful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Oh, the pleasure is mine, Mr. Innovative. Uh, another one says the concept shows some real out-of-the-box thinking. Do you hear that, Mr. Out-Of-The?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper I do, indeed, Mr. Box-Thinking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 howard_wolowitz How are you today, Mr. Can-You-Believe-These-Jack-Asses?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Just dandy, Mr I-Wish-I-Was-Better-At-Improv.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Read another one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Okay, okay. Uh, the analogy between space-time and a supercooled fluid is either meaningless or false. I wish this blog would devote itself to real science instead of wasting our time with crackpot wannabe theoreticians in a rush to publish.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Who wrote that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter It’s anonymous, and user name General Relativity.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Well, I’m responding to it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Uh, don’t lower yourself to their level.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Look, I am simply going to defend our work, scientist to scientist. And failing that, suggest that his mother enjoys a string of both human and non-human lovers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, my name’s on that paper, too. There’s no upside to doing this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper He just left another comment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 raj_koothrappali What does it say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Upon review, I’ve changed my mind about the Cooper-Hofstadter hypothesis that space-time is like a superfluid. In fact, it’s inspired me to come up with my own theory. Maybe space-time is like two clowns with their heads in a bucket, much like Cooper and Hofstadter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Can I respond now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper You mess with the bull, you get the horns. I’m about to show this guy just how horny I can be.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Somebody else do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 penny Doctor, please help me. I think I might be turning into a killer gorilla.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 doctor Why do you think you’re turning into a killer gorilla and not just a regular gorilla?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 penny Because regular gorillas are vegetarians, and I just bit the fingers off your receptionist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 penny Okay, we’ve seen plenty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski No, give me the remote.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler Careful. She’ll bite your fingers off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 penny Okay, well, I’ve been poking around the internet, and I think I found something we’ll enjoy watching even more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler What is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 penny Oh, just a video of Bernadette in a beauty pageant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski Okay, I learned my lesson. Making fun of people is wrong.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler I haven’t learned my lesson. Play it. Play it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski Hi. I’m Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski from Yorba Linda, California.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 penny You look like a talking cupcake.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski And you should pick me for Miss California Quiznos 1999, because I want to tell you what I want, what I really really want, l tell you what I want, what I really really want, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna Really, really, really be Miss California Quiznos 1999.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler Play it again. Play it again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Did he respond yet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Hmm. No, not yet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Well, maybe we shouldn’t have sunk to his level.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 howard_wolowitz It wasn’t that bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Read it back one more time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper My good sir, we are neither crackpots nor wannabes. In fact, we are experts in our fields. And while you hide behind your anonymity, we stand behind our paper. And later tonight, your mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter And you don’t think that’s too rough?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper We’re just standing behind her. It’s not like we’re gonna say boo and scare her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 penny How could you not tell us you were in beauty pageants?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski ‘Cause it’s embarrassing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 penny It is; it truly is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, well, Amy writes Little House on the Prairie fan fiction about herself and posts it on the Internet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler Why? What did I do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski Sorry, I had to get the spotlight off me, and tearing down other women is part of my pageant training.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 penny Okay. We are reading that right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler No, please don’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski We got embarrassed tonight. Come on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler But it’s personal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 penny Why? Is it about you and Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 penny Oh, my God, it’s about her and Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler It’s not about me and Sheldon. It’s about a young woman in the 1800s named Amelia, and the time-traveling physicist named Cooper she falls in love with.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 penny Please show us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski Please?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 penny You know I’m gonna read it either way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler Good luck finding it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 penny Amelia and the time-trav… found it. It was just past dawn on the prairie, and like every morning, Amelia prepared to do her chores. Except something about this morning felt different.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski Why? Why did it feel different?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 penny Maybe it was the first whisper of winter in the air, or maybe it was the unconscious handsome man with porcelain skin and curious clothing she was about to discover lying in the field. A man who would open her mind to new possibilities and her body to new feelings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler You know, there was a time when I was alone and had no friends. I’m starting to miss that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper He still hasn’t responded. What’s taking him so long?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Do you really want him to write back?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Yeah, I do. Then no matter how he responds, I am going to destroy him with a picture of a bored cat saying oh, really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Me-wow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 howard_wolowitz What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 raj_koothrappali I’ve, uh, created some other user accounts so I can post positive comments about their paper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 howard_wolowitz This wee li’l bairn of a theory nearly blew my kilt off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 raj_koothrappali No. You have to read it how Dr. Angus McDougal of the University of Edinburgh would. This wee li’l bairn of a theory nearly blew me kilt off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper He wrote back. Cooper and Hofstadter resorting to juvenile attempts at humour is proof they have nothing to back up their ridiculous paper. It should come as no surprise given they work at Cal Tech, essentially a technical school, where even the physicists are basically engineers. Engineers? Do you know how insulting that is?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 howard_wolowitz Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Guys, this person’s just going out of their way to get a rise out of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Yeah, but it’s still so aggravating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Yeah, well, all the other comments said really nice things. Focus on those.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 howard_wolowitz Yeah. Dr. Dmitri Plancovik of Moscow University said dis paper great, I love it more than wodka.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 raj_koothrappali See? Better with the accent.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper And send.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter What did you write?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper I’m done hiding from bullies. I’m taking this into the real world.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter What does that mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper I told him we’ll meet him face-to-face anytime, anywhere.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Are you crazy? You don’t know who this person is. Delete that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Come on, Sheldon!
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Oh, okay, okay, calm down. It’s him. He’s trying to video chat. Perhaps I shouldn’t have taken this into the real world.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Oh, really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 penny “Time travel? I don’t understand,” said Amelia. Cooper stared at her. ‘Which word don’t you understand, time or travel?”
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski Wow, even in your fantasies Sheldon’s kind of exhausting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler He’s like that in the beginning, so she can change him. It’s called good writing. And wishful thinking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 penny It stung Amelia when he spoke to her this way. In her little one-room schoolhouse, she was always the smartest student, regularly besting the boys in her class, but this was no boy in front of her, this was a man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski Here we go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 penny Cooper told Amelia about all the strange and incredible things the future would hold, like computers and living past 30. He asked her if she had any questions. All she longed to ask was if his heart was beating as fast as hers, but she was too afraid to hear the answer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, Amelia.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 penny So instead she asked if, in the future, Montana ever became a state.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler In the 1800s that was considered flirting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 raj_koothrappali I’m so sick of people being mean on the Internet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 howard_wolowitz Well, I think the anonymity makes everyone feel like they can say things they’d never say to your face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Interesting. I can’t think of a single thing I wouldn’t say to someone’s face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Never noticed that about you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 raj_koothrappali You know what? At least you guys did something. You know, you, you had a theory, you wrote a paper, you made an actual contribution. All guys like this do is just stand on other people’s work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper He’s right. I say we call this person back. We’ve got no reason to hide.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter All right, do it. Call him. Let’s find out what this loser’s ever accomplished.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Click it with me. One, two, three, click.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 stephen_hawking Well, hello there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Professor Hawking?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 stephen_hawking Oh, brother, you should see the look on your faces.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter You really didn’t like our paper?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 stephen_hawking I like your paper very much. The premise is intriguing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Then why are you attacking us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 stephen_hawking If you were sitting in a chair for 40 years, you’d get bored, too. Anyway, got to go. I promised to help the neighbour kid with his maths homework. Ciao.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Stephen Hawking liked our paper. Said the premise is intriguing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Good to see you again, Mr. Stephen-Hawking Liked-Our-Paper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter And you as well, Mr. Our-Premise-Is-Intriguing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 howard_wolowitz How do you do, Mr. I’ll-Admit-That’s-Pretty-Cool?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Yeah, you keep setting me up for failure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 penny With a heavy heart, Amelia stood before the newly repaired time machine. She regretted giving Cooper the part he needed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski Because she wanted him to give her the part she needed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler Okay, that’s enough.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 penny What? No, I really want to know what happens, and Bernadette really, really, really wants to know what happens.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler You’re just making fun of me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski I was just kidding. I’m sorry. And the story’s really good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 penny No, it is. Does he stay? Do they kiss? Does she find out about Montana?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski Please?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler Fine. As Cooper prepared to depart, tears filled Amelia’s eyes. He took her hand in his and said, “I can’t stay, but I will never forget you.” He brushed his fingers against her cheek, then quickly stepped into the machine. “Please don’t go,” she whispered. But it was too late. The engine hummed to life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski But they didn’t even kiss.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler She turned away, wiping her eyes. She couldn’t bear to watch her one chance at true love disappear forever. Then she felt a strong hand on her shoulder spin her around. It was Cooper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 penny Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler “What about the future?” asked Amelia. He looked deeply into her eyes and whispered, “There is no future without you.” He pulled her in close. She began to tremble all over. She felt his warm breath…
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter You will not believe what Stephen Hawking just said.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 penny Get out!
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski Not now!
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 amelia#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 Is the water warm enough?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Given the fact that you took the time to build a wood fire, draw the water from the well and heat it, it would be rude to complain. But since you asked, it’s a little nippy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 amelia#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 I can fix that. I couldn’t help but notice your unusual undergarments.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper They’re not undergarments. They’re Underoos. Where I come from, they’re known as underwear that’s fun to wear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 amelia#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 And what’s the significance of the spider?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Oh, that represents Spider-Man. He does whatever a spider can.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 amelia#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 There’s a lot of rhyming in the future, isn’t there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter You’re right. This is even weirder than I thought.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 penny You want me to stop reading?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Are you kidding? No, no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 penny As he stood for Amelia to dry him…
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 amelia#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 So, tell me, Cooper, are the ways of physical love different in the future?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, okay, I’m good.
