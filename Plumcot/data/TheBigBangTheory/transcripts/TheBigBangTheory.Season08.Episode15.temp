TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon I’ve invented a science joke, would you like to hear it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 amy Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon How many Edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 amy How many?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon Who cares? He stole the idea and doesn’t deserve his own joke.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 amy Is that really true?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon Of course, that’s how you know it’s a good joke. It not only entertains, it informs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 barry Hey, sowwy to intewupt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon Uh, Barry, uh, how many Edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 barry Did you know Edison didn’t actuawy invent the wight bulb?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon What do you want, Barry?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 barry Just wanted to dwop this off as a wittle thank you for Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 amy What’s this for?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 barry Your idea weawy hewped me out. My wight-cone quantization paper’s onwine alweady. The wesponse has been amazing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 amy Well, that’s fascinating. I can’t wait to read it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon Oh, no, me as well. Uh, please e-mail it to Sheldon at bazinga dot biz. Why dot biz? Because I just gave you the business. And also bazinga dot com was taken.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 barry Anyway, thanks again. Cooper, suck eggs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon Since when do you help out Barry Kripke?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 amy Well, I’d been thinking about a cellular automata approach to neuronal connectivity, and I thought it might have some interesting applications to string theory, it’s not a big deal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon Oh, really? When I was doing string theory and hit a dead end, why didn’t you try to help me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 amy I did. You said the only math biologists know is if you have three frogs and one hops away, that leaves two frogs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon That’s pretty funny, that does sound like me. But that doesn’t mean that you should be standing on street corners handing out your math to whatever guy comes along.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 amy Sheldon, we’re all scientists. I helped out a fellow colleague. You’re being petty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon I’m being petty? You know Barry and I have a professional rivalry. You heard him, he told me to suck eggs. If we were friends, he would have suggested I suck something more pleasant. Why are you laughing? Did you learn something?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 howard Okay, Ma. Say hi to Aunt Gladys. Yeah, I love you, too. Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 bernadette Your mom having fun in Florida?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 howard Mmm, she loves it. She finally found a place where everyone talks about how sweaty they are. Anyway, she wants us to go to the house and check in on Stuart because he might be lonely.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 bernadette She’s just being nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 howard Well, I’m her son, how come she doesn’t send someone to check on me if I’m lonely?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 bernadette Because you have a wife.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 howard Yeah, well, sometimes you work late.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 bernadette I know you don’t like Stuart being in the house, but the store’s about to reopen, I’m sure he’ll get back on his feet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 howard That would be great. I’d love for things between me and Mom to get back to normal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 bernadette Well, normal’s a strong word, but sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 penny Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 penny You okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon If I was okay, I would’ve said hello, and not the much more ominous hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 penny What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon I’m mad at Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 penny Did she leave pit stains in your favourite crop top, too?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon No. She helped Barry Kripke make an advancement in string theory.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 penny Oh, that sounds like a good thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon Well, it would be, except that I left string theory because I decided it was a dead end. Yeah, and then she went behind my back to help someone else prove me wrong. My rival, no less. I’m sorry you had to see that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 penny I’m sorry I didn’t have a camera.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon Why would she do this to me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 penny Well, I’m sure she didn’t upset you on purpose. Besides, aren’t you the one who says there’s nothing more important than the advancement of science?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon No, I said there’s nothing more important than me advancing science.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 penny All right, well, if I’m understanding this right, and all she did was help out another scientist, I’m thinking you might have to let this one go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon Ugh, let it go. I have heard that my whole life. Every time something upsets me somebody says, let it go, you know, like it’s my fault, and it’s not okay to feel the way I feel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 penny I don’t know what to tell you. I mean, why don’t you talk to her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon Is that all you have? Shopworn tidbits like talk to her and let it go? Gee, Penny, life’s giving me lemons. What should I do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 penny Well, you could shove them somewhere.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon Okay, now you’re getting creative.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 stuart Thanks again for your help.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 leonard No problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 raj Our pleasure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 leonard The place really looks great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 raj Yeah, you should have burned it down years ago.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 stuart I keep telling you I didn’t burn it down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 leonard We know, we know, because burning something down for the insurance money is a crime.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 bernadette Stuart, this place looks amazing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 stuart Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 howard You really did a nice job.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 stuart And thank you for putting up with me staying at your mom’s through all this. I couldn’t have done it otherwise.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 howard I appreciate that, and I’m glad you were able to… is that my mother’s furniture?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 stuart Yeah, she said I could use it. Doesn’t it look great?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 howard Not as great as it looks in the den where it belongs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 bernadette Howie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 howard Why don’t you just clean out the whole room? Take the string art clown I made her in third grade and the ribbon I got in swim class for putting my face in the water.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 stuart What is your problem? She said it was okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 howard Well, I’m her son, and I say it’s not okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 stuart Some son, looks like you spent ten minutes on that clown art.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 howard Well, maybe I should’ve gone to a fancy art school like you. Then I could run a failed comic shop and mooch off some guy’s mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 bernadette Why don’t we leave so you can cool off?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 stuart I think that’s a good idea. Take him out of my store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 howard Your store? My mother gave you the money to reopen. I’m not going anywhere.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 leonard Why don’t we go get the food for the party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 stuart Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 raj Smart, looks like we’re being helpful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 leonard Mmm, when really we’re just exiting an uncomfortable situation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon Kripke, you know, of all the people, Barry Kripke. I’m so… Are you folding that like a crazy person to get me to do it for you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon Oh, give me that. Just out of curiosity, if I were to let something go, how would I do that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 penny I don’t know, just think about something else.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon Can I think about the spiny anteater?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 penny Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon The spiny anteater never went behind my back and worked with Barry Kripke. That didn’t help at all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 penny You know, some people try visualization.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon How does that work?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 penny Okay, imagine your problems are a pen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 penny Now imagine you’re holding that pen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 penny Now open your hand and let it go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon But I just got this pen. It’s got my initials on it and everything. Look.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 penny Sheldon, this isn’t that hard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon I may have a better way that you can teach me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 penny How?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon What if I told you that over the past few months Amy has secretly been giving you little puzzles to test your intelligence against chimpanzees in her lab?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 penny What? She didn’t give me any puzzles.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon Are you sure?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 amy Boy, I just can’t seem to get these scissors back together. Can you do it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 amy Darn it. There’s something in my eye, and I need to sort these coins by size. Can you help?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 amy Penny? I really want to eat this banana, but it’s stuck inside this bamboo puzzle box.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 penny Son of a bitch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon Okay, that’s great. Now, let it go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 penny I can’t believe you were testing me against a chimp.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon Well, excuse me, Amy was testing you. I was rooting for you. Good job on that banana box, by the way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 penny Why would she even do this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon She’s been conducting an experiment on apes where they’re given various puzzles to solve. I was surprised at the complexity of the puzzles and thought some humans wouldn’t be able to solve them. That’s when Amy said, want to make this interesting?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 penny Make this interesting? You bet money on me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon No, no. We designed an experiment involving you. See? Now, isn’t that interesting?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 penny It’s not interesting. It’s incredibly insulting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon Okay, maybe this will help. Imagine you’re holding a pen. Before you go too far, not a special pen with your initials engraved on it, that’ll make the next part really hard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 penny Oh, my, that’s it. Get out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon I don’t understand why you’re mad at me. You should be mad at Amy. Like I was this afternoon. Hey, look at that, I let it go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 penny Get out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon I think I left my pen in there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 bernadette I understand why you’re upset, but he worked really hard to get the store ready. And it’s just furniture.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 howard It’s my mom’s furniture. It belongs in the house I grew up in, next to that pile of TV Guides and in plain view of what, for a ten-year-old, was a quality piece of string art.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 bernadette Howie, if the store succeeds, Stuart has a source of income, and he can move out of your mother’s house. Seems like some old furniture is a reasonable price to pay for that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 howard That is a good point. But I didn’t marry you for good points. I married you to blindly support me no matter how ridiculous I’m being.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 bernadette This is why I had to rewrite our wedding vows.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 leonard Hi, we’re here to pick up an order for Comic Center.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 waitress Sure, let me go check on that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 raj Dude, I, I think that’s Nathan Fillion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 leonard Oh yeah, look at that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 raj And he’s picking the tomatoes out of his salad just like I do. I always did feel a connection with him. Oh, I have got an idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 leonard We’re not selling his tomatoes on eBay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 raj No, if we got Captain Reynolds from Firefly to do a signing at Stuart’s store, that would be amazing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 leonard That would be great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 raj So should we go talk to him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 leonard I don’t know. I mean, if he’s not nice, it’s gonna make it hard for me to watch him in anything again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 raj What? The, the guy who plays Jon Snow was a jerk. We still watch Game of Thrones.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 leonard He was a jerk because you rear-ended him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 raj I was distracted. It’s weird seeing a member of the Night’s Watch with a kayak strapped to his car. Come on. Hi, excuse me, s, sorry, I, I don’t mean to bother you, but we’re just really big fans of Firefly. And Dr. Horrible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 nathan_fillion Oh, uh, I think you made a mistake. I’m not an actor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 raj Don’t say that. I mean, you’re not Dame Judi Dench, but you’re pretty great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 nathan_fillion Oh, yeah, I get it, you think I’m Nathan Fillion, but I’m not. So if you don’t mind, I would just love to eat my lunch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 leonard Come on. Sorry to bother you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 raj Don’t know why he’s so grumpy. I got mistaken for that guy in Life of Pi once, and I’m still floating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 amy Sheldon, it’s me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 penny Oh, hey. Did you see that? I, I figured out how to open the door all by myself. Maybe I’ll fling some faeces around my cage to celebrate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 amy What are you talking about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 penny I know you’ve been giving me secret puzzle tests.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 amy Sheldon, open the door.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon I can’t. I’m naked.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 amy I just saw you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon Hang on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 penny Open the door now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 amy Oh, hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 penny Pull up your pants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 amy It’s not a big deal. I run tests like this on undergrads all the time. If you fill out some paperwork at the university, I can get you five dollars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 penny I don’t want five dollars. I want my dignity.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 amy So what are we talking, like, ten bucks?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 leonard Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 raj Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 leonard Sorry again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 nathan_fillion No problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 raj Are you sure you’re not him? Uh, you can tell us. We’re scientists, not crazy fanboys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 nathan_fillion All right, fine. I’m him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 raj And you’re eating alone at a deli. I don’t buy it, you’re not him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 nathan_fillion I just wanted to eat my lunch in peace. But I really am him. And thank you very much for being a fan. If you want, uh, let’s take a picture.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 leonard That would be great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 raj Great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 leonard Yeah, thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 nathan_fillion You bet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 raj Wait, hang on. If you’re really Nathan Fillion, what’s the line from Firefly about your bonnet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 nathan_fillion I swear by my pretty floral bonnet, I will end you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 leonard That’s it, that’s the line.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 raj Although, I knew the line, doesn’t make me Nathan Fillion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 nathan_fillion Do you want the picture or not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 raj I want a picture with Nathan Fillion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 nathan How about a picture with a guy who looks like Nathan Fillion but a little more annoyed than Nathan Fillion usually is?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 leonard What do you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 raj Ah, it’s good enough for Facebook.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 leonard I can’t believe they did that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 penny I know, it’s so insulting. At one point, they had me figure out how to get a banana out of a puzzle box.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 leonard Wait, Sheldon gave me a banana in a box. He was testing me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 penny Unbelievable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 leonard And how could a chimp even solve that? That was impossible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 penny Really? You couldn’t get it out?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 amy Wow, the store looks great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 leonard So you guys were testing us both? What is the matter with you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 penny Eh, what’s the matter with them is they think they’re so smart they don’t care if they hurt other people’s feelings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 amy That’s not true.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon That sounds like us. I still don’t understand why you’re upset. You solved every puzzle faster than all of the chimps.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 amy Well, except Barnabas, but he was on Adderall.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 howard I’m sorry, but it’s making me crazy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 bernadette Can you please just let it go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon Oh, I can help you with that. Imagine you’re holding an ordinary pen. While your favourite pen is safe and secure in your pocket.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 howard Hold that thought. Hello?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 amy How can I make this up to you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 penny The answer’s in this puzzle box. Let’s see if you can open it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 stuart You could have at least warned him about the furniture.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 raj That’s what I said when we moved it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 bernadette You helped him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 raj No, Stuart picked out those throw pillows all on his own.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 leonard Hey, you okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 howard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 leonard What’s wrong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 howard My mom died.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 bernadette What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 howard Uh, that was my aunt. Ma took a nap. She never woke up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 bernadette Oh, my God, Howie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 leonard I’m so sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 raj What can we do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 howard I don’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon May I say something?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 leonard Not right now, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon But I think it would be comforting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 leonard Buddy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 howard No, it’s okay. What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon When I lost my own father, I didn’t have any friends to help me through it. You do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 penny I really thought he was gonna say let it go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 raj Okay, thanks, Bernadette. Travel safe. Okay, bye. Well, they’ve booked a flight. They’re heading to the airport now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 penny How’s Howard holding up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 raj He’s hanging in there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 leonard How are you doing, Stuart?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 stuart Still can’t believe she’s gone. I mean, that woman took me in. If it wasn’t for her, I, I would have been homeless.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 amy One of us would have taken you in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 stuart Yeah, I don’t recall any offers. But, you know what, uh, I, I’m glad it worked out the way it did because I got to know this wonderful person.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 raj Yeah. Mrs. Wolowitz was pretty special. When I first moved to America, Howard was my only friend and she made me feel so welcome in her home. Which says a lot, because, those first few years, she thought I was the gardener.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 penny Whenever I saw her, she’d say I was too skinny and try and feed me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 amy She did that to me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 penny Don’t take this away from me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon I didn’t care for her yelling. But now that I’m not going to hear it again, I’m sad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 leonard If you want, I can yell at you later.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 sheldon It won’t be as good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode15 leonard Let’s have a toast. To Mrs. Wolowitz. A loving mother to all of us. We’ll miss you.
