TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 amy I just read about an experiment designed to see if you could make two people fall in love in a matter of hours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 leonard That doesn’t sound right. My research has shown that it takes three to five years of shameless begging.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny Honey, neither of us comes off good in that story.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 raj Yeah, I, I, I saw that article you’re talking about. Uh, the participants ask each other a series of questions designed to promote intimacy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 amy And then they finish it off by staring into each other’s eyes for four minutes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon Oh, that’s nonsense. I proclaimed my love for you. And the last time I looked into your eyes was when you thought you had conjunctivitis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 amy Other than the fact that I had it, that was a magical night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny Raj, would you ever try an experiment like that with Emily?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 raj What? I don’t need science to win her heart. I have my family’s wealth for that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 leonard I’m telling you, you can’t create love in a few hours. Right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny Oh, careful. You’re poking at the whole foundation of The Bachelor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon Yeah, but we don’t have to debate this. We’re scientists. We can conduct our own research. I propose that we imprison two street people and…
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 amy No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon You didn’t even let me finish.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 amy Forget it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon So, you can experiment on all the apes you want. But I want to manipulate the emotions of two captive human beings, suddenly I’m the monster.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 raj Why don’t you just do the test?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon In the interest of science, I’d be willing to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny What? You’re okay with an experiment where you have to answer awkward questions about your innermost feelings?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny Please, can I do it with him? Please?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 leonard I’ve been listening to Sheldon’s feelings on things for ten years. Tag, you’re it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 raj Yeah, but what if the experiment works?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny I’m not gonna fall in love with Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 amy That’s what I said. Before I knew it, he pontificated his way right into my heart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon Uh, fun fact, pontificate comes from the Latin word pontifex, which means bridge builder or Pope.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 leonard In love yet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon Just out of curiosity, Penny, if this experiment does make us fall in love, would you drive me to Lake Geneva, Wisconsin for Gary Con? It’s the only convention celebrating the life and work of Gary Gygax, the co-creator of Dungeons and Dragons.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny You know what? I can honestly say if we fall in love, not only will I drive you there, I will buy you all the dragon T-shirts you want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon Okay, babe, let’s do this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 raj You guys are really being calm about Penny and Sheldon doing this thing. If it were me I’d, I’d be a little nervous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 amy Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 raj Well, even if the study’s nonsense, I don’t believe in tempting fate. Same reason I wouldn’t use a Ouija board, or pick a fight with an Asian guy. He probably doesn’t know karate, but why risk it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 amy I think we’re safe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 raj Well, that’s what the bullies at Bruce Lee’s high school thought. And then, bam. Karate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 leonard Well, are we just gonna sit here while they do the experiment?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 amy The two of us could do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 leonard Yeah, sure, that might be fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 amy What’s the first question?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 raj Hang on. Okay. Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 leonard Hmm. I can honestly say Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 amy Oh, then I choose a janitor, ’cause I’m about to throw up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 leonard I’m in love. Let’s do something else.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 raj Ooh, uh, Emily gets off work soon. Why don’t the four of us go out?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 leonard Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 amy Sounds good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 leonard Should we call Howard and Bernadette?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 raj I don’t know what time their plane gets in, but let me, let me shoot them a text.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 amy Did he say anything about the funeral?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 raj Not much, but he seemed to be in a pretty good place.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 howard Are you kidding me? You lost my mother’s ashes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 baggage_clerk No, I’m just saying that sometimes bags are misrouted.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 howard All right, fine. Where did you misroute the only woman who ever loved me? The first, well,
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 clerk I just need some information. Uh, what’s the flight number?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 bernadette Eight sixteen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 howard I really did mean first.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 bernadette Just drop it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 clerk And can you describe the bag?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 bernadette Um, well, it’s, uh, black. There’s a red ribbon tied to the handle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 howard The world’s greatest mom is in the shoe compartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon You ready to begin?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny Yup. Be right there. I assume you don’t want wine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon Correct. You’re not supposed to drink alcohol when operating heavy machinery.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny What heavy machinery? Let’s just start.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon Well, as a Texas gentleman, I’m inclined to say ladies first. Although, I’m concerned that level of politeness and charm might make you fall in love with me before the test even begins. Perhaps we should flip a coin. Or if you’re familiar with the rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors…
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny Question one. Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon Hmm. Living or dead?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny Just says anyone in the world. I guess that means living.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon Ah, that’s just as well. As much as I’d love to meet Euclid, inventor of the geometric proof, he probably wore sandals and I cannot look at toes during dinner. Oh, I know, the person I’d most like to have dinner with is myself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny You sure that’s your choice? ‘Cause I’ve had that dinner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon Well, I haven’t. And while they say never meet your heroes, I just don’t see how I could disappoint. Who would you choose?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny Robert Downey, Jr.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon Oh, I didn’t think of Iron Man. You know, maybe after myself and I have dinner, we can meet you two for dessert.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 raj So, what do you guys want to do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 amy Well, we’re the ones tagging along, you pick.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 emily Ooh, have you ever been to an escape room?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 leonard What’s that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 emily Um, it’s kind of like interactive theatre, except you have to solve puzzles in a certain amount of time to get out. There’s one downtown where they trap you in a room with a zombie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 raj Oh, so kind of like what’s happening with Penny right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon What would constitute a perfect day for you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny Uh, well, I’d probably sleep in, do a little yoga, then lie on the beach while cute cabana boys brought me drinks and probably get a massage and then cap off the night with some dancing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon That’s it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny Yeah, why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon You didn’t mention Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny He’s there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon I don’t think so. Leonard can’t stand yoga, the beach, massages or dancing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny Yeah, well, he brought a book, okay? What’s yours?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon Uh, I wake up. Uh, I enjoy some French toast with butter and syrup. Uh, then a wormhole opens, and whisks me millions of years into the future where my towering intellect is used to save the last remnants of mankind from a predatory alien race.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny Interesting, you didn’t mention Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon Who do you think made the French toast with butter and syrup?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 woman_in_lab_coat You’re about to enter the lab of the late Dr. David Saltzberg. While conducting studies on slowing the aging process, there was a catastrophic accident and he died. Or did he?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 leonard Ladies?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 emily Are you being polite or scared?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 leonard Yup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 emily Ah, what a room!
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 amy Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 leonard This is cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 amy So, how do we start?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 emily We have to look for the clues hidden around the room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 raj Uh, wasn’t there supposed to be a zombie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 zombie Uuuuuuuh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 raj Ooh. Okay, let’s hope one of the clues is written on a pair of clean underwear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 clerk Mr. and Mrs. Wolowitz? As far as I can tell, your bag arrived in Los Angeles.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 bernadette So, where is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 clerk I don’t know, perhaps somebody took it off the carousel by mistake?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 howard So, some stranger has my mom? Is that what you’re telling me? My poor mother can be anywhere in Los Angeles right now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 clerk I, I wish I was telling you that. Um, but the passenger could’ve gotten on an international flight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 howard Oh, okay, great. So, your entire job is to find lost luggage, and you’ve narrowed down the location of my mother to the planet Earth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 clerk I’m sorry. W, would 500 frequent-flyer miles help? That could get you to Sacramento.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny Well, not to steal from the Bible, but turning water into wine sounds pretty good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon I don’t think you’re taking this seriously.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny Come on, I’m just having some fun with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon I believe what you’re doing is using humour to avoid vulnerability.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny Fine. Honestly, if I could have one quality, I wish I could be as smart as you guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon Ha. Keep dreaming.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 shedon I’m sorry. That was me having fun with you. Look, you may not be as, as academically inclined as are we. Yes, that’s how you say it. But, you possess an intelligence I envy. Which leads me to my answer. I would choose the ability to read people’s minds.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny Well, I can’t read people’s minds. Actually, that’s not true, I can read men’s minds, but only ’cause it’s usually the one thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon When are we going to get robot eyes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny You’re all alike.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon Well, what I meant was I often misinterpret how others are feeling. Like, I can’t always tell if someone is only joking or laughing at me. You know, like, uh, if they’re mad at something I’ve done or just in a bad mood. It, it’s incredibly stressful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny Really? You always seem so confident.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon Well, I’m not. And if I could read people’s minds, life would be so much simpler.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny Well, now I wish I had the ability to make that stuff easier for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny Wow, I just felt this wave of affection for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon You sure it’s not too much Bible juice?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny And the wave is gone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 zombie Brains!
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 amy Keep it down, we’re working here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 raj Okay, we’ve got the cipher decoded.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 emily How’s it going with the globe?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 amy We used the coordinates to locate the cities.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 leonard I’m putting the city names in the grid now. I’m sure that’ll give us the code to the safe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 zombie Solve puzzle too fast! Slow down!
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 leonard Yup. Got the code.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 zombie Just saying, no refund for finish early!
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 bernadette Sure you don’t want to go home? When the bag’s returned, they’ll deliver it to us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 howard No, I’m not leaving without her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 bernadette All right, we’ll wait.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 howard I could’ve driven her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 bernadette What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 howard The day she left for Florida. She asked me to drive her to the airport. I was too busy. And I made her take a cab. I was too busy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 bernadette There’s no way you could’ve known. Be right back. Excuse me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 clerk Yes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 bernadette You better find my husband’s mother ’cause one way or another, w e’re walking out of this airport with a dead woman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 leonard Which book are we looking for?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 raj Uh, Origin of Species.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 leonard Here it is. There’s a black light.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 emily Oh, hang on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 raj Oh, okay. Uh, brothers and sisters I have none, but this man’s father is my father’s son. Who am I looking at? Yeah, yeah, we get it, you want brains. Calm down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 amy Well, if I don’t have a brother, my father’s son is me. And if I’m this man’s father, then he’s my son. The answer’s son.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 emily Ooh. There’s a picture of the sun over there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 leonard I bet the key’s behind it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 zombie Could be somewhere else.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 emily Oh, got the key.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 amy So, that’s the key to the door? That’s it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 leonard We spent two hundred dollars on six minutes of fun?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 raj It’s like when you bought that remote-controlled helicopter, and it just flew away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 emily Sorry, guys. Really thought the puzzles would be better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 amy Well, to be fair, we do all have advanced degrees.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 zombie Remember that before you post on Yelp.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny If you were to die this evening with no opportunity to communicate with anyone, what would you most regret not having told someone?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon So, it would be today? Huh. Well, I suppose there’s something satisfying about dying on my birthday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny Today’s your birthday?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny Well, that’s always been a secret. Not even Amy knows.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon Well, I don’t enjoy presents. And the thought of people jumping out and yelling surprise fills me with more dread than the words George Lucas Director’s Cut.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny So, why did you finally tell me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon The point of the experiment is to be completely honest with each other.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny Well, thank you for sharing it with me. I won’t tell anyone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny That is so funny. I never would have pegged you for a Pisces.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon You’re making it difficult to love you right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 clerk Great news, your bag was returned.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 howard Oh, thank God. It’s okay, she’s here. Ma’s here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 bernadette Okay, thank you so much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 howard Ma? I’m sorry I didn’t take you to the airport. I just want you to know that I’ll never forgive myself for being so selfish. And I promise to keep you close for the rest of my life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 bernadette Oh, no. That thing’s gonna end up in my bedroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon That’s it. We’re done with the questions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny All that’s left to do is stare into each other’s eyes for four minutes without talking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon Okay. Wait, hang on. Bladder check. We’re good to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny You ready?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny And begin. This is kind of creepy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon We’re not supposed to talk during this part.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny Sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon This is kind of creepy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny Do you want to stop? I know you have trouble with eye contact.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon Well, you have a brown fleck in your right iris that looks like a Formula One race car. So I’m just concentrating on that. Plus, it’s easier around people that I’m comfortable with.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny Aw, sweetie, I’m comfortable around you, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon Of course you are, I’m warm and soothing. I’m like a human bowl of tomato soup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny I meant more like a little brother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon Oh. Well, I suppose I do think of you as a sister. And sometimes, a mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny It’s getting creepy again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny Just thinking about the day I met you and Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon It was a Monday afternoon. You joined us for Indian food.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny Can you believe it’s been eight years?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon Yeah, and you’re still eating our food.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny I can’t remember a time you guys weren’t in my life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon I remember it perfectly. But I have an eidetic memory. If you’re interested, I also remember how much you owe us for the food.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny That’s it. That wasn’t so bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon No, it wasn’t. Uh, now let’s tabulate the results of the experiment. I think it’s safe to say that you’re not in love with me and I’m not in love with you. And psychology has once again proved itself the doofus of the sciences.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny Well, maybe. But I’m still glad we did it. I do feel closer to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon And I, you. And yes, that’s how you say that. Yeah, so, given our newfound intimacy, I’d say we have some hard choices to make.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny Like what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon Gary Con, do we fly or drive? Do we wear costumes? And if so, who gets to be Gary?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon Thank you for walking me home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny I just want to make sure you get there safe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon Well, this is me. It’s been a very interesting evening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 penny It really has.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 all SURPRISE!
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode16 sheldon Aah! And after I let you be Gary.
