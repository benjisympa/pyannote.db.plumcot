TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard I was unstoppable. I mean, I was, I was on fire. It was like my mind and my body were totally connected, like, like athletes must feel when they’re in the zone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny Again, it was miniature golf.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard Admit it, you’re a little turned on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny You can’t be this proud.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny Because I beat you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon Oh, good. You’re back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy We have some exciting news.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon As you know, Amy and I have been together a long time, and a lot of things I never thought possible now seem possible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy After a careful evaluation of our relationship, we decided that the time was right to take a step forward.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon Do you want to say it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy Let’s say it together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 together We’re getting a turtle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny This is why I’ve been saying we should keep champagne on ice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon Sarcasm?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon Okay. That was tricky, ’cause when it comes to alcohol, she generally means business.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard Well, we’re, we’re very happy for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy Thank you. Acquiring a joint pet is a big step for us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon No. It’s true. It means that we care so much about each other, there’s enough left over for an eight-ounce reptile.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard Why a turtle?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon After much deliberation, we’ve determined that a turtle is the ideal pet. They don’t shed fur, they don’t make noise.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy For Halloween, we can dress him as a cobblestone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon Yeah. And if he ever goes berserk, I know I can outrun him. Coincidentally, that’s also why I chose you as a roommate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard Well, congratulations. Who would’ve thought you two would be the first in our group to start a family?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny Mm-hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy That’s what I said.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj So, where’s your roommate tonight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 emily Well, I thought it was a little unfair that she’s always here, and you never get a chance to stay over, so I killed her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj But remember our agreement? You can joke about murdering people, but you have to say just kidding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 emily And the more important thing to remember is that I’d never hurt you. Oh, crap. I have to run over to the hospital and check on a patient.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj That’s okay. I can come back later.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 emily No. No, don’t be silly. I won’t be gone long. Just stay here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj Okay, cool. Oh, and you’re sure your roommate’s not gonna come back while I’m here alone, right? ‘Cause that’ll be awkward.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 emily Oh, don’t worry. She’s in Palm Springs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj Oh, good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 emily Well, her torso is. Just kidding. I put her in a wood chipper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon Oh, dear Lord. Oh, dear Lord.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy It’s okay. You made it. We’re fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon That was a lot of puppies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy Let’s forget about them, and pick ourselves out a nice turtle. Oh, how about this one up on the log?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon Oh, I don’t know. He kind of looks like a jerk. How about this one?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy Well, he’s barely moving. He looks half dead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon I know. I like him, too. Hi, little guy. How’d you like to come home with us? You’ll be living with me because we don’t live in the same house.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy But that’s not your fault. Like you, we’re taking it ridiculously slow. You’ll stay with me when he’s at Comic-Con or away for work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon Or if they accept Daddy’s application to live on Mars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy What are you talking about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon Oh, there’s this company that’s attempting to establish a colony on Mars, and I applied to be among the first to go. What should we name him? You know, I came in thinking Seth, but he kind of looks Italian.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy You applied for a mission to be a colonist on another planet, and couldn’t be bothered to tell me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon Would you have approved?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy Of course not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon Well, based on your reaction, it looks like I made the right choice. Isn’t that right, Giuseppe?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard Hey, hey. Listen, I, I have a little confession to make.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny Aw, is this your first time?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard No, I got you something for Valentine’s Day, and I was too embarrassed to give it to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny Well, why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard Well, ’cause I got it at the dirty store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny You went to the dirty store without me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard In sunglasses and a hat after I parked two blocks away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny Well, get it. Get it for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard Yeah?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard Okay, uh, well, I hope it’s fun. I mean, it, it comes with paints, and, and it’s kind of creative and artistic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny Okay, did you go to the dirty store or Michaels?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard No, no. We cover ourselves in body paint, and then, then we get on this big canvas and do our thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny Whoa, that’s kind of a big step for a guy who only recently agreed to take his socks off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard You’re making fun of me. Forget it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny No. No, come on, I want to do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny Yeah, let’s you, me, and your very, very pale feet make some art. Hey, when you got back to this store, I want to go with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard Okay, but it’s a drive, the one I went to is in San Diego.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 howard How are the taxes going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 bernadette Okay. But you got a lot of receipts for the Lego store in here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 howard Those are business expenses. You can write those off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 bernadette A two hundred dollar R2-D2 is a business expense?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 howard Oh, Bernie, you’re gonna have to sound a lot more confident when we get audited. Hey, what’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj Oh, Emily ran back to the hospital, so I’m just hanging out at her place. What are you, uh, what are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 howard Just playing video games while Bernie does the taxes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj What are you, a little kid? Is she gonna cut your dinner into little pieces, too?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 howard She doesn’t have to, I filled up on jelly beans.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj So, uh, what game are you… Oh. Crap.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 howard What’s wrong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj I can’t get Emily’s night-stand to close.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 howard So?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj She’s gonna know I was looking in it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 howard Why were you looking in it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj Well, there’s a question I better have a good answer to before she gets back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 howard Okay, calm down. There’s probably something jammed behind it. Just, uh, pull it out and see what’s there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj Hang on. Oh no. Oh, no. Oh, God, no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 howard You know what, you sound busy, I’m gonna let you go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj Dude, the whole front came off. Now she’s gonna know I was snooping.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 bernadette What’s happening?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 howard Raj was snooping through Emily’s drawers and broke one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 bernadette Aw. I’m gonna miss her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny So what do you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard I thought it’d be a little more, just more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny I’m not even sure why we were out of breath. Uh, I mean, did we move at all?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard Maybe along the z-axis, but x and y are looking pretty sad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny Okay, come on. We are not old boring people. We can do better than this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard Uh, Th, that’s true. How late did we stay up last night?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny Almost 1am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard Damn straight, almost 1am. And we weren’t even watching TV. We were watching Netflix, like the kids do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny Yeah, is it a comedy? Is it a drama? Nobody knows. Now, come on. We are gonna do this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard Yeah. You get the paint, I’ll rest for 30 to 40 minutes, and then we do this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon I can’t believe you almost had me bring a wild animal into my home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy No one told you to poke the turtle’s face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon I was playing Got Your Nose. That’s how you get children to like you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy I’m surprised you even care if he likes you, since you’re planning on leaving the planet the first chance you get.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon Ugh, this again. Amy, I’ve already had one new hole torn in my body today. I don’t need another one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy Sheldon, I know the odds of you even going to Mars are incredibly small, but it still hurts that you would volunteer for something that would take you away from me forever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon So you’re saying you wouldn’t leave me for the chance to be one of the first humans to colonize another planet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy I would at least mention it before filling out the application.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon Huh, that’s exactly what Leonard, Wolowitz, Koothrappali, Bernadette and Penny said.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy And who says you could even survive an interplanetary mission, anyway? You could barely survive a tiny turtle bite.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon First of all, this has only made me stronger. But beyond that, all I did was fill out an application.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy You know what? Go to Mars, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon Is there anything I can do to cheer you up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy No. Forget it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon What if I play the Star Trek theme on my nose?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy Please don’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon Yep, you’re mad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 howard Okay, let me see the damage.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj Hang on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 howard Well, I think you broke the dowels. You’re not gonna have time to glue it back on, you’ll have to nail it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj With what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 howard Does she have any pillows or wine glasses?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj She does.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 howard Great. Neither of those. Try a hammer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj Did that feel good? You feel like a big man now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon I was going to make you red zinger, but since Mars is the red planet, I went with peppermint.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy Why do you even want to do this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon Actually, as part of the application, I was required to make a short video answering that very question. You want to see it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy Can’t you just tell me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon But I made a video.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and I’d like to tell you why I should be chosen to go to Mars. I’m exceedingly smart. I graduated college at 14. While my brother was getting an STD I was getting a PhD. Penicillin can’t take this away. Being in close quarters, cleanliness is important and my hygiene is impeccable. In fact, animals don’t trust me because I smell like nothing. Literally nothing. During the seven-month space flight, I can keep up morale with my wacky sense of humour. Hey, Leonard, is there any peanut brittle left in that can?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard You mean this weirdly suspicious one?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon Yes. Open it and check.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard I don’t get it. There’s actually peanut brittle in… Please go to Mars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon But on a more serious note, the most important reason I want to go to Mars is that I believe, as a scientist, it’s my duty to push the boundaries of human knowledge forward. Now, I know that life on Mars will be difficult. But life here on Earth is no picnic. Also, picnics are no picnic. Where should we go for lunch? Oh, I know, the ground. In conclusion, thank you for considering me for this journey of a lifetime. To Mars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon Afterwards, Leonard blew his nose, and pie came out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard Right there, right there, Oh, God, that’s it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny How did you get paint in your eye?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard Because you wouldn’t let me wear safety goggles.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj This looks terrible. She, she’s gonna know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 howard It’s fine. You just need two more nails.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj Okay, where should I put them?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 howard In Emily’s eyes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj You’re not helping.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 bernadette Well, maybe this is what you get for snooping.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj You know, it, it’s bad enough that I have to deal with this…
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 emily Raj? I’m back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj Oh, no. Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 emily Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj How was the hospital?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 emily Fine. What were you doing in there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj Uh w, well, okay, look, I, I don’t want to lie to you. I got curious, I was looking around and I broke the drawer on your night stand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 emily You were looking in my night stand?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 emily So, the first time I leave you alone, you snoop on me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj You’ve never snooped around my apartment?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 emily No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj Come on, think back. It would really help if you had.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 emily I can’t believe you don’t trust me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 bernadette She sounds really mad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 howard We should hang up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 bernadette Yeah, we should.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 howard But we’re not going to, are we?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 bernadette Not a chance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 howard What happened to snooping is wrong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 bernadette Howard, you’re going to jail for tax fraud. Who cares?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard Well, we did it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny We sure did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard I mean, I was on fire. I, I was in the zone, like an athlete.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny Sweetie, I beat you at this, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard So, where do we want to hang it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny What? Are you kidding? We’re not hanging it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard But it’s an expression of our love.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny And our butts. Not hanging it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard Seems a shame to throw it away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny Yeah. We could give it to Sheldon, and tell him William Shatner painted it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard God, I love you. I love you so much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy I think I’m gonna go home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon Why? I really don’t understand what’s happening here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy You know, Sheldon, at any other time, learning that you had plans to go live on Mars would be a slow news day. But a couple of hours ago, we were getting a turtle. And silly as it sounds, I thought that meant something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon Amy. Oh, why didn’t I give her Sleepy Time tea? Amy, wait. Getting a turtle meant a great deal to me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy Sure. Unless something better comes along.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon Do you want me to withdraw my application?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy What I want is for us to be planning our future together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon And in that future, are we on the same planet? Because I’ve seen people make the long-distance thing work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy We’re on the same planet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon Okay. Does that planet have to be Earth?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy Are you asking me to go to Mars with you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon I am. Yeah, if I’m going to a barren, lifeless environment where the chances of survival are slim to none, I want you there with me. Why don’t we go back to the apartment, and fill out your application?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy Okay. I suppose being the first people on a new planet would be incredibly exciting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon Oh, I know. We could be the first to plant a flag on Mars. We could be the first to watch Mars Attacks! on Mars. We could be the first to say good lord, what on Mars are you talking about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy You know, we could also be the first people to procreate on Mars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon You just can’t keep it in your space pants, can you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy Think about it. If we had a family there, our kids would be Martians.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon They would, wouldn’t they? We could give them cool Martian names. And we could teach them about Martian history. Like, who planted those flags? And, uh, where did that copy of Mars Attacks! come from?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy I guess we’ll have to make a new video together, as a couple.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon Good idea. And since you’ve had such a rough day, I’m gonna let you throw the pie in Leonard’s face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj Thank you for forgiving me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 emily That’s okay. At some point, we were bound to have our first fight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj Well, it almost happened when you called my apple pie crust doughy, but the truth is you were right, and I was just angry at myself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 emily Can I ask you one thing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj Of course. What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 emily Did you look in my closet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj No. Just the drawer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 emily You promise you didn’t look in the closet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj I promise. Why, what’s in there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 emily Don’t worry about it. Good night.
