TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter I was unstoppable. I mean, I was, I was on fire. It was like my mind and my body were totally connected, like, like athletes must feel when they’re in the zone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny Again, it was miniature golf.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Admit it, you’re a little turned on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny You can’t be this proud.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny Because I beat you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Oh, good. You’re back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler We have some exciting news.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon_cooper As you know, Amy and I have been together a long time, and a lot of things I never thought possible now seem possible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler After a careful evaluation of our relationship, we decided that the time was right to take a step forward.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Do you want to say it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Let’s say it together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 together#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 We’re getting a turtle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny This is why I’ve been saying we should keep champagne on ice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Sarcasm?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Okay. That was tricky, ’cause when it comes to alcohol, she generally means business.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Well, we’re, we’re very happy for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Thank you. Acquiring a joint pet is a big step for us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon_cooper No. It’s true. It means that we care so much about each other, there’s enough left over for an eight-ounce reptile.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Why a turtle?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon_cooper After much deliberation, we’ve determined that a turtle is the ideal pet. They don’t shed fur, they don’t make noise.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler For Halloween, we can dress him as a cobblestone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Yeah. And if he ever goes berserk, I know I can outrun him. Coincidentally, that’s also why I chose you as a roommate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Well, congratulations. Who would’ve thought you two would be the first in our group to start a family?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny Mm-hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler That’s what I said.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj_koothrappali So, where’s your roommate tonight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 emily_sweeney Well, I thought it was a little unfair that she’s always here, and you never get a chance to stay over, so I killed her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj_koothrappali But remember our agreement? You can joke about murdering people, but you have to say just kidding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 emily_sweeney And the more important thing to remember is that I’d never hurt you. Oh, crap. I have to run over to the hospital and check on a patient.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj_koothrappali That’s okay. I can come back later.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 emily_sweeney No. No, don’t be silly. I won’t be gone long. Just stay here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Okay, cool. Oh, and you’re sure your roommate’s not gonna come back while I’m here alone, right? ‘Cause that’ll be awkward.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 emily_sweeney Oh, don’t worry. She’s in Palm Springs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Oh, good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 emily_sweeney Well, her torso is. Just kidding. I put her in a wood chipper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Oh, dear Lord. Oh, dear Lord.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler It’s okay. You made it. We’re fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon_cooper That was a lot of puppies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Let’s forget about them, and pick ourselves out a nice turtle. Oh, how about this one up on the log?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Oh, I don’t know. He kind of looks like a jerk. How about this one?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Well, he’s barely moving. He looks half dead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon_cooper I know. I like him, too. Hi, little guy. How’d you like to come home with us? You’ll be living with me because we don’t live in the same house.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler But that’s not your fault. Like you, we’re taking it ridiculously slow. You’ll stay with me when he’s at Comic-Con or away for work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Or if they accept Daddy’s application to live on Mars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler What are you talking about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Oh, there’s this company that’s attempting to establish a colony on Mars, and I applied to be among the first to go. What should we name him? You know, I came in thinking Seth, but he kind of looks Italian.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler You applied for a mission to be a colonist on another planet, and couldn’t be bothered to tell me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Would you have approved?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Of course not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Well, based on your reaction, it looks like I made the right choice. Isn’t that right, Giuseppe?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Hey, hey. Listen, I, I have a little confession to make.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny Aw, is this your first time?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter No, I got you something for Valentine’s Day, and I was too embarrassed to give it to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny Well, why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Well, ’cause I got it at the dirty store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny You went to the dirty store without me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter In sunglasses and a hat after I parked two blocks away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny Well, get it. Get it for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Yeah?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Okay, uh, well, I hope it’s fun. I mean, it, it comes with paints, and, and it’s kind of creative and artistic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny Okay, did you go to the dirty store or Michaels?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter No, no. We cover ourselves in body paint, and then, then we get on this big canvas and do our thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny Whoa, that’s kind of a big step for a guy who only recently agreed to take his socks off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter You’re making fun of me. Forget it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny No. No, come on, I want to do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny Yeah, let’s you, me, and your very, very pale feet make some art. Hey, when you got back to this store, I want to go with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Okay, but it’s a drive, the one I went to is in San Diego.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 howard_wolowitz How are the taxes going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 bernadette_rostenkowski Okay. But you got a lot of receipts for the Lego store in here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Those are business expenses. You can write those off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 bernadette_rostenkowski A two hundred dollar R2-D2 is a business expense?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Oh, Bernie, you’re gonna have to sound a lot more confident when we get audited. Hey, what’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Oh, Emily ran back to the hospital, so I’m just hanging out at her place. What are you, uh, what are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Just playing video games while Bernie does the taxes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj_koothrappali What are you, a little kid? Is she gonna cut your dinner into little pieces, too?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 howard_wolowitz She doesn’t have to, I filled up on jelly beans.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj_koothrappali So, uh, what game are you… Oh. Crap.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 howard_wolowitz What’s wrong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj_koothrappali I can’t get Emily’s night-stand to close.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 howard_wolowitz So?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj_koothrappali She’s gonna know I was looking in it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Why were you looking in it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Well, there’s a question I better have a good answer to before she gets back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Okay, calm down. There’s probably something jammed behind it. Just, uh, pull it out and see what’s there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Hang on. Oh no. Oh, no. Oh, God, no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 howard_wolowitz You know what, you sound busy, I’m gonna let you go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Dude, the whole front came off. Now she’s gonna know I was snooping.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 bernadette_rostenkowski What’s happening?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Raj was snooping through Emily’s drawers and broke one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 bernadette_rostenkowski Aw. I’m gonna miss her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny So what do you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter I thought it’d be a little more, just more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny I’m not even sure why we were out of breath. Uh, I mean, did we move at all?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Maybe along the z-axis, but x and y are looking pretty sad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny Okay, come on. We are not old boring people. We can do better than this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Uh, Th, that’s true. How late did we stay up last night?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny Almost 1am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Damn straight, almost 1am. And we weren’t even watching TV. We were watching Netflix, like the kids do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny Yeah, is it a comedy? Is it a drama? Nobody knows. Now, come on. We are gonna do this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Yeah. You get the paint, I’ll rest for 30 to 40 minutes, and then we do this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon_cooper I can’t believe you almost had me bring a wild animal into my home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler No one told you to poke the turtle’s face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon_cooper I was playing Got Your Nose. That’s how you get children to like you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler I’m surprised you even care if he likes you, since you’re planning on leaving the planet the first chance you get.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Ugh, this again. Amy, I’ve already had one new hole torn in my body today. I don’t need another one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, I know the odds of you even going to Mars are incredibly small, but it still hurts that you would volunteer for something that would take you away from me forever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon_cooper So you’re saying you wouldn’t leave me for the chance to be one of the first humans to colonize another planet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler I would at least mention it before filling out the application.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Huh, that’s exactly what Leonard, Wolowitz, Koothrappali, Bernadette and Penny said.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler And who says you could even survive an interplanetary mission, anyway? You could barely survive a tiny turtle bite.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon_cooper First of all, this has only made me stronger. But beyond that, all I did was fill out an application.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler You know what? Go to Mars, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Is there anything I can do to cheer you up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler No. Forget it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon_cooper What if I play the Star Trek theme on my nose?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Please don’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Yep, you’re mad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Okay, let me see the damage.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Hang on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Well, I think you broke the dowels. You’re not gonna have time to glue it back on, you’ll have to nail it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj_koothrappali With what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Does she have any pillows or wine glasses?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj_koothrappali She does.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Great. Neither of those. Try a hammer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Did that feel good? You feel like a big man now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon_cooper I was going to make you red zinger, but since Mars is the red planet, I went with peppermint.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Why do you even want to do this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Actually, as part of the application, I was required to make a short video answering that very question. You want to see it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Can’t you just tell me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon_cooper But I made a video.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon_cooper I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and I’d like to tell you why I should be chosen to go to Mars. I’m exceedingly smart. I graduated college at 14. While my brother was getting an STD I was getting a PhD. Penicillin can’t take this away. Being in close quarters, cleanliness is important and my hygiene is impeccable. In fact, animals don’t trust me because I smell like nothing. Literally nothing. During the seven-month space flight, I can keep up morale with my wacky sense of humour. Hey, Leonard, is there any peanut brittle left in that can?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter You mean this weirdly suspicious one?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Yes. Open it and check.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter I don’t get it. There’s actually peanut brittle in… Please go to Mars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon_cooper But on a more serious note, the most important reason I want to go to Mars is that I believe, as a scientist, it’s my duty to push the boundaries of human knowledge forward. Now, I know that life on Mars will be difficult. But life here on Earth is no picnic. Also, picnics are no picnic. Where should we go for lunch? Oh, I know, the ground. In conclusion, thank you for considering me for this journey of a lifetime. To Mars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Afterwards, Leonard blew his nose, and pie came out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Right there, right there, Oh, God, that’s it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny How did you get paint in your eye?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Because you wouldn’t let me wear safety goggles.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj_koothrappali This looks terrible. She, she’s gonna know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 howard_wolowitz It’s fine. You just need two more nails.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Okay, where should I put them?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 howard_wolowitz In Emily’s eyes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj_koothrappali You’re not helping.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 bernadette_rostenkowski Well, maybe this is what you get for snooping.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj_koothrappali You know, it, it’s bad enough that I have to deal with this…
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 emily_sweeney Raj? I’m back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Oh, no. Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 emily_sweeney Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj_koothrappali How was the hospital?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 emily_sweeney Fine. What were you doing in there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Uh w, well, okay, look, I, I don’t want to lie to you. I got curious, I was looking around and I broke the drawer on your night stand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 emily_sweeney You were looking in my night stand?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 emily_sweeney So, the first time I leave you alone, you snoop on me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj_koothrappali You’ve never snooped around my apartment?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 emily_sweeney No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Come on, think back. It would really help if you had.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 emily_sweeney I can’t believe you don’t trust me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 bernadette_rostenkowski She sounds really mad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 howard_wolowitz We should hang up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, we should.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 howard_wolowitz But we’re not going to, are we?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 bernadette_rostenkowski Not a chance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 howard_wolowitz What happened to snooping is wrong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 bernadette_rostenkowski Howard, you’re going to jail for tax fraud. Who cares?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Well, we did it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny We sure did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter I mean, I was on fire. I, I was in the zone, like an athlete.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny Sweetie, I beat you at this, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter So, where do we want to hang it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny What? Are you kidding? We’re not hanging it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter But it’s an expression of our love.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny And our butts. Not hanging it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Seems a shame to throw it away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 penny Yeah. We could give it to Sheldon, and tell him William Shatner painted it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter God, I love you. I love you so much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler I think I’m gonna go home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Why? I really don’t understand what’s happening here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler You know, Sheldon, at any other time, learning that you had plans to go live on Mars would be a slow news day. But a couple of hours ago, we were getting a turtle. And silly as it sounds, I thought that meant something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Amy. Oh, why didn’t I give her Sleepy Time tea? Amy, wait. Getting a turtle meant a great deal to me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Sure. Unless something better comes along.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Do you want me to withdraw my application?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler What I want is for us to be planning our future together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon_cooper And in that future, are we on the same planet? Because I’ve seen people make the long-distance thing work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler We’re on the same planet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Okay. Does that planet have to be Earth?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Are you asking me to go to Mars with you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon_cooper I am. Yeah, if I’m going to a barren, lifeless environment where the chances of survival are slim to none, I want you there with me. Why don’t we go back to the apartment, and fill out your application?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Okay. I suppose being the first people on a new planet would be incredibly exciting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Oh, I know. We could be the first to plant a flag on Mars. We could be the first to watch Mars Attacks! on Mars. We could be the first to say good lord, what on Mars are you talking about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler You know, we could also be the first people to procreate on Mars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon_cooper You just can’t keep it in your space pants, can you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Think about it. If we had a family there, our kids would be Martians.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon_cooper They would, wouldn’t they? We could give them cool Martian names. And we could teach them about Martian history. Like, who planted those flags? And, uh, where did that copy of Mars Attacks! come from?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler I guess we’ll have to make a new video together, as a couple.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Good idea. And since you’ve had such a rough day, I’m gonna let you throw the pie in Leonard’s face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Thank you for forgiving me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 emily_sweeney That’s okay. At some point, we were bound to have our first fight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Well, it almost happened when you called my apple pie crust doughy, but the truth is you were right, and I was just angry at myself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 emily_sweeney Can I ask you one thing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Of course. What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 emily_sweeney Did you look in my closet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj_koothrappali No. Just the drawer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 emily_sweeney You promise you didn’t look in the closet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 raj_koothrappali I promise. Why, what’s in there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode17 emily_sweeney Don’t worry about it. Good night.
