TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon Two one six four two zero one nine eight nine. And that, little lady, is pi to a thousand places.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy I’d say I’m sorry I asked, except I didn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon Oh, look, it’s the Scientific American that covered the paper Leonard and I wrote.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy Oh, let me see.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon I have mixed feelings about doing interviews. I like the part where I talk. I do not like the part where the other man talks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy Sheldon, this article doesn’t mention Leonard at all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon Well, that can’t be right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy It only refers to Dr. Cooper and his team. Did you even talk about him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon All I did was answer a few questions about the theory. And then expressed my gratitude that Scientific American doesn’t include any of those smelly perfume cards.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy Poor Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon Why? The theory he came up with just got mentioned in Scientific American. He ought to be thrilled.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy He might not be.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon Oh, maybe you’re right. He is kind of a lump.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy Think about it. How would you feel if you were referred to as part of Leonard’s team?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon Oh, I’d be incensed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy So you see what I’m getting at?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon Squeaky wheel gets the grease?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon Grass is always greener?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy Try again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon Well, I don’t know, we’re all Groot? Just tell me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy Leonard is as much a part of this paper as you are, and he was overlooked. He’s going to feel bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon But it wasn’t my fault. I didn’t exclude him. And I didn’t write the article.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy Remember that time you didn’t get picked to pull the sword out of the stone at Disneyland and they let that other kid do it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon Oh, that kid. Poor Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy Exactly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon For the record, that kid was a terrible choice. If you cry when you drop your churro, you do not have what it takes to rule England.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard Thanks for helping us sort through all my mom’s stuff.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 raj Of course. I know what it’s like having to go through a loved one’s possessions. My uncle was a worshipper of Krishna. But after he died, you know what we found? A statue of Shiva. It may not be Crips and Bloods, okay? But in India, it’s a thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 bernadette Well, it’ll be good that you’re there. Howard’s been having trouble deciding what to keep and what to let go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard Well, it’s hard. A lot of Ma’s stuff brings back fond memories.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 bernadette Is that why you couldn’t get rid of her drawer full of ketchup packets?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard Yes. It reminds me of us eating out and her saying quick, nobody’s looking, fill your pockets with ketchup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon Leonard? Have you ever noticed that only my name is on the cable bill?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon Good, good. And your name is on the electric bill and mine isn’t. And I’m okay with that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard Actually, your name is on the electric bill.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon Oh, right. This is a disaster.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard I don’t even know what you’re talking about and I agree.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon Okay, I have to tell you something, but you’re not going to like it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon An article was just published in Scientific American about our theory.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard Did they hate it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon No. No, they loved it. They, uh, couldn’t say enough nice things about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard So what’s the problem?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon You know how the PennySaver only has my name…
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon They didn’t mention you in the article. Only me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon I know. It’s not fair. Let the anger go, buddy. You just, you relax all your muscles. Except for your pubococcygeus and anal sphincter. Let’s keep those tight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard Uh, that, that’s not necessary.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon It is. They’re what hold back the urine and the faeces. Look, maybe, maybe you shouldn’t read it. It’ll only make you feel worse.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard Cooper and his team?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon You should know I had nothing to do with that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard Uh, at least they’re talking about the theory. I mean, that’s what’s important.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon You know, you’re right. Yeah. You know, it’s like when Stan Lee and Steve Ditko created Spider-Man. Stan Lee may get all the credit, but Steve Ditko knows he was just as important. Even though Stan Lee gets to be in all the Marvel movies. And. and he’s far richer. And he’s a household name, you know? Whereas, you know, you say Ditko, and that sounds like a company that makes Dits.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard That’s not helping.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon Well, I’d give more examples, but, well, everyone in your position’s so forgettable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard Stuart, we’re here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 raj It’s nice of you to let him keep staying at your mom’s house.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard Yeah, well, I tried putting him out on the curb, but nobody took him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 stuart Hey. Just so you know, the power’s out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 bernadette What happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 stuart I called, they said a transformer blew. It’s the whole block. Should be fixed by tomorrow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard Wait, when did it go out?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 stuart In the middle of the night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard Oh, my God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 bernadette Howie, what’s wrong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard It’s all defrosting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 bernadette It’s okay. It’s just food.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard It’s not just food. This is the last food my mother ever made. This is her last brisket. This is her last meatloaf. This is her last. I have no idea what this is, but it’s the last one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 raj Everything okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard No. All Ma’s food is gonna be ruined.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 bernadette Well, why don’t we take it home and put it in our freezer?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 raj You don’t want to do that. Refreezing not only removes moisture, but it creates ice crystals in the fibres of the meat that can compromise its taste and texture. What? I saw a teachable moment. I dropped some culinary science.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 bernadette What should we do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard I’ll tell you exactly what we’re gonna do. We’re gonna eat it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 bernadette There’s, like, twenty pounds of food in there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard All you said was I had to get rid of things. You didn’t say they couldn’t pass through my colon first.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 bernadette Howie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard Okay. Then how about this? Let’s invite everyone over to dinner. It’ll be like Ma’s feeding us one last time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 bernadette I love that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 raj Me, too. Oh, look, we’ve got enough ketchup to cover every ounce of it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny I mean, who even reads Scientific American?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard It’s kind of a big deal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny If it’s such a big deal, how come the biggest celebrity they could get for the cover is a molecule?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard Can we please just stop talking about it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny I’m sorry. What can I do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard Nothing, I’m fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny No, no. I’m gonna cheer you up. Here we go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard What are we doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny I am taking you shopping.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny My baby is sad, and I’m gonna make him happy again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard Look, I know shopping cheers you up, but it’s just not really my thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny Well, what about this helicopter you control with an iPad?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard Does it have a camera in it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny It does have a camera in it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard Baby’s listening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon Leonard? Leonard? Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon I spoke to the reporter at the magazine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard What happened? Did you tell him it was my idea?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon I did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard Thank you. What did he say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon He said they made the editorial decision to only cite the lead scientist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard Why did he think you’re the lead scientist? It was my idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny You know, for an extra four bucks, I can have this thing here tomorrow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon Well, I know it was your idea, but the reporter said he’s been following my work for a while, and the only reason they even mentioned it in the magazine is ’cause my name is on it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny You know what? I did it. What’s four bucks?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard If you’re trying to make me feel better, it’s not working.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon Well then what if I told you that I added your name to the cable bill?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon Oh. That’s just as well. They had me on hold for 20 minutes and I hung up. Leonard? Leonard? Leonard? Also, Wolowitz invited us all to dinner, so I’m ready whenever you are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon All he had was an idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy Well, that is an important part.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon Oh, please. I have ideas all day long. Reverse SeaWorld where dolphins are allowed to pet people. A new clothing size between medium and large called Marge. Snow White retold from the point of view of Sneezy. Why won’t Doc prescribe him something? We finally find out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy But Leonard’s idea was good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon Fine. Then Grumpy, what’s he so grumpy about? Maybe his girlfriend won’t take his side.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard I’m the one who thought of it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny Well, didn’t he do a lot of the work?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard Yeah. But now he’s happy to let people think he’s responsible for everything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny And that’s why you get an iPad helicopter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon Is it my fault I have a much bigger reputation than he does?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy It’s not your fault.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon Is it my fault that my name came first on the paper alphabetically?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy Not your fault.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon Is it my fault that when the reporter cited me as the lead scientist I didn’t correct him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy Hey, look at that pretty bird.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard He always needs all the attention. He’s such a baby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny I know, I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard I swear, he is never ever playing with my helicopter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 raj Okay, I’ll start heating some of this stuff up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 bernadette Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard Oh, man. This is the boutonniere from my high school prom. A piece of cake from my Bar Mitzvah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 bernadette Did she throw anything away?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard No. If I find my foreskin, I’m gonna kill myself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 raj Okay, so we’ve got, um, three briskets, four meatloafs, one lasagna.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard No, that’s noodle kugel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 raj One Jewish lasagna, two pound cakes that are about eight pounds each, and one giant container of matzoh ball soup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard Ma always kept it on hand, in case I got sick. She thought she could cure anything with her cooking. Even the time I got food poisoning. From her cooking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 bernadette You okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard Yeah, I’m okay. Let’s get started.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 raj You got it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard I’m never gonna talk to her again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 bernadette Should we tell everyone not to come?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard No. I want to do this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 bernadette Okay. Well, I’ll keep it together if you can.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 raj I’m not making any promises.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 stuart Glad you guys could make it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard Of course.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny Wow, it looks really pretty in here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 stuart Yeah, turns out half a dozen menorahs really sets a mood.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard So, Stuart, have you thought about what you’d do if Howard sells the house?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 stuart And there goes the mood.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon Hi. Hello. Oh, and a special hello to Leonard, who needs to be mentioned by name.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard Subtle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon But you got it, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard Hey, guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 all Hey. Hi. Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard I just want everyone to know, uh, tonight’s not a sad occasion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 bernadette Yeah, we just want to have the kind of dinner that we’ve all had here so many times before.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard Good food, good friends, and sometime around midnight, heartburn that makes you pray for death.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy Do you need any help in the kitchen?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 bernadette No, we got it. You guys make yourselves comfortable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny All right, hey, you two, we’re here for Howard right now, okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy Yes, so please behave yourselves.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard Fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon Of course.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 stuart So I heard you two, uh, wrote a paper together. How’s that going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny This food is amazing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 raj Mm, and not a vegetable in sight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard That’s not true. We’ve got tomatoes right here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy All these bright people sitting around a table by candlelight. Feels like we could be an 18th century French salon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon Indeed. Penny, a salon is a gathering where intellectuals entertained each other with sparkling conversations about issues of the day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny Oh, so it’s like The View.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy Sheldon, The View is a daytime talk show hosted by women.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny Shut up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 raj I would like to propose a salon topic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy Ooh, please do, Rajesh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 raj The lead in The Hunger Games is a woman. Marvel has made Tor a female.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny Wait, who’s Tor?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 raj You know, Tor, the God of Tunder. As I was saying, is this a sign that our society is approaching gender equality?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard Certainly a lot more women are reading comic books now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 stuart It’s true. At the store, I had to put a seat on the toilet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy We won’t know if there’s equality until female Thor has a baby and the Avengers are cool with her pumping breast milk at work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard I wonder if only a baby who is worthy can suckle at the bosom of Thor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny Okay, new salon topic. Salons, dumb thing from a long time ago or interesting thing made dumb by talking about superheroes? Discuss.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon I don’t believe it matters what the topic is. What’s crucial for a salon is that we conduct the discussion in an elevated and insightful way. It’s all about the execution.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard Of course you’d focus on that rather than the inspiration. Uh, new salon topic. What’s more important, an idea or its execution?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 bernadette Oh, that’s fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon Yeah, good for you, Leonard. That’s a lovely little notion. Kind of like, I wish I could talk to my uncle in Chicago. Yeah, now stand back while I invent the telephone. Hello? Oh, hold on. Leonard, it’s your uncle. He says you just got burned.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny Guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard No, it’s okay. We’re all adults trying to have an intelligent discussion. At least I am. Howard, what do you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard Well, I guess, as an engineer, I lean towards execution. I spend my days trying to take ideas and make them real.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon Well said, old chap. I thought eloquence had died, here it stands before us. Starting today, it’ll go Gettysburg Address, I have a dream, and what he just said.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard Oh, now he’s a genius? All you ever do is make fun of him and engineering.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon Leonard, please. His mother just died.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard You’re being ridiculous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon Yeah, so are you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny Guys, if I wanted to hear people be bitchy, I’d go to my real salon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon Leonard, lots of people could’ve had that idea, but very few people could’ve worked out the math the way I did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard Lots of people also didn’t have that idea, like everyone in the entire world except for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon Oh, well, apparently Leonard thinks he’s better than everyone in the whole world, including those fighting for our freedom. Yeah, well, I don’t know about you, but I support our boys overseas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy And girls.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon Hey, you already ruined Thor, give it a rest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard So I’m just supposed to be okay with you hogging all the credit?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon I didn’t hog anything. Unlike you and that weird lasagna with raisins in it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard You want some of this? I’ll give you some.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 bernadette Hey. Sheldon, Leonard, living room, right now!
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon She said my name first, that must kill you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 bernadette I don’t know what you think you’re doing, but this is a very difficult time for my husband. We’re eating the last food his mother ever made, and you were gonna throw it at each other like children? Whatever it is you’re fighting about, put it aside, go back in there and be a good friend to Howard or there’s no dessert for either of you. Look at me when I’m talking to you. And don’t think…
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard You guys ever notice sometimes Bernadette sounds like my mom?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy I don’t hear it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 raj No, not at all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny I don’t think I’ve eaten that much in my entire life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard It’s why my people wandered the desert for 40 years. Took that long to walk it off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon You see, Penny, the Israelites were in the desert…
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny Shut up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 ra So glad you two are done fighting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard Right now, I’m just trying to burp without throwing up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon Hang on. Physics Today mentioned the paper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 stuart What’d they say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy Who cares? Did they mention Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon They did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 all Yay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 bernadette Good news, I found more Tums.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 all Yay.
