TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Two one six four two zero one nine eight nine. And that, little lady, is pi to a thousand places.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler I’d say I’m sorry I asked, except I didn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Oh, look, it’s the Scientific American that covered the paper Leonard and I wrote.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, let me see.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper I have mixed feelings about doing interviews. I like the part where I talk. I do not like the part where the other man talks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, this article doesn’t mention Leonard at all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Well, that can’t be right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler It only refers to Dr. Cooper and his team. Did you even talk about him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper All I did was answer a few questions about the theory. And then expressed my gratitude that Scientific American doesn’t include any of those smelly perfume cards.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler Poor Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Why? The theory he came up with just got mentioned in Scientific American. He ought to be thrilled.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler He might not be.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Oh, maybe you’re right. He is kind of a lump.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler Think about it. How would you feel if you were referred to as part of Leonard’s team?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Oh, I’d be incensed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler So you see what I’m getting at?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Squeaky wheel gets the grease?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Grass is always greener?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler Try again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Well, I don’t know, we’re all Groot? Just tell me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler Leonard is as much a part of this paper as you are, and he was overlooked. He’s going to feel bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper But it wasn’t my fault. I didn’t exclude him. And I didn’t write the article.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler Remember that time you didn’t get picked to pull the sword out of the stone at Disneyland and they let that other kid do it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Oh, that kid. Poor Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler Exactly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper For the record, that kid was a terrible choice. If you cry when you drop your churro, you do not have what it takes to rule England.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard_wolowitz Thanks for helping us sort through all my mom’s stuff.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 raj_koothrappali Of course. I know what it’s like having to go through a loved one’s possessions. My uncle was a worshipper of Krishna. But after he died, you know what we found? A statue of Shiva. It may not be Crips and Bloods, okay? But in India, it’s a thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 bernadette_rostenkowski Well, it’ll be good that you’re there. Howard’s been having trouble deciding what to keep and what to let go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard_wolowitz Well, it’s hard. A lot of Ma’s stuff brings back fond memories.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 bernadette_rostenkowski Is that why you couldn’t get rid of her drawer full of ketchup packets?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard_wolowitz Yes. It reminds me of us eating out and her saying quick, nobody’s looking, fill your pockets with ketchup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Leonard? Have you ever noticed that only my name is on the cable bill?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Good, good. And your name is on the electric bill and mine isn’t. And I’m okay with that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Actually, your name is on the electric bill.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Oh, right. This is a disaster.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter I don’t even know what you’re talking about and I agree.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Okay, I have to tell you something, but you’re not going to like it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper An article was just published in Scientific American about our theory.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Did they hate it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper No. No, they loved it. They, uh, couldn’t say enough nice things about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter So what’s the problem?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper You know how the PennySaver only has my name…
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper They didn’t mention you in the article. Only me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper I know. It’s not fair. Let the anger go, buddy. You just, you relax all your muscles. Except for your pubococcygeus and anal sphincter. Let’s keep those tight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Uh, that, that’s not necessary.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper It is. They’re what hold back the urine and the faeces. Look, maybe, maybe you shouldn’t read it. It’ll only make you feel worse.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Cooper and his team?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper You should know I had nothing to do with that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Uh, at least they’re talking about the theory. I mean, that’s what’s important.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper You know, you’re right. Yeah. You know, it’s like when Stan Lee and Steve Ditko created Spider-Man. Stan Lee may get all the credit, but Steve Ditko knows he was just as important. Even though Stan Lee gets to be in all the Marvel movies. And. and he’s far richer. And he’s a household name, you know? Whereas, you know, you say Ditko, and that sounds like a company that makes Dits.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter That’s not helping.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Well, I’d give more examples, but, well, everyone in your position’s so forgettable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard_wolowitz Stuart, we’re here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 raj_koothrappali It’s nice of you to let him keep staying at your mom’s house.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard_wolowitz Yeah, well, I tried putting him out on the curb, but nobody took him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 stuart_bloom Hey. Just so you know, the power’s out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 bernadette_rostenkowski What happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 stuart_bloom I called, they said a transformer blew. It’s the whole block. Should be fixed by tomorrow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard_wolowitz Wait, when did it go out?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 stuart_bloom In the middle of the night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard_wolowitz Oh, my God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 bernadette_rostenkowski Howie, what’s wrong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard_wolowitz It’s all defrosting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 bernadette_rostenkowski It’s okay. It’s just food.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard_wolowitz It’s not just food. This is the last food my mother ever made. This is her last brisket. This is her last meatloaf. This is her last. I have no idea what this is, but it’s the last one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 raj_koothrappali Everything okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard_wolowitz No. All Ma’s food is gonna be ruined.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 bernadette_rostenkowski Well, why don’t we take it home and put it in our freezer?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 raj_koothrappali You don’t want to do that. Refreezing not only removes moisture, but it creates ice crystals in the fibres of the meat that can compromise its taste and texture. What? I saw a teachable moment. I dropped some culinary science.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 bernadette_rostenkowski What should we do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard_wolowitz I’ll tell you exactly what we’re gonna do. We’re gonna eat it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 bernadette_rostenkowski There’s, like, twenty pounds of food in there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard_wolowitz All you said was I had to get rid of things. You didn’t say they couldn’t pass through my colon first.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 bernadette_rostenkowski Howie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard_wolowitz Okay. Then how about this? Let’s invite everyone over to dinner. It’ll be like Ma’s feeding us one last time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 bernadette_rostenkowski I love that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 raj_koothrappali Me, too. Oh, look, we’ve got enough ketchup to cover every ounce of it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny I mean, who even reads Scientific American?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter It’s kind of a big deal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny If it’s such a big deal, how come the biggest celebrity they could get for the cover is a molecule?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Can we please just stop talking about it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny I’m sorry. What can I do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Nothing, I’m fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny No, no. I’m gonna cheer you up. Here we go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter What are we doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny I am taking you shopping.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny My baby is sad, and I’m gonna make him happy again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Look, I know shopping cheers you up, but it’s just not really my thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny Well, what about this helicopter you control with an iPad?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Does it have a camera in it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny It does have a camera in it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Baby’s listening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Leonard? Leonard? Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper I spoke to the reporter at the magazine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter What happened? Did you tell him it was my idea?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper I did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Thank you. What did he say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper He said they made the editorial decision to only cite the lead scientist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Why did he think you’re the lead scientist? It was my idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny You know, for an extra four bucks, I can have this thing here tomorrow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Well, I know it was your idea, but the reporter said he’s been following my work for a while, and the only reason they even mentioned it in the magazine is ’cause my name is on it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny You know what? I did it. What’s four bucks?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter If you’re trying to make me feel better, it’s not working.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Well then what if I told you that I added your name to the cable bill?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Oh. That’s just as well. They had me on hold for 20 minutes and I hung up. Leonard? Leonard? Leonard? Also, Wolowitz invited us all to dinner, so I’m ready whenever you are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper All he had was an idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler Well, that is an important part.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Oh, please. I have ideas all day long. Reverse SeaWorld where dolphins are allowed to pet people. A new clothing size between medium and large called Marge. Snow White retold from the point of view of Sneezy. Why won’t Doc prescribe him something? We finally find out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler But Leonard’s idea was good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Fine. Then Grumpy, what’s he so grumpy about? Maybe his girlfriend won’t take his side.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter I’m the one who thought of it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny Well, didn’t he do a lot of the work?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Yeah. But now he’s happy to let people think he’s responsible for everything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny And that’s why you get an iPad helicopter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Is it my fault I have a much bigger reputation than he does?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler It’s not your fault.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Is it my fault that my name came first on the paper alphabetically?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler Not your fault.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Is it my fault that when the reporter cited me as the lead scientist I didn’t correct him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler Hey, look at that pretty bird.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter He always needs all the attention. He’s such a baby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny I know, I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter I swear, he is never ever playing with my helicopter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 raj_koothrappali Okay, I’ll start heating some of this stuff up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 bernadette_rostenkowski Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard_wolowitz Oh, man. This is the boutonniere from my high school prom. A piece of cake from my Bar Mitzvah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 bernadette_rostenkowski Did she throw anything away?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard_wolowitz No. If I find my foreskin, I’m gonna kill myself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 raj_koothrappali Okay, so we’ve got, um, three briskets, four meatloafs, one lasagna.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard_wolowitz No, that’s noodle kugel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 raj_koothrappali One Jewish lasagna, two pound cakes that are about eight pounds each, and one giant container of matzoh ball soup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard_wolowitz Ma always kept it on hand, in case I got sick. She thought she could cure anything with her cooking. Even the time I got food poisoning. From her cooking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 bernadette_rostenkowski You okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard_wolowitz Yeah, I’m okay. Let’s get started.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 raj_koothrappali You got it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard_wolowitz I’m never gonna talk to her again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 bernadette_rostenkowski Should we tell everyone not to come?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard_wolowitz No. I want to do this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 bernadette_rostenkowski Okay. Well, I’ll keep it together if you can.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard_wolowitz Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 raj_koothrappali I’m not making any promises.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 stuart_bloom Glad you guys could make it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Of course.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny Wow, it looks really pretty in here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 stuart_bloom Yeah, turns out half a dozen menorahs really sets a mood.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter So, Stuart, have you thought about what you’d do if Howard sells the house?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 stuart_bloom And there goes the mood.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Hi. Hello. Oh, and a special hello to Leonard, who needs to be mentioned by name.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Subtle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper But you got it, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard_wolowitz Hey, guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 all@ Hey. Hi. Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard_wolowitz I just want everyone to know, uh, tonight’s not a sad occasion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, we just want to have the kind of dinner that we’ve all had here so many times before.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard_wolowitz Good food, good friends, and sometime around midnight, heartburn that makes you pray for death.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler Do you need any help in the kitchen?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 bernadette_rostenkowski No, we got it. You guys make yourselves comfortable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny All right, hey, you two, we’re here for Howard right now, okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler Yes, so please behave yourselves.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Of course.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 stuart_bloom So I heard you two, uh, wrote a paper together. How’s that going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny This food is amazing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 raj_koothrappali Mm, and not a vegetable in sight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard_wolowitz That’s not true. We’ve got tomatoes right here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler All these bright people sitting around a table by candlelight. Feels like we could be an 18th century French salon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Indeed. Penny, a salon is a gathering where intellectuals entertained each other with sparkling conversations about issues of the day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny Oh, so it’s like The View.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, The View is a daytime talk show hosted by women.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny Shut up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 raj_koothrappali I would like to propose a salon topic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler Ooh, please do, Rajesh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 raj_koothrappali The lead in The Hunger Games is a woman. Marvel has made Tor a female.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny Wait, who’s Tor?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 raj_koothrappali You know, Tor, the God of Tunder. As I was saying, is this a sign that our society is approaching gender equality?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard_wolowitz Certainly a lot more women are reading comic books now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 stuart_bloom It’s true. At the store, I had to put a seat on the toilet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler We won’t know if there’s equality until female Thor has a baby and the Avengers are cool with her pumping breast milk at work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard_wolowitz I wonder if only a baby who is worthy can suckle at the bosom of Thor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny Okay, new salon topic. Salons, dumb thing from a long time ago or interesting thing made dumb by talking about superheroes? Discuss.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper I don’t believe it matters what the topic is. What’s crucial for a salon is that we conduct the discussion in an elevated and insightful way. It’s all about the execution.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Of course you’d focus on that rather than the inspiration. Uh, new salon topic. What’s more important, an idea or its execution?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, that’s fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Yeah, good for you, Leonard. That’s a lovely little notion. Kind of like, I wish I could talk to my uncle in Chicago. Yeah, now stand back while I invent the telephone. Hello? Oh, hold on. Leonard, it’s your uncle. He says you just got burned.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny Guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter No, it’s okay. We’re all adults trying to have an intelligent discussion. At least I am. Howard, what do you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard_wolowitz Well, I guess, as an engineer, I lean towards execution. I spend my days trying to take ideas and make them real.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Well said, old chap. I thought eloquence had died, here it stands before us. Starting today, it’ll go Gettysburg Address, I have a dream, and what he just said.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Oh, now he’s a genius? All you ever do is make fun of him and engineering.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Leonard, please. His mother just died.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter You’re being ridiculous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Yeah, so are you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny Guys, if I wanted to hear people be bitchy, I’d go to my real salon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Leonard, lots of people could’ve had that idea, but very few people could’ve worked out the math the way I did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Lots of people also didn’t have that idea, like everyone in the entire world except for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Oh, well, apparently Leonard thinks he’s better than everyone in the whole world, including those fighting for our freedom. Yeah, well, I don’t know about you, but I support our boys overseas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler And girls.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Hey, you already ruined Thor, give it a rest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter So I’m just supposed to be okay with you hogging all the credit?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper I didn’t hog anything. Unlike you and that weird lasagna with raisins in it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter You want some of this? I’ll give you some.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 bernadette_rostenkowski Hey. Sheldon, Leonard, living room, right now!
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper She said my name first, that must kill you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t know what you think you’re doing, but this is a very difficult time for my husband. We’re eating the last food his mother ever made, and you were gonna throw it at each other like children? Whatever it is you’re fighting about, put it aside, go back in there and be a good friend to Howard or there’s no dessert for either of you. Look at me when I’m talking to you. And don’t think…
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard_wolowitz You guys ever notice sometimes Bernadette sounds like my mom?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler I don’t hear it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 raj_koothrappali No, not at all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny I don’t think I’ve eaten that much in my entire life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 howard_wolowitz It’s why my people wandered the desert for 40 years. Took that long to walk it off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper You see, Penny, the Israelites were in the desert…
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 penny Shut up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 raj_koothrappali So glad you two are done fighting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 leonard_hofstadter Right now, I’m just trying to burp without throwing up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper Hang on. Physics Today mentioned the paper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 stuart_bloom What’d they say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 amy_farrah_fowler Who cares? Did they mention Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 sheldon_cooper They did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 all@ Yay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 bernadette_rostenkowski Good news, I found more Tums.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode18 all@ Yay.
