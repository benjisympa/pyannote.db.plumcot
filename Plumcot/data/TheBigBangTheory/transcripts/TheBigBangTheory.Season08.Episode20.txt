TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 raj_koothrappali You’re wrong.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 howard_wolowitz No, I’m not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 raj_koothrappali Yes, you are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 howard_wolowitz No, I’m not. Settle this. Those little animated pictures on the Internet, are they called gifs or jifs?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Well, the G stands for graphics. That’s a hard G, so I’d say gif.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 raj_koothrappali The guy who invented it says it’s jif.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 howard_wolowitz I’m sorry, do you mean the guy or the juy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Well, I’ll give you three guesses why I’m so irritated.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Something happened different from the way you wanted it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 sheldon_cooper I guess news travels fast. It’s true, a select group of scientists was invited to a weekend symposium at a former home of Richard Feynman, and I wasn’t included.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Oh, Sheldon, I’m sure it’s not because they don’t think you’re an elite scientist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Yeah, I bet you anything it’s just ’cause you’re a pain in the ass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 sheldon_cooper You’re just saying that to make me feel better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Look, you can spend the rest of the day being bitter about this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Agreed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter I was gonna say or, but why bother?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski Hey, Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 raj_koothrappali Hey, I got you a little gift.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, that’s a lot of Girl Scout Cookies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 raj_koothrappali You know me. I’m from India. I can’t resist children begging. So, how’s it going with the title to the house?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Great, it’s all done. The lawyer tracked down my father and got him to sign it over. I didn’t have to meet him, I didn’t have to talk to him, I don’t even know where he is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 raj_koothrappali Wow, so you’re not curious at all?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Nope.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 raj_koothrappali Hmm. What if he’s in prison? What if he’s a spy? What if he’s in a Beatles cover band? I’m just saying, if he’s got your nose and haircut, he’d make a killer Ringo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 wil_wheaton Thanks again for agreeing to do this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 penny Oh, it’s cool, I’ve never been on a podcast before.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Well, you picked a good one to start. Wil’s had lots of great guests. Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, Michael Dorn, Gates McFadden.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 penny Those are Star Trek people.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 penny I only figured that out because I’ve never heard of any of them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 wil_wheaton I deserve that. I invited you on my show and I drove here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 penny Sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 wil_wheaton Okay, so, this is basically gonna be just like a little talk show. Uh, we’re gonna take some calls, we’ll talk about what it was like on the set of Serial Ape-ist 2. It should be really fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter This is exciting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 penny Yeah, so, how many people listen?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 wil_wheaton Most people download it later, but usually a few thousand people listen live.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 penny What? A few thousand people listen to you talk about nerd stuff?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 wil_wheaton Again, right in the ears, straight to the feelings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler Can you please pass the salt?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Sure. It’s not like I was invited to Richard Feynman’s house and have anything better to do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler Is this how the rest of the night’s going to be?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 sheldon_cooper I don’t know the future. Do you think there’s a chance that an asteroid could hit the Earth, destroying Feynman’s house and everyone in it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler No, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Then buckle up, you’re in for a cranky night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler According to the codicil of the Relationship Agreement which you insisted upon, we’re not allowed to pout or be moody on date night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 sheldon_cooper You know I just put that in because of uterus stuff.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler Well, it applies to you, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 sheldon_cooper I was afraid you might bring this up, so I have a work-around. There you go. As far as you’re concerned, I’m smiling. Although, I must admit, I’m smiling a little bit at the moment because this loophole is so brilliant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 raj_koothrappali So, Bernadette, have you thought about how you’re going to redecorate this place?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski You know, I’m thinking ripping up the carpets, maybe lose the wallpaper, all new light fixtures.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 raj_koothrappali You know, if you knocked out this wall, it would give you an open floor plan, and then, it’s a little scary, but could be fun, indoor fire pit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Hey, I grew up in this house, okay? No one’s knocking anything down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski Okay, okay. When he’s at Comic-Con, I’m bringing in a wrecking ball.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Can I help you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 guy_at_door#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 Hi. Are you Howard Wolowitz?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 guy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 Um, this is a little weird, but a lawyer was trying to contact my father, because his name was still on the title for this house.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Wuh, uh, who’s your father?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 guy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 Sam Wolowitz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Sam Wolowitz is my father.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 guy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Well, wait, so if we have the same father, are, are you saying you’re my half-brother?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 guy#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 I think so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Bernadette, weird things are happening out here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 wil_wheaton Uh, spoiler alert, after the monkey sees, it kills.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Psst.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 wil_wheaton I’ve just been handed a note. I’m going to read it. Wil, do you want more Diet Coke? Also, we have juice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter I, I didn’t want to interrupt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 wil_wheaton Uh, that voice you just heard belongs to Leonard, Penny’s fiancé. Uh, Leonard, why don’t you grab some headphones and join us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 wil_wheaton Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Hey, great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 wil_wheaton So, while Leonard gets set up, let’s take a call. Hello, caller, you are on with Penny and Wil from Serial Ape-ist 2.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 caller I don’t have a question. I just want to say I’m a big fan of the movie. I’ve seen it, like, ten times.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 penny Okay, well, I’ll apologize for the first time, but the other nine are on you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 wil_wheaton Thanks a lot, caller. You know that the movie actually has a little bit of a cult following.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 penny Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 wil_wheaton Yeah. I was at a science-fiction convention, and I saw a woman dressed as your half-ape character.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Oh, if she was with an Indian guy dressed like a banana, that was just my friends, Howard and Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 wil_wheaton All right, it’s time for a very special guest caller, a friend of mine, who you probably know as the director of such movies as Clerks, or from podcasts and books where he often reminds you that he’s the guy who directed Clerks. Hello, Kevin Smith.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 kevin_smith Hey, man, yo, is everything okay, Wil? ‘Cause it’s been, like, two minutes and you haven’t even brought up Stand By Me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 penny Hey, Kevin. It’s really exciting to talk to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter It really is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 kevin_smith Oh, you guys are very sweet. So, Penny, listen, I saw your movie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 penny Oh, wow. I wish it was better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 wil_wheaton Oh, don’t worry about it. Have you seen some of Kevin’s films?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 kevin_smith You’re cruisin’ for a beatin’, Wheaton. Anyway, man, I dug the ape movie, Penny. And I thought you were, like, really great in it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 penny Aw.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 wil_wheaton You know, I’m in the movie, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 kevin_smith Yeah, whatever. Penny. Penny, how come you’re not in more stuff, man? I’d cast you in a minute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 penny Seriously?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 kevin_smith Oh, yeah, man. I’m actually in pre-production on a movie right now. Way different than anything I’ve ever done before. It’s called Clerks 3. You should come over and read for a part.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 penny Oh, my, I would love that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter You have a new job.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 penny Well, maybe I can do both.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter I don’t think you can do both.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 penny I don’t think I asked you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 kevin_smith Yeah, you tell him, Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Stay out of it, Kevin Smith.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Do you think there comes a point in life when it stops feeling bad to be left out of things?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler Probably not. It’s an evolutionary advantage to be included in group activities.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 sheldon_cooper You know what? I used to be a fan of evolution, but I’ve since evolved, and now I think it’s dumb.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler Being left out is a terrible feeling. No one understands that better than I do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Hey, look at that. Even in your example, you’re all by yourself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler When there was a lice epidemic at my school, everybody got it except me. I tried to fool everyone by sprinkling sugar in my hair, but I just got attacked by bees.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 sheldon_cooper I can just picture them all right now at Feynman’s house, probably discussing Schrodinger and at the same time, not discussing Schrodinger. See? They’re missing out on hilarious jokes like that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler And at the same time, not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 sheldon_cooper It reminds me of when my stupid brother and sister would build forts in the living room and wouldn’t let me in. I hated that so much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler You know, there’s nothing I can do about getting you invited to the symposium, but if you wanted, we could build a fort.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Isn’t that a little juvenile?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler More juvenile than this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 sheldon_cooper I’ll get the blankets. You Google how to have childlike fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 howard_wolowitz You know what, I’m being a bad host. Let me get some more coffee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, let me do it, Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 howard_wolowitz No, I got it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski So, Josh, what do you do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 josh_wolowitz I’m studying oceanography down in San Diego.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, how nice. I loved Finding Nemo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 raj_koothrappali Enough chitchat. How do we know you are who you say you are?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 josh_wolowitz Why would I lie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 raj_koothrappali Okay, you got me there. You here looking for money?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 josh_wolowitz No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 raj_koothrappali A kidney, cornea, piece of his liver?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 josh_wolowitz No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 raj_koothrappali You’re in a Beatles cover band and you need Howard to replace your dad as Ringo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski Why don’t you help with the coffee?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 raj_koothrappali Okay, but something smells fishy. And not just because you work around sea animals. That actually sounds interesting, and I’d like to learn more about it. Hey, you okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Not really. This guy shows up out of the blue, and now I have a brother? My father has another family?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 raj_koothrappali I get it. What do you want to do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 howard_wolowitz I don’t know. I, I’d just like him to go away. I can’t deal with this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 raj_koothrappali All right, I’ve got your back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Thank you. Come on. And I’d like to point out, this wall just provided a lot of privacy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 josh_wolowitz I can’t believe my brother’s an astronaut. That’s amazing. What was it like?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 raj_koothrappali Listen, dude, it’s time for you to hit the road.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Hey, hey, the young man asked a good question.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 wil_wheaton So, for those of you just tuning in, we are listening to a really fun fight between my co-star…
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter No, no, no. We’re not fighting, we’re just having a conversation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 wil_wheaton All right. We’re listening to a really fun conversation between my co-star from Serial Ape-ist 2 and her fiancé, who doesn’t believe women should have dreams.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Give me back that juice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 penny What is the harm if I audition?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Well, what if you get it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 penny I don’t know, I make a movie, become rich and famous, win an Oscar, a Golden Globe and live an incredibly wonderful life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter From a Kevin Smith movie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 kevin_smith Oh, I’m hanging up now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 wil_wheaton Don’t you listen to him, buddy. You’re awesome. You’re one of the greatest directors of our time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 kevin_smith I don’t have a part for you, Wheaton.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 wil_wheaton And that was Kevin Smith.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 penny Thanks a lot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter I’m just trying to protect you. How many times did I see you get your heart broken trying to make it as an actress?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 penny Okay, instead of protecting me, why don’t you try being excited when something good happens?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter I’m always excited for you. I’m excited that you found this new job where you’re making decent money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 penny Decent? I make twice what you make.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Wait, twice?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 penny Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Like, times two twice?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 wil_wheaton For those of you at home, Leonard just found out his fiancée makes way more money than he does. Let’s listen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter I went to school for half my life. I have a doctorate. I’m still paying off college loans.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 penny Well, how much do you owe? Maybe I can help you out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Wil, can we just turn off the podcast for a little bit?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 wil_wheaton For those of you at home, I am shaking my head no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler How’s it going, Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Wonderful. I just finished hanging the lights.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler Can I come in?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Yes, oh, but enter through the side. Batman is a load-bearing blanket.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler Amazing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 sheldon_cooper I know. This isn’t the printout. This is my real face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler What are we doing? This is a fort. Let’s sit on the floor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Roughing it? Okay. Everything looks so big from down here. This must be how Leonard feels.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 howard_wolowitz I’m surprised you could hear me with this Thin Mint in your ear. Yeah, pretty cool, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 josh_wolowitz Yeah. Anyway, I should probably get going.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski Howie, have you noticed how often people say that when you start to do magic?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 josh_wolowitz Sorry, I have a long drive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Well, I hope I get to see you again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 josh_wolowitz I hope so, too. I’ve always dreamed of having a brother to play catch with.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski Keep dreaming.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Hey, I threw out the first pitch at an Angels game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 josh_wolowitz Wow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski He did it with a robot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 josh_wolowitz You had sex with a robot?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 howard_wolowitz That’s not what she meant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 raj_koothrappali But technically, yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Hang on, if you’re making all this money, where is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 penny In a safe place.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter What does that mean, under your bed?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 penny No, it means a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds. I’m not overly conservative. I’m young, so my guy said I can afford to take some risks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Wait a minute, you have a guy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 penny Don’t you have a guy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Why would I have a guy? I don’t have any money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 penny Oh, sweetie, you should really get some money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 wil_wheaton For those of you listening at home, how great is this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Wil, I’m begging you, just please turn that off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 wil_wheaton Sure. And we’re back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 penny Leonard, why are you making such a big deal out of this? So our roles have changed a bit over the last couple years. This is the way life is. And I’m sure in time they’ll change again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Great, you’re not only more successful than me, now you’re more mature.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 penny Okay, look, would it make you feel better if I did something dumb like sneak out of work one day to go audition for a Kevin Smith movie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter That would be great, thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 wil_wheaton I’m just gonna jump in here real quick. Leonard, a moment ago, you were dead set against Penny resuming her acting career, but now you’re all for it. Is it fair to say that she played you like a violin?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Yes, it is, Wil.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 josh_wolowitz So, I have to ask, was the robot sexy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 howard_wolowitz It was actually just a mechanical hand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 josh_wolowitz ‘Cause that’s all you need, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 howard_wolowitz You are my brother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Okay, so the final four forts in the first annual best fort ever contest, or fort off, are, Fort Knox, Fort Ticonderoga, Fort Sumter and Fort Cozy McBlanket.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler I’d say, Knox over Ticonderoga, ’cause it’s got the gold.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Mm-hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler And McBlanket over Sumter ’cause it has a higher thread count. Oh. Ten o’clock. Date night’s over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Wait, no. We haven’t picked a winner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler We both know this one’s gonna win.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Well, of course we do. Fort Knox doesn’t have a secret physics lending library.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler Come on, I’ll help you take this down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Well, wait. What if, just this once, we suspend the date night parameters and you stay later?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler Well, as long as we’re suspending the parameters, I could stay really late and we could have our first sleepover.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 sheldon_cooper That’s a big step.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler It’s a big fort.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Very well. I will agree to a family-friendly, G-rated, boy-girl sleepover.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler PG. Some scenes may be too intense for younger viewers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 sheldon_cooper G-rated, with a warning for families with babies and toddlers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler You got yourself a sleepover.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Do you need to borrow a toothbrush or pajamas?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler Would it alarm you to know that I hid those things here two years ago just in case this ever came up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 sheldon_cooper It would, but you know how much I admire preparedness. How did you know we’d be in the living room?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler Who says this is the only one I hid?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Hello? What is this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 sheldon_cooper We built a fort.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Are those my sheets?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler Yes, they are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Okay. Well, you kids have fun. I’m gonna go to sleep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Well, Leonard, don’t you want to see the inside of the fort?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I’m good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Oh, come on. I really wanted to tell someone they can’t come in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Okay, fine. Sheldon, may I please visit your fort?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode20 sheldon_cooper I want to say no, but it’s too glorious. Get in here.
