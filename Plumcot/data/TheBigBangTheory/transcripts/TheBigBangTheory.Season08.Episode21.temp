TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 sheldon Hey, would you like to hear some songs I’ve rewritten to get children interested in the hard sciences?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 howard Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 leonard Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 howard Yeah. Well, I like music, I like science, I like making fun of Sheldon. Hit it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 sheldon There was a scientist who had a theory and James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o. J-A-M-E-S, C-L-E-R-K space M-A-X-W-E-L-L, And James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o. There was a scientist who had a theory and James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o, A-M-E-S…
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 leonard Uh, okay, okay. Uh, we, we get it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 sheldon Perhaps you’d prefer this one. The itsy bitsy spider is not an insect at all, because it haseight legs and two body parts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 leonard That’s pretty cool, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 sheldon Thank you. Do either of you know Beyoncé? I’d love her to get behind it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 raj Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 leonard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 howard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 sheldon Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 raj You guys know the new Discovery class missions that NASA’s been working on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 leonard Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 raj Well, they’re looking to include a message from Earth in case one of them is encountered by alien life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 leonard Oh. When I encountered alien life, I discovered that the key thing was not to sit in its spot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 sheldon All right, you can’t breathe our air without an inhaler, he’s allergic to Earth nuts, but I’m the alien.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 raj Anyway, I’m among a handful of scientists that have been asked to submit a design proposal for the message and its delivery system.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 sheldon Excellent.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 howard Good for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 leonard Congratulations.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 raj And I was wondering if any of you guys would like to help me do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 leonard Are you kidding? Yes. What did you have in mind?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 sheldon I’ll tell you exactly what you should do, avoid the presumption of the Terran sensory input paradigm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 howard Yeah, absolutely. You need a device capable of delivering information across a wide range of perceptual modalities.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 sheldon Any intelligent organism would at the very least need the ability to locate the position of objects in space. So the ideal interstellar lingua franca would be haptic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 howard Ooh, how about a 3-D tactile communicator rigged for cross-sensory transposition?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 raj Exactly what I expected. Two people forcing their ideas on me and only one gentleman who could be bothered to ask me what my thoughts were. You two are out. Congratulations, Leonard, you’re on the team.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 leonard My mommy raised a gentleman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 raj Hey. Thanks for coming by.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 leonard Yeah. I’m excited to help.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 raj I would have included the others, but you know exactly what would’ve happened. They would’ve taken over the project and bossed us around.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 leonard I get it. Uh, just this morning, Sheldon wouldn’t let me put almond milk on my Grape-Nuts because he said it was a theoretical nut conflict.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 raj You should have told him to mind his own business.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 leonard Yeah. That’s better than what I did say, which was, fine, I’ll eat them with club soda.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 raj What makes them think they’re always in charge of everything?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 leonard Mmm, they’re alpha males.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 raj Huh, what does that make us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 leonard We could be betas. They’re second in charge.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 raj Okay, that sounds good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 leonard Or we could be omegas. They get pushed around by the alphas and the betas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 raj Okay, that sounds like us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 leonard Whatever. There’s no alphas here, and this is your project. You’re in charge. How do you want to start?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 raj I don’t know. How do you want to start?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 leonard I don’t know. Should we call Sheldon and Howard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 raj No. We can do this by ourselves.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 leonard Okay. Great. How do you want to start?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 raj I don’t know. How do you want to start?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 penny Sheldon. Sheldon. Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 sheldon I bet that started off as a joke, but by the third one you realized there was something strangely enjoyable about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 penny Yeah, I kind of want to do it again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 sheldon I don’t recommend it. You’ll be doing it the rest of your life. Anyway, if you’re looking for Leonard, he’s with Koothrappali.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 penny Uh, no, I actually came to talk to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 sheldon How nice. Here are some topics that interest me, quantum mechanics, trains, flags.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 penny No, no. It’s about my acting career.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 sheldon Oh, sorry. That’s not on the list.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 penny Well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 sheldon Oh, wait. No. How about we split the difference and discuss why Austria was an archduchy and not just a regular duchy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 penny Okay, look, here’s the thing. I like pharmaceutical sales, it’s going great, but I have an audition for a movie, and if I get it, it could screw everything up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 sheldon Hmm. I know exactly what you should do. Unfortunately, I cannot tell you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 penny Well, why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 sheldon I’m attempting to turn over a new leaf. Earlier today, it was pointed out to me that I tend to force my ideas on people.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 penny You’re really not gonna tell me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 sheldon No, that train has left the station. Now, we can play this one of two ways. You can say, trains, tell me more, or you can just look at me like that and I’ll start.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 bernadette What’s going on in here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 howard I am making molecular cocktails. This sphere is actually a cosmopolitan.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 bernadette Oh. How do you drink it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 howard Oh, just put it in your mouth and pop it like a zit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 bernadette I think I’ll have a beer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 howard First take a picture with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 bernadette Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 howard Well, Raj and I always talked about learning how to make cocktails like this together, so I taught myself and I’m putting this on Instagram so he can see it and feel like a turd. Say cheese.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 bernadette Is this about the space probe he’s working on without you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 howard You betcha. The very one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 bernadette Howard, you’re grown men. You guys don’t have to do everything together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 howard I know. That’s why I’m spending tonight with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 bernadette Trying to hurt Raj’s feelings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 howard With my honeybunch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 bernadette You’re being childish.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 howard No. He is. So I have a dominant personality. We all know that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 bernadette I’m sorry. What do we know?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 howard In social groupings, I just naturally wind up in charge.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 bernadette Don’t take this the wrong way, but how many of these little booze balls have you had?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 howard You don’t think I’m a leader?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 bernadette I was kidding. Of course you are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 howard Right. I couldn’t change if I wanted to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 bernadette You better not change, because I love who you are. Now, will you need help cleaning all this up when you’re done or can you do it all by yourself?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 howard All by myself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 bernadette There’s my big boss man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 sheldon So, often on the front of the locomotive is a large iron wedge for clearing objects off the tracks. Now, while commonly known as a cowcatcher, I prefer the more accurate cow exploder.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 penny Okay. Sheldon, let me ask you a question.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 sheldon Mmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 penny If I was at a train station and one train could take me to my current job and the other train could take me to an audition for a movie, which train should I get on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 sheldon Are you using trains to trick me into giving you advice?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 sheldon All right, then. You should take a third train where you audition for the movie but hold off on making a career decision until you have more information.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 penny Oh. You’re right. I’m worried about something that hasn’t even happened yet. Huh. You are a wise man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 sheldon Well, Penny, who’s smarter, the wise man or the person who comes to him for advice?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 penny Oh, I guess you’re right. Maybe it is the person who asks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 sheldon No, it’s the wise man. That’s why he’s called the wise man. You know how I know that? I’m the wise man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 penny I’m sorry. What was I thinking?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 sheldon Uh, just out of curiosity, why didn’t you ask Leonard for advice about this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 penny ‘Cause I already know what he’ll say. Wah, wah, wah, you shouldn’t do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 sheldon Ah, it’s just like he’s here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 raj Okay, so we know that previous attempts to send a message into space, like the Golden Record on Voyager, were heavily criticized.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 leonard Well, aliens could only play the Golden Record if they figured out how to build a record player.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 raj Eh. Although, to be fair, I watched E.T. build a telephone out of a Speak & Spell and an umbrella. Dude was like a little brown MacGyver.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 leonard That would be more helpful if E.T. were real.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 raj Well, my feelings were real when he was about to die.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 leonard My God, when he’s on the table and they use the paddles on him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 raj And he’s all white.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 leonard They zip him up in that bag.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 raj And Gertie can’t stop crying.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 leonard The flower dies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 raj Okay, let’s talk about something else.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 leonard All right, so it sounds like we need a way to communicate that’s simple.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 raj And doesn’t require outside machinery to be built to access it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 leonard It’s also a problem because we don’t even know if the aliens who find this can see. I mean, they might communicate in a totally different way than us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 raj Like when my dog is mad at me, she tells me by peeing in my slippers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 leonard That’s actually a valid example. Animals do deliver messages through scent.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 raj Bees talk to each other by dancing. Whales have their songs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 leonard Yeah. Penny has about twenty different ways of rolling her eyes that each mean something different.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 raj Okay, so, what it sounds like is, what we want is a device that can deliver a message through not only sight, but other senses, as well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 leonard The most basic sense that any space-faring civilization would have to possess is touch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 raj Ooh. Ooh, ooh. We could make a video-playing device that simultaneously translates the information into a tactile medium.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 leonard All we have to do is rig up a 3-D communication system.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 raj We, we can totally do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 leonard I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 raj This is great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 leonard Yeah, you know what else it is?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 raj What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 howard Exactly what Sheldon and Howard said.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 raj Well, thank you for peeing in my slippers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 sheldon It’s the eye of the tiger, it’s the ear of the bat, it’s the whiskers of the catfish and the walrus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 howard Hang on. Not that your song isn’t terrible, it is. but how do you mention bats and leave out sonar?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 sheldon You didn’t let me finish. And also regarding the bat, it has sonar.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 leonard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 howard Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 raj Look, I know you guys are upset, but we’ve talked about it, and we think it’d be beneficial for you to be part of the project.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 howard Well, well, well, did you hear that, Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 sheldon I’m sorry. I was trying to think of what rhymes with nose of the aardvark.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 leonard We want you back on the project with us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 sheldon Well, well, well, did you hear that, Howard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 raj Look, we admit it. The idea that you guys came up with was really good, and I’d love your help.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 howard I suppose it couldn’t have been easy for you to say that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 raj It wasn’t, so are you in?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 sheldon Certainly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 howard Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 leonard Great. Now that we’re all on the same page, let’s get together tonight and work on it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 sheldon Get together tonight? Leonard, stop trying to control everything, and give poor Raj a chance to come up with what we should do. Go ahead, Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 raj Okay, I think we should do it right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 sheldon Tonight works better for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 raj Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 penny Okay, it’s just an audition. Why am I nervous? Maybe it’s a good thing. Just means I want it. And I can have it. This feels right. Why did I ever give this up? I’m starting to remember.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 raj So, I’d like to try a technique where no one gets steamrolled. When you talk, instead of bringing up a new idea, respect what was just said by building on it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 sheldon Uh, building on that, we should order dinner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 leonard How is that building on what he just said?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 howard Building on what Sheldon said, I could go for Chinese.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 raj Hang on. Building on what Leonard said, no one built on what I said.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 sheldon Building on building on that, there’s a new build-your-own pizza place on Colorado.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 leonard Building on that, I’d like to remind you, I’m lactose intolerant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 howard I saw the menu. They have soy cheese.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 sheldon Bah, you didn’t say building on. You’re out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 leonard It’s not Simon Says.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 raj Yeah, you’re missing the point, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 sheldon You’re out, and you’re out. I win. Who wants pizza?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 girl Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 penny Oh, hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 girl Hey. I haven’t seen you auditioning in a while.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 penny Yeah, uh, I got a job as a pharmaceutical sales rep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 girl You quit acting?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 penny Well, kind of. But now I get to act like inflamed heart is only a mild side effect.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 second_girl I heard you can make good money doing that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 penny Yeah, it’s going okay, but I do miss this sometimes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 first_girl Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 penny Mmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 first_girl ‘Cause I got to tell you, I am so sick of the humiliation and being treated like a piece of meat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 audiitoner Chelsea?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 first_girl Wish me luck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 second_girl They’re gonna love you. I heard she’s pushing 40 and everything’s fake.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 penny Yeah. I started that rumour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 leonard Okay, since we agree on the delivery system for the message, maybe we should talk about what the message could be.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 raj Well, I think we should show what earthlings look like.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 howard The plaque they sent up on the Pioneer probe had a drawing of a naked man and woman on it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 sheldon Yeah, I never cared for that. It’s advertising to predator races just how soft and squishy we are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 leonard Squeeze yourself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 sheldon Oh, don’t be offended. You know, of the four of us, you have the most veal-like consistency.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 raj Well, maybe there’s a way to appear non-aggressive, but also be able to protect ourselves if necessary. Like smiling and waving with one hand, but the other hand holding the severed head of a tiger.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 howard You want to send a passive-aggressive message out into the universe? That’s ridiculous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 raj Oh, you mean passive-aggressive like posting pictures of you and your wife eating cosmopolitan balls that you know belong in my mouth?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 sheldon Perhaps Howard meant passive-aggressive like asking our group to help on your project, and then only choosing Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 raj Look, I’m sorry I hurt your feelings, but you do have strong personalities and always end up taking over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 howard It’s not always.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 leonard What about when we went to Comic-Con and dressed like Jabba the Hutt? You got to be Jabba’s head, and I got to be his fat slug butt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 sheldon We looked great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 leonard You let a guy sit on me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 howard He was dressed as Princess Leia. It made a nice picture.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 leonard I’m just saying, sometimes Raj and I feel pushed aside.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 raj Yeah. Like when you took Sheldon to Texas and showed him all around NASA, you didn’t even think to ask me and Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 howard You know what? You’re right. I should have asked you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 sheldon Yeah, and if he does ask you, go. It’s amazing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 howard Okay, and if we’re talking about being left out of things, you guys went to Skywalker Ranch without us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 sheldon Oh, I recommend that, too. That was a magical experience.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 leonard Wait a minute. Sheldon spent a whole day with James Earl Jones and never told any of us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 sheldon I sure did. Oh, my goodness. Well, from Jabba’s head to ice cream with Darth Vader, I’m having a heck of a ride. Yeah, look, clearly, good things happen when I’m in charge. Now, why don’t you boys step aside, let me knock this project out?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 leonard Sheldon, you’re not in charge. Raj is in charge.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 sheldon Leonard, who’s really in charge? The person in charge, or those who put him in charge?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 raj He’s right. If you think about it, we’re all in charge.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 sheldon No, the guy in charge is in ch… why is everyone so bad at these?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 penny I mean, the whole experience reminded me about how much I hated about that world. You, you know, the anxiety, the depression, the negativity. I don’t want to feel those things. I want to sell drugs to people who feel those things.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 amy I can’t believe you got up and walked out of an audition for a big movie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 penny I did. I mean, I walked in, read for the part, then stunk up the place, but then I walked right out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 bernadette Well, I’m glad you have a new appreciation for your job.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 penny I do, and you know, I don’t think I’ve ever thanked you properly for helping me get it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 bernadette Properly, at all. It’s just words I’ve never heard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 penny Well, thank you. You’re a good friend, and you changed my life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 bernadette You’re welcome. Hey, now that you’re making some real money, maybe you can take your friend out for a nice thank-you dinner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 penny Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 amy And you probably have to invite your other friend ’cause she overheard you talking about it, and it would be awkward to exclude her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 penny Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 bernadette How about now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 penny All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 bernadette Don’t forget your wallet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 penny I, uh, huh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 sheldon Greetings from planet Earth. Just turn left at Alpha Centauri. You can’t miss it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 first_alien That soft pink alien looks delicious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode21 second_alien I could eat.
