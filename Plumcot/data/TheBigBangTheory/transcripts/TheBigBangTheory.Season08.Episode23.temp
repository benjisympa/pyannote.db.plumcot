TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 penny Leonard, what time does your mom’s plane get in?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard I don’t know, some time tomorrow morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 penny Don’t you want to know for sure?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard No need to. As soon as she flies into California airspace, I’ll feel a disturbance in the Force.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 amy It’s so nice both of your moms are coming in to see you guys get an award.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon Well, my mother’s been there for every honour I’ve won since I beat out my twin sister for the did it on the potty trophy. How does this look?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 penny Aw, it’s so nice. She’s gonna love it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 amy Sure, his mom gets roses. When I want them, they’re a bouquet of severed plant genitals.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon You act like I didn’t get you that mushroom log on Valentine’s Day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 amy He’s right. Roses die, but a moist rotting log will pump out mushrooms for two or three magical years.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 penny You know, your mom’s never been too thrilled with our relationship. Maybe I should get her something so she warms up to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard If you could run out and get a PhD, that might make her like you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 penny Really? It didn’t work for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 amy Do you think the moms will get along?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard Uh, I don’t know. They’re pretty different.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon Maybe they’ll be best friends. One of them is brilliant, one is sweet and simple. Sound familiar?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mrs_cooper Shelly, I’m so proud of you and Leonard for getting this award.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon Oh, thank you, Mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mrs_cooper I tried to read your paper, but it was very hard for me to understand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon Oh, it’s quite straightforward, actually. It describes a new model of the universe that conceptualizes it as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mrs_cooper Interesting. You can believe that, but God filling an ark with animals two-by-two is nonsense.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon What did they feed the lions, Mother?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mrs_cooper The floating bodies of drowned sinners, of course.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon Listen, Leonard’s mom is a renowned psychiatrist and woman of science. Can you please keep the Bible babble to yourself while she’s here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mrs_cooper Are you ashamed of me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon Of course not. I love you. I’m just embarrassed by the things you believe, do and say.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mrs_cooper Well, I love you, too. My little bowl of lion chow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_hofstadter So, have you and Penny set a wedding date?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard No, we’re kind of taking it slow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_hofstadter I see.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard What does that mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_hofstadter You’ve been on and off with this woman for seven years and engaged for one year. One has to wonder if there’s a problem. Are you having satisfactory intercourse?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard Yes, Mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_hofstadter Only satisfactory. I see.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard I change my answer. It, it’s amazing. It’s hot. We can barely keep our hands off each other.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_hofstadter Seems odd to try and impress your mother with your sexual prowess. But then, you always did have that unresolved Oedipal complex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard See, this right here, what you’re doing, can you please not do that around Sheldon’s mom?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_hofstadter Why? Are you attracted to her, too?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard Of course not. She’s, she’s just a very sweet and God-fearing lady, and you have to be respectful of her beliefs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_hofstadter Leonard, I’m an adult. I know how to conduct myself around people from different walks of life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_hofstadter Where is she from again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard East Texas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_hofstadter Ugh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard Hey, look who’s here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon Oh, Doctor Hofstadter, it’s so good to see you again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_hofstadter Likewise. I read your paper, it was very impressive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon Oh, thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard We just spent two hours in traffic. Did you think to mention to me that you liked our paper?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_hofstadter Of course I did, but it’s a mother’s job to make sure her child’s self-esteem is not dependent on anyone’s approval.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard That’s so sweet, you think I have self-esteem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon Doctor Hofstadter, I want you to meet my mother, Mary.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_hofstadter So nice to meet you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mrs_cooper Nice to meet you, too. How was your flight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_hofstadter Very pleasant. And yours?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mrs_cooper Lovely. Almost as if someone, not saying who, was watching over the plane.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_hofstadter You’re kidding, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard Subtle, mom, real subtle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 bernadette Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 stuart Morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 bernadette We talked about this. I don’t mind you still living here, but we got to have some rules. And rule number one is pants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 howard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mrs_cooper You must be very proud of your son.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_hofstadter Oh, yes. He recently argued a case before the Supreme Court.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mrs_cooper He did?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_hofstadter Oh, you mean this son. Uh, sure, he’s terrific.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon Beverly, would you like to see the math I worked out to support our hypothesis?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard You mean, my hypothesis. I hypothesized it all by myself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_hofstadter Calm down, dear. Mary, I’m curious. When did you first realize that your son had such a remarkable mind?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon Ooh, good question. Everyone loves stories about Sheldon Cooper, boy genius.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mrs_cooper Well, I would have to say when he was 13 and tried to build a nuclear reactor in the tool shed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon Ooh, this is a good one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mrs_cooper Now, the first thing you have to know about Shelly is ever since he was a little boy, he was always concerned with the well-being of others. And he didn’t think that it was fair for people to pay for electricity, so he was gonna power the entire town for free.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon Tell her about the uranium. Tell her about the uranium.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mrs_cooper Oh, well. Oh, this is adorable. When he arranged to get some yellowcake from Chad, I thought he was talking about Twinkies from one of his friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon But I wasn’t. ‘Cause I didn’t have any friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mrs_cooper No. It turns out that this little scallywag was trying to use my Visa card to buy uranium from an African warlord in the country of Chad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_hofstadter Sounds like Sheldon was a handful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mrs_cooper Oh, he was a handful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon I was a handful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard You still are. Uh, Mom, hey, tell Mary the story about how I made a Van der Graaf generator out of our vacuum cleaner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_hofstadter All right. He broke the vacuum cleaner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 howard I mean, for a while, everything was vampires. Now it’s all zombies. I wonder what the next monster fad will be.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 raj We haven’t had a good invisible man in a while.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 stuart Clearly, you’ve never seen me try to talk to a woman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 bernadette Guys. In the time you’ve been sitting here playing video games, I got the car washed, picked up cleaning supplies and went to the bank.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 stuart I put on pants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 howard Kiss-ass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 bernadette Okay, I don’t know when I became the mother to three lazy teenagers, but it stops today. You guys are cleaning the kitchen, top to bottom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 raj Hey, I don’t even live here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 bernadette Yes or no, do you have clothes in my laundry right now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 raj I do. And some of it’s wool, so dry flat if possible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon Oh, and here’s a picture of me receiving my bachelor of science degree.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_hofstadter You don’t look very happy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon Well, I had just begun puberty. It was figuratively and literally one of the hairiest moments of my life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mrs_cooper Shelly does not like change.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon Oh, true. But all the clenching in the world will not keep testicles in your abdomen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 penny Hey, sorry, got caught up at work. Hi, Beverly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_hofstadter Hello. Oh, okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 penny Sorry, I forgot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon You remember my mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 penny Oh, yes. Hi, Mary.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mrs_cooper Good to see you again, dear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 penny Ah, yeah, now that’s what I’m talking about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard So, Mom, you haven’t seen Penny since we got engaged.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 penny Oh, yeah, let me show you the ring.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_hofstadter Oh, lovely. Must have been very expensive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon Oh, no, not at all. No, we, uh, found a place online that, uh, repurposes diamond drill bits.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard We did not. That’s not true. Can I speak to you alone for a second?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon Oh, sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard It came from Tiffany’s.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon You mean the box, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard Keep walking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 penny Really doesn’t matter to me how much he spent on the ring. I think.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon Did I misspeak about the ring?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard Yes, and we’ll get back to that. But, uh, even with your mother here, you are deliberately hogging all the attention from my mom. You’re like one of those elephant seal pups that steals the milk from two mothers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon Do you mean what marine biologists refer to as super weaning?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard Yes, you are a super weaner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon Well, now I have to correct you. As a bit of an elephant seal buff, the more accurate comparison would be when two mother seals actively seek to nourish the same pup. So I believe the term you’re looking for is a double mother suckler.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard Yeah, you’re right. That is the term I’m looking for. You are a dirty double mother suckler.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon Okay, well, now that we have the terminology straightened out. How dare you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 penny We’re not in a rush. We’ll set a date when the time is right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mrs_cooper It doesn’t matter, sweetie. The moment a man lays with a woman, they are married in the eyes of the Lord.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_hofstadter Uch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mrs_cooper Uch? The bible is uch to you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_hofstadter No, I’m sorry. That was inappropriate. As a psychiatrist, I know how important people’s superstitions can be to them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mrs_cooper You want to talk about superstitions? Sheldon sent me the books you wrote, all that nonsense about superegos and ids. What bull dropped that on the barn floor?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_hofstadter His name is Sigmund Freud.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 penny Hey, look at that. You both believe in Jewish bearded guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mrs_cooper Stay out of this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 penny Mm-hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mrs_cooper At least the bearded man that I believe in preaches love and compassion. All yours talks about is why you hold in your poop and want to crawl back inside your mama.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_hofstadter It’s fascinating. How can someone as enlightened as Sheldon come from someone like you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mrs_cooper I know the answer. You’re not gonna like it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_hofstadter Try me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mrs_cooper When I was pregnant with Shelly, I was driving to church, and I was praying to the Lord to give me a son smarter than his dumb-ass daddy. And I looked over and I saw a Jesus bobblehead in the Subaru next to me nodding yes. What is that supposed to mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_hofstadter It means, I can’t believe we’re having this conversation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mrs_cooper Well, do it some more. Maybe you can knock some sense into yourself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 penny Why don’t we all stop hitting ourselves and talk about something safe, you know, like shoes or how cute little Chinese babies are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon It is not my fault that your mother likes me better than she likes you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard Oh, don’t flatter yourself. She likes everybody better than she likes me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 raj How old is this Jell-O?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 stuart Well, it’s carrots, so gonna say very.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 howard Sorry we have to do this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 stuart Bernadette’s not wrong. She does work hard around here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 raj Yeah, maybe it’s a good thing if she stops babying you so much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 howard She doesn’t baby me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 stuart I saw her pull you home in a wagon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 howard For your information, I twisted my ankle chasing the ice cream truck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 raj Face it, dude, Bernadette treats you the same way your mother used to, and that was not a healthy relationship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 howard You’re right. It’s time for me to act like an adult in this marriage. Starting with my husbandly duty of taking out the trash. Bernie, I made a mess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_hofstadter I’m terribly sorry that I upset your mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon Oh, it’s all right. She’ll forgive you. She has to or she goes to hell.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_hofstadter I can’t help but notice how her unconditional love for you is diametrically opposed to my own parenting strategies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon Well, you doled out affection as a reward for achievement, a proven way to raise a child. Or train a rat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_hofstadter But look how well you turned out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon I’d feign modesty at this point, but who would believe me? Still, you need to consider how successful Leonard’s brother and sister are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_hofstadter I suppose.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon While my brother and sister are mouth-breathing idiots.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_hofstadter Do you suppose you would’ve flourished more in a reward-based environment?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon Perhaps. But my mom made me spaghetti with chopped-up hot dogs whenever I wanted, so who cares?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard Not once did my mother ever give me any love or affection for just being myself, I always had to earn it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mrs_cooper Oh, Leonard, I’m sure she loves you very much. In her own cold godless way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 penny Yeah, and you certainly don’t have to earn my love.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 penny Of course, you already knew that when you bought me this princess-cut drill bit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard That’s not what it is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 penny I know, I know. Zzzzzzzz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mrs_cooper When your mom gets back, I’m gonna need to apologize for the way I spoke to her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 penny Well, come on now, she did kind of start it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mrs_cooper Doesn’t matter, a good Christian would’ve turned the other cheek. On the other hand, a good Texan would’ve shot her, so, I just kind of split the difference. Hey, who’s in the mood for spaghetti and hot dogs?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard Oh, me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 penny Yeah, me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mrs_cooper Coming up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard I don’t really feel I deserve it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 howard That was a big sticky mess, but I think I got it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 raj Looks good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 stuart Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 bernadette Look at that. You cleaned it up all by yourself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 howard Yes, I cleaned it up all by myself. Honestly, I don’t know why you complain so… okay, maybe I missed one spot. Just leave.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mrs_cooper I’m so glad that you and I were able to bury the hatchet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_hofstadter Me, too. And I respect your right to your beliefs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mrs_cooper And I will pray for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard Okay, Mom, let’s get you back to your hotel before anyone says anything else.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_hofstadter One moment. There’s something I need to say to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard Oh, really? That’s too bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_hofstadter Leonard, I always made you earn my affection, but today I realize that there’s more than one way to raise a child.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon I taught her that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_hofstadter Therefore, I would like to initiate a new protocol wherein I shower you with unconditional love.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard Wow. When does that start?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_hofstadter So needy. Come to Mommy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 penny It’s okay, go ahead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_hofstadter Oh, my son.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard Oh, my mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 penny Oh, my God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 stuart It’s a hard-knock life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 together It’s the hard-knock life for us, it’s the hard-knock life for us. ‘Stead of treated, we get tricked, ‘stead of kisses, we get kicked, it’s the hard-knock life. Got no folks to speak of so it’s the hard-knock row we hoe, cotton blankets ‘stead of wool, empty bellies ‘stead of full, it’s a hard-knock life.
