TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 penny Leonard, what time does your mom’s plane get in?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter I don’t know, some time tomorrow morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 penny Don’t you want to know for sure?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter No need to. As soon as she flies into California airspace, I’ll feel a disturbance in the Force.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 amy_farrah_fowler It’s so nice both of your moms are coming in to see you guys get an award.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Well, my mother’s been there for every honour I’ve won since I beat out my twin sister for the did it on the potty trophy. How does this look?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 penny Aw, it’s so nice. She’s gonna love it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 amy_farrah_fowler Sure, his mom gets roses. When I want them, they’re a bouquet of severed plant genitals.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon_cooper You act like I didn’t get you that mushroom log on Valentine’s Day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 amy_farrah_fowler He’s right. Roses die, but a moist rotting log will pump out mushrooms for two or three magical years.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 penny You know, your mom’s never been too thrilled with our relationship. Maybe I should get her something so she warms up to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter If you could run out and get a PhD, that might make her like you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 penny Really? It didn’t work for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 amy_farrah_fowler Do you think the moms will get along?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Uh, I don’t know. They’re pretty different.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Maybe they’ll be best friends. One of them is brilliant, one is sweet and simple. Sound familiar?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mary_cooper Shelly, I’m so proud of you and Leonard for getting this award.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Oh, thank you, Mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mary_cooper I tried to read your paper, but it was very hard for me to understand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Oh, it’s quite straightforward, actually. It describes a new model of the universe that conceptualizes it as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mary_cooper Interesting. You can believe that, but God filling an ark with animals two-by-two is nonsense.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon_cooper What did they feed the lions, Mother?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mary_cooper The floating bodies of drowned sinners, of course.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Listen, Leonard’s mom is a renowned psychiatrist and woman of science. Can you please keep the Bible babble to yourself while she’s here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mary_cooper Are you ashamed of me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Of course not. I love you. I’m just embarrassed by the things you believe, do and say.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mary_cooper Well, I love you, too. My little bowl of lion chow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_beverly_hofstadter So, have you and Penny set a wedding date?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter No, we’re kind of taking it slow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_beverly_hofstadter I see.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter What does that mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_beverly_hofstadter You’ve been on and off with this woman for seven years and engaged for one year. One has to wonder if there’s a problem. Are you having satisfactory intercourse?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Yes, Mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_beverly_hofstadter Only satisfactory. I see.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter I change my answer. It, it’s amazing. It’s hot. We can barely keep our hands off each other.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_beverly_hofstadter Seems odd to try and impress your mother with your sexual prowess. But then, you always did have that unresolved Oedipal complex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter See, this right here, what you’re doing, can you please not do that around Sheldon’s mom?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_beverly_hofstadter Why? Are you attracted to her, too?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Of course not. She’s, she’s just a very sweet and God-fearing lady, and you have to be respectful of her beliefs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_beverly_hofstadter Leonard, I’m an adult. I know how to conduct myself around people from different walks of life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_beverly_hofstadter Where is she from again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter East Texas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_beverly_hofstadter Ugh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Hey, look who’s here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Oh, Doctor Hofstadter, it’s so good to see you again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_beverly_hofstadter Likewise. I read your paper, it was very impressive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Oh, thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter We just spent two hours in traffic. Did you think to mention to me that you liked our paper?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_beverly_hofstadter Of course I did, but it’s a mother’s job to make sure her child’s self-esteem is not dependent on anyone’s approval.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter That’s so sweet, you think I have self-esteem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Doctor Hofstadter, I want you to meet my mother, Mary.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_beverly_hofstadter So nice to meet you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mary_cooper Nice to meet you, too. How was your flight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_beverly_hofstadter Very pleasant. And yours?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mary_cooper Lovely. Almost as if someone, not saying who, was watching over the plane.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_beverly_hofstadter You’re kidding, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Subtle, mom, real subtle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 stuart_bloom Morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski We talked about this. I don’t mind you still living here, but we got to have some rules. And rule number one is pants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mary_cooper You must be very proud of your son.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_beverly_hofstadter Oh, yes. He recently argued a case before the Supreme Court.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mary_cooper He did?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_beverly_hofstadter Oh, you mean this son. Uh, sure, he’s terrific.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Beverly, would you like to see the math I worked out to support our hypothesis?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter You mean, my hypothesis. I hypothesized it all by myself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_beverly_hofstadter Calm down, dear. Mary, I’m curious. When did you first realize that your son had such a remarkable mind?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Ooh, good question. Everyone loves stories about Sheldon Cooper, boy genius.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mary_cooper Well, I would have to say when he was 13 and tried to build a nuclear reactor in the tool shed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Ooh, this is a good one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mary_cooper Now, the first thing you have to know about Shelly is ever since he was a little boy, he was always concerned with the well-being of others. And he didn’t think that it was fair for people to pay for electricity, so he was gonna power the entire town for free.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Tell her about the uranium. Tell her about the uranium.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mary_cooper Oh, well. Oh, this is adorable. When he arranged to get some yellowcake from Chad, I thought he was talking about Twinkies from one of his friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon_cooper But I wasn’t. ‘Cause I didn’t have any friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mary_cooper No. It turns out that this little scallywag was trying to use my Visa card to buy uranium from an African warlord in the country of Chad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_beverly_hofstadter Sounds like Sheldon was a handful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mary_cooper Oh, he was a handful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon_cooper I was a handful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter You still are. Uh, Mom, hey, tell Mary the story about how I made a Van der Graaf generator out of our vacuum cleaner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_beverly_hofstadter All right. He broke the vacuum cleaner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 howard_wolowitz I mean, for a while, everything was vampires. Now it’s all zombies. I wonder what the next monster fad will be.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 raj_koothrappali We haven’t had a good invisible man in a while.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 stuart_bloom Clearly, you’ve never seen me try to talk to a woman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski Guys. In the time you’ve been sitting here playing video games, I got the car washed, picked up cleaning supplies and went to the bank.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 stuart_bloom I put on pants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Kiss-ass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski Okay, I don’t know when I became the mother to three lazy teenagers, but it stops today. You guys are cleaning the kitchen, top to bottom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Hey, I don’t even live here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski Yes or no, do you have clothes in my laundry right now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 raj_koothrappali I do. And some of it’s wool, so dry flat if possible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Oh, and here’s a picture of me receiving my bachelor of science degree.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_beverly_hofstadter You don’t look very happy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Well, I had just begun puberty. It was figuratively and literally one of the hairiest moments of my life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mary_cooper Shelly does not like change.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Oh, true. But all the clenching in the world will not keep testicles in your abdomen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 penny Hey, sorry, got caught up at work. Hi, Beverly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_beverly_hofstadter Hello. Oh, okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 penny Sorry, I forgot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon_cooper You remember my mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 penny Oh, yes. Hi, Mary.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mary_cooper Good to see you again, dear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 penny Ah, yeah, now that’s what I’m talking about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter So, Mom, you haven’t seen Penny since we got engaged.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 penny Oh, yeah, let me show you the ring.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_beverly_hofstadter Oh, lovely. Must have been very expensive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Oh, no, not at all. No, we, uh, found a place online that, uh, repurposes diamond drill bits.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter We did not. That’s not true. Can I speak to you alone for a second?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Oh, sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter It came from Tiffany’s.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon_cooper You mean the box, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Keep walking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 penny Really doesn’t matter to me how much he spent on the ring. I think.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Did I misspeak about the ring?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Yes, and we’ll get back to that. But, uh, even with your mother here, you are deliberately hogging all the attention from my mom. You’re like one of those elephant seal pups that steals the milk from two mothers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Do you mean what marine biologists refer to as super weaning?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Yes, you are a super weaner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Well, now I have to correct you. As a bit of an elephant seal buff, the more accurate comparison would be when two mother seals actively seek to nourish the same pup. So I believe the term you’re looking for is a double mother suckler.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, you’re right. That is the term I’m looking for. You are a dirty double mother suckler.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Okay, well, now that we have the terminology straightened out. How dare you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 penny We’re not in a rush. We’ll set a date when the time is right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mary_cooper It doesn’t matter, sweetie. The moment a man lays with a woman, they are married in the eyes of the Lord.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_beverly_hofstadter Uch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mary_cooper Uch? The bible is uch to you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_beverly_hofstadter No, I’m sorry. That was inappropriate. As a psychiatrist, I know how important people’s superstitions can be to them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mary_cooper You want to talk about superstitions? Sheldon sent me the books you wrote, all that nonsense about superegos and ids. What bull dropped that on the barn floor?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_beverly_hofstadter His name is Sigmund Freud.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 penny Hey, look at that. You both believe in Jewish bearded guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mary_cooper Stay out of this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 penny Mm-hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mary_cooper At least the bearded man that I believe in preaches love and compassion. All yours talks about is why you hold in your poop and want to crawl back inside your mama.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_beverly_hofstadter It’s fascinating. How can someone as enlightened as Sheldon come from someone like you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mary_cooper I know the answer. You’re not gonna like it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_beverly_hofstadter Try me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mary_cooper When I was pregnant with Shelly, I was driving to church, and I was praying to the Lord to give me a son smarter than his dumb-ass daddy. And I looked over and I saw a Jesus bobblehead in the Subaru next to me nodding yes. What is that supposed to mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_beverly_hofstadter It means, I can’t believe we’re having this conversation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mary_cooper Well, do it some more. Maybe you can knock some sense into yourself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 penny Why don’t we all stop hitting ourselves and talk about something safe, you know, like shoes or how cute little Chinese babies are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon_cooper It is not my fault that your mother likes me better than she likes you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Oh, don’t flatter yourself. She likes everybody better than she likes me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 raj_koothrappali How old is this Jell-O?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 stuart_bloom Well, it’s carrots, so gonna say very.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Sorry we have to do this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 stuart_bloom Bernadette’s not wrong. She does work hard around here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Yeah, maybe it’s a good thing if she stops babying you so much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 howard_wolowitz She doesn’t baby me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 stuart_bloom I saw her pull you home in a wagon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 howard_wolowitz For your information, I twisted my ankle chasing the ice cream truck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Face it, dude, Bernadette treats you the same way your mother used to, and that was not a healthy relationship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 howard_wolowitz You’re right. It’s time for me to act like an adult in this marriage. Starting with my husbandly duty of taking out the trash. Bernie, I made a mess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_beverly_hofstadter I’m terribly sorry that I upset your mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Oh, it’s all right. She’ll forgive you. She has to or she goes to hell.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_beverly_hofstadter I can’t help but notice how her unconditional love for you is diametrically opposed to my own parenting strategies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Well, you doled out affection as a reward for achievement, a proven way to raise a child. Or train a rat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_beverly_hofstadter But look how well you turned out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon_cooper I’d feign modesty at this point, but who would believe me? Still, you need to consider how successful Leonard’s brother and sister are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_beverly_hofstadter I suppose.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon_cooper While my brother and sister are mouth-breathing idiots.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_beverly_hofstadter Do you suppose you would’ve flourished more in a reward-based environment?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon_cooper Perhaps. But my mom made me spaghetti with chopped-up hot dogs whenever I wanted, so who cares?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Not once did my mother ever give me any love or affection for just being myself, I always had to earn it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mary_cooper Oh, Leonard, I’m sure she loves you very much. In her own cold godless way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 penny Yeah, and you certainly don’t have to earn my love.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 penny Of course, you already knew that when you bought me this princess-cut drill bit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter That’s not what it is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 penny I know, I know. Zzzzzzzz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mary_cooper When your mom gets back, I’m gonna need to apologize for the way I spoke to her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 penny Well, come on now, she did kind of start it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mary_cooper Doesn’t matter, a good Christian would’ve turned the other cheek. On the other hand, a good Texan would’ve shot her, so, I just kind of split the difference. Hey, who’s in the mood for spaghetti and hot dogs?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Oh, me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 penny Yeah, me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mary_cooper Coming up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter I don’t really feel I deserve it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 howard_wolowitz That was a big sticky mess, but I think I got it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 raj_koothrappali Looks good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 stuart_bloom Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 bernadette_rostenkowski Look at that. You cleaned it up all by yourself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 howard_wolowitz Yes, I cleaned it up all by myself. Honestly, I don’t know why you complain so… okay, maybe I missed one spot. Just leave.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mary_cooper I’m so glad that you and I were able to bury the hatchet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_beverly_hofstadter Me, too. And I respect your right to your beliefs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 mary_cooper And I will pray for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Okay, Mom, let’s get you back to your hotel before anyone says anything else.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_beverly_hofstadter One moment. There’s something I need to say to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Oh, really? That’s too bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_beverly_hofstadter Leonard, I always made you earn my affection, but today I realize that there’s more than one way to raise a child.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 sheldon_cooper I taught her that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_beverly_hofstadter Therefore, I would like to initiate a new protocol wherein I shower you with unconditional love.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Wow. When does that start?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_beverly_hofstadter So needy. Come to Mommy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 penny It’s okay, go ahead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 dr_beverly_hofstadter Oh, my son.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 leonard_hofstadter Oh, my mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 penny Oh, my God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 stuart_bloom It’s a hard-knock life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 together#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode23 It’s the hard-knock life for us, it’s the hard-knock life for us. ‘Stead of treated, we get tricked, ‘stead of kisses, we get kicked, it’s the hard-knock life. Got no folks to speak of so it’s the hard-knock row we hoe, cotton blankets ‘stead of wool, empty bellies ‘stead of full, it’s a hard-knock life.
