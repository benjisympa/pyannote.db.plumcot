TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 amy Can you believe it’s been five years since our first date?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 sheldon I know. Do you think I should start watching The Flash TV show?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 amy That’s what you’re thinking about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 sheldon Well, one of the things.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 amy Are any of them me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 sheldon Yes. I thought, I can’t decide if I should watch The Flash TV show. I know, I’ll ask Amy. Anyway.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 amy What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 sheldon You’re right, you did kind of kill the mood.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 amy I didn’t kill anything. You did, talking about your stupid TV show.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 sheldon Excuse me. Starting to watch a television show that might run for years isn’t a decision to take lightly. I’m wrestling with a big commitment issue here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 amy Really? That’s the commitment issue you’re wrestling with? Sheldon, do you understand the irony of your fixation on a man with super speed, while after five years all I can get out of you is a distracted make-out session on a couch?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 sheldon Irony’s not really my strong suit. But I have been getting better with sarcasm, if you want to give that a try.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 amy Oh, sure, I’d love to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 sheldon Whenever you’re ready.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 stuart I don’t want to rush you, but I’m closing a little early tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 raj Ooh. Hot date?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 stuart Uh, no. I overheard Bernadette tell Howard she was making him a meat loaf, and you don’t have to not ask me twice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 emily If I stick a light bulb on this, wouldn’t it make a great lamp for my bedroom?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 raj You’re kidding, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 emily Oh. Is this freaking you out?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 raj I guess I’m just more of a Pottery Barn, Crate and Barrel kind of guy. Maybe Pier 1 if I really want to cut loose.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 emily All right. Never mind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 raj No, no, no. Hey, you should totally get it. In fact, I’ll buy it for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 stuart Sold.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 emily Raj, you don’t have to do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 stuart Too late. No returns.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard That was really intense.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny Well, now we know, next time we go to the farmers’ market, the order is petting zoo first, then buy vegetables.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 sheldon Oh, good. You’re here. I need your assistance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard Can it wait until I put a Band-Aid on a goat bite?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 sheldon What happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny Oh, your buddy got mugged by some baby farm animals.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 sheldon Been there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny Mmm. So what do you need help with?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 sheldon Amy’s mad at me, and I’m not clear why.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny Okay. Were you talking before she got upset?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 sheldon Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny That’s probably it. What’d you say to her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 sheldon Well, I just asked her if I should start watching the new Flash TV series.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny And that made her angry?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 sheldon Baffling, right? We were necking like a couple of hooligans under the school bleachers. I stopped so I could ask the question. Next thing I know, good-bye, kissy face. Hello, yelly face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny Well, Sheldon, when you’re kissing a girl, she expects the attention to be on her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 sheldon It was. I asked her if she thought I should watch The Flash.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny Yeah. I’m tapping out. Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard I’m gonna guess that your main concern is the time commitment of watching an entire season of a new show.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 sheldon Oh, no, not just a season. If I’m in, I’m in for the whole run, even if the quality declines.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard I get it. Smallville almost wrecked you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 sheldon Yeah. Exactly. You know, I waited ten years to see a guy everyone knows can fly, fly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny Wait, what is wrong with you two? He was talking about television during their date night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 sheldon Oh, not just date night, our fifth anniversary.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny Okay, see, that’s even dumber than you wondering if being bitten by a goat would give you the powers of a goat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 sheldon If that happens, don’t make me wait ten years to watch you eat a tin can.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 raj You guys ever notice that Emily has a bit of a twisted side?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 bernadette You mean ’cause she has weird tattoos?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 raj No, because she wants to have sex with me in a graveyard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 howard One more time?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 raj She and I were supposed to watch the new Avengers movie tonight, but it was sold out. So I said, what else do you want to do? She said, let’s go to a cemetery and do it on somebody’s grave.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 howard Like, a random person or somebody she knew?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 raj What difference does it make?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 howard Well, if it’s her father’s grave and they didn’t get along, then you know she holds a grudge.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 bernadette The only issue is that everybody has their own thing, and as long as it’s two consenting adults, I guess I don’t see the harm in it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 raj Well, what if it’s one consenting adult and one adult who pretends to consent because he’s afraid of being alone?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 bernadette Well, then I guess bring a blanket. The grass gets damp at night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 raj I don’t know, guys. Maybe this relationship isn’t for me. Maybe I should break up with her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 howard Right. You’re gonna break up with a girl who has sex with you. Can you believe this guy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 bernadette I think if Raj wants to break up with a girl, he can do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 howard How are you saying that with a straight face?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 bernadette I don’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 raj You guys are being jerks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 howard Buddy, other than Jenny Craig, you’ve never broken up with a girl in your life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 raj You’re one to talk. You’ve been complaining about Stuart living here for the past year. I don’t see you showing him the door.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 howard That’s not the same thing. Emily’s a person. Stuart’s more like an infestation, something you spray for.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 raj Baloney, okay? You two are as afraid of hurting someone’s feelings as I am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 bernadette That’s not true. We were just laughing right in your face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny Thanks for cooking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard Mmm. My pleasure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny That carrot was delicious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard Yeah. I wish I’d fought harder for the rest of ’em.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny Still haven’t heard from her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 sheldon No, and I’m confused. It’s been nearly 24 hours. Amy should have figured out she’s wrong by now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny Hey, I don’t think she’s wrong about you going too slow in the relationship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 sheldon Too slow?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny Yeah, you’ve been going out for years. You haven’t even slept together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 sheldon That’s right. It’s called foreplay. And I could make the case that you two aren’t moving forward in your relationship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny Uh, hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 sheldon Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny No. Sheldon, we’re getting married.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 sheldon But you’ve been engaged for over a year now, and you don’t even have a wedding date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny Well, we will. We’re just not in a rush.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 sheldon Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard We’re gonna set a date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 sheldon Okay. If you say so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny Yeah, it’s just, things are good right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard Really good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny I’m focusing on my job.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard And we’ve been busy with our paper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny So busy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard Yeah, we’ll pick a date when we pick a date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 sheldon Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny You know, I can see why Amy’s mad at you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 sheldon Yeah, shut up, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 bernadette Did you eat all my yoghurt?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 howard You mean the one that makes ladies do the thing that ladies pretend they don’t do even though they do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 bernadette You know which yoghurt I mean.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 howard I didn’t touch it. Must have been Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 bernadette Maybe Raj is right. Maybe it’s time we tell him he needs to move out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 howard We should have done it months ago.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 bernadette I know, but his store was reopening, and then there were the holidays, and then he was sick.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 howard Yeah, right. Sick. He didn’t have jaundice. He just looks like that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 bernadette All right. Tonight’s the night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 howard Agreed. When he gets home, I’m dropping the hammer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 bernadette Ooh, I like when you take charge.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 howard Oh, I’m not taking charge, you’re the hammer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard So, why haven’t we picked a date?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny You know why.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard Well, of course I know why. But just for fun, why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny Not in a rush, busy with work…
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 sheldon Things are good right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny Really good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard You still want to get married, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny Oh, my God. Yes. Why would you even ask that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard I don’t know. Because we don’t have a date?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny Well, you want a date, pick a date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard It’s not just the date. We haven’t talked about anything. Big wedding, small wedding, indoor, outdoor?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 sheldon Outdoor? Oh. I can RSVP no right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny Okay, indoor it is. Big or small?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard Is your dad paying for it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny I doubt it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard Okay, two friends each.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny All right, well, I want it in a church.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard Fine. I want black-tie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny Fine. I want to release butterflies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 sheldon Seriously? Airborne worms?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard Okay. Well, then it’s settled. Small indoor church wedding, black-tie, no butterflies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny Sounds perfect.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard Great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 sheldon You still didn’t pick a date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny Stay out of it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard Shut up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 emily Mmm. It’s a beautiful night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 raj Oh, yes, we’ve got the moon and the trees and Elizabeth McNulty, who apparently died when she was the same age I am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 emily Makes you feel alive, doesn’t it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 raj So does enjoying a meal at a well-lit restaurant, but here we are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 emily You aren’t scared, are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 raj Of ghosts, no. Of you, little bit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 sheldon I’m sorry I’ve upset you. I shouldn’t have asked so many questions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny No, it’s okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard Yeah, maybe it’s good you got us talking about this stuff.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 sheldon Well, look at that, even when I’m causing problems, I make the world a better place. Hey, next, why don’t we tackle your penchant for whining and Penny’s love of the ol’ glug-glug?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny Uh, Sheldon, I think we’re good for now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 sheldon Ah, well, very well. So does this mean you’ll finally pick a wedding date?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny Here we go again. Why is everyone so concerned with us setting a date? We’re committed to each other. We’re happy. A ceremony isn’t gonna change anything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 sheldon So you’re never getting married? It’s his whining, isn’t it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard Sheldon, I’m not a whiner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 sheldon It’s amusing that he doesn’t hear it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard Look, all she’s saying is we are in love so it doesn’t matter if we get married tomorrow or a year from now or 50 years from now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny Ew, 50? We’ll be old and gross.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard Yeah, but we’ll be old and gross together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 sheldon My aunt and uncle were married 63 years. Towards the end, it was like watching cheese melt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny Um, I’m free tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard Are you saying you want to get married?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny Vegas isn’t that far away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard I’m in. Let’s do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 sheldon After all these years. I’m really happy for the two of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny Oh, thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 sheldon Now get out of my spot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 howard Bernie, Stuart just pulled up. So remember, the key is to be firm. Show no weakness.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 bernadette Right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 howard Good luck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 bernadette Howard Joel Wolowitz, you get back here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 howard Never should have told you my middle name.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 stuart Hey, guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 howard Hey, you got a minute?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 stuart Sure. Uh, let me just put this stuff in the fridge. I felt bad for finishing your yoghurt, so I bought more. And, Howard, your favourite fruit is in season. Crunch Berries.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 bernadette Don’t let that sway you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 howard It’s hard not to. They taste so much better than real berries.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 stuart What’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 bernadette So, we need to talk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 emily You okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 raj I think we should talk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 stuart Is everything okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 bernadette Well, you’ve been living here a while now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 stuart I know. I may sell comic books at work, but the real superheroes are sitting right in front of me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 bernadette Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 howard His middle name is David. Go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 raj Look, I care about you a lot, but we are very different people.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 emily Are you breaking up with me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 raj No, no, I’m just pointing out that you’re dark on the inside and I’m dark on the outside.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 bernadette So, anyway, what I’m trying to say is… 
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 howard You need to take that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 stuart It’s just my dad, probably calling to wish me a happy birthday. I’ll call him back. You were saying?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 emily Look, Raj, be honest with me. If you want to end things, just do it. Don’t expect me to do it for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 raj End things? I’m trying to tell you that I love you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 howard_and_bernadette Happy birthday to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny Wow, there’s a Denny’s in Vegas you can actually get married in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard Doesn’t sound very romantic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny Yeah, but we could get heart-shaped pancakes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard I’m sure we’ll find a decent chapel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny Yeah. This is crazy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard I know. You think people are gonna be mad?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny Maybe. But this isn’t about them, it’s about us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard It is. It is about us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny And you know what the best part is? We took our time. I mean, we met, we were friends for a couple years, then we got together, and then we got untogether, then we worked out all our problems, and now we know everything about each other, we can just go forward with no surprises and no regrets.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard Right. No surprises.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny And no regrets.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard Uh, well, there, there’s one thing I feel I should tell you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard You know, so we can go into this with no secrets between us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard Remember, uh, a couple years back when I was on that research ship in the North Sea?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard Okay, well, there, there was a lot of drinking and craziness going on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny No, you told me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard Okay, um, well, there was this girl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny What did you do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard Nothing really. It was just kissing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny And then what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard And then nothing. I stopped it. But it still bothers me, and I wanted you to know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard Did you ever do anything like this since we’ve been?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny Nope, never.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard Oh, that’s too bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny You know, can I ask you a question?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard Hmm?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny Why are you telling me this now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard Well, like I said, we’re about to get married, and I, I want a clean slate. No secrets.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny Really? Because to me, it seems like we’re about to get married and you’re trying to sabotage it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard Would you rather I didn’t tell you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny No, I don’t want there to be secrets between us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard See, now I’m confused. I mean, what, what am I supposed to do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny Uh, keep your mouth off other women.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard I can do that. Uh, uh, from now on, this mouth, you and food, that’s it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard Yeah?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny Look, I’m not happy this happened, but I think I can get past it. I mean, we weren’t engaged at the time, and it was just kissing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard Right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny Just kissing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard It wasn’t even very good. She was a smoker, I’d just been seasick.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny Okay, that’s enough. Stop talking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard So, we’re still getting married?
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard Because we love each other.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 leonard And it’s the happiest day of our lives.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 penny Ha-ha, don’t push it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 amy Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 sheldon Hello. Listen, I’ve been thinking a lot about relationships and how difficult they can be, and I think…
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 amy I’ve been thinking about them, too, Sheldon. Being your girlfriend is so challenging. Emotionally, physically. I’ve been incredibly patient for years.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 sheldon Strongly disagree. Go on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 amy Okay, well, this isn’t easy to say, because I love you, but I need some time to take a step back and re-evaluate our situation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 sheldon Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 amy I hope you understand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 sheldon Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 amy Bye, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season08.Episode24 sheldon Well, Gollum, you’re an expert on rings. What do I do with this one?
