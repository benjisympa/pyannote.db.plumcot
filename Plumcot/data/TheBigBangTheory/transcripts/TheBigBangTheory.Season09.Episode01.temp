TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny So, what package are you thinking?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard Mm, this one comes with music and flowers. Oh, they even stream the whole thing live on the Internet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny Why would we want that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard ‘Cause there’s a lot of gorgeous blondes out there who don’t believe they can land a short, nearsighted scientist. Let’s give them hope.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny Whatever. Put us on the Internet. I’ve always wanted a wedding with a comment section.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard If you’re not into this, we can do it another time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny No. No, I want to. Look, we’ve put this off long enough. Let’s do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard Aw. That’s exactly what you said the first time we slept together. Oh, excuse me. Sheldon. Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon Leonard, have you gotten married yet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard No. Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon Good. Don’t do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon Some important new information has come to light. Women are the worst. I thought it was paper cuts, but I was wrong. No piece of paper ever cut me this deep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard What happened now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon Amy has ended our relationship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard Oh, no. Seriously?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard Amy broke up with Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny She did?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon Is Penny crying?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon No, of course not. They thrive on our suffering.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard Buddy, I’m so sorry. Is there anything I can do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon Yes. If I ever talk about going out with a girl again, roll your eyes at me like I do to you when you say dumb things.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard Sheldon, uh, okay, just because you’re going through this with Amy doesn’t mean that all women are bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon Whatever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny Hey, I just heard about you and Sheldon. Are you okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 amy Not really. Can you come over?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny Uh, actually I’m in Vegas. Leonard and I are about to get married.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 amy Hold on. You’re getting married and you didn’t invite me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny Well, it was kind of a spur-of-the-moment thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 amy Wow. Hope I can catch the bouquet from here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny Amy, don’t be like that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon Why did I just hear Amy’s name?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard Penny’s on the phone with her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon Did she say anything about me? Never mind. I don’t care. Well, if you care, you can find out and tell me. Just don’t be shocked when you find out that I don’t care.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny Okay, will you relax? You’re not missing anything special.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny She’s upset. Look, it’s gonna be a great wedding. Look at you in your little suit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon Amy’s upset? Is it about me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard No, I think it’s because we’re eloping.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon Your marriage is causing her pain? Yeah, great, I take it back. Go ahead and do it. Yay for love.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 amy Oh. What are you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon When last we spoke, you said you needed time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 amy Well, it’s only been 11 hours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon The Lord of the Rings trilogy was nearly 11 hours. I made you watch that, you said it was an eternity.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 amy Sheldon, when I’m ready to talk, I’ll let you know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon Very well. You seem to be headed somewhere. May I walk with you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 amy Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon Boy, I’m glad we’re going out again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 amy We’re not back together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon Why? Is there someone else? Just couldn’t wait for that first notch on your bedpost, could you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 amy If you must know, I’m going to Howard and Bernadette’s to watch the wedding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon And who’s this guy you’re taking?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 amy There’s no guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon Oh, you’re going to a wedding alone? That’s sad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 amy I’m not gonna be alone. I’ll be with my friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon Your friends? Well, I think you mean my friends. And why wasn’t I invited to this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 amy Maybe because the two of us being there would make them feel awkward.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon We make everyone feel awkward. That’s our thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard They’re running a little behind. Should be pretty soon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard Hey, if you’re hungry, there’s a breakfast buffet at the strip club next door.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny Thanks, but I don’t like glitter on my scrambled eggs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard I don’t think the strippers prepare the meal, but okay. Look, it’s not how I pictured it either, but I’m still glad we’re doing it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny Me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard You sure?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard And you promise you’re okay with everything from the car?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny Oh, my God, would you stop bringing it up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard You’re right. I’m sorry. We have the rest of our lives to dredge stuff up from the past and fight about it. So what do you think? Should we run next door and grab a bite?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny What if they call our names?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard Oh, don’t worry. They gave me this vibrating coaster.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny Oh, and the fairy tale continues.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 amy Thank you for doing this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 bernadette Our pleasure. You feeling okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 amy We were together for so long, I honestly don’t know what I’m feeling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 howard Well, that’s understandable. You forgot. It’s called happy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 bernadette Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 howard I’m not saying anything bad. Just that she was in love with her captor and somehow managed to escape from his dark and crazy dungeon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 stuart I know what you’re going through. My, my, my last breakup was pretty tough.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 amy Oh. What was her name?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 stuart Hey, it’s a true story. I don’t need the third degree.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 bernadette For God’s sake, Sheldon, what are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon I didn’t want to come in. I was told it would make everyone feel uncomfortable. So I’ll just stay out here and pretend that I don’t have to go to the bathroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 bernadette Howard, do something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 howard I’m on it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 amy Sheldon, you being here might not be making things better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon I see. And is that why everybody was invited but me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 amy They didn’t invite everybody but you.Bernadette invited me, and Stuart lives here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 raj Who wants hot cinnamon rolls?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 official So, when you hear the music, that’s your cue. Any questions?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard Oh, the package that we paid for said the aisle was supposed to be strewn with rose petals.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 official Where are the rose petals?!
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard You know what? It’s fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 female_voice We can use the potpourri from the bathroom!
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny Really, we’re good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard Yup, just want to get married.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 official Great. I’ll see you two up there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard This is it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard I love you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny I love you, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 female_voice Was that a yes or no on the potpourri?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny No, thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard We’re good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon Raj, you’re probably wondering why Amy and I aren’t showing any affection to one another.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 raj Didn’t even crack the top ten.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon Well, you should know that she recently broke up with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 amy I said I needed time to think.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 raj I’m sure you guys will figure something out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon You hear that? Raj is devastated.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 bernadette Sheldon, shh. The wedding’s starting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon I see what’s happening. Sides are forming. Well, if Bernadette’s on Amy’s team, I pick Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 howard I’m not taking sides.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon Fine, I guess I’m stuck with Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 raj Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 stuart At least you got picked.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 official Before I go any further, have either of you prepared your own vows?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny No. You wrote vows?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny Well, I don’t have any. You’re kind of making me look bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard It’s okay. I don’t have to say them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny No, no, no, go ahead. I’ll come up with something mushy, you’ll cry, we got this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard Penny, we are made of particles that have existed since the moment the universe began. I like to think those atoms travelled 14 billion years through time and space to create us, so that we could be together and make each other whole.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny Wow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 official Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny Right. Um, okay. Leonard, I mean, you’re not only the love of my life. I mean, you’re my best friend, and, you’ve got a friend in me. You got troubles. I got ’em, too. There isn’t anything I wouldn’t do for you. We stick together, and we can see it through, ’cause you’ve got a friend in me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 official Is that the song from Toy Story?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny He loves that movie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard I do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 bernadette Aw, that was beautiful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 howard Yeah. I mean, not like our wedding beautiful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 bernadette No, we totally won.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon Amy, I don’t understand, are we broken up or not? It’s like you can’t make up your mind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 amy It’s because you’re not giving me any space to think.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon Well, you should think fast, because men can sire offspring their entire lives, but those eggs you’re toting around have a sell-by date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 amy You know what, Sheldon, you’ve made this really easy. You’re immature, you’re selfish, you just insulted me to my face. I don’t need any more time to think. We’re broken up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 bernadette Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon Will someone take me home?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 raj Yeah. Come on, I’ll give you a ride.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny We did it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard Yeah, I’m so glad you guys could watch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 howard We’ll say it was beautiful in the comment section.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard No, no, no. Hang on. I believe I’m supposed to carry you across the threshold.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny Can you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard Who do you think carries Sheldon to bed when he falls asleep in front of the TV?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny Okay, let’s do it. You gonna make it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard I’m okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny Nicely done.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard Thank you. Finally, there’s a Mrs. Hofstadter who isn’t disappointed in me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny Well, the night is still young.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard Everything all right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny Yeah. I guess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard Just tell me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny It’s just, when we were kissing, I couldn’t help but picture you with that other girl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard Oh, no. No, come on. I have a friend in you. You said so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny You’re right. Just forget it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard Yeah. Okay, listen. If you’re imagining that it was sexy, it wasn’t. We, we were both drunk, and she smelled like an ashtray. The boat was moving a lot, so I chipped her tooth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny Did you feel guilty?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard No, she had dental insurance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny Did you feel guilty after kissing her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard Yes. I felt guilty as soon as it happened. I feel guilty every time I see her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny What do you mean, every time you see her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard What do I mean? Boy, that’s a toughie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny You still see her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard Well, no, not socially. But, you know, just at work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny You work with her? How could you not tell me that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard I wanted to tell you in the car, but you told me to stop talking
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny Oh, okay. So you’re saying this is my fault?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard No, of course not. Okay, look, instead of fighting, why don’t we dim the lights, um, get naked and make a baby? I was trying to lighten the mood. It’s not easy. You try it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon Hello, Mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 mrs_cooper Shelly! How’s my baby doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon I just wanted to let you know that you can remove Amy from your nightly prayers. Unless you’re open to praying for a beehive to fall on her head.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 mrs_cooper Oh, what’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon She broke up with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 mrs_cooper Oh, Shelly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon No, I’ll be okay. But I think that I’d like to send the ring back to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 mrs_cooper Well, let’s not be hasty. Are you sure it’s over for good?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon It’s over for me. I’m done with women. Like when I swore off Pop Rocks. They both hurt you on purpose.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 mrs_cooper You want to tell me what happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon Are you going to say it’s all part of God’s plan?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 mrs_cooper Good chance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon Then no, thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 mrs_cooper Well, honey, don’t send it back yet. Your sister’s married, and I’m not letting your brother give my grandmother’s ring to that whore he’s dating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon Wasn’t Mary Magdalene a woman of ill repute?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 mrs_cooper When your idiot brother redeems mankind, he can date whoever he wants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 bernadette I know it hurts now, but it’s gonna get better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 amy Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 howard Everything’s gonna be okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 stuart You’ve got so much to offer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 amy Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 stuart Any man would be lucky to have you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 bernadette That’s true.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 amy I just hope I did the right thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 stuart I’m sure you did. Maybe that’s the problem, you always do the right thing. Maybe it’s time to do the wrong thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 amy Like you’re doing right now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 stuart Exactly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard I asked you over and over if you were okay. Why would you go through with the wedding if you weren’t?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny I thought I was okay, but it turns out I’m not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard Okay, listen, I may not have been entirely faithful, but you, you are not easy to lift.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon Wow. Well, marriage must agree with you. Well, you are just glowing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard I’m not glowing. I’m upset.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon Well, whatever it is, it agrees with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon Knock, knock, knock, Penny? Knock, knock, knock, Penny? Knock, knock, knock, Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny What’s this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon Leonard told me what happened, so I took it upon myself to make you a hot beverage.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny Oh. That’s so sweet of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon Yeah. I know. Turns out, being sweet isn’t enough to keep a girl these days. I blame Madonna.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny I’m sorry to hear about you and Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon Well, I’m sorry about Leonard. Thought I raised him better than that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny You know, it’s bad enough what happened, but then he tried to hide the fact that he sees her all the time at the university.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon He does? Who is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny Some girl named Mandy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon Mandy Chao?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon Oh, you don’t need to worry about her. She’s brilliant and attractive. She can do way better
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny That’s great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon Wait a minute. I know this may sound far fetched, but I’m on the market now. You know, if I dated Mandy, that would teach both Leonard and Amy a lesson.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny That’s ridiculous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon Oh, you’re right. I could never be with a woman whose self-esteem was so low she’d be with Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny I’m with Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon Yeah, I know. Forever. Who would have believed these things would happen to us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny Right? I can’t believe Amy actually went through with it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon Hang on. You knew that she was going to end it with me? Did you try and stop her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny I told her to be true to herself and do what makes her happy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon Do what makes her happy? She plays the harp and her car is paid for. How much happier can she be?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny Okay, look, it’s not my fault that she thought you were a bad boyfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon I see. Well, I think I’ll be going.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon No, no, no, no. We are done here. Would you mind opening the door and then angrily slamming it behind me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 penny Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon Thank you. And slam it hard, because I am pretty steamed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 howard All right, Leonard, hang in there. Talk to you tomorrow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 bernadette What happened? They just got married.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 howard I don’t know. It’s a mess. They had a huge fight in Vegas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 bernadette Think they’ll break up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 howard I don’t know. Sounds pretty bad. Penny’s back in her apartment all by herself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 stuart Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon Would you like to hear another reason why men are better than women?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard Sure, let’s make it an even hundred.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon You would never kiss me and make me say I love you and then break up with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard I wouldn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon And you know why? ‘Cause you’re a man. The champagne of genders.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard Well, I may be a man, but I think I’m the one that screwed up on this one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon Yeah, well, and you admit it, like a man. All you hear women say is, I’ll just have a salad. You know? Where’s my lip gloss? I think this element should be called radium. That last one was Madame Curie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard I figured that out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon You know what? She was kind of an honorary man. She had a penis made of science.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 leonard Can’t believe I’m spending my wedding night with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode01 sheldon Really? I never imagined it any other way.
