TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Why are you up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter How am I supposed to sleep? I’ve been married less than 24 hours, and my wife isn’t speaking to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Perhaps you can think of this n a more positive light. In one day, you’ve managed to do what it takes many couples decades to achieve.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 penny Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 penny You couldn’t sleep either?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Of course not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Me neither. But I just had a tickle in my throat, not profound marital problems.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter What are we gonna do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 penny I don’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Please, tell me how I can fix it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Glad you asked. As I see it, there’s a simple solution. Your lips had a dalliance with the lips of another woman. It seems only logical that to restore balance to the relationship, you should find another man and dally with him. And by dally, I mean some hardcore mouth-on-mouth action.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Okay, that is the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 penny Actually, I think he’s onto something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter You can’t be serious. ‘Cause I messed up and made out with a girl, you’re gonna do the same with a random guy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I’m currently single.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 penny That’s true. You are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter What is happening?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I will tell you what is happening. I am saving my best friend’s marriage.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter U-u-u-uh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, I don’t think you understand how being broken up works. The only way I can sort through my feelings is if there is space between us. Every time I see you, it re-traumatizes me. I go through the pain all over again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Well, hello to you, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler What do you want?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I understand we’re no longer a couple, but I would like to remind you that we made a baby together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler What baby?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 sheldon_cooper A precocious little Internet show known as Fun With Flags.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler I’m hanging up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Great. See you in about half an hour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, I am not doing Fun With Flags with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Because we’re broken up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Sonny and Cher made it work. Their variety show kept going long after the divorce, and here we are still talking about them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler No one’s talking about Sonny and Cher.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 sheldon_cooper You must be thinking about Donny and Marie, ’cause you and I are clearly talking about Sonny and Cher.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, this has to stop. I know it’s hard. It’s hard for me, too. But I’ve seen and talked to you more in the two days we’ve been broken up than in the last two months that we were together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Well, if you want to see less of me, maybe we should go out again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 raj_koothrappali I can’t believe you made out with Mandy Chao.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Well, trust me, I wish it never happened.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 raj_koothrappali And you knew about this this whole time?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 howard_wolowitz I did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 raj_koothrappali And you didn’t think to tell me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Leonard asked me to keep it to myself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Let’s leave Leonard out of this for the moment. This is about you and me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Wait, wait, wait, how is my day-old marriage falling apart becoming about you two?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Hang on. What do I need to do to make you trust me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 howard_wolowitz You think it’s hard having one wife, try having two.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 raj_koothrappali I bet you told Bernadette all about how he was screwing around with Mandy Chao.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Oh, we didn’t screw around. We just got drunk and made out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Whatever. It would have been nice to hear it from you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler What are you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I’m here to return your belongings. That’s what people who’ve broken up do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler And you didn’t do your compulsive knocking ritual so I would open the door.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 sheldon_cooper On the contrary, you no longer get to enjoy my charming eccentricities. We’re not friends with benefits.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Just give me the box.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Wait. Don’t you want to go through it to make sure I haven’t forgotten anything?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Fine. My old scarf.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 sheldon_cooper You wore it the night we went ice-skating. Remember?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler You mean the night that I went ice-skating, and you stood at the rail googling the symptoms of hypothermia?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 sheldon_cooper We made one heck of a team, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Whose bra is this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 sheldon_cooper It’s not yours? Oh, my. How embarrassing for both of us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler It’s Penny’s.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Hey, you broke up with me. It is none of your business whose naked bosom I’m smooshing around like pizza dough.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Good-bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Amy. Amy. Amy. Hmm. Tables work, too. Good to know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Ooh, brownies for girls’ night!
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski Hands off. I’m mad at you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Look, I know it’s a lot of money, but the guy at the store said in five to seven years, it’ll pay for itself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski What will pay for itself?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Doesn’t matter. What are you mad about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski I’m mad at you for blabbing to me what Leonard did on the North Sea, and I’m mad that I’ve had to hide this from Penny for two years.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 howard_wolowitz And you have every right to be mad about those things. So, why don’t you let me handle the credit card bill this month, huh? I mean, don’t even look at it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski I mean, if Penny finds out I’ve known all this time and haven’t told her, she’s gonna think I’m a terrible friend. I wish you never told me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 howard_wolowitz And I wish Leonard never told me. He’s the bad guy here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski I guess that’s true.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 howard_wolowitz And you let Penny marry him. Compared to that, who cares if I bought a George Clooney limited edition manscaping kit?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Hi. I’m calling about your marriage counselling services and was curious what your rate is. Really? Um, okay. Is there any kind of discount for length of marriage? ‘Cause we’re just talking hours here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 penny Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Call you back. Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 penny Can we talk?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter I would love that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 penny All right, look, I’m sorry I said I was okay with everything before we got married. I hate that we’re going through this, but I don’t know what to do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter If you don’t mind waiting for a Groupon, we can try marriage counselling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Hey, uh, buddy, can we have some privacy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Oh, of course. Wouldn’t want to intrude. This is yours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 penny Okay, when I’m done with him, I’m gonna need more information.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Nothing odd. I just wanted to rub Amy’s nose in it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 penny Okay, look, I might be overreacting, but how am I supposed to get past this when I know tomorrow you’re gonna go to work and see this woman?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Now, forgive me for eavesdropping, but as I see it, there’s a simple solution.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Wake up, wake up, wake up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Bring Penny to meet Mandy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter What? Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Well, right now, Penny’s imagination is running wild, but if they meet, that will eliminate the mystery and alleviate her fears. Like when that Sparkletts guy let me look under his eye patch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Uh, first of all, you made that guy cry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 sheldon_cooper And we learned that you don’t need an eyeball to do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Secondly, I can’t think of a more horrible idea than Penny meeting Mandy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 penny Really? Why is that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter What, you actually want to meet her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 penny No, but now that you’re being weird about it, maybe I should.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter I’m not being weird. Am I being weird?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Yes. And that’s coming from me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Fine, you want to meet her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 penny No, I just want to know that when you’re at work, there’s nothing going on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter How many times do I have to tell you? I have no interest in this woman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 penny Yeah, well, maybe she has interest in you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 sheldon_cooper In Leonard? Oh, even the Sparkletts guy could see that’s unlikely.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 penny I guess my big problem is I never saw Leonard as the kind of guy who would do something like this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Anybody can make a mistake in a weak moment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 penny What do you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t know what to think. But then again, I just found out about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 penny You know, I fell in love with Leonard because he wasn’t anything like the guys I was used to dating. I mean, I knew those guys weren’t above cheating because that’s usually how we met.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Come on, you know Leonard’s not like that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 penny I want to believe you. I really do. Am I being naive?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, I don’t know. This is all so new to me. I’m still processing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 penny You know, he never would’ve done this when we first met. He’s cockier now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler That’s because you made him more confident.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski You know, if you think about it, without you, he never would’ve grown into the person he is now. I mean, sure, more women might notice him, but I think it’s better to have a guy be with you because he wants to be and not because he thinks he doesn’t have any other choice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 penny I never thought about it like that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, me neither, not until just now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter You guys have any idea how much it costs to see a marriage counsellor?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 howard_wolowitz 250 dollars an hour. Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 raj_koothrappali How do you know?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Bernadette and I have occasionally gone to one to, you know, stay on top of things.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 raj_koothrappali And I’m just hearing about this now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Dude, just because we’re best friends doesn’t mean that I have to tell you everything that goes on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 raj_koothrappali You don’t have to, you should want to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Oh, great, there’s Mandy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Why are marine biologists always so cute?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 raj_koothrappali I don’t know, but I’d like to get lost in her Bermuda Triangle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter That’s not helpful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Then I won’t say I’d like to cover three-quarters of her surface area.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Are we done?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Not yet, this is fun. Ooh, I know. I’d let her free my willy. Where you going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter I’m gonna ask her if she’d be willing to talk to Penny, tell her she has nothing to worry about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Leonard, wait.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 howard_wolowitz I’d like to SpongeBob her SquarePants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Now we are done.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 mandy_chow Oh, hi, Leonard. What’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Uh, do you mind if I sit?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 mandy_chow Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter So, um, I’ve been thinking a lot about you and me and the boat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 mandy_chow What about it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter You know, what we did, when we were drunk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 mandy_chow Oh, no, did I sleep with you, too?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter No, we just made out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 mandy_chow Oh. Well, good for me. So what can I do for you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Uh, okay, well, um, I got married recently.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 mandy_chow Oh, congratulations. To Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Never gets old. No, no, to a girl. Anyway, I told her what happened between you and me, and she’s concerned about us seeing each other at work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 mandy_chow It was just a kiss. Why would you even tell her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Because I didn’t want there to be any secrets between us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 mandy_chow Is that really the reason?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter What else would it be?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 mandy_chow I don’t know. Sounds like you’re trying to sabotage the relationship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter No, I don’t think so. Although, Penny did say exactly that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 mandy_chow Okay, well, that’s something to think about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter You know, on some level, I’ve always believed that I don’t deserve a woman like her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 mandy_chow Oh, you’re gonna think about that right here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter I mean, she’s really beautiful. She could have any guy she wants. Which is probably why it took her so many years to tell me she loved me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 mandy_chow Maybe you should talk to a therapist about this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Too expensive. You’d think I’d be used to women withholding their love. I mean, my mother did. I mean, no matter how hard I tried, she just didn’t have any interest in me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 mandy_chow Imagine that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter I wonder if that’s why I have such a dysfunctional relationship with Sheldon. I had a dream the other night that I was in a cave and I was nursing a baby, but the baby had Sheldon’s head on it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 mandy_chow And your wife is worried about me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Hey, Leonard, when you’re done, we came up with a bunch more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 sheldon_cooper And then the Czech Republic says to Slovakia, I don’t think you understand how being broken up works. Can you believe that? You’d think that the Czech Republic would try to hold on to what it had, given that it’s not as young as it used to be. And I don’t see any other countries lining up to invade its southern borders.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler I’m gonna kill him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 sheldon_cooper But enough about the Czech Republic. Let’s talk about the time Moldova made Romania a birthday cake and Romania said it tasted good even though it didn’t. And yet Romania gets dumped. I’ll pause here while you mull that one over. I know, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 penny So, you said you had something to tell me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Okay, yeah, um, do you remember when you accused me of trying to sabotage our wedding?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 penny Uh-huh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter I’ve been thinking about it, and you might be right. But the good news is that I’m pretty sure I know why.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 penny I’m listening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Penny, after all these years, I still feel like maybe I don’t deserve you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 penny Okay, that is the lamest excuse you could’ve possibly come up with. But I get it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter You do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 penny Yeah. Yeah, sometimes I worry you’re gonna wake up and leave me for someone more like you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter I don’t even understand why you’re with someone like me. Why would I want to be with someone like me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 penny You know what I mean. And, you know, maybe the way I’ve been reacting was me sabotaging this, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Well, how about we stop being so scared of losing each other and just be together?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 penny That sounds nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Good. Because I’ve loved you since the moment we met, and I will keep loving you until the end of time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 penny Oh. Oh, my God, that is the most beautiful thing anyone’s ever said to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Yeah? That’s because you’re beautiful, and your beauty fills my heart with love and song.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 penny It’s getting kind of cheesy, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Huh? If you think that’s cheesy, buckle up. Penny Hofstadter, will you please stay married to me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 penny Oh, damn it, you topped it. Should we go to the bedroom and make this marriage official?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Yes, please.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 penny Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 penny Sheldon, I can’t believe you got us a wedding gift.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I don’t know why you’re so surprised. I watch movies, I see what people do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter What is this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Plane tickets and hotel reservations for a weekend away in San Francisco.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 penny Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Wow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 penny That’s so great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Yeah, there’s Fisherman’s Wharf and Alcatraz and cable cars. We’re gonna have so much fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 penny We?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Is there a problem?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 penny Oh, no, no, I just, I said, Whee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler How dare you go on the Internet and say mean things about me and compare my genitalia to part of Czechoslovakia?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 sheldon_cooper You saw through that one, did you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler I don’t know what you were thinking, but take the video down now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 sheldon_cooper She watched it. I’m gonna get that girl back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler I only watched it because you e-mailed it to me with the subject line this is gonna make you mad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode02 sheldon_cooper She was listening through the door. She wants me.
