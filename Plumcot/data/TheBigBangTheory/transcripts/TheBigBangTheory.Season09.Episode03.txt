TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Would you pass the mustard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Sure. Hey, want to hear a fun fact about mustard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Is it that the glucosinolates which give mustard its flavour were evolved by the cabbage family as a chemical defence against caterpillars?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Well, that was fun. Good for you, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Hey, there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Hey, you’re early. The movie doesn’t start for an hour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Actually, we’re not going to the movies. We are here to kidnap you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter What are you talking about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Well, you eloped and we didn’t get a chance to throw you a bachelor party, so there’s a van downstairs and we’re here to take you to a surprise location for the weekend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Well, I’d hardly call this kidnapping. Where’s the blindfold? Where’s the duct tape? Where’s the part where you call me and demand ransom and I try to keep you on the phone, but you hang up seconds before I can trace it and then I say I’m getting too old for this crud?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter When do we leave?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Yeah, Penny packed you a bag.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Wow, okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 sheldon_cooper You’re seriously going to get in a van and let these two take you to an unknown destination for an entire weekend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Oh, not just him, you’re coming, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Oh, and how do you think you’re going to get me to do that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Unhand me. This is ridiculous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 howard_wolowitz I told you to put tape on his mouth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 raj_koothrappali And I told you he bit me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 sheldon_cooper It’s bad enough I’m being taken against my will. I don’t see why it has to be in some hippie’s mobile sex dungeon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Well, Sheldon, there’s something about this van that you’re going to find very interesting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 sheldon_cooper It runs on syphilis?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 raj_koothrappali This van was owned and driven by your personal physics hero, Richard Feynman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 sheldon_cooper No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Yeah. A buddy of mine let me borrow it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter This was Feynman’s van? That’s so cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Yeah, nothing’s been changed since he drove it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 howard_wolowitz I bet he picked up a lot of cute grad students in this bad boy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Yeah, and talked about physics with them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter So, are you gonna give us a clue where we’re headed?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Uh, okay, let’s see. They’ve got spicy food and there’s a chance you’ll get diarrhoea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter India.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 raj_koothrappali We can drive there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Your house?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 howard_wolowitz We are going to Me-hi-co.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Fun, I’ve never been there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Leonard, don’t be fooled. I’m from Texas, Me-hi-co is Spanish for Mexico.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 raj_koothrappali What’s wrong with Mexico?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Uh, mariachi bands, wild dogs, beans that jump around ’cause there’s a worm inside.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Okay, calm down. There’s a theme to this weekend. We are going to Mexico in Feynman’s van to stay at the vacation house Feynman bought with the money from his Nobel Prize.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Viva la Imodium. Ay-ay-ay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Come on, Leonard’s doing bachelor stuff. You sure we can’t take you to a strip club?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny Nah, if I want to see a naked dancing man, I just flush the toilet while Leonard’s in the shower.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler I know we’re not making a fuss, but in the spirit of bachelorette parties, I made cookies in the shape of male genitals.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny You really didn’t have to, whoa! That is anatomic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Thank you. The veins are gummy worms.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, look, Jewish and gentile.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler I had extra dough.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny Oh, that’s Leonard. He said they’re about to cross the border.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski I hope the boys don’t get too crazy in Mexico.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny Oh, yeah, right. Lock up your daughters or Sheldon might lecture them about the North American Free Trade Agreement.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Boy, that was a long night for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Uh-oh. According to this Mexican customs website, visitors may not bring more than five laser discs, 20 compact discs or 12 VHS tapes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 raj_koothrappali We don’t have any of those.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 sheldon_cooper How can you be sure? VHS was king when Feynman drove this van. For all we know, there are hidden compartments lousy with Jane Fonda workout videos.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter If there was a hidden compartment, don’t you think you’d be stuffed in it by now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Are we all up to date on our yellow fever inoculations?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 howard_wolowitz You don’t need a yellow fever shot to go to Mexico.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 sheldon_cooper You can never be too careful. I got one last year before I went to Epcot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler So, Penny, how’s married life?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny Oh, it’s good. I just wish Leonard would work up the courage to tell Sheldon he’s moving in here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski You guys still aren’t living together?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny We are. I mean, he sleeps here. But it’s only a matter of time before Sheldon has a bad dream and tries to climb into bed with the Leonard-shaped pile of pillows.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Speaking of Sheldon, how’s single life treating you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Fine, I guess. I’ve been focusing on me. I was thinking about changing my wardrobe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Good for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler But then I decided I don’t want to go changing who I am just because of some man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Good for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny You know, it is normal to want to change your look after a breakup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Actually, I was thinking of making one small change.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Your sweater?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny Your glasses?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Your hair?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny Your shoes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Piercing my ears.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski You really never had that done?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler My mom said pierced ears were for whores, pirates and genies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny Okay, well, you’re a grown woman now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler I know, but Sheldon had this clause in the Relationship Agreement forbidding cosmetic surgery unless it’s to look like a Klingon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski We’ll take you to the mall to get it done.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny Why? I can do it right here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Really? You have a piercing gun?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny No. All you need is a needle and an ice cube. I’ve done it, like, a dozen times.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, I don’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny Oh, come on. I’ll be gentle. Let me take your ear virginity.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski This party’s weird.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Hey, watch your speed. I hear the Mexican police target tourists.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Oh, not a problem. If anything goes down, we just put Koothrappali in the driver’s seat and slap a sombrero on his head.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Dude, how many races can you offend in a single breath?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 howard_wolowitz I don’t know. Have you watched the Olympics with me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, can you believe that we’re driving in a van that was owned by one of the greatest scientific minds of the 20th century? It’s like the Batmobile. If Batman was real and a physicist and his car wasn’t cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 sheldon_cooper It is extraordinary.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Perhaps some of his mojo will rub off on us. Maybe between this and his beach house, we will be inspired to greatness.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 sheldon_cooper I usually don’t put too much stock in charms and talismans. However, even I must admit feeling Richard Feynman’s butt dent cupping my own bottom that does get the creative juices flowing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Hey, I have to return this van. Keep your creative juices in your pants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 sheldon_cooper What was that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 howard_wolowitz I think it’s a tyre.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 sheldon_cooper What if it’s banditos shooting at us? What if we get kidnapped? What if we end up in a factory making Bart Simpson piñatas for the rest of our lives?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 howard_wolowitz It’s the tyre.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 sheldon_cooper I am getting too old for this crud.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Amy, I noticed your status still says in a relationship on Facebook.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler You’re right. I should probably let all of my Facebook friends know. Penny, I’m no longer in a relationship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Did you change yours to married yet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny Uh, no, not yet. There’s still a few people I haven’t told personally.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Who?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny Oh, just my parents and my entire family.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny Well, I don’t want to hurt my dad. You know, he always wanted to dance with his daughter at her wedding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski What about your sister’s wedding?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny They started to, then her water broke. You know, if he finds out we eloped, it’s gonna break his heart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler How long do you think you can keep it from him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, isn’t it gonna get worse the longer you wait?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny Well, not necessarily. You know, Dad’s not getting any younger, so if I wait long enough, I’ll just tell him he walked me down the aisle and it was magical.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 raj_koothrappali When did you learn how to change a tyre?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Every self-respecting gentleman should know how in case he comes across a damsel in distress by the side of the road.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 sheldon_cooper If I see one scorpion, I am getting on someone’s shoulders and never coming down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter And there’s your damsel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Wow, this one’s really stuck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Are you turning it the right way?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 howard_wolowitz No. I took the other four off and when I got to this one, I thought, you know, I’m in a rut, let’s shake things up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Here, let me try. You’re right, it doesn’t turn the other way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny There you go. You’re all done.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler That wasn’t so bad. Nice. Boy, if my mom could see me now, she’d lock me in the sin closet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski That’s a joke, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Actually, the joke was on her. I could still see the TV through the slats.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny I’m starting to see why you and your mom aren’t very close.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Bet she’d still tell her if she got married.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny You’re not gonna let this go, are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Well, it’s kind of sad that they don’t know. I mean, they love Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny Fine, you want me to call? I’ll call. Why am I so nervous?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski It’s understandable. Amy was afraid to tell her mom she broke up with Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny Yeah? How did it go? Did she make you crawl into the breaking-up drawer?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Uh, well, actually, to be honest, I haven’t told her yet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny You’ve been giving me a hard time and you haven’t even told your mom about Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler I’m feeling a little dizzy from all the blood loss. I don’t know what you’re talking about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny Fine. I’m calling home, but when I’m done, you’re calling your mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Easy for you to say. You never had to watch 60 Minutes like this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny Hey, Daddy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 wyatt Hey, slugger. How’s my girl?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny Uh, good. Is Mom around?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 wyatt Ah, she took your brother out to celebrate. He just got his tenth one-month sober chip. Yeah, she’s gonna make him a little necklace.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny Okay, I’ll talk to her later. Uh, Dad, there’s something I need to tell you. Leonard and I got married.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 wyatt You did? When?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny Last week. I’m sorry, I should’ve told you. It was a spur of the moment thing. I feel terrible. Please don’t be too disappointed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 wyatt Are you happy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny Very. Leonard is so great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 wyatt Well, then I’m happy for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny Aw, thank you, Daddy. That means so much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 wyatt Well, I understand it’s hard to tell someone something if you think it’s gonna upset ’em.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny It is. You’re the best dad ever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 wyatt Yeah. Uh, hold that thought. I’ve been sitting on a little news myself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny Well, what is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 wyatt You know that rototiller I got for the tractor?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 wyatt Oh, you should see it. It is a beautiful piece of machinery. Anyway, uh, I backed over your pet pig with it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny Moondance?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 wyatt Yeah, he’s, uh, not dancing anymore.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny You killed my pig?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 wyatt I did not kill him. The vet took care of that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny When?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 wyatt Oh, ten, twelve months ago.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny You didn’t tell me for a year?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 wyatt Well, apple doesn’t fall far from the tree, does it? Love ya, slugger. Gotta go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Okay, Amy, your turn.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 howard_wolowitz What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 raj_koothrappali It’s called Lamaze breathing. It helps you push.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Great. He’s pushing with his uterus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 raj_koothrappali There’s got to be a smarter way of removing it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, this is nothing more than a physics problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Right. Archimedes once said give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Of course. All we need is to find stuff to make a lever big enough to fix this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Exactly. I’ll bet there’s something around here that could be a lever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Let’s see, a lever, a lever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Everybody hold on. Let’s take this problem one step at a time. First, we need to decide whether we’re calling it leever or lehver. And the sooner we decide it’s leever, the sooner we can roll up our sleeves, not slehves, and get to work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter We’re gonna be here foreever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny Thanks a lot, guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski What did we do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny Before I made that call, my pig was alive and happy and rolling around in the mud. Now he’s illegally buried in our backyard next to my great-grandmother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Really? They didn’t eat him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny No. He was a beloved member of the family.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski The breakfast meat family?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny It’s not funny. You’re up. Call your mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, maybe later. Your pig dying made me sad. And a little hungry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny Phone, now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Okay. Okay. Fine. Hi, Mom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny Try dialing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler You saw that, huh? Hi, Mom. How are you doing? Oh, good. How’s work? That’s nice. I’m fine. Hey, listen, I’ve been meaning to ask, how come Aunt Doe and Aunt Florence never got along?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny Okay, just give me that. Amy broke up with Sheldon, she got her ears pierced and she made us eat penis cookies. Hang on. She wants to talk to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter I don’t think the lever’s working.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 howard_wolowitz What makes you say that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter There’s gotta be something else we could try.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 raj_koothrappali If this was Star Trek, we could use a phaser to blast it off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 howard_wolowitz No, it’s too broad of a beam. You’d need something more precise, like Superman’s heat vision.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Ooh, the Green Lantern’s ring could make a big green hand that unscrews it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 raj_koothrappali If you need a green hand, why not just use the Hulk?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Oh, please, the Hulk would never get across the border with that temper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Guys, excuse me, not that calling one of the Avengers isn’t a perfectly reasonable choice, but we’re scientists. Don’t you think we can figure this out using actual science?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Yes, we could use science. But it’s your bachelor party. Lighten up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 howard_wolowitz We will, we will percussive shock you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 howard_wolowitz@raj_koothrappali We will, we will percussive shock you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Buddy you’re a boy, make a big noise playin’ in the street, gonna be a big man someday. You got mud on your face, you big disgrace, kickin’ your can all over the place. I have an eidetic memory. Sometimes it’s a curse.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 raj_koothrappali I had no idea tortilla chips were such a good fuel source.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter They’re basically pure hydrocarbons soaked in fat. Let’s hope the lug nut expands.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 sheldon_cooper What if that burning food attracts animals?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 howard_wolowitz We have plenty of food for the animals.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 sheldon_cooper We do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Yep. A six-foot wiener in a Flash T-shirt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 sheldon_cooper That’s not very nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter It’s a bachelor party. Lighten up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 sheldon_cooper What is that awful smell?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 howard_wolowitz It’s burning salsa. I’m hoping the acidity and salinity combined with electricity will corrode the lug nut off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 sheldon_cooper What an innovative solution. Perhaps I don’t give your MIT education enough credit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Yeah, I saw it on Mythbusters.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 sheldon_cooper All right, this rust, combined with the aluminium recovered from the van, is now thermite.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Great. Couple of pinches ought to do the trick.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Is that enough to melt the lug nut?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Well, let’s start small. We can always add more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 howard_wolowitz You put up a good fight, lug nut, but you’ve met your match.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Hey, look, the lug nut’s off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny What? What are you doing back?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter We got a flat and couldn’t get the tyre off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny Oh, I’m sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny If it makes you feel any better, I pierced Amy’s ears and her mom made her sit in my closet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 sheldon_cooper We blew up Feynman’s van.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny My dad killed my pig with his tractor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter I spent the night in Mexico with Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode03 penny You win.
