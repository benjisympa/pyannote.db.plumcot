TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 sheldon What a wonderful day, thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 penny Oh, we’re glad you had fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 sheldon Blue Icees and a trip to The Container Store? It’s like I died and went to the post-mortem, neuron-induced hallucination commonly mistaken as heaven.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 leonard I still don’t understand why you bought that pill caddie. You’re a young man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 sheldon Age is a state of mind, Leonard. In here I’m 90. Why are you taking your bins over there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 leonard It’s just where I need them. You know, she doesn’t have a lot of closet space.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 sheldon What’s wrong with your closet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 penny Uh, well, honey, you know, now that Leonard and I are married, it kind of makes sense that we actually live together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 sheldon So that’s all this day was? A plan to butter me up before delivering bad news?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 leonard Come on, buddy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 sheldon No, I thought we were friends. You asked for a sip of my Icee. If you had your own straw, I might’ve said yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 penny Sheldon, please, we already feel bad about this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 sheldon You know what they don’t sell at The Container Store? Something large enough to contain my disappointment. Although, if anyone did, it would be them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 sheldon Thank you for letting me come speak with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 bernadette Of course.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 sheldon As my relationships with Penny and Amy are currently strained, I’m turning to you for female comfort and encouragement.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 bernadette Aw. I’m honoured.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 sheldon I tried reaching out to my mother, but she was in Bible study. Leonard’s mother is on a book tour. My Mee-Maw was taking a nap, and after a while Siri started repeating her answers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 bernadette So, I’m your seventh choice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 sheldon Yeah, I know, top ten, pretty exciting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 bernadette How can I help you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 sheldon Well, in addition to Amy leaving me, Leonard’s moving in with Penny. It’s difficult not to feel abandoned.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 bernadette Well, why don’t you look at this as an opportunity? You had other roommates before Leonard. Maybe this is a chance to find someone new.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 sheldon Perhaps I could find someone better than Leonard. Someone I can rub in his face. Chris Pratt’s all the rage right now. I wonder how he’d feel about taking the smaller bedroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 stuart Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 bernadette Hey. You know who would be the perfect roomie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 sheldon Gandalf, but he’s a smoker.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 bernadette Stuart. He’s been living with us for a while now. I’m sure he’d love to get us out of his hair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 stuart Nope, couldn’t be happier.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 bernadette Well, Sheldon’s looking for a roommate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 stuart Nope.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 bernadette He’ll think about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 stuart No I won’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 raj Have you seen this Archie comic? It’s actually Archie versus Predator.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 howard How could Archie defeat Predator?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 raj I don’t know. Maybe Jughead’s a Terminator.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 stuart Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 howard Hey, Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 stuart Do you guys know any musicians?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 howard Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 stuart I was thinking it might be cool to have live music here a few nights a week. You know, give this place more of a staying in business vibe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 howard What kind of music are you thinking of?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 stuart I like all kinds of music, but my favourite genre is free.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 raj Hey, we’ve always talked about playing together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 howard Well, it could be fun to try a little acoustic thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 raj Oh, we could play filk music.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 stuart What’s that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 raj It’s been around for years. It’s like folk music, but with a sci-fi/fantasy theme.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 stuart I like it. It sounds exactly like something I shouldn’t be expected to pay for.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 raj Dude, if we do this, we’re gonna need a cool band name.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 howard You know, I’ve actually had one I’ve been sitting on for years.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 raj Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 howard It was for this power trio I tried to put together in junior high, but I was short two friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 raj What is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 howard Footprints on the Moon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 raj I just got chills.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 howard So did I.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 stuart Me, too. But I, uh, might have Lyme Disease.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 sheldon Just a few more signatures, and we’ll be finished. Initial here to acknowledge that you’ve returned your key. Okay. As my future neighbour, I’d like you to have a key. Initial here to acknowledge you received it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 penny I’m proud of you. You’re taking this really well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 sheldon Well, it’s not like I’m never going to see you two again. Which brings us to article 23 subsection C, please check here to reserve your spot at the ten year roommate reunion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 leonard Do I really have to do that now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 sheldon No, but if you want chicken and get stuck with the fish, that’s on you. All right. Oh, and lastly, please initial here to confirm that ownership of the living room couch is hereby transferred to me in perpetuity all throughout the universe and all alternate universes except for those universes where owning a couch is forbidden by the hive queen. In which case, all glory to the hive queen. All right, now all that’s left is for us to sign and date the document, and we will officially no longer be roommates.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 penny What’s the matter?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 leonard It’s harder than I thought.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 sheldon Let me help you. L. E. O. N.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 leonard That helped.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 raj So I have an idea for a filk song. It’s kind of a, a power ballad, superhero crossover tale of epic proportions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 howard Is it cold in here, ’cause, oh, my.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 raj Okay, so it’s a, it’s a David and Goliath story. It’s about man against God. It’s called Hammer and Whip, The Untold Story of Thor versus Indiana Jones.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 howard Thor versus Indiana Jones? You just blew my filking mind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 raj Okay, I don’t have it all worked out yet, but I was thinking something like, um, Oh, Indy, oh, Indy, the skies are so windy. Is that a flying man with a killer bod? Wait, that’s no man, it’s a Norse god.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 howard Oh yes, definitely. Hang on. Thunder clapped as Thor raised his mighty hammer. Indy rapped, that’s one bad mamma-jamma.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 raj That is, that is so good!
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 howard Right? Mamma-jamma just came to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 raj Okay, and here’s the hook. Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays with bones.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 together Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays with bones.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 howard Oh, man, that rocks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 raj Hey, remember The Ark of the Covenant?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 howard Yeah?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 raj That’s how much we’re gonna melt people’s faces off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 sheldon I appreciate your interest in the apartment. I just need to ask you a few standard questions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 bespectacled_man Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 sheldon It says here you’re a chemist. Which element on the periodic table do you feel is too big for its britches?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 bespectacled_man Is that supposed to be a joke?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 sheldon Looks like argon’s not the only one with an attitude problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 sheldon In general, would you say that you smell better, worse or the same as you do right now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 sheldon I was going to ask you what is the best fruit, but then I realized what I want to ask you is why is there a Band-Aid on your forearm, but then I realized what I really want to ask you is just can you just go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 sheldon You’re healthy. You have a job in the sciences. I’ve got to say, if this credit report comes back good, you’re the frontrunner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 amy I’m not gonna be your roommate, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 sheldon But I met with 11 people, and they all walked out. And that Hollywood phoney Chris Pratt never tweeted me back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 amy I’m sure you’ll find somebody else.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 sheldon I suppose. What happened to me, Amy? Years ago I was completely disengaged from my feelings. I’d say it was a happier time, but I was disengaged from my feelings, so who can tell?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 amy I don’t know how to help you. You know, feelings are a part of life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 sheldon They didn’t used to be. You and Leonard and Penny, you all poisoned me with emotions. I was like the Tin Man, perfectly content until that evil wizard gave him a heart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 amy I don’t think that was the point of the movie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 sheldon Fine, then I was like Pinocchio before that jerk Geppetto went and made him a real boy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 amy There you go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 penny So, what are you thinking for dinner?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 leonard Well, it’s Thai food night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 penny Well, honey, you don’t live with Sheldon any more. You can have anything you want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 leonard You’re right. But what? Mexican? Italian? German? Indian? Greek? Cuban? Chinese? Pizza? Barbecue? Korean? Korean barbecue?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 penny How about Thai food?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 leonard Oh, thank God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 penny Hey, we’re going to dinner. You want to come?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 sheldon Oh, I wish I could, but I realized I’ve become too emotionally vulnerable, so, like an operating system, I’m restoring my life to the last stable version, which was in 2003, the day before I met Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 leonard You heard him, no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 penny Hang on. Wait, you actually think it’s 2003?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 sheldon No, just because I’m living my life like it was 12 years ago doesn’t mean I’m delusional. And since it is 2003, I don’t know who you are, so please exit the premises before I call the police on my stylish new flip phone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 penny Are you doing okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 leonard I guess. I’m just, you know, worried about Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 penny Well, come on, he’s a grown man in his 30s pretending to be a grown man in his 20s. He’s fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 leonard I hope so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 penny What else can you do? Move back in with him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 leonard No, of course not. I just feel bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 penny Well, so do I, but don’t you want to live with your wife and set the thermostat to whatever you want and have your body tell you when it’s time to go to the bathroom, you know, not a schedule slipped underneath your door every morning?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 leonard I did like that he had the weather on it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 penny Trust me, this is the right thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 leonard I know. And it’s not like we’re abandoning him. Plus, we can FaceTime him whenever we want, you know, once iPhones are invented in his universe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 bernadette I can’t believe Sheldon asked you to be his roommate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 amy I can’t believe he ran my credit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 bernadette Hey, if you’re open to living with someone great, I’ll give you a thousand dollars to take Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 amy You really should’ve gone on the Internet and checked how long that kind of thing lives before you got one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 bernadette I’m sorry. I just thought you might have a pasty, weirdo-shaped hole in your life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 amy Hey, I know Sheldon’s quirky, but he’s also brilliant and insightful. I think calling him a weirdo is a little unfair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 sheldon Hello, 2003.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 leonard Hey, we brought you Thai. Where is everything?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 sheldon In my present, it’s in the future. In your present, it’s been crammed in the bedroom by an enterprising young man I met in The Home Depot parking lot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 leonard I know what you’re doing. You’re trying to get attention so we’ll feel bad for you, but it’s not happening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 sheldon No, what I’m doing is trying to figure out how to live my life now that everyone is leaving me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 leonard Will you knock it off? We’re across the hall.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 sheldon As the kids are saying today, talk to the hand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 penny They’re not saying that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 sheldon They are in 2003.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 penny No, no, they’re really not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 raj Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One runs from Loki, the other runs from stones. So, what do you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 emily Wow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 raj Runs from stones means that, that big boulder, but I couldn’t rhyme anything with boulder.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 emily Colder, shoulder, soldier, folder.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 raj Right, yeah, right. But, what do you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 emily I think it’s very cute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 raj Cute? It’s not cute. Cute is children dressed as vegetables.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 emily Okay, fine, it’s not cute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 raj Just be honest. You don’t like it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 emily I didn’t say that. I, I just like music you can dance to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 raj You can dance to this. Um, uh, uh, Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays with bones.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 raj I’m telling you, dude, the song has no groove, you can’t dance to it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 howard Who cares? I thought the whole point of Footprints on the Moon was to write songs that make people think.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 raj You can do both, like Michael Jackson’s Billie Jean. While you’re dancing you’re thinking, like, darn it, whose baby is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 howard Where’s this coming from? A few hours ago, we both loved this song.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 raj I still love it. I just think there’s room for improvement.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 howard You played it for Emily, didn’t you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 raj Yeah, so what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 howard You are such a wimp. She didn’t like it, now you don’t like it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 raj No, no. I’m just evolving as a musician. You’re the one who’s stuck in the past.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 howard The past was lunch. You know what’s really happening here? Your girlfriend is breaking up our band.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 raj She has nothing to do with this. I am my own man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 howard Oh, please. Your brain belongs to whoever’s willing to sleep with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 raj That is so not true.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 howard Really? Remember when you were gonna get circumcised for Rachel Bernstein?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 raj That had nothing to do with Rachel. It was an overreaction to a bad zipper injury.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 howard I don’t need this. I’m quitting the band.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 raj Fine, I quit, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 howard Then get out of my house.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 raj With pleasure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 howard Raj, wait.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 raj What took you so long?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 leonard Buddy, I know me moving in with Penny feels like a big change, but it’s not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 sheldon How can you say that? Amy’s gone, and you two are married now, so it’s only a matter of time before you’re gone, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 penny Okay, you don’t know what’s gonna happen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 sheldon No, I do. Eventually you’ll want more space, and you’ll move into a house, and then instead of dinner a couple of times a week, it’ll only be a couple of times a month, and then it’ll only be on special occasions, like when Bernadette divorces Wolowitz. Or, or, or like when Koothrappali’s weird girlfriend admits where she buried his body. Or Amy’s wedding, where she’s marrying someone better than me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 penny Okay, look, we don’t need to rush into anything. All right? Maybe instead of Leonard moving in with me, we just leave things the way they are, and sometimes we’ll sleep over there, and sometimes we’ll sleep over here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 sheldon But mostly here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 penny Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 leonard Wuh, what about what you said in the restaurant?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 penny Well, it’s not forever. It’s just for a while. If you want, we can think of him like he’s our dog.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 sheldon You can. I’m happy when you come home. And I’m scared of fireworks. By the way, on July Fourth, we’re all sleeping here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 leonard Fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 sheldon All right, great. Just give me one minute, and I’ll get started on a new roommate agreement. Yeah. nothing from Pratt, we’re good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 howard Indy’ whip snapped, Thor’s hammer missed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 raj It was Avenger versus archeologist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 howard Indy held his ground, and straightened his fedora.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 raj Thor said, that’s a nice look in nineteen fourty-foura.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 together Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays with bones. Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays with bones.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode04 stuart Play something we can dance to.
