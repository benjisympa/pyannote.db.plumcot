TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 leonard Hey, ready for lunch?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 howard Oh, one sec.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon Is that the prototype drive system for the high-G rover?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 howard No, Bernadette got me a Fitbit so she can track how much I’m exercising.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 leonard That’ll teach her to care about your health.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 howard Yeah, I can’t wait to see the look on her face when I die young.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 raj When was the last actual exercise you got?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 howard The other day, when she tried to put that Fitbit on me and I ran away from her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon According to a recent study, simply thinking about exercise, even while sitting still, can have physical benefits. For all you know, I could be exercising right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 raj Are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon Nah, I’ll do it tomorrow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 leonard It wouldn’t be the worst thing if we were more active.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 howard You make an excellent point. Ooh, I think I’m getting a runner’s high.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 leonard Look at all these activities the university has. Rock climbing club, archery, flag football.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon Had me at flag, lost me at football.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 penny Yeah, I think it’s great you guys want to get more exercise, but do you really think sports is the right choice for you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 leonard What are you saying? We’re not coordinated enough to play sports?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 penny Okay, Leonard, sweetheart, you twisted your ankle playing Scrabble.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 leonard I got a triple-word score with a double letter Q. If that’s not a time to bust out the scrabble dance, what’s the point of having one? Hey, Barry Kripke started a fencing club.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon Interesting. Sword fighting does hold a certain elegant appeal. And I would imagine it meets many of our personal criteria for a sport.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 leonard It’s indoors, so no sunscreen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon No throwing, no catching, no running.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 leonard No gym shorts that can be yanked down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon Or worse, up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 leonard Preach.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon And as an added bonus, the word touché comes from fencing. It would be our only opportunity to use it in a non-metaphorical sense.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 leonard What about a game of tag on a French schoolyard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon Ah, touché.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 stuart Thanks for coming by.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 bernadette Sure. So how can we help?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 stuart Well, I know more women are buying comics than ever, but for some reason, I, I can’t get ’em in here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 penny All right, well, what have you tried so far?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 stuart Uh, I’ve, I’ve been stocking more female-oriented titles. Uh, in the bathroom, I folded the end of the toilet paper into a triangle. And, uh, you are now sitting in the official breastfeeding area.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 penny Really? In a comic book store?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 stuart Oh, don’t worry. I, I’ve got a camera right up here, so I could watch from the counter and make sure guys aren’t being pervs. Anyway, so what do I got to do to, to get you in the door?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 amy Well, for starters, you might want to rethink some of this artwork. I mean, this woman’s actually on a leash like a dog.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 stuart Well, you don’t know the backstory. Maybe she kept jumping up on the couch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 raj I feel cool. Like Puss in Boots.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 leonard I always wanted to be a swashbuckler when I was a kid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon Technically, swashbuckler is a combination of two terms. Swash referring to the sound of the sword. Swash. And then buckler meaning a small shield, which you don’t have.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 raj We can still be swashers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 howard Well said, Puss.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 barry Gentlemen, welcome to the fencing cwub. Before we start, I just want to warn you, fencing isn’t a joke. I hope you’re not here because you think it’s going to be wike Star Wars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 leonard That’s not why we’re here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 raj Yeah, I’m here because I think it’s gonna be like Game of Thrones.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 howard And maybe a little Princess Bride.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 raj Ooh, ooh, I forgot about Princess Bride. That’s my answer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 barry Well, sowwy to disappoint you, but fencing is a sewious spowt. If you’re not wiwwing to put in the effowt, you might as well just weave now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon We’re not afraid of physical activity.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 howard Yeah. I already ran 18 miles today.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 barry Awwight. Let’s begin with some fundamentals. This is the en garde position. Feet are in an L. Heels in a stwaight wine. Elbow is about a fist from the wib cage. Notice my dominant weg faces fowward.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon Oh, dear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 barry What’s wong, Cooper?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon Well, I’m not sure I have a dominant leg. They’re both pretty submissive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 howard When you’re in a public restroom, which foot do you flush the toilet with?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon Right. Always right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 howard He’s a righty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 barry Okay, show me en garde. Good. Knees bent, swightwy over the toe. Non-sword hand up for bawance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 howard Oh, God, I am going to feel this tomorrow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 barry The first move is called an advance. You move your fwont foot fowward, heel to toe. Back foot fowwows. So fwont foot fowward, heel to toe. Back foot fowwows. Now you twy. Advance. And advance. And advance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 leonard This is easy. I didn’t need to wear a cup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 barry Good. The next move is called a wetweat. Step back. Back foot first, toe to heel. Fwont foot fowwows. On thwee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon Excuse me, Barry?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 barry Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon When can I stab one of my friends?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 barry In fencing, we don’t call it a stab. We call it a touch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon Uh, yes, I’m aware. But if I say I want to touch one of my friends, I’ll get called into Human Resources.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 barry Okay, on thwee, Cooper and Koothwappawi advance, the other two wetweat. One, two, thwee. Vewy good. Switch it up. One, two, thwee. Switch again. One, two, thwee. Excuse me. Can I call you back? No, I’m teaching a cwass. Sure. Sure. An hour, tops. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. And one, two, thwee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 amy Have you thought about advertising directly to females?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 stuart Hmm, okay. Well, alright, what if I put up a sign in the window that said women, come in. Don’t be afraid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 penny Hey, have you read the online reviews for this place?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 stuart Eh, the Internet’s so negative. I try to avoid it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 penny All right, well, Heather H says, the owner stared at me the whole time and didn’t blink once. Kelly M says, the creepy guy who runs it asked me out, then called himself stupid before I could say no. Jessica K says, I told the weird owner that I liked his shirt. He took it off and gave it to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 stuart See? Negative.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 barry With your foil extended, kick your fwont weg up and push off with your back weg. Now you twy. And again. And again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 raj Look at us. We’re like the Rockettes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon En garde, Leonard. Prepare yourself for a rigorous touching.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 howard My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 raj My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 howard I thought you were Puss in Boots.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 raj Oh, yeah, right. Sorry. My name is Puss in Boots. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon I’m looking forward to him teaching us glove-slapping.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon You know, when my honour is insulted, and I need to challenge someone to a duel by slapping them across the face with my glove.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 leonard When was your honour insulted?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon My last physical.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 leonard Again, that doctor didn’t insult your honour. Just checked your prostate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 raj My name is Little Orphan Annie. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 howard My name is Darth Vader. I am your father. Prepare to die.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon Ah, this is fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 leonard Well, good. It’s nice to see your mind off Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 barry What’s going on with Amy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon Not that it’s any of your business, but she broke up with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 barry Weawwy? Good to know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon Good to know? What’s that supposed to mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 leonard Oh. I hate to say it, but it sounds like he’s interested in her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon Well, that’s unacceptable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 leonard Oh, buddy, I get that you don’t like it, but it’s not really up to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon Yeah, but he’s dumb, and his face is dumb.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 leonard Look, even if it’s not him, Amy’s probably going to date someone at some point.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon You really think so?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 leonard Of course. She deserves to be happy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon How dare you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 leonard Listen, I should warn you that maybe asking Amy out isn’t a good idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon Barry, a word?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 leonard And now the crazy version of what I just said.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon If you intend to pursue Amy, you leave me with no choice but to put a stop to it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 barry And how are you gonna do that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon By challenging you to a duel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 barry You’ve had one wesson. I’ll destwoy you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon That is why the duel will take place at high noon, three years from today. If you’re worth your salt as an instructor, I should be ready by then. Yeah, and be warned. I’m going to touch you all over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 leonard Wow. That, that was crazier than I thought.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 stuart All right, I’m not saying it’s true, but let’s, let’s consider for a moment that possibly I’m the problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 penny Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 bernadette You are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 amy You can say it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 stuart Okay, fine. What, I mean, what can I do? I get so nervous around women.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 penny Well, you’re talking to us now. I mean, you don’t seem nervous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 stuart Well, that’s ’cause I’m doing that trick where you imagine the audience is naked. By the way, thumbs up, ladies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 amy Do you not hear how creepy that sounds?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 stuart It was a joke.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 bernadette Was it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 stuart No, I’m still doing it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 penny Okay. Don’t be offended, but, what went wrong with you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 stuart I, I guess I assumed at this point in my life, I would be married or in a relationship, or even have a pet that didn’t run away or kill itself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 bernadette That really happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 stuart I mean, I can’t say for sure, but I swear that rabbit looked me right in the eye before it hopped in front of that car. Anyway, the longer I’m alone, the more desperate I get.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 amy Stuart, believe it or not, I understand. You know, before I met Sheldon, I was alone for a really long time. I was so desperate for people to like me, when I met these guys, it took everything in my power to hide my insecurity.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 stuart Okay, we’re all feeling it. Yes, I’ll go out with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 amy Suddenly, the rabbit thing makes sense.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 leonard I’m surprised you wanted to go to a sports bar, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon Look at this blister. Like it or not, we’re athletes now. Besides, a bar is where I belong. I’m having female problems.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 leonard If you’re cranky and retaining water, I have a theory.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 howard Sheldon, instead of focusing on Amy dating other guys, maybe you should start thinking about dating another girl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon That’s ridiculous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 raj Why? You never thought you’d end up in a relationship, and then you met Amy. Maybe there’s someone else out there for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon True, but Penny’s married, and so is Bernadette. And your girlfriend has red hair and white skin, which really rubs up against my clown phobia.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 leonard Maybe you should consider women who aren’t in serious relationships with your closest friends?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon There’s that prostate doctor, but I’m still mad at her. Oh, there’s a woman. I’ll make her my girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 raj Whoa, whoa. Walking up to a strange woman in a bar usually doesn’t work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon You’re forgetting something. Ladies love jocks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 raj How many sips of that beer did he have?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 leonard Three.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 howard Oh, boy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon Excuse me. I’m recovering from a recent breakup, and I’m told asking out another woman might make me feel better. And as Ash Ketchum said to Pikachu, I choose you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 woman What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon It’s a Pokémon reference.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 woman I don’t know what that means.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon Well, we gave it a shot. How about you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 older_woman I’m married, and I’m her grandmother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon Ah, what might have been. And you, give my regards to Barnum and Bailey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 bernadette Stuart took that rejection like a pro.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 penny Well, he knew he was on the breast cam.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 amy I don’t have much experience turning men down. It wasn’t so much fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 bernadette Oh, you get used to it. Some guys you have to turn down over and over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 penny And sometimes we marry them anyway.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 amy Huh. Well, this is weird.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 amy Barry Kripke just asked me out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 bernadette Oh. Look at you, two guys in one day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 penny I told you things would change if you plucked your eyebrows.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 bernadette What did he say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 amy Hi, how are you? I was wondering if you’d like to get a drink after work sometime.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 penny Well, what are you gonna do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 amy I don’t know. I guess I assumed that I would eventually date other people, but this is happening so fast.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 bernadette What can it hurt?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 amy Well, I was hoping the next person I dated would be a little less like Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 bernadette You mean, not a scientist?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 penny I think she means not a weirdo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 bernadette Are you attracted to him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 amy I don’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 penny All right, well, what happens if you imagine him naked?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 amy Oh, I don’t have to imagine it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon I smell funny. I taste salty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 leonard You’re just sweaty from exercise.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon And kind of delicious. I wonder how many licks it would take to get to the centre of me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 leonard I know it only takes one doctor’s finger.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 amy Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 leonard We should let you guys talk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 bernadette Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon You don’t have to leave.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 leonard Look at me go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 amy Uh, Bernadette, you’re my ride.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 bernadette Walk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 amy How have you been?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon I’m doing all right. I tried fencing today.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 amy How’d that go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon It was pretty easy. And I think my background in mathletics helped. Barry Kripke was there. I should let you know that he expressed interest in asking you out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 amy Well, actually, he, he already did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon Okay. But don’t get too attached to him. in two years, 364 days, he’s a dead man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 amy I said no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon Interesting. I asked two women out today, and they both said no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 amy I didn’t know you were interested in dating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon I’ve been told it’s a good way to move on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 amy Oh. Okay. Anyway, um, it’s nice to see you. You look good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 sheldon Thanks. And I taste good too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 bernadette Howie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 howard What’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode05 bernadette Why does your Fitbit say you ran 174 miles yesterday?
