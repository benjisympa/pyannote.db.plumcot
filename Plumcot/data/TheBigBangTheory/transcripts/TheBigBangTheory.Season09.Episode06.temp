TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon Leonard, I’ve got terrible news.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon Before I tell you, perhaps I should soften the blow. You’re face is pleasingly symmetrical.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard Just tell me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon A Swedish team of physicists is trying to scoop our super-fluid vortex experiment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard Oh, well, that kind of stinks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon That kind of stinks? Why aren’t you more upset? Did I soften the blow too much? Because this here is more like a Picasso painting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard What are we going to do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon Perform the experiment immediately.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard I’d love to, but we need liquid helium and our shipment’s on back order for a month.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon A month? What? Are you kidding me? That would have been a good time for you to soften the blow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard That shirt brings out the blue in your eyes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon Thank you. Aren’t you sweet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard Let’s go check to see if the university has any helium in reserve.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon Did you know that I almost didn’t wear this shirt today?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard Hey, Barry, we’re in trouble. We need liquid helium, does the department have any we can use?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 barry Sowwy, there’s a showtage. And what we do have I need for my quantum excitation study.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon But you won’t need much for that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 barry Twue, but if it’s successful, I’m having a pawty with bawwoons.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard Come on, Barry, there’s a Swedish team trying to run our experiment before us. Can’t you spare any?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 barry Be honest, if the shoe was on the other foot, would you do this for me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon Not a chance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon He said be honest, so I was honest. Didn’t your mother tell you? It’s the best policy. So, what do you say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 barry Hell no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon He could’ve softened the blow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 raj Why do you need Kripke? Can’t you just go to Party City for helium?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard We’d have to go to every Party City in California.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 howard Sounds like you on Cinco de Mayo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 raj Hey, people were still talking about that party on siete de Mayo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon Leonard, if that Swedish team beats us, I will never be able to enjoy anything from their country again. Which is a shame, because Swedish meatballs are my favourite toothpick-delivered meatball.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 howard If you need liquid helium so bad, I know a guy who can get you some, if you don’t ask too many questions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard Who is he?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon Where does he work?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard How does he get the helium?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon How many questions are too many questions?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 howard Maybe he’s not for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon Four questions. There answer’s four.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 bernadette Hey, you know who went out on a date the other night? Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 penny Oh, good for him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 bernadette I thought so, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 penny So is she, like, homeless, or framing him for a crime?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 bernadette He’s using some kind of dating app on his phone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 penny Oh, which one? Maybe we can get Amy to try it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 bernadette I don’t know. Stuart, can you come in here? He tried to explain it to me. It shows you pictures of people nearby, you swipe them around, it looks kind of like a game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 penny Oh, and if you lose the game, you have to go out with Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 stuart What’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 bernadette Can you show us that dating app?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 stuart Oh, yeah, sure. This thing has changed my life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 penny Wow. So how many girls have you met?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 stuart Two. I probably don’t need to mention there’s an entire number between that and zero.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 penny Well, so how does it work?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 stuart Uh, well, it, it shows me all the single women in a five-mile radius who are using the app. If I like the way they look I hit thumbs up, if I don’t, thumbs down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 bernadette Oh, what would make you give a girl a thumbs down?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 stuart First time it happens I will let you know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard Oh, hey. I just heard back from the liquid helium guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon What’s he say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard He’s got what we need and can meet us tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon Really? You know I don’t like buying things at night. January 7th, 2009, I went to the Ralph’s at 11:30pm to pick up Cracklin’ Oat Bran for the morning and what did I see?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard The man restocking the cereal shelves.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon That’s right. And what did he do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard He handed you the box directly and called you Stretch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon It’s like it was yesterday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard Do you want liquid helium or not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon Of course I do. I don’t want that Swedish team scooping us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard Then I’m going to tell him we’re in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon Leonard, wait. This is highly unethical.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard We’re just bending the rules a little. We have grant money to do the experiment, so we’re going to spend it on the helium we need. It’s not like when Dr. Goldfarb claimed he bought an electron microscope and he was really just keeping a Russian girl in an apartment in Van Nuys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon Was she helping him with his research?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard Sure. So, are we doing this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon Well, but where does he get the helium?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard Remember? Don’t ask too many questions?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon Uh, but this is violating university code.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard A little, but if I may quote Einstein, the pursuit of science calls us to ignore the rules set by man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon Huh. All right, do it. Tell him we’re in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard Done.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon I can’t find that quote on the Internet. Did you make that up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard Before I answer, may I just say your skin has never looked better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon Aren’t you just made of sugar.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 amy I’m not sure how I feel about this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 penny Oh, come on, just let him put the app on your phone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 bernadette Yeah, Stuart got two dates with it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 stuart One of which would’ve ended in sex had she not said no. Okay, all set.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 penny Okay, let me see. Nope, nope, nope, oh, he’s cute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 bernadette Doesn’t a teardrop tattoo mean he murdered someone?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 penny And he’s sad about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 howard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 raj Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 penny Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 bernadette Hey, I thought you were gonna be out late?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 howard If you wanted me to stay out later, you should’ve given me more spending money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 raj What are you guys up to?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 bernadette We put Amy on a dating app, and we’re seeing what’s out there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 raj Oh, fun. Let me see. Uh, no, no, uh, definitely not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 howard What was wrong with that guy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 raj Uh, he’s Indian. We’ve already got one of those. Ooh, we should find a nice Latino, really round us out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 howard Hey, I want to try.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 amy Uh, excuse me, can I have my phone back?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 howard Hang on, I’m trying to find you the next great love of your life. The man who will father your children. Okay, yes or no on white guy with dreadlocks?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard That must be him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon Oh, of course. An nondescript, white panel van. You may be familiar with it from the sentence, their bodies were found in a nondescript, white panel van.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 man What’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard Uh, I’m Leonard. This is my friend…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon I’m Skippy. Skippy Cavanaugh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 man Great. You got the cash?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard Uh, yeah, uh, right here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon Wait, hold on, hold on. How do we know that you’re not gonna take the money and drive away?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard What ya doing, Skippy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon Exactly what 1970s television crime dramas have taught us. You give us the helium first.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 man Oh, how do I know you’re not gonna drive away without paying me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon Guess I’m not the only one who watches ’70s television crime dramas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard Look, you can trust us. We’re respected scientists.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon Well, he is. I’m a wedding planner who can’t find love himself. It’s ironic, but the point is we can’t trust you. You’re a sketchy character in a parking garage.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 man Yeah, well, from my perspective, that’s how you two appear to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon Well, I never thought of it like that. Boy, frame of reference will just sneak up on you, won’t it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard My friend does make a decent point about the money. I don’t feel comfortable just handing it over up front.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 man Ah, no money, no helium. Seems we’re at a, uh, stalemate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon Not technically. In chess, a stalemate refers to a situation in which there are no remaining moves. Uh, you have plenty of moves available. You could beat us up and steal the money. You could kill us, you know. Really, you’re only limited by your imagination.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 man Huh. All these years I’ve been using stalemate, when I really mean impasse. I feel foolish.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard I don’t think it matters if this is a stalemate or an impasse or a Mexican standoff. What are we gonna do here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 man Oh, whoa, whoa, how can it bea Mexican standoff? Everybody knows you need three sides for that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon Not necessarily. Uh, many argue the essence of a Mexican standoff is that no one can walk away from the conflict without incurring harm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 man Hmm, I don’t follow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon Let me give you an example. Earlier today, I decoded the headers on your e-mail, and I know that your name is Kenneth Fitzgerald. From that, I figured out where you live and where you work. Now, to make this a Mexican standoff, I would say something like, uh, you give us the helium or I’ll turn you in to the authorities.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 man Is that a threat?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon Yeah, exactly. See, you’re getting it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 man Yeah, well, I know where you work, all right? And if you mess with me, I’ll report you, then I’ll pound your asses into the ground.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon Perfect. Now we really are in a Mexican standoff. Is this one of those times where I’ve won the battle but lost the war?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard Afraid so, Skippy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon I told you we shouldn’t go shopping at night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard All right, let’s all just calm down. Nobody wants to report anybody.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 man No, I don’t like this. I’m out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard No, no, no. Wait, don’t go. Just let me explain. We’re physicists, and we’re trying to prove a hypothesis that we’ve been working on for over a year.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 man Really? What’s the hypothesis?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon Space-time can be interpreted as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 man Hmm. Could be, could be. Go on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard Okay, but now there’s this Swedish team that read our paper and they’re trying to beat us to our own discovery. We really need this helium.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon And I’m sorry I lied about being a wedding planner who can’t find love. Although I am currently single, if you know anybody.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard Here’s the money. Can we do this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 man Okay. It’s a shame about those scientists ripping you off. I expected a higher ethical standard from our friends in Sweden.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard It’s actually pretty common in our field. There’s not much you can do about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 man Well, for the right amount of money, if you know where they live, there’s, uh, plenty we could do about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon Did you hear that, Leonard? There’s plenty we could do about it. Do you have a card?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 penny Okay, here we go. Now everyone can see. All right. Where do we stand on cross-eyed Mike?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 raj You know he won’t be looking at other girls.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 howard Unless they’re sitting on the end of his nose.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 penny Okay, okay, okay. Thumbs down. Next.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 bernadette Ew, check out his tiny teeth. He looks like a man-dolphin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 penny Well if he’s good in bed, she can throw him a fish.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 howard I love you, Amy. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 amy Okay, I’m starting to feel guilty. Aren’t we being a little mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 raj That’s a fair point. We wouldn’t make fun of someone like this to their face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 penny Look, it’s Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 raj You may want to leave the room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon Right this way, Uncle Harvey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard Will you stop with that already?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon I’m trying not to attract attention.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard And tipping his hat to the cleaning lady didn’t do that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon She said buenas noches. What was he supposed to do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard Let’s just start the experiment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon Leonard, we should probably have our story straight in case we get caught.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard We’re not getting caught.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon Well, you can’t be sure of that. What if the helium dealer rats us out? What if Kripke asks where we got it? What if the university checks my family tree and finds out I don’t have an Uncle Harvey?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard The dealer doesn’t care, Kripke has no authority over us, and you being related to a metal container would explain a lot. Help me hook this up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon Uh-oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon Well, did you see this sticker?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard What is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon It’s partially torn off, but the segment that remains reads property of and the letter U.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard It’s probably USC or UCLA.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon Yeah, but what if it’s Property of U.S. Government? There’s a national helium reserve in Amarillo, Texas. If this was stolen from there, we’re accessories to a federal crime.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard Let’s not jump to conclusions. A lot of things start with U.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon That’s true. There’s the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Department of Defence, U.S. Navy, you and I are going to jail.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard Listen, we can do the experiment as planned and beat the Swedish team to the punch, or we can kiss our dreams good-bye because we were to afraid to break a few rules.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard Ma’am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 penny Okay, does everyone remember the rules? If he’s shirtless, one sip. Posing with a pet, two sips. Pet and shirtless, chug like it’s your job. And pull.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 raj I have that same underwear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 penny Chug.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 penny Amy, you’re getting a text.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 amy Oh, um, give me that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 raj I had a great time last night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 amy No, no, stop reading that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 howard Who’s Dave?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 penny You went on a date last night? Are you seeing someone?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 amy No, it, it’s not like that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 bernadette And I’d love to take you out again”?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 all Amy/What?/Can’t believe it/Oh, my God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 amy Okay, it’s like that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard Thank you for coming back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 man Yeah, well, normally I wouldn’t, but my daughter’s having a sleepover, and there’s only so much screaming and Katy Perry a man can take.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon Anyway, if you could just give us our money back, you can have your helium and we’ll be on our way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 man Yeah, well, is there something wrong with it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard No, nothing. We just changed our mind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon He has glasses and I’m a know-it-all, we are not built for prison.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 man Yeah, I hear you. Well, you’re good guys, so I’ll, uh, I’ll take the helium off your hands.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 man But you ain’t getting your money back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon You’re taking advantage of us? We clarified nomenclature together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 man Look, I enjoy semantic digressions as much as the next guy, but, uh, this is business.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard You know what? It’s fine. Keep the money. We just want to be done with this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 man No problem, but I am gonna have to charge you a small helium restocking fee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon I don’t understand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard He wants more money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon Well, it better not be more than a thousand dollars. That’s all I’ve got on me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 man That’s exactly how much it is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon Finally, something breaks our way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 penny I can’t believe you’re seeing someone and we don’t even know about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 bernadette Yeah, why wouldn’t you tell us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 amy Because it’s new and weird and I’m just trying to figure it all out. And I knew if I told you guys I had been out with a few people that you’d get way too excited about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 stuart A few people?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 bernadette What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 penny Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 stuart So, are we allowed to ask how it’s going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 amy It’s going fine. It’s mostly just been meeting people for coffee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 raj What? I thought we were all… never mind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 bernadette I, I thought you weren’t ready to start seeing people.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 amy Well, I don’t have much experience dating, so I decided it would be good for me to, you know, get out there a little.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 penny Well, good for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 amy Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 bernadette And how many guys have you gone out with?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 stuart Please be less than two.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 amy Three.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 stuart Damn it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon Well, the Swedes might beat us, but at least we won’t get gang-noogied in prison.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard Is Ernest Goes to Jail the only prison movie you’ve seen?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon It scared me straight, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 barry Hey, I’ve been thinking. I was being petty. You can have my hewium.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard Thank you, Barry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 barry But you have to add my name to your paper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon That’s preposterous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 barry I don’t know, seems fair. You can’t do it without me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard Can you give us a minute?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 barry Take your time. I’ll walk out backwards for dwamatic effect.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon I don’t like being extorted like this. Especially by him of all people.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard Me neither, but what other choice do we have?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard I promise this is the last time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 leonard It says right here on Wikipedia. A Mexican standoff is a confrontation between at least three parties.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon How can you trust Wikipedia if they use between to refer to three parties?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 helium_man They should’ve used among, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon Or amongst, if they were feeling whimsically archaic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 helium_man All right, enough with the chitchat. Are we gonna watch Ernest Goes to Jail or not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 sheldon Absolutely. But don’t be surprised if this movie sets you on the straight and narrow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode06 helium_man I am open to change.
