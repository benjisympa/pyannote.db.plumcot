TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 leonard Did you hear about this study that found people that were cool and popular at 13 have problems succeeding later in life?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 raj Hmm. I’m doing okay, and I was very popular at 13.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 penny In school?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 raj Oh, no. At home. The servants would sing to me, laugh at my jokes. I wish I knew their names.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 penny Does the study say what happens to the unpopular kids?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 leonard You tell me, you woke up in bed with one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 sheldon Listen to this. I just received an e-mail from Wil Wheaton. Leonard Nimoy’s son is working on a documentary that he started with his father before he passed away. It’s about Mr. Spock and his impact on our culture.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 leonard Why is he writing to you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 sheldon Well, they’re looking for fans to interview, and Wil thought I’d be good for it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 raj Oh. Hey, high five.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 sheldon Absolutely not. Yeah, Penny, you spent some time in front of the camera. Any words of advice?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 penny Yes. Don’t take your shirt off just because the director said so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 sheldon This is a documentary about Mr. Spock. I’m sure if there’s nudity, it will be tasteful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 bernadette Hey. You got a minute?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 howard Not really. Visigoths are kind of up my butt right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 bernadette Pause the game, Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 howard Howard? Uh-oh. Make room, Visigoths. ‘Sup?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 bernadette We need to talk about redecorating this place.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 howard Oh, no, not this again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 bernadette Look, I get that you grew up here and you’re attached to things looking a certain way, but I want this to feel like my house, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 howard Oh, honey, of course it’s your house. Why else would you be cleaning it all the time?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 bernadette All right. Let’s start over. I’m redecorating. The furniture, the carpeting, the walls. I’m changing everything that depresses me when I look at it. Try not to be one of those things.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 howard May I say something?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 bernadette Is it about how I can’t have new wallpaper ’cause your dad left when you were little and your mom died?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 howard Never mind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 sheldon Hello, Amy. It’s Sheldon. Yeah, I, I know that we’re broken up, but I’m leaving this message because I thought perhaps you’d like to watch me be interviewed for a documentary about Mr. Spock. Or as I like to call it, a Spockumentary. Yeah, I’m going to use that joke in the interview, so try to laugh like you’re hearing it for the first time. You know, hysterically, hmm? And with a tinge of sadness that I’m no longer in your life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 leonard I’m the one who thought of Spockumentary.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 penny And I’m laughing like I did the first time I heard it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 sheldon Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 wil_wheaton Hey, Sheldon. This is Adam Nimoy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 adam Nice to meet you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 sheldon Oh, it’s nice to meet you. I admire your father’s work very much. It’s not every day I get to meet someone whose life’s journey began in my hero’s scrotum.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 wil I told you. This guy is gold.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 bernadette Whatcha doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 howard Oh. Making myself a bologna sandwich like my mom used to make me after my dad left, but before she died.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 bernadette Okay, listen, I’m thinking that maybe we can compromise on the house.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 howard I’m listening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 bernadette Let’s just redo one room and see how it goes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 howard That is reasonable. But what room?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 bernadette How ’bout this one?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 howard No way. No, this is the room I associate the most with my mom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 bernadette Then how ’bout the bathroom?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 howard I want to change my answer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 bernadette Fine. Then the dining room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 howard I guess we didn’t use it very often. Unless we had company. Which didn’t happen much after my dad left and not at all after my mom…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 bernadette Great. I’m gonna go pick out paint samples.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 adam All right, we’re just gonna have a conversation. Pretend the camera’s not here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 sheldon All right. But this better not be some elaborate scheme to get me out of my shirt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 leonard How long have you known Adam?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 wil A few years.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 leonard And what are you getting him back for?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 adam Let’s start with your name and occupation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 sheldon Dr. Sheldon Cooper, theoretical physicist, Caltech.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 adam And what is your earliest memory of the character Spock?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 adam What was it about Spock that appealed to you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 sheldon I think the same thing that appeals to people everywhere, the dream of a cold, rational world entirely without human emotion. Spock came from a planet governed only by logic. You know, on Vulcan, when your brother asks, why are you hitting yourself? the answer is, I’m not. You’re moving my arm. To which he says, Fascinating. And then you both watch educational television.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 penny Aw. When he says things like that, I just want to hug him and make everything better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 leonard My brother was mean to me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 penny Yeah, you probably had it coming.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 adam Do you have any Spock collectibles?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 sheldon I have many. My most treasured is an autographed napkin given to me by my very thoughtful friend Penny. That’s her over there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 penny Hi. Look at that. I’m in a movie, my shirt stayed on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 adam Can we see the napkin?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 sheldon Of course. Excuse me. This will just take a moment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 leonard When did we get a wall safe?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 sheldon When there was no more room in the floor safe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 leonard When did we get a floor safe?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 sheldon When we got the security camera.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 leonard There’s a security camera?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 sheldon Aquaman, protecting your home since 2012.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 penny Oh, my God. We’ve done things on that couch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 sheldon Yeah. You don’t have to tell me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 raj So, your father-in-law is in there right now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 howard Yes. So back me up. The house is good the way it is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 raj Oh, okay. Got it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 howard Hey. What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 raj Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 bernadette Hey, Raj. Dad and I were just talking about taking down this wall.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 raj You sure? It’s a pretty great wall.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 mr_rostenkowski What’s so great about it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 raj I’m sorry. I did what I could.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 bernadette Seriously? You brought Raj over to take your side?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 howard Your dad’s on your side.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 bernadette He’s not on my side. He’s doing all the work for free.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 raj That is so generous of you. I’d like to switch sides.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 howard Look, uh, I don’t even think you can take this wall down ’cause it’s load-bearing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 raj Well, it’s easy to find out. Just go into the crawlspace under the house and check.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 howard When is your visa up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 sheldon Not only is it signed to me but this is where he wiped his mouth. So we are currently in the presence of Leonard Nimoy’s DNA.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 wil Um, doesn’t Adam count as Leonard Nimoy’s DNA?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 sheldon No offence, but this is pure 100% Nimoy. Because of your mother, you’re only 50%. Which isn’t bad, but anything that you wipe your mouth on gets thrown away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 penny Okay, enough about the napkin. What else you hiding in there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 sheldon Wouldn’t you like to know?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 penny I would.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 sheldon All right then. See? Just my valuables. My passport, uh, my will.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 leonard You have a will?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 sheldon Yeah. My 1/18 scale Wil Wheaton action figure. I also have the other kind of will, and in it I will my Wil back to Wil.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 leonard Will Wil want it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 wil Wil won’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 penny Oh, what’s that ring box?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 sheldon Oh. That is an engagement ring that I was going to give my girlfriend Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 leonard You bought her a ring?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 sheldon No, no. This has been in my family for generations. Except for a short time when Comanches cut off my great-great-great-grandmother’s finger and stole it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 wil Sheldon, that’s awful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 sheldon No. The Texas Rangers tracked them down to their village and slaughtered every last one of them. It was a happy ending. Well, for my nine-fingered Nana.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 penny Okay, back to the ring. Does Amy even know about this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 sheldon No. She broke up with me before I could broach the subject.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 leonard Oh, man, I’m sorry, that must have been devastating for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 sheldon No, not at all. No, I’m fine. You know, Amy had reservations about our relationship, so all worked out for the best.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 penny I know. It just…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 sheldon I said I’m fine! We’ve gotten a little off-topic. Allow me to make things entertaining again in this little Spockumentary. That was Leonard’s joke. As a child, when faced with a dilemma, my mother encouraged me to ask what would Jesus do? The answer to that was always love thy neighbour. But my neighbour had a dead tooth, so that wasn’t going to happen. But that’s why I changed it to, what would Spock do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 adam Did you find that helpful?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 sheldon Yes. Oh, for example, three years ago when I discovered Penny was eating all my Pop-Tarts, instead of getting angry or vindictive, you know, I got a floor safe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 penny I knew I could smell ’em.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 adam What about from when you were a kid?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 sheldon Oh, certainly. Uh, when I was eight years old, Billy Sparks cornered me in the playground. I asked myself what would Spock do? Then I grabbed Billy on his shoulder and performed my first Vulcan nerve pinch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 adam Did it work?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 sheldon Oh, no, he broke my collarbone. I can still hear it click.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 adam That must have been very upsetting for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 sheldon Oh, not at all. As I said, the entire point of emulating Spock was to rise above human emotion, which I’ve spent a lifetime mastering.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 penny Oh pfft.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 sheldon Excuse me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 penny I’m sorry. I’m not here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 sheldon No. You went pfft. What does pfft mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 penny Um.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 leonard You did go pfft.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 penny All right, fine. Well, Sheldon, I’m no expert, but aren’t you completely missing the point of Spock? I mean, he liked to act like he had no emotions, but he was still half human.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 leonard Just like you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 penny I’m just saying, you pretend you don’t, but you have feelings just like everybody else.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 sheldon Not true. No, look at me. I had an engagement ring to give a girl, and instead, she rejected me. And am I emotional about that? No. No, I am sitting here on a couch, talking about my favourite TV character like nothing happened. ‘Cause I am just like him, all logical, all the time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 penny Sweetie, you’re yelling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 sheldon Because when I speak at a regular volume, no one seems to believe me that I’ve put this Amy nonsense behind me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 wil This documentary is gonna be awesome.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 mr_rostenkowski You gonna be okay down here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 howard Yeah. Yeah, I feel like an archaeologist. Indiana Jones and the Single-Family Dwelling. Hey. Look. Found a seashell.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 mr_rostenkowski Yeah, that’s a rat skull.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 howard Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 mr_rostenkowski Relax. There’s enough droppings down here without you making more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 howard Sorry. Do you have a sense of where we are?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 mr_rostenkowski Yeah. I think that’s the den.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 howard Oh. Okay, so we must be under the dining room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 mr_rostenkowski Uh-huh. Yep. You know, I know you don’t want to hear this, but it wouldn’t take that much work to turn that den into a nursery.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 howard Why wouldn’t I want to hear it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 mr_rostenkowski ‘Cause Bernie said you didn’t want kids.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 howard That’s not true at all. I wish she’d get pregnant, believe me. I’m climbing on top of her every chance I get. In a loving and respectful manner. The point is, I really do want kids.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 mr_rostenkowski Huh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 howard I don’t know why she’s lying to you. She’s the one who doesn’t want kids. In fact, every time I bring up the subject…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 bernadette Earthquake.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 howard Oh, my God, we’re gonna die.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 bernadette Aftershock.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 penny I can’t believe Sheldon was gonna ask Amy to marry him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 leonard I know. I also can’t believe he watched what we did on that couch and still sits on it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 penny Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 sheldon Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 leonard Hey, buddy. How you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 sheldon Better. Did Wil and Adam leave?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 leonard Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 sheldon Do you think they’re going to put my outburst in the documentary?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 leonard Oh, yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 penny Definitely.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 sheldon Well, there’s no point in dwelling on it. As the Vulcans say, Kup-fun-tor ha’kiv na’ish Du stau.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 penny Do you know what that means?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 leonard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 penny Are you telling the truth?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 leonard Nirsh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 sheldon Well, this is ridiculous. Being upset about Amy all the time isn’t accomplishing anything. If I want to resolve this situation, then I need to take action.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 penny What are you gonna do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 sheldon I’m going to find her and ask her to marry me. And if she says yes, we can put this behind us and resume our relationship. And if she says no, well, then she can just ponfo miran.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 leonard He didn’t meant that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 bernadette So I should probably explain why I kind of fibbed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 howard That would be nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 bernadette I told my dad that you were the one who didn’t want kids because I didn’t want to disappoint him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 howard But you were okay throwing me under the bus?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 bernadette Turns out yeah, I didn’t think twice about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 mr_rostenkowski Bernie, you don’t need to worry about me. But I don’t want to see you miss out. Raising children was the most rewarding experience of my life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 bernadette Oh, please. Mom did everything. All you did was come home from work, sit on the couch and drink beer. How is that raising kids?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 mr_rostenkowski This is really a conversation for husband and wife. I’m gonna go clean up, hit the road. If your mother asks, I was here till ten.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 raj It’s interesting your father didn’t help around the house and Howard doesn’t help, either, so in a way, Howard’s not only like your father, but he’s also like the child that you’re afraid to have.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 howard Why are you still here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 raj Fine, I’ll leave. But it sounds like somebody needs a fresh diaper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 howard All right, I admit that I don’t help out a lot. And I need to work on that. But if we had a kid, it would be different.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 bernadette Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 howard Because when my dad left, I promised myself that if I ever had a chance to be a father I’d always be there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 bernadette Okay, I’ll think about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 howard And this an actual I’ll think about it, not like the can we get a motorcycle with a sidecar I’ll think about it”?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 bernadette It’s an actual I’ll think about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 howard I really believe I’d be a great dad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 bernadette I know you would.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 howard Speaking of making babies, what do you say I wash up and poke around your crawlspace?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 kirk Dr. Dana feels he isn’t that dangerous. What makes you right and a trained psychiatrist wrong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 spock Because she feels. I don’t. All I know is logic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 sheldon Yeah, right. You can just shut your feelings off. There goes television, lying to us again. We let you raise our children, and this is the thanks we get. Leonard, how could I have been so foolish to try and follow in the footsteps of a made-up alien race with no emotions?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 leonard Well now instead of idolizing fictional characters, you can focus on the real people who are already in your life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 sheldon Those are very wise words.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 leonard Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode07 sheldon They’d just be so much more comforting if they came out of a television.
