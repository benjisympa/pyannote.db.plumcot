TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 penny I think it’s so adorable you’re making Sheldon breakfast.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 leonard Well, he’s having a rough time. Amy broke his heart, the DVR cut off the last minute of Doctor Who. That crow followed him home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 penny Aren’t you worried you’re making French toast on oatmeal day?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 leonard Ah, well, what’s this? A pot of oatmeal? Or, thanks to you, what I will now call gloatmeal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 penny Oh, I don’t want credit for that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 sheldon Oh, Dr. and Mrs. Hofstadter, lovely to see you this fine morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 leonard You’re in a good mood.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 sheldon Yeah, I am indeed. I have decided, instead of wallowing in sadness about Amy, it is time that I find myself a new female companion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 penny Oh. Good for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 leonard What brought this on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 sheldon I realized something. When Amy was in my life, I was hyper-focused on my work and ignored her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 penny And you don’t want to make the same mistake with the next woman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 sheldon No, I need a new woman in my life to ignore so I can hyper-focus on my work again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 leonard Hey, I made French toast sticks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 sheldon On oatmeal day?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 leonard Ah, I also made oatmeal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 sheldon Ooh, that’s a lot of carbohydrates for a man on the prowl. You know what? You eat it. You’re married, it doesn’t matter what you look like.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 penny Don’t take advice from a man who threw his shoe at a crow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 sheldon Thank you for coming by, gentlemen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 howard No problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 raj So what’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 sheldon Well, it was the two of you who found Amy Farrah Fowler for me. Now that I’m looking for my next girlfriend, it seemed only logical that I employ your services once again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 howard You sure you’re up for that? She did hurt you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 sheldon Oh, no, it’s all right. I think of my time with Amy as a stick of Fruit Stripe gum. Sweet and enjoyable at first, but ultimately a flavourless lump of sadness.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 raj You’re not wrong about Fruit Stripe. I was always a Hubba Bubba man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 howard Hubba Bubba over Dubble Bubble? You’re crazy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 raj Hey, the jaw wants what it wants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 sheldon Gentlemen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 raj Oh, right, uh, girlfriend. Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 howard But what are you looking for?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 sheldon All I’m looking for is an educated, intelligent woman who shares my interests while retaining her own unique point of view. She should be kind, patient, and most important, unable to imagine life without me by ten o’clock tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 howard Isn’t that a little unreasonable?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 sheldon All right, fine, she doesn’t need her own point of view. Now, chop-chop.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 penny Come on, Amy, show us the dress.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 amy Okay. But I’m really stepping outside of my comfort zone here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 penny Uh, I don’t think any of your comfort zones are showing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 bernadette Yeah, it’s your third date, maybe you could go more sexy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 amy Well, some people think the sexiest organ is the brain.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 penny No one ever bought me drinks at a bar because my brain just popped out of my shirt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 amy Do you have any heels higher than this? He’s pretty tall.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 penny Ooh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 bernadette Ooh, tall. Finally some details about this mystery man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 penny Yeah, come on, tell us more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 amy Well, I told you his name and that he’s tall. What more do you need?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 bernadette Did you kiss him yet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 amy Just a little peck on the lips.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 penny Well, we’re your best friends, give us one more detail and we promise we’ll leave you alone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 amy Fine. Um, he’s British. All right, that is a juicy one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 penny All right, where is tall British Dave taking you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 bernadette Tea and basketball?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 amy To that new Italian place on Walnut.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 bernadette Oh, nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 amy I’m gonna go look for other shoes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 penny Good luck. I threw out all my tall ones when I married Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 bernadette Hey, you want to swing by that place tonight and get a look at this guy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 penny We don’t even know what time they’re gonna be there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 bernadette I’ll just call the restaurant, pretend I’m Amy and check the reservation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 penny Damn, you’re sneaky.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 bernadette Yeah, but I’m little, so it’s adorable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 howard I think the quickest way to find you a new girlfriend is just to get you on every dating Web site out there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 sheldon Are you sure? I’ve heard that on those sites, often when you think you’re corresponding with someone, it’s actually a computer program pretending to be a real person.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 raj And you’re afraid it’ll do a better job than you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 sheldon Excuse me. No one does a better job pretending to be a person than I do. Siri comes close, but I know more jokes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 howard If you don’t want to use dating Web sites, what do you suggest?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 sheldon Off the top of my head? Uh, prospective women weed themselves out in a battle of wits until only one champion remains, and she shows up at my door flush with the thrill of victory, and then sits quietly by my side while I watch Daredevil.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 howard You seriously think women would fight for you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 sheldon People compete for jobs and trophies, why not me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 howard He’s right, he knows a lot of jokes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 raj Yeah, no, but it is basic human nature. If we present him as a prize, maybe they would.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 howard Well, he’s smart, he’s a respected scientist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 sheldon And I have the soulful eyes of a cow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 raj I don’t know if I’d say you… oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 howard I have an idea. What if we put a post on Craigslist that says world-class Caltech physicist seeking girlfriend. If interested, solve the following puzzles for a chance to meet him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 sheldon Oh, we’ll make the puzzles extremely challenging to eliminate unworthy candidates.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 raj Oh, we could set it up like a scavenger hunt where the last puzzle gives the winner Sheldon’s contact information.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 howard Well, this is actually an interesting social experiment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 raj I’m a little jealous of the people who get to do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 howard Me, too. And we’ve seen the prize.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 leonard I don’t understand why we’re leaving so early for the movie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 penny Oh, I forgot to tell you, we’re gonna meet up with Bernadette to spy on Amy and her date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 leonard What? I don’t want to do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 penny What, and you think I want to see a documentary about aluminium can recycling?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 leonard This is the movie that big soda doesn’t want you to see.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 penny No, it’s the movie your wife doesn’t want you to see.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 leonard So you’re actually okay with invading your friend’s privacy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 penny You’re not curious who she’s out with?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 leonard Not really.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 penny But you’re curious about aluminium cans? You’re a weird little guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 sheldon That’s it. The Sheldon Cooper Girlfriend Challenge is officially live.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 howard Congratulations.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 raj This is exciting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 sheldon Right now, somewhere, a woman is dividing the atomic weight of the best noble gas by the number of colours in the oldest national flag still in use.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 howard Then using that number as the average speed to calculate the travel time from Mordor to the Shire.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 sheldon And, taking her first step towards a lifetime of laughter, love and, best of all, rules.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 raj I, I hope we didn’t make the puzzles too hard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 howard Well, if she can solve them, it’ll prove she’s intelligent, tenacious and so socially awkward she has nothing better to do on a Saturday night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 sheldon Golly, she sounds too good to be true.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 tall_british_dave This is fun. I haven’t dated much since my divorce.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 amy Well, I’m having a good time, too. If you don’t mind me asking, why did you and your wife split up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 dave Oh, you know how it is, we wanted different things. I wanted children, and she wanted a pastry chef named Jean-Philippe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 amy Oh, I’m, I’m so sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 dave No, it’s, it’s fine. It’s why I left England. It reminded me too much of her. Cold, gloomy and easily accessed by a Frenchman through a tunnel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 penny Hey. So, where are they?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 bernadette Across the street, in the left window.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 penny Oh, damn it, we should have brought binoculars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 bernadette Right here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 leonard You just happen to have those in the car?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 bernadette Kinda. Before I met Howie, I liked to keep close tabs on my boyfriends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 leonard By stalking them?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 bernadette No. Stalkers are creepy. I’m just a harmless little girl with military-grade spy equipment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 penny Oh, there he is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 bernadette He’s cute, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 penny Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 leonard Can I see?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 penny What, now you’re interested? You didn’t even want to come.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 leonard I know, but you guys make being a crappy friend look fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 penny Fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 leonard Yeah, okay, I see him. It looks like they’re having a nice time. I wish I could hear what they’re saying.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 bernadette Yeah, I should’ve brought my parabolic microphone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 penny Your what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 bernadette Nothing. Not important.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 dave So you’ve never been married?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 amy No. I mean, to be completely honest, I’ve, I’ve only been in one long-term relationship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 dave Oh. What happened with that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 amy That’s a good question. After five years, it was just feeling like more work than it should be.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 dave Oh, that’s too bad. Was he a neurobiologist like you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 amy No. He’s a theoretical physicist at Caltech.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 dave I love teaching math, but that would be my dream job. What’s his focus?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 amy Um, used to be string theory, now it’s dark matter. But let’s not discuss Sheldon. Let’s get back to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 dave Wait, you’re not talking about Dr. Sheldon Cooper?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 amy I’m trying not to. Do you know him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 dave No, but I’ve followed his work for years. He’s a rock star. You’ve got to tell me about him. What’s he like?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 penny He really seems into her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 bernadette I took a video. I forgot how much fun this is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 leonard Okay, we saw them. Can we go catch the movie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 bernadette Why’d you bring him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 penny I had to; we’re married now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 bernadette Ugh, I hear that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 dave I’m sorry, just one more question about Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 amy Sure, why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 dave It’s more of a four-part question, really. When he wrote his paper on supersingular prime numbers, how long did it take?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 amy Um about an hour and half.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 dave Wow. I mean, wow. And you were there to see it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 amy Yes. Yep. We were on a date. Very much like this one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 dave Mm. I doubt it was like this one. I mean, he’s a genius, and I wasn’t even smart enough to figure out why my wife always smelled of croissants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 amy What was the rest of your question?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 dave Do you think you could introduce me to him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 amy Really? You-you want me to introduce you to my ex-boyfriend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 dave You’re right, it’s, it’s weird. No, wait. Do it. No. I changed my mind. I’d be too nervous. Oh, I don’t know what to do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 leonard Are we gonna be much longer? I really have to go to the bathroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 bernadette Right here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 raj 37 minutes left until the deadline.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 sheldon Someone will show.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 howard And no matter what happens, this is still a fun experiment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 raj Not as fun as the night we blew up grapes in the microwave. We really have led full lives.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 sheldon Someone will show.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 raj Maybe you don’t want someone exactly like you. You know what they say, opposites attract.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 sheldon Well, by that logic, I should be with someone short, dull and needy, eh? Not to cast aspersions, but I can’t shake a stick around here without hitting that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 dave You know, I once drove 500 miles to hear him speak at Stanford.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 amy I have a DVD of that lecture.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 dave Really? Wasn’t it great?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 amy Not as a Valentine’s present, no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 dave Well, the next time you watch it, I’m the bloke who asked the question that he said was stupid and obvious. It was the nicest thing he said to anyone there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 amy That’s, um, terrific. Listen, I’m, I’m kind of tired. Can we call it a night?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 dave Oh, gosh. Sorry, I’ve just spent the whole night talking about your ex-boyfriend. I’m such an idiot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 amy No, you’re not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 dave Well, maybe not an idiot, but certainly not as smart as someone we won’t mention.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 amy Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 dave That you said you might introduce me to, I’m free on Thursday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 bernadette Hey, hey, they’re leaving.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 penny What? Here, give me, give me. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, they’re coming right towards us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 bernadette We got to get out of here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 penny Okay. Well, wait, what about Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 bernadette He and his tiny bladder can take the bus. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 penny Oh, no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 dave She just hit my car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 amy What are you guys doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 bernadette Hi, Ames, what are you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 leonard What happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 dave O-M-G. Aren’t you Leonard Hofstadter?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 leonard Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 dave I saw you speak at Stanford with Sheldon Cooper. Amy, can you believe it? It’s Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 amy No. Pinch me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 dave It’s an absolute pleasure to meet you. Can I shake your hand?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 leonard I don’t know if you want to do that, I was just, okay, never mind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 dave Amy, I’m never washing this hand again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 leonard You really should.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 raj Sixty seconds. This is not looking good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 sheldon One minute is a long time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 howard I’ve been telling women that for 20 years.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 raj Forty-five.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 sheldon 45 seconds is plenty of time for a woman to walk through that door and fall in love with me. You know, probably half that if I break out the old cow eyes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 raj Thirty seconds.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 sheldon Uh-oh. What if it’s Jennifer Lawrence?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 howard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 sheldon Well, that last Hunger Games was not my cup of tea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 howard You thought she was great in X-Men.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 sheldon Oh, fine, I won’t shut my heart to the love of Jennifer Lawrence.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 raj Guys, fifteen seconds.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 howard Maybe she’s waiting to show up at the last possible moment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 sheldon Sounds like a drama queen. Oh, no. It is Jennifer Lawrence.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 raj Five, four, three, two, one. That’s too bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 howard Maybe we did make the test too difficult.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 raj I don’t think it matters. Look, Sheldon, I believe when the time is right for you to meet someone, it’ll just happen. Okay? Not because of a test or a Web site, but because… we are the dreamers of dreams.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 howard It’s an actual girl, and she’s really pretty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 raj Answer it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 sheldon All right. Can I help you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 girl Um, are you the physicist that placed the ad on Craigslist?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 sheldon Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 girl Hi. I’m Vanessa Bennett. Sorry it took a while for me to get here. I was stuck in this boring symposium on atomic spectroscopy when I came across your ad, and it saved my night. The puzzles were, were really fun. I’ve never had to translate Klingon into ancient Sanskrit before.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 sheldon Careful, it’s addictive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 vanessa Chija”e’vlKub je. Or, as they say in Sanskrit, Ahm asman matey-bee ta-teyva.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 sheldon And just like that, you’re a Klingon-Sanskrit junkie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 vanessa Anyway, I, I just, I knew I had to meet the person responsible for such a brilliant idea. And I don’t need to tell you, there aren’t a lot of men who love physics, archaic languages and flags of the world.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 sheldon I am a bit of a unicorn. Well, you certainly seem like a special lady, uh, but as you know, you missed the deadline, so thanks for playing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 raj How could you send her away?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 sheldon She was late. And she found atomic spectroscopy boring. Well, I wouldn’t coitus her with your genitals.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 dave Uh, thanks for driving me home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 amy No problem. I’m really sorry about your car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 dave Oh, it’s all right. If you’re free next weekend, I’d love to take you out again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 amy Um, listen, you’re a really nice guy, but I just, I don’t think this is working out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 dave Oh. Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 amy I’m, I’m really sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 dave No, it’s, at least the same woman that rejected Sheldon Cooper rejected me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 amy There you go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 dave If I ever do meet him, we’ll have that in common.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 amy Sure. Heh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 dave And, he’s kissed you and I’ve kissed you, so if you think about it…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode08 amy Okay, get out.
