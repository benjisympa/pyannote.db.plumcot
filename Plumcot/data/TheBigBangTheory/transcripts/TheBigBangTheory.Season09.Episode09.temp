TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 raj Have you guys seen this feature that lets you talk to Siri without pressing any buttons?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 howard No. How does it work?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 raj You just say, uh, Hey, Siri, what time is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 siri The time is 6:37 p.m.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 howard So now anyone can control your phone? Hey, Siri, show me pictures of naked grandma butts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 raj Nice try. It only recognizes my voice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 howard Oh. Cool. Hey, Siri, show me pictures of naked grandma butts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 raj I don’t sound like that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 siri Here are some images of naked grandma butts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 sheldon Hey. Good news, everybody. Now that I’m no longer with Amy, I have an extra ticket to the annual Thanksgiving lunch buffet at the aquarium cafeteria. Who wants it? Well, you realize you won’t be going alone, I’ll be there the whole time. Providing fish and pilgrim facts. Can you people hear me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 leonard Well, we’re having everyone over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 penny Yeah, Leonard and I are gonna be cooking all day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 leonard Otherwise we’d love to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 penny But we can’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 leonard Yeah, poor us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 penny Mm-hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 bernadette And Raj and I are volunteering at the soup kitchen, feeding food to the homeless.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 sheldon Well, Howard, what about you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 howard Oh, I can’t. I’m going to the soup kitchen, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 bernadette You said that sounded like the worst thing ever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 howard If you can’t support me when I’m lying, why are we married?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 amy Hi, Sheldon. What’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 sheldon Well, I’m calling because Thanksgiving is coming up, and I wanted to offer you the aquarium tickets.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 amy No one can go with you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 sheldon No. They’d rather spend the holiday with each other than find out of this is the year I finally touch a starfish. Anyway, I wouldn’t want the tickets to go to waste, so take whomever you’d like.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 amy Oh. Okay. Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 sheldon And feel free to tell your guest that the Myanmar catfish is also known as the pilgrim fish. In case the turkey’s dry and you need something juicy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 amy Sheldon, I can tell you want to go, so if you’d be comfortable with it, maybe we could go as friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 sheldon You don’t think that will be awkward?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 amy Well it is Thanksgiving in an aquarium cafeteria, so I’m gonna go out on a limb here and say yes. But if you mean between us, I think it’ll be fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 sheldon Very well, then. I’ll see you on Thanksgiving morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 amy See you then.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 sheldon Oh, and forget what I said about the Myanmar catfish. My list of marine-themed pilgrim facts is pretty short.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 amy Did you know they served shellfish and eel at the very first Thanksgiving?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 sheldon And there goes my list.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 emily So, how does this work?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 bernadette The soup kitchen manager assigns the jobs, and the shifts are six hours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 howard Six hours? Oh, God, I don’t want to complain for that long.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 raj Do you ever do anything for anyone else?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 howard I happen to be a giving and generous lover.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 emily Are you and I close enough for me to say that’s creepy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 bernadette We are, and I believe the word you’re looking for is yu-huh-huh-huh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 soup_kitchen_manager Uh, can I help you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 bernadette Hi. We’d like to volunteer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 soup_kitchen_manager Oh, I appreciate you guys coming down, but we already have enough people. Any other day, please, come back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 bernadette Oh. Okay. Wipe that smug smile off your face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 howard Maybe I’m happy that so many people turned up to help the less fortunate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 emily Are you and I close enough for me to say…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 bernadette That he’s an ass? He beat you to it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 soup_kitchen_manager I was wrong. A large group had to cancel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 bernadette Oh, great. We’d love to help.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 howard Wipe that smug smile off your face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 bernadette I can’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 penny Look at us. Our first Thanksgiving as husband and wife.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 leonard I know. I feel so grown up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 penny Sweetie, you are grown up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 leonard Really? How many grown-ups do you know who have Mr. Spock oven mitts? Hey, the recipes are on my iPad. Will you pull ’em up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 penny Yep. What’s the code?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 leonard My birthday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 penny It’s not working.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 leonard It’s just the four digits, month and day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 penny Nope.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 leonard Let me see. Yeah, there. What number were you putting in?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 penny Uh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 leonard You don’t know my birthday, do you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 penny Yes, I do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 leonard Well, what is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 penny May.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 leonard May what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 penny I’m not gonna say your password out loud. That is not secure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 leonard You don’t know your own husband’s birthday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 penny Well, you don’t know everything about me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 leonard Your birthday is December 2, you grew up on Perkins Street, the last four digits of your social are 7 6-2 1, and the odds of me letting you forget this are zero.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 penny Oh, look at us. Our last Thanksgiving as husband and wife.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 sheldon Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 amy Hi. Ready for the aquarium?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 sheldon I am. You know, and in an effort to reduce awkwardness as we learn how to function as friends, I printed out a list of safe topics for polite conversation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 amy If that makes you more comfortable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 sheldon If there were a list of things that make me more comfortable, lists would be on the top of that list. Okay, now, oh, since last we spoke, have you acquired any pets?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 amy No. You?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 sheldon No. Um, since last we spoke, have you planned or gone on any vacations?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 amy I might go visit my aunt next week.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 sheldon Mm. Your aunt in Modesto?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 amy No, the one in Bakersfield.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 sheldon Bakersfield. I see. Where has this list been all my life?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 soup_kitchen_manager We’re gonna have you washing dishes. Uh, aprons and rubber gloves are here, just scrape, wash and stack. If you need me, I’ll be around.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 howard So we don’t even get to be up front where the action is?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 bernadette What difference does it make?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 howard I don’t know. I was hoping some poor kid would come up to me and say, please, sir, I want some more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 raj You’re in a soup kitchen, not a production of Oliver!
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 howard It’s not like I’m expecting them to sing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 sheldon and then the next day was 73 degrees, and the day after that was 72, and then it was 72 again, uh, then it was 74, and that brings us to today, at I’d wear shorts if I had a pair. 78.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 amy Are we done discussing the weather?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 sheldon I don’t know if I’d call it discussing. You kind of sat back and let me do all the work. Let’s see, what’s next on the list. Oh, uh, do you whittle, and if so, what kind of knife do you use.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 amy Sheldon. We’ve known each other a long time. We are perfectly capable of having a conversation without relying on a list off the Internet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 sheldon All right. Well, what should we talk about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 amy I don’t know. Just ask me whatever comes to mind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 sheldon Very well. I know you’ve been seeing other men. Have you had coitus with any of them?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 amy Man, I walked right into that one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 leonard Next we need a teaspoon of pepper, which, I believe, was also the name of your childhood dog.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 penny Fine. You think you know so much. Who’s my favourite Spice Girl?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 leonard Baby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 penny Who’s my favorite member of NSYNC?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 leonard Justin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 penny Who’s my favorite Backstreet Boy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 leonard Nice try. NSYNC forever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 penny Damn it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 leonard Face it, you can’t stump me. I am the king of husbands. I know that you don’t like the lingerie that I got you on Valentine’s Day. I know you hate the word moist. I know…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 penny Hang on. Wait, wait. Why don’t I like the lingerie you got me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 leonard Because it’s orange and you think it makes you look like a slutty carrot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 penny Interesting. I never told you that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 leonard Sure you did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 penny No. I never told anyone that. But I did write it in my journal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 leonard What? I didn’t know you had a journal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 penny I also know your voice gets higher when you’re lying.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 leonard No, it doesn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 raj You know, this reminds me of high school.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 emily You worked in a restaurant?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 raj No, I was in India, it was humid and smelled funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 howard All right, I think I’m getting into a groove here. This isn’t so bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 emly Only five hours and 40 minutes to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 howard We’ve only been doing this 20 minutes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 raj You know, I read that washing dishes can be an excellent form of meditation. The key is that while washing the dishes one should only be washing the dishes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 howard Just because you have that accent doesn’t mean what you say isn’t stupid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 raj No, seriously. It’s about being present in the moment, focusing on the feeling of the warm water, the smell of the detergent, the sound of the dishes squeaking, and following your own breath. It’s about, it’s about simply being.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 howard Huh. Okay, I’ll try it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 soup_kitchen_manager I need three people out front.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 bernadette I’ll do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 raj Me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 emily Right here!
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 howard No fair, I was meditating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 leonard Come on, don’t be mad. It was a long time ago, and it was an accident.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 penny How can reading my journal be an accident?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 leonard I didn’t even know what it was. I saw it on your nightstand. I picked it up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 penny Well, when you realized what it was, why didn’t you stop?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 leonard You know me, I’m a big ol’ bookworm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 penny All right. Let’s just finish cooking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 leonard Well, hey, okay. Let me make this up to you. Sometimes I keep an online journal. I want you to read something that I wrote.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 penny Okay, really, I’m fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 leonard Okay. Well, then I’ll read it to you. It’s from the day we first met. Beauty, thy name is Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 penny Oh, God. Stop. I don’t want you to read something you think’ll just butter me up. I want to hear the most recent thing you wrote.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 leonard Fine. Mmm, Penny’s beauty, like our love, grows more with each passing day.”
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 penny Does it really say that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 leonard Why would I lie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 penny OMG. OMG. We’re so close to the new Star Wars. I can’t take it. Gah. Gah?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 leonard Well, you didn’t read it right. The new Star Wars is coming. Gah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 sheldon I’m sensing things have gotten awkward.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 amy No. It’s okay. If we’re friends, we should be able to talk about anything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 sheldon All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 amy So, you had some questions about me seeing other people.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 sheldon Just a few.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 amy Go ahead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 sheldon How many dates have you been on? Who were they with? Where’d you go? Where did you meet them? Did you sleep with them? And how much longer to the aquarium? I’m getting kind of hungry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 amy Let’s see. I have been on six dates with three different people. It was either for coffee or dinner. One I met at a bookstore and two I met online. I haven’t slept with anyone. The aquarium is 40 minutes away. And there’s a baggie of Cheerios for you in the glove compartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 sheldon Is that regular or honey nut?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 amy I mixed them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 sheldon You mixed them. No wonder gentleman callers are pounding down your door. Do you have any questions for me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 amy Just one. Are you doing okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 sheldon I am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 amy Good. I want you to be happy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 sheldon I believe you. I’d believe you more if you threw a few Apple Jacks in here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 man Here you go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 howard Thanks. You got to be kidding me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 man Sorry?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 howard Y, you’re Elon Musk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 elon I am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 howard Wh, what are you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 elon I’m washing dishes. Well, I was on the turkey line, but I got demoted for being too generous with the gravy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 howard Oh, man. I, what an honour to meet you. I’m, I’m such a fan of Tesla and SpaceX. All your companies. Howard Wolowitz, Caltech.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 elon Nice to meet you, Howard. Feels great to come down here and help the less fortunate, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 howard Oh, yeah. Nothing better than helping people. Which is something I realized when I was viewing Earth from the deck of the International Space Station, where I spent two months as a payload specialist, a job I was qualified for because I’m an MIT-trained engineer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 elon And I thought I ladled the gravy on thick.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 howard Sorry. It’s just, you’re you, you know? And I really want you to adopt me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 elon Well, you’re here on Thanksgiving, so you’re probably a good person.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 howard Oh. I made my wife come down, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 elon You think you might ever get back out to space?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 howard Is that a job offer? ‘Cause I really want to go to Mars. Assuming I can bring my wife. She hardly takes up any room. She’s basically a carry-on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 elon Well, we’re not quite there yet, but we’re always looking for engineers. So let me give you my e-mail. We can stay in touch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 howard Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 elon Oh, look. Someone hardly touched their pumpkin pie. Want to share it with me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 howard A partially eaten piece of pumpkin pie from a homeless shelter? With Elon Musk, you bet I do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 sheldon You know, for a Thanksgiving buffet in an aquarium cafeteria, that was really bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 amy You’re just upset ’cause they ran out of Pilgrim hats.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 sheldon They gave one to that baby. He wasn’t even awake.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 amy Well, it wouldn’t be a holiday without you being mad at a baby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 sheldon Oh. Would you care to play an ocean-themed game I invented?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 amy Sure. What is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 sheldon It’s called Food, Friend, Fight. One of us chooses three aquatic creatures, and the other one must decide which he would eat, befriend, or battle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 amy So it’s like Kiss, Marry, Kill.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 sheldon What is that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 amy It’s a game where you’re given three people and you choose which one you’d kiss, marry, or kill.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 sheldon Well, my game is better, ’cause instead of marrying someone, you get to eat them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 amy Let’s just play.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 sheldon I’ll start you off easy. Electric eel, pufferfish, shrimp.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 amy Hmm. Well, I wouldn’t fight the eel, because I know it can generate enough current to kill a horse. So I’d eat the eel, fight the shrimp, and befriend the pufferfish, because it would be nice to have company on those days I feel bloated.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 sheldon Very well done.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 amy Thank you. Okay, your turn. Hmm. Seal, hagfish, SpongeBob SquarePants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 sheldon Well, I’d befriend SpongeBob but he’s not real, so I can’t do that, can I?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 amy But you can pal around with a hagfish?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 sheldon Hey, let’s not pull at that thread. Okay. I’ll fight SpongeBob, because he’s so friendly we’ll just end up tickling each other. Um, I’ll befriend the seal, because he’s trainable, which is the problem I’m having with my current friends. Which means I’ll have to eat the hagfish.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 amy Isn’t that gross? I mean, a hagfish can produce enough mucus to fill a bucket in a minute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 sheldon I know. It makes its own gravy, it’ll slide right down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 amy I miss this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 sheldon How can you miss a game you’ve never played before, silly?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 amy I guess sometimes I’m silly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 penny Hey. Where’d you go? I can’t tell if the turkey’s done.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 leonard Be right there. Hi, lover.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 penny What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 leonard I’m sorry about the journal. I want to make it up to you. So I’m gonna let you post a shame photo of me on Facebook.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 penny I am not putting that on the Internet. I don’t want people to see this. I don’t want to see it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 leonard Don’t want people to see what, huh? A little bit of this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 penny Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 leonard Huh? Some of this? And, since it’s Thanksgiving, an extra helping of this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 bernadette Happy Thanks… Yikes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 leonard I’m glad you had a nice time with Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 sheldon Me, too. It’s comforting to know that she and I are able to function as friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 penny Well, I’ve never been friends with any of my exes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 sheldon Oh, I’m sure you and Leonard will be able to pull it off. Oh. It’s my friend Amy. Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 amy Hi, Sheldon. I’m just driving home from my mother’s.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 sheldon Did you have a nice time?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 amy I did. Um, listen, I really enjoyed spending this morning with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 sheldon Well, I can’t take all the credit. It was pretty funny when that one anchovy started going the wrong way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 amy It was. Uh, listen, I, I was thinking that, um, maybe I’m ready to be your girlfriend again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 sheldon Oh. I thought we were just friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 amy We are. But I was hoping, maybe…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 sheldon Amy, I excel at many things, but getting over you wasn’t one of them. I think I need to just be your friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 amy Okay. I understand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 sheldon Good. Oh, I watched a video of the hagfish producing mucus, so I’m gonna change my answer and eat SpongeBob.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode09 amy Okay. Sure.
