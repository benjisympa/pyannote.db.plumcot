TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 sheldon Sheldon Cooper’s descent into madness, day two. It’s 2:25 a.m., and I feel the urge to urinate. My normal urination time is 7:10 a.m., but here I am, in the middle of the night, struggling to keep my mind sharp and my pajamas dry. It’s only a matter of time before my tenuous grasp on reality fades. I suppose I should pee while I still know what a toilet is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 leonard Since when do you hum songs?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 sheldon What are you talking about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 leonard You were just humming.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 sheldon Are you sure? Sometimes when my brain really gets moving, it makes noise.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 leonard How does your brain feel about calculating the surface tension of the domain walls?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 sheldon Let’s see. Hey, I was humming. One point for Hufflepuff. What song is that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 leonard Well, hum it again. Is that the SpongeBob song?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 sheldon Who lives in a pineapple. Nope.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 leonard Whatever. Can we just get back to this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 sheldon I feel like I know what song that is, but I can’t put my finger on it. My country, ’tis of thee. No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 leonard It’s just an earworm. It’ll come to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 sheldon Okay. R-E-S-P-E-C-T. No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 leonard Is this what we’re doing the rest of the night?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 sheldon I’m surprised you have to ask.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 sheldon Hello, yes, I was hoping you could help me. What song is this? La, la, la, la, la, la, la. You don’t know? Well, how dare you call yourselves a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame? My goodness. Do you sing along to the greatest hits of Elvis Presley with that mouth? Well, they were no help at all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 leonard Which is crazy, since rock and roll is all about good customer service.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 penny Yeah. So you have a song stuck in your head. It happens to everybody.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 sheldon Well, I’m not everybody. I have an eidetic memory. I should be able to remember what song this is, but I can’t. Something’s wrong with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 penny I told you if we were patient, he’d figure it out for himself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 sheldon I was always afraid this day would come. This might be the first step of my descent into madness, where I gradually test the limits of public nudity.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 penny Public nudity?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 leonard Eh, that just means going barefoot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 dave Hello?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 amy Hi, Dave. Uh, it’s Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 dave Oh. How are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 amy I’m fine. How are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 dave Terrific. And pleasantly surprised to hear from you, given how I acted on our last date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 amy Yeah, well, we both made mistakes, you know. I took the last breadstick, you gushed over my ex-boyfriend like he was Leonard Nimoy and you were my ex-boyfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 dave So, to what do I owe the pleasure?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 amy Well, I was wondering if you’d like to get dinner again sometime.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 dave Yes, please.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 amy Great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 dave Let me just check my schedule, he said, trying to seem like a man with things on his schedule.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 amy How ’bout Saturday?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 dave Uh, hmm, let me see. Uh, Friday, farmers’ market with Jay Z. Sunday, piano shopping with Elton John. Saturday works.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 raj Oh. Did you know, at the United Nations, there’s a Department for Outer Space Affairs?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 howard Really? Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 raj They exist in case we ever make contact with an alien civilization.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 howard Mm, boy, that’s one of those jobs that’s boring, boring, boring, then, oh, God, where’s the memo with what we do now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 raj Oh, this is cool. So, a few weeks ago I set up a fan page on Facebook for our band and…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 howard Wait a second. How could you do that without consulting me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 raj It’s not a big deal. It just took, like, five minutes to set up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 howard That’s not the point. When we created Footprints on the Moon, we agreed that every band decision would be mutual. Now you’re just trying to take over the whole thing. You know, maybe I should go solo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 raj But someone joined our page. We have an actual fan.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 howard All right. This thing’s bigger than you and me, band’s back together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 raj So, listen to what he wrote. Uh, I saw you play at the comic book store. You guys rock. And then there’s an animated smiley face raising the roof like this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 howard We did raise the roof that night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 raj Yeah, we totally did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 howard Why do rock stars do drugs when this feels so great?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 sheldon Why can’t I recall this song? This is taking far too long. The urge to bang my head against the wall again and again and again and again and again is strong.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 leonard Put on some headphones.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 sheldon No they make my earlobes sweat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 penny Hey, sweetie, why don’t you take a break and do something else for a while?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 sheldon There was a project I’ve been thinking about starting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 penny Okay, great. What is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 sheldon I’ll show you. Dear Crazy Future Sheldon, you were driven mad by an earworm. Your mind, once your most trusted asset, is now a sack of parrots and monkeys. So, I’m going to tell you everything you need to know. Uh, first, music is dangerous. The movie Footloose tried to warn us, but we wouldn’t listen. Oh, wait. Everyody cut footloose. Nope.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 penny I’ll pay a thousand dollars to watch you cut footloose.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 sheldon This is Penny. She is your friend. If she offers you food, it’s safe to take it. You probably paid for it, anyway.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 bernadette So, you’re really going out with Dave again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 amy Why not? He’s actually a very nice guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 bernadette But he spent an entire date talking about how much he loves Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 amy That’s nothing Sheldon hasn’t done before. Dave’s just a big fan of his work. Besides, he said he wouldn’t bring it up again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 bernadette Okay. So where’s he taking you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 amy Oh, he’s coming here. I’m actually making dinner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 bernadette Oh. That’s a big step.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 amy It is?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 bernadette Yeah. You’re inviting him into your home. It’s intimate. It’s where your underpants live.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 amy You know what? Good. I tried to get back together with Sheldon, he shot me down. Dave likes me. Maybe intimate is what I need.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 bernadette You sure? You’ve never really been with a man. Do you really want to start with one that’s six-foot-seven?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 amy Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 bernadette ‘Cause it’s like taking your driver’s test in a bus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 raj Maybe we should post a comment back to our fan and thank him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 howard What should we write?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 raj How about, uh, oh, how about, we might be Footprints on the Moon, but your kind words sent us over the moon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 howard Someday you’re gonna make an amazing grandma.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 raj Well what do you want to write?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 howard Something badass, you know, like, thanks for diggin’ our vibe. We’ll keep rockin’ if you keep rollin’.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 raj Dude, if I was wearing a bra, I’d throw it at your head right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 howard I’ll keep rockin’. You don’t do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 raj Okay. I posted it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 howard So, who is this guy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 raj Let’s see. Uh, his name is Trent Monaco.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 howard Cool name.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 raj Yeah. He’s 24. He’s a deejay. He brews his own beer. He’s got awesome tattoos. Dude, he’s got a hot girlfriend, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 howard Damn. I don’t know if he’s our biggest fan or I’m his. Hey, Trent just liked our comment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 raj He is so cool. Hey, no hard feelings, but I’m throwing my hypothetical bra at him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 penny Oh, my God, he won’t stop.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 leonard How does he keep coming up with new ways to be annoying?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 penny Nobody knows. That’s why he’s number one. Can you please go talk to him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 leonard Come on. I take care of him all day long. You do it for once.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 penny Once? Who got the gum out of his hair?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 leonard What do you want, a medal? It was your gum.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 penny Fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 leonard I love you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 penny Who cares?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 sheldon What are you doing in my room? Stop it. That’s mine. Why are you so strong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 penny Problem solved.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 leonard Oh, yeah, he got a tuba.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 sheldon Dear Crazy Future Sheldon, this is a thermostat. It controls the temperature of the apartment. The ideal setting is 72 degrees. If you find this too cold, then put on a jacket. A straitjacket, ’cause 72’s the best and you’re crazy. Now, this is your spot. You’re very protective of it. When anyone else tries to sit here, you berate them relentlessly. It sounds mean, but somehow you make it adorable. People are also delighted by your love of pranks. For example, Leonard has no idea what I did to his coffee. It wasn’t replace it with Folger’s crystals, I’ll tell you that much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 leonard Hey, can we please get back to work?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 sheldon This is Leonard. He’s your best friend in the world.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 leonard All right, just stop. This is ridiculous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 sheldon Sometimes he gets cranky, but you can trust him with your life. And he does more things for you than I can even begin to list.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 leonard Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 sheldon Oh, no, he’s drinking it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 howard Look at this. Trent is rebuilding a vintage motorcycle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 raj That is so cool. Old broken things are so much better than new things that work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 bernadette Who’s Trent?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 howard Oh, he’s our fan.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 bernadette Fan of what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 howard Uh, did you forget? We’re in a band.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 bernadette You mean because you played one time in the comic book store?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 howard And at the children’s hospital until they asked us to leave.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 raj Hey, dude, Trent just checked in at the coffee shop on Fair Oaks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 howard Really? You want to go down there and meet him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 bernadette Are you stalking him? That’s creepy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 raj It’s not creepy. I built a Footprints on the Moon fan page, Trent joined it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 howard After that, all I did was check out his profile, go back in the archive of his feed until I found his Twitter handle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 raj From there, it was easy to find him on Instagram, Snapchat and pretty much track his every movement.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 howard So if you think that’s creepy, you married the wrong guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 bernadette Maybe I should marry Trent.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 raj Yeah, like she could get Trent.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 dave This is delicious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 amy Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 dave Been a long time since I had a home-cooked meal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 amy When you were married, did your wife cook?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 dave Not at first, no. But when she began cheating on me with a French chef, she became quite the wiz in the kitchen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 amy So, a little silver lining.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 dave I suppose. Yeah. Nothing takes the sting out of a shattered life like a properly-seasoned bowl of onion soup. How long have you, uh, lived here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 amy Uh, about five years. I’m actually thinking of moving to a better place now that I don’t need to be so close to, well, you know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 dave I do. The brilliant physicist that I now know lives in the area, not that I care.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 amy Yeah. Anyway, he doesn’t drive, so, I pretty much had to take him everywhere.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 dave Had to or got to? Sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 amy My fault. I brought him up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 dave Yeah. Well, let’s change the subject. No more mentions of you-know-who. That’s a cool train. Where did you get that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 sheldon Bah, bam, bum-bum, bah, bum, bum. This song is never going to stop. Have you ever dealt with something so relentlessly irritating?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 leonard That’s a trick question, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 sheldon Well, I shouldn’t be surprised. There’s a rich history of brilliant minds descending into madness.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 penny Come on, Sheldon. There are plenty of smart people who don’t have mental problems.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 leonard Yup, she’s right. For every Newton who had a psychological issue, there’s an Edison who was just a jerk. That could totally be you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 sheldon Empedocles thought he was a god and jumped into a volcano. And Pythagoras had an irrational fear of beans. Tesla fell madly in love with a pigeon who he claimed loved him back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 penny Maybe he just had bread in his pocket.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 sheldon The list extends outside of science. Painters like Van Gogh and Pollock, chess champion Bobby Fischer, Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys. I remember the song. It’s called Darlin’ by the Beach Boys. Oh, thank goodness. I’m not crazy. I don’t have to take a pigeon as my bride.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 leonard There goes our shot at him living on the roof.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 raj So, all right, there he is. So, should we introduce ourselves?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 howard No. Let him spot us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 raj I wonder if he’s listening to our music right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 howard Could you imagine? What a cool way for us to meet. He’s playing our song and looks up, and there we are, his favorite two-piece acoustic sci-fi novelty rock band.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 raj And he’s, all, like, aren’t you the guys from Footprints on the Moo-oo-ooh what is he doing?!
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 howard I can’t watch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 raj It’s okay. Oh, it’s okay. He’s done.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 howard Why is he looking at it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 raj Eh, no, he’s not going to eat it, is he?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 howard Come on, Trent, you’re better than th-ah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 raj Ooh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 howard Let’s just go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 trent Hey, aren’t you the guys?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 howard Nope.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 raj No, never heard of ’em!
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 sheldon I wonder why it was this particular song that was stuck in my head.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 leonard I don’t know. It’s pretty catchy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 penny Do you even like the Beach Boys?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 sheldon They have beach right in the name. What do you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 leonard Well, now that you can focus again, what do you say we get back to surface tension of domain walls?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 sheldon Of course. I’m already seeing a more efficient way of taming the ultravi… I know why the song was in my head.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 penny Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 sheldon It’s about Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 penny Okay, look, I know Amy’s like an old lady, but she’s not old enough to have a song from the sixties written about her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 sheldon It’s about how she made my life better. Consider the lyrics. I was living like half a man. Then I couldn’t love, but now I can. More soul than I ever had. I love the way you soften my life.”
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 penny She did soften your life, didn’t she?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 sheldon Yes. She’s like the dryer sheets of my heart. I have to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 leonard Aw. Am I like the dryer sheets of your heart?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 penny Better. You’re the lint trap of my love.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 leonard Aw.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 amy That’s an interesting tie clip.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 dave Oh, thanks. It’s, uh, Avogadro’s constant. It’s useful for calculating the number of atoms in a substance, or causing regret in anyone who asks about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 amy No, I, I think it’s neat. Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 dave Sorry. Sorry. No one’s ever liked the tie clip before, so I just lost all control.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 amy No, it, it’s okay, and we are on a date. I’m, I’m just a little nervous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 dave Well, no need to be nervous with me. I’m just a harmless giant from a foreign land.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 amy You know, I’m just being silly. I, I don’t know what I’m waiting for.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 sheldon Amy? Amy? Amy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 amy That’s Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 dave You’re kidding. How’s my hair?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 amy Sheldon, this, this isn’t a good time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 sheldon I don’t care. Amy, there was a song I couldn’t get out of my head. Eventually, I realized the song was about you, and like that earworm, I can’t get you out of my heart. So, what I’m trying to say is, you’re my heartworm. The metaphorical kind, not, not the poodle-killing kind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 amy What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 dave If I may, I believe what he’s saying, in a charming and delightful way, is that he loves you and wants you back. Dave Gibbs, huge fan of your work. Don’t mind me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 sheldon I’m, I’m sorry; I didn’t realize you were on a date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 amy No, it, it, it’s okay. Keep going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 sheldon Amy, if you want to be my girlfriend again, I really want to be your boyfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 amy I really want that, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 sheldon Good. Because I love you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 amy I love you, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 dave Kiss her, you brilliant fool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 sheldon Well, I’ll let you get back to your date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 amy Get back here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode10 dave Okay, then. I’ll, uh, see myself out. Amy, thank you for dinner. Dr. Cooper, pleasure to meet you, sir. Uh, if perhaps sometime you have a spare moment, I’d, uh, love to discuss physics, or shoot the breeze, as you Yanks say. Ah. What a lovely evening.
