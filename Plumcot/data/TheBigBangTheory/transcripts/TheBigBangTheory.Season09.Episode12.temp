TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon I’m glad to see you made it safely. How’s your hotel?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 amy It’s not the best Best Western I’ve been to, but I’d say it’s the third best Best Western I’ve been to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon I know how you feel. The Best Buy by my house is only the third best Best Buy. They have the best buys, but having the best buys isn’t the only thing that makes a Best Buy the best Best Buy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 amy What makes a best Best Buy the best Best Buy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon Mm, that’s a great question. I like when they’re next to a Chipotle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 amy Okay, well, I should unpack.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon All right. Enjoy the neurobiology conference.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 amy I will. I wish you were here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon At a neurobiology conference? What a mean thing to say.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 amy Okay, I’m glad you’re not here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon Aw, you always know just what to say after I tell you what to say.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 amy Good-bye, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon Bye. Oh, good news, gentlemen. Amy’s at a conference this weekend, which means I’m available to be entertained, hmm. As today’s youth might put it, who wants to get their Sheld-on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 howard Bernie and I are getting the house ready for the remodel. We could always use an extra pair of hands.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon That sounds awful. Raj?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 raj Uh, I’ve got time booked in the telescope room all weekend scanning for rogue planets. You’re more than welcome to join me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon That’s the one to beat. Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 leonard Oh, if anything, I’m trying to get my Sheld-off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon Well, then it looks like we have a winner. Congratulations.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 raj Well, I should warn you, it’s just looking at data for hours and hours on a computer screen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon Uh, stop selling it, kid. You won.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 penny Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 leonard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 raj Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 howard Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 leonard How was your day?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 penny Oh, not good. Still couldn’t get in to see Dr. Gallo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon A doctor? Well, I hope you’re not contagious. I’ve got a weekend in the telescope room I’ve been excited about for almost three minutes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 penny I’m not sick. It’s for work. There’s this doctor who refuses to see any sales reps. I’ve been trying to get in for months.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 leonard Well, did you try wearing the shirt I said was inappropriate for work?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 penny Well, the doctor’s a woman, but yes, because you never know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 howard What kind of doctor is she?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 penny Um, a psychiatrist. Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 howard Well, what if you make an appointment as a patient? Then you’ll get to talk to her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 penny Yeah, they already know I’m a pharmaceutical sales rep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 raj Oh. What if Leonard made an appointment and tried to lay some groundwork for you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 penny That’s interesting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 leonard I’m not gonna make a fake appointment with a psychiatrist. What would I say is wrong with me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 raj Low self-esteem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 howard Social anxiety.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon Sexual insecurity.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 leonard None of that is true.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 penny Uh, denial. See, sweetie, the list goes on and on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 leonard That’s just crazy. How would my going in there even help you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 penny I don’t know. You could talk to her, and maybe if it comes up, you could ask if she’s heard about the drug.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 leonard What if I get caught?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 howard Fear of failure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 raj Lack of confidence.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon Kind of a wuss.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 leonard Fine, I’ll do it. But not because of them, because I love you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 penny Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 raj Pushover.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 howard Spineless.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon Still hasn’t bought milk even though I told him two days ago.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 howard That was incredible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 bernadette It was. I just wish Stuart wasn’t around so we didn’t have to be so quiet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 howard I know. It’s not like he returns the favour when he watches his Japanese porn cartoons.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 stuart You guys got a minute, or are you still cuddling?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 howard What is it, Stuart?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 stuart Can I come in?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 howard Hang on. Should I send him away?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 bernadette No, it’s okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 stuart Thanks, Bernie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 howard What’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 stuart Uh, well, I know the remodel is coming up, so I thought I’d make it easy on you guys and find my own place.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 howard Wow. I thought I was done getting lucky tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 bernadette So, when are you thinking of moving?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 stuart Uh, actually, I already found an apartment, so in a couple of days.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 bernadette Oh. Okay. Sorry to see you go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 stuart Okay, well, thank you guys for everything. I, I really appreciate it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 bernadette You’re very welcome.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 stuart Hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 howard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 stuart Hmm, I just have never been in this room while you’re awake.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 raj Uh, making sure the telescope’s camera is white-field balanced.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon Hmm. What are you doing now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 raj Still making sure the telescope’s camera is white-field balanced.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon Oh, I see. How about now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 raj Now I’m making sure the telescope’s camera is white-field balanced and wishing you had a colouring book.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon Well, I can be helpful. Give me something to do. You know, my father took me to work once, and in ten minutes I figured out who’d been stealing from the cash register. It was my father. Yeah, Dad lost his job, but Mr. Hinckley gave me a Fudgsicle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 raj Fine, you want something to do? There’s about six months of data on this hard drive. Why don’t you go through it and see if you can spot any patterns or anomalies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon Yep, I’m on it. Hey, look at that, an Indian guy outsourcing a computer job to a white fella.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 raj Yeah, okay, whatever it takes to keep you busy for a few hours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon Found one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 raj No, you didn’t. There are millions of data points there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon But, look, an optical transient.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 raj Yeah, maybe that is something. How did you find that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon It wasn’t difficult. You know how when you see prime numbers, they appear red, but when they’re twin primes, they’re pink and smell like gasoline?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 raj No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon Oh. I guess I’m a special boy. You know, sometimes when a boy is special, he gets a Fudgsicle. Which, by the way, tastes like the speed of light.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 leonard Thank you for seeing me on such short notice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 dr_gallo Ah, it’s my pleasure. I’m curious, are you related to Dr. Beverly Hofstadter?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 leonard Uh, she’s my mother. You know her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 dr_gallo No, not personally, but I have read all of her books.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 leonard Well, then you know her better than I do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 dr_gallo Well, I’m not so sure about that. But I can tell you I do not agree with her theories on child rearing at all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 leonard Really? Any chance you find them cold, cruel and unsuitable for innocent little boys who just want to be happy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 dr_gallo Well, I didn’t want to say it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 leonard No, no, say it. Sing it. Rent a plane, write it in the sky.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 dr_gallo Sounds like you’re holding on to quite a bit of anger towards her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 leonard Oh, no, I, I’ve worked through a lot of that stuff, I’m better now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 dr_gallo Mm. Good for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 leonard Do you know she never let me celebrate my birthday because being born was her achievement, not mine?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 dr_gallo That’s heartbreaking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 leonard Right? To this day, I send her a card every year with a little money in it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 howard You know, once we get the house back to ourselves, we can be romantic in any room we want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 bernadette Great. I can finally show you where the laundry room is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 stuart Boy, who would’ve thought when you asked me to move in and help take care of your mom, I’d still be here two years later?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 howard No one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 bernadette Nobody thought that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 stuart Well, that’s it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 bernadette I guess so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 stuart This is weird.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 howard Yeah. A grown man moving into his own apartment. Crazy times. See ya.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 bernadette Ignore him. He’s just using humour to express how happy he is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 stuart It’s okay. I know he loves me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 bernadette Sure he does. Well, let us know when you’re all settled in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 stuart I will. And I really can’t thank you guys enough.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 bernadette Our pleasure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 stuart Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 bernadette Goodbye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 howard He’s gone. Let’s start in the garage.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 raj Okay, so once we receive the next image and compare it to the ones we’ve already collected, we’ll know what it is that we found.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon Ooh, perhaps it’s a Heliosheath scintillation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 raj It could be a trans-Neptunian object.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon Maybe it’s a new planet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 raj Unlikely, but it could be a dwarf planet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon Well, as long as it has a healthy gravity and all its moons, I’ll be happy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 raj Okay, the final image is coming in. And the object we discovered is…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon Come on, Daddy needs a livable planet he can rule with an iron fist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 raj A medium-sized asteroid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon That’s it? How common. That’s the chicken fingers on the menu of space.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 raj I kind of like chicken fingers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon Yeah, me, too. I was stuck for a metaphor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 raj Come on, a medium-sized asteroid is still an interesting discovery.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon I suppose it could end up on a collision course with Earth and destroy life as we know it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 raj You dream different than me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon It is kind of cute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 raj Yeah, it is. And you know we get to name it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon We better choose a name no one can make fun of. Sir Frederick William Herschel didn’t do Uranus any favours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 leonard Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 penny Hey, how’d it go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 leonard Oh, great. Dr. Gallo is terrific. You know, I, I’ve always been insecure that no one cares about what I have to say, but she made me see…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 penny Yeah, no one cares. Did you help me out or not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 leonard Okay, now, what I’m hearing is that you feel that I sometimes take too long to express myself, and you wish I’d be more succinct.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 penny You’re only hearing that because I cannot roll my eyes any louder.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 leonard All right, well, after we talked about my issues with my mother, nothing too deep, just how she ruined my life, I told her about you and your drug. She said she’d be happy to meet you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 penny Really? Oh, you’re the best husband ever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 leonard So you’ll go to the Doctor Who convention with me next week?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 penny I guess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 leonard Oh, I actually did hear your eyes roll that time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 bernadette Boy, when was the last time Stuart cleaned this place?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 howard No kidding. Oh, okay, I’m about to suck something up. What do you think this object sounds like?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 bernadette Howie, I don’t want to play Lego, Toenail or Pill anymore. So, what do you think we should do with this room?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 howard Well, I was thinking a home theatre or a gaming room, you know, like a man cave.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 bernadette Why can’t it be a woman cave?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 howard As long as it has a home theatre, a video game system and you’re not allowed in it, you can call it whatever you want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 bernadette I’m being serious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 howard Well, what do you think we should do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 bernadette I don’t know, maybe a home office or, oh look. The teddy bear Stuart won the night we took him to the fair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 howard Oh. He was so excited.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 bernadette Yeah. You know, no matter how hard they tried, they could not guess his age.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 howard I’ll give it to him next time I see him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 bernadette Have you heard from him since he left?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 howard No. You’d think he would’ve called once he got settled in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 bernadette Hmm. Maybe he’s busy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 howard Too busy to call? He wasn’t too busy to binge-watch Hot in Cleveland with my Hulu password. What is happening? Are we missing him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 bernadette No, that’s not what this feeling is. Is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 howard Of course not. He drove us crazy. Like when you were gonna make that pie and Stuart ate all the blueberries.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 bernadette And he tried to deny it, but his teeth were all purple.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 howard That was pretty cute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 bernadette Yeah. Ew, we are missing him!
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 raj So I was thinking, maybe we can come up with a name for the asteroid by combining our names.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon That’s a great idea. I’ve got it. We’ll call it Cooper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 raj How is that both our names?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon Koo from Koothrappali and per from Cooper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 raj Yeah, s-so it’s, like, Kooper with a K?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon Nah, you’re right, that’s dumb.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 leonard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon Oh, Leonard, great news. We discovered a medium-sized asteroid together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 leonard Wow, that’s amazing. I’m in a pretty great mood today myself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon Okay. Guess we’re gonna talk about you now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 leonard Well, we are, because Dr. Gallo made me realize that I’m a worthwhile person and that my feelings matter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 raj I learned that for free from a cat poster, but good for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon Okay, back to me. I discovered an asteroid, and now I get to name it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 raj Wait, what happened to us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon Now, this isn’t about us, this is about what’s best for the asteroid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 leonard Well, what are you thinking of naming it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon I haven’t settled on anything yet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 raj We haven’t settled on anything yet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon All right, way to go, Cat Poster. You hang in there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 leonard You know what’d be nice? Name it after your girlfriends. Show them how much you care.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 raj That is a great idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon It’s perfect. It appears romantic, but it’s really just a rock in space that gets me out of Valentine’s Day forever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 raj So, uh, what were you thinking? Combine their names?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon I like it. Yeah, we’ll take the A-M from Amy and, uh, the Y from Emily.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 raj That’s just Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon Exactly. See how well we work together?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 penny And in double-blind studies, Placinex proved extremely effective in treating all kinds of anxiety. Actually, funny story, the boys in the lab were worried about getting FDA approval for Placinex. They started taking it, stopped worrying.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 dr_gallo Got it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 penny Uh, do you have any questions?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 dr_gallo Just one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 penny Mm-hmm?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 dr_gallo When you made your husband pretend to be a patient so you could get access to me, what were you thinking there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 penny I just meant a question about the drug.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 dr_gallo Yeah, I know what you meant. Let’s put that aside for a minute and talk about why you married Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 penny I don’t wanna.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 dr_gallo Here is a man raised by an overbearing woman who completely dominated every aspect of his formative years. Do you think he’s perpetuating that relationship by seeking out a partner like you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 penny You know, I used to wear tank tops a lot. That was a big selling point.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 amy Hi, Sheldon. What’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon Good news. You’re an asteroid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 amy Uh, please tell me what to say next.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon Perhaps I should explain. While working with Koothrappali, we discovered an asteroid, and I named it after you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 amy Oh. Sheldon, thank you. That’s so romantic. But what about Rajesh? He was okay with you choosing the name?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon Well, it took a little negotiating, but I wore him down. Uh, we get the asteroid, and if you and I have children, they all have to be named Rajesh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 amy All of them?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon Even the girls.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 amy Okay, I think I know what to say now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 penny How can I not sound like his mother when our entire bedroom is filled with Star Wars toys? I mean, have you ever had sex with a stuffed Wookiee watching you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 dr_gallo I went to college in the ’70s. It was a hairier time. I’m gonna say yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 penny You know, if anything, he’s turning me into his mother. Before I did pharmaceutical sales, I was an actress. You know, I was pretty good. You know, girl-next-door type, but hot. Doable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 dr_gallo Hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 penny And not only am I Leonard’s mother, but we have this man-child living with us named Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 dr_gallo Oh, Leonard talked a lot about him. I wasn’t sure if he was real.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 penny Yeah, he’s as real as the fine I get when I use too much toilet paper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 dr_gallo Wow, you really do have a lot on your plate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 penny I do. You know, Leonard’s right. Talking to you is really helping.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 dr_gallo Oh, I’m glad. You know, you might also benefit from a prescription for anxiety.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 penny Okay, if you think it’ll help. Oh, just don’t make it Placinex. I do not need sudden fits of homicidal rage.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 amy I miss you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 sheldon I miss you as well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 howard I can’t believe I miss Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 penny I guess I just miss when life was simpler.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 girls Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard!
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 leonard Remember, girls, you decide what makes you happy, not your emotionally withholding mothers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 girls Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard!
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode12 stuart I really miss this.
