TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 penny Hey, so I saw a movie trailer the other day. How could Batman possibly fight Superman? I mean, isn’t that dumb?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 bernadette Maybe he uses Kryptonite.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 emily Well, Batman’s got a lot of money. Maybe he builds a suit that can do everything Superman can do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 penny No, no, no, no, no. I’ve seen that movie. It’s called Iron Man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 leonard What is happening?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 howard I don’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 raj But it’s beautiful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 penny And now Ben Affleck is Batman?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 emily Oh, he was great in Shakespeare in Love.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 penny Ooh, we should watch that next girls’ night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 bernadette We could do a double feature with the Leonardo Di Caprio Romeo and Juliet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 penny Oh, I love me some Leo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 leonard And it’s gone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon Oh, hello, everyone. I am happy to report I’m feeling much better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 leonard Good for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon My fever is gone, my sinuses are pressure-free, and my mucus is as clear as a Yosemite waterfall.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 howard Glad to hear it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon I’ll be able to return to work tomorrow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 raj Yay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon Well, why isn’t everyone happy? Your little ray of sunshine is ready to beam again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 penny You really don’t know why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon No. But I knew that his yay was sarcastic. Not bad for a guy whose last bowel movement sounded like rain on a roof.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 leonard Let me refresh your memory.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon Penny, rub Vicks on my chest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 penny Sheldon, I cooked you breakfast. I made your bed. I checked your mouth for thrush. You can rub your own chest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon Oh, sure, grope every other male on the planet, but draw the line with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 bernadette I brought you a little care package from work. It’s our latest antiviral and the best decongestant we make.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon I hope laughter is the best medicine, ’cause this care package is a joke.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 howard Hey, she came all the way here…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 bernadette You’re gonna want to take these with food.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 raj Sheldon, stop being a baby and let Emily take a look at you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon She’s a dermatologist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 emily I went to medical school.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon Well, in that case, try removing the irritating patch of brown skin standing next to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 leonard All right, here you go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon Leonard, I’m dying.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 leonard You’re not dying. It’s just the flu.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon I asked for chicken noodle. This is chicken and stars. It’s killing me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon I never did get that chicken noodle, did I?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 amy Hi, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 amy Are you feeling any better?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon Physically, yes, but I’m upset because everyone’s mad at me for no good reason.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 amy Why don’t you tell me what happened, and in a gentle, loving way, I’ll explain to you why you’re wrong.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon You know how, when you’re sick, you’re allowed to be cranky and say whatever you want and other people’s feelings don’t matter?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 amy Ooh. Gentle and loving, this is gonna be tricky.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon I had a hundred and one fever. If that’s not a time to verbally abuse my loved ones, when is?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 amy Sheldon, when you’re sick, you can be unbearable. That’s why your friends have been known to work late or sneak out to the movies or stay at a neurobiology conference three days after it’s ended.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon You stayed in Michigan all week to avoid being around me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 amy No, no, not just that. I mean, Detroit is beautiful when it’s sleeting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon You know, I’m not the only one who’s unpleasant when they’re sick. When Penny got food poisoning, she threw up so loudly I could barely hear the television.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 amy Ooh, I just heard something. Might be hail, might be gunfire. Either way, I’m gonna go take pictures. Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 raj Hey, Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 stuart Hey. Where’s Sheldon? Still sick?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 leonard No, he’s fine. We just needed a little break.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 stuart Yeah, I get that. When I brought him his comics the other day he said, oh great, death is literally at my door.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 howard He was being a jerk to everyone. Don’t take it personally.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 stuart Oh, I’m on so many antidepressants, I couldn’t if I wanted to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 raj I wish we could do more stuff without Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 leonard I wish that all the time. Usually before I blow out birthday candles.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 howard You know, Amy took some time off from him. Really improved their relationship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 raj Huh. Okay. As long as it doesn’t end with us having coitus with him, I’m in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 howard We should all take a trip or something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 leonard Well, you know, Penny and I have been talking about taking a weekend in Vegas. Maybe we should all go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 howard Bernie would love that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 raj Oh, Ooh, maybe we could get one of those party buses to take us there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 leonard That sounds really fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 raj Yeah, that sounds fun. A party-bus party don’t stop. Ooh, when I say party, you say bus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 leonard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 howard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 leonard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 howard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 leonard So, the guys and I were talking about renting a party bus and everyone going to Vegas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 penny Oh, that could be fun. But just to be clear, you mean a party bus with booze and music, right, not, like, juice boxes and video games?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 leonard Yes. And Howard’s birthday was a drop-off party, you didn’t have to stay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 penny Well, I’m in. When are we going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 leonard This weekend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon Oh, where are we going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 leonard Well, Vegas, but…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon Ugh, Atlantic City without the taffy? No, thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 leonard That’s fine, ’cause actually you’re not invited.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon Well, now, well, that’s hurtful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 penny Oh, Sheldon, you don’t even like it there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon I can consider a place America’s urinal cake and still enjoy the occasional visit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 leonard Not this time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon Oh, fine. Then I’ll just hang out with Wolowitz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 leonard He’s coming, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon Well, then Raj and I will…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 leonard Nope.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon Very well. Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 leonard Oh, great. Do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon Ugh. Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 amy Hi, Sheldon. What’s new?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon Our friends are jerks, and I’m mad at all of them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 amy I said what’s new, but sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon Can you believe they planned a trip to Las Vegas and didn’t invite me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 amy Did you refuse to apologize and act like they were stupid for being mad?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon You know, I liked it better when there was still a little mystery left in our relationship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 amy Everyone tried to take care of you, and you were nothing but mean to them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon I can’t believe you’re not on my side. I was on your side when someone stole your car radio.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 amy Who else’s side could you have been on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon I don’t know. A music-loving hobo with a heart of gold?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 amy Sheldon, I understand that you’re upset because you feel left out, but I don’t know why we’re even talking about this. Just apologize to them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon Fine, if that’s what it takes to go on their dumb trip.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 amy Maybe you could try apologizing because you actually feel bad. It’s called empathy. It’s something you could work on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon I have empathy. Watch. Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 amy Great. Now try it as if this isn’t your first day as a person.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon Fine. Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him. Hey, I felt a little something. Let me try again. Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him. I was mean to him. He must have felt terrible. Oh, now I feel terrible. Neat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 amy Glad I could help.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon Now let me see you feel bad for lying and staying in Detroit longer than you needed to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 amy I feel so, so bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon Hey, we’re both great at this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon Leonard, get ready for an apology. And with the added twist of an M. Night Shyamalan movie, I’m going to mean it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 leonard Ah, so like every other M. Night Shyamalan movie I’ve seen, you spoil it in advance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon Hey, if you didn’t know Bruce Willis was dead the whole time, that’s not on me. Okay. Here it comes. You tried to take care of me when I was sick, and I was mean to you. There’s no excuse for that. And I’m truly sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 leonard Thank you. I appreciate that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon I want you to know that that is sincere. I do feel bad. I’m not just saying it to be included on your trip.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 leonard Appreciate that, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon Terrific. Now all that’s left is for you to invite me to come, me to ask are you sure, you to say absolutely, and then me to bring it home with, how could I say no to that face?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 leonard You’re still not coming.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon What? I apologized and I meant it. I know that we don’t play this game very often, but you’re doing it wrong.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 leonard Sheldon, I accept your apology, but you upset a lot of people while you were sick. I’m not in a position to just say you can come.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon Well, all right. What if I apologize to all of them?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 leonard Fine, if you apologize to everyone, they all say it’s okay, then yes, you can come.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon Challenge accepted. Sounds like it’s time for the Sheldon Cooper Apology Tour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 leonard Well, I hope it’s as much fun as the Sheldon Cooper Spell-Checks Local Menus Tour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon My goodness, do you remember comes with apsparagus?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon Howard and Bernadette, you tried to comfort me when I was ill, and I treated you terribly. I’m sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 howard Wow. I’m impressed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon No, no, no, wait. I’m not done. Allow me to underscore my sentiment with a haunting rendition of Brenda Lee’s I’m Sorry played on the pan flute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 howard Apology accepted.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 bernadette Forgiven, forgiven.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon All right, that’s eight hours of practice down the drain. And to memorialise this occasion, here are your commemorative T-shirts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 howard Sheldon Cooper apologized to me
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 bernadette And he made it all better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon All you did was offer maternal care and affection, and all you received in return was rude and insensitive behavior.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 penny Can this wait?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon I’m afraid it can’t. The trip is tomorrow. And I have more apologies to make.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 penny Okay, fine, I accept your apology, now get out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon Wonderful. would you mind holding up this shirt while I take a quick…?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 penny Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon You brought me my comic books when I wasn’t feeling well. That, that was thoughtful. And I was insensitive. I’m sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 stuart Thank you, Sheldon. I appreciate that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon And I want you to know that I mean it, you know? This isn’t me just wanting to go on the trip to Las Vegas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 stuart What trip to Las Vegas?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon The one everyone’s taking this weekend on the party bus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 stuart Of course, I wasn’t invited.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon That would be my understanding. On a less painful subject, what size T-shirt do you take?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon Raj, you were being a good friend, and my illness was no excuse for my behaviour. I hope that you can accept my apology.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 raj Of course I do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon And, Emily, I’m sorry for saying dermatologists aren’t real doctors. And I’m sure you’re tired of hearing that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 emily Do you honestly think I hear that a lot?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon Well, I would imagine when your job is popping zits and squirting Botox into old lady faces…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 raj Okay, okay, the point is that we accept your apology.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 emily Uh, maybe you do. He just insulted me again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 raj Yeah, but he doesn’t mean it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 emily Why are you defending him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon I believe I can answer that. Uh, like me, Raj is demonstrating empathy. Now, why don’t you accept my apology receive your free T-shirt, uh, I hope extra small is okay. For some reason Wolowitz took a medium.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 emily Well, I don’t accept your apology.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 raj What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 emily It’s called standing up for myself. You should try it some time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 raj Fine, how about this? You’re making me uncomfortable by prolonging this ridiculous fight, and I wish you’d stop.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 emily Oh, you want me to stop? No problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 raj No, come on, please don’t leave.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon Point of clarification, are you still going on the trip? Because if not…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 emily Don’t worry, you’re good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon I caused that fight, I feel terrible. Wait, I can do that better. I caused that fight. I feel terrible. Yeah, wow, I don’t know which one I like more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 penny So, was the fight really bad?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon No. As a fight, it was excellent. She used harsh language and slammed the door. Although as I say this, that might not have been what you were asking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 leonard You think they’ll still go on the trip?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon All I know is after the fight I went to Emily’s to smooth…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 leonard They’re not going on the trip.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 raj What is wrong with you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon Look at him, caring about what’s wrong with me. That is some top-shelf empathy. Hey, well, we should start a club.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 raj You went to Emily’s to apologise, and when you left, she was crying.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon That is true. Well, I suppose I should apologize again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 all No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 penny Is she okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 raj Yeah, I calmed her down, but she’s not going to Vegas if he’s going.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 howard Wait, that’s an option? I didn’t know that was an option.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon Well, that is fine, because I’ve decided that I won’t be joining you. I’ve realized that the most genuine way to demonstrate the remorse I feel is to let you have this weekend to yourselves.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 raj That’s very mature of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon Well, I’ve been on a little trip myself recently. Not to Sin City but to Sincere City. Where instead of genital warts, the only growth you’ll come back with is personal growth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 penny And there’s your next T-shirt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 howard Ooh, check out the stripper pole.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 bernadette You know what that means.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 leonard That Raj’ll be on it before we make it to the freeway?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 raj You know it. Oo-ah, oo-ah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 bernadette This is so cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 penny Here’s some champagne.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 leonard Mm-hmm. Well, I would like to propose a toast to a well-deserved weekend of…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon Aha.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 leonard What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon My plan was to jump out at the state line, but one of my nose plugs fell into the toilet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 penny You couldn’t give us just one weekend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 stuart I told him this was a bad idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 leonard What do we do, kick them off?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 penny If we drop them off at a fire station, they have to take them, no questions asked.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon Before you do, please give me one more chance to apologize to Emily.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 raj Oh, God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon Emily, as I’m sure you know, I’m considered an odd fellow. But what you don’t know is that, while I often say the wrong thing, in my heart I mean well. I think that you are a smart and wonderful woman, you know? And we all think that you can do better than Koothrappali.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 raj You know, Sheldon…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 emily Shh, let him finish.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon So, for all the times I’ve offended you and all the times that I’ll offend you in the future, I’m sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 emily Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon Good. Then I’ll be leaving now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 emily Oh, it’s okay, Sheldon. Come with us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon Oh, that’s very kind of you. But I’m sure you’ll all have a better time without me. Let’s go, Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 stuart But I want to stay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon Stuart, now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 emily You know, I know he’s a jerk, but I actually feel bad for him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 penny And now you see the problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 leonard Come on, you pain in the ass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon That’s me. Bye, Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 stuart Wait. I’m a pain in the ass, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 sheldon Are you relieved that you and Raj were able to patch things up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 emily At the moment? No, not really.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 penny Shake it, baby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode13 bernadette Ooh, work that thing.
