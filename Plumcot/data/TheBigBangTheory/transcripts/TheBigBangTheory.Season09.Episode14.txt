TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Here’s a fun Postal fact. The inner side of our mailbox is under federal jurisdiction. So, if you broke my right thumb, that’s Pasadena city police. But if you broke my left thumb, that’s the FBI.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter If I’m going to jail, I’m killing him, not breaking his thumb.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 penny Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Oh, I got a letter from my Meemaw. Umm. Smell this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 penny What is that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Uh, roses, bengay, and Dr. Scholls’ foot powder.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 penny Ah, yeah, Grandma by Calvin Klein. You know, the last time I got a hand written letter it was from someone who told me I parked like a blind person.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter That someone has a name.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Uh, thank you. Oh, Meemaw got a new set of teeth. Oh, but then she found her old ones. Oh, so now the new ones are just gonna be her church teeth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Fun. Like your Comic-Con Spock ears and your around the house Spock ears.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 penny I park fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Oh, my goodness, she’s coming to visit!
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Oh, it’ll be nice to finally meet her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Oh, you are going to love her. She is the kindest, sweetest woman you’ll ever meet. Unless you’re a gopher digging up her vegetable garden. In that case, you can expect to have your head bashed in with a shovel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 sheldon_cooper That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her. That’s not her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Really? The old Asian man is not your Meemaw?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 sheldon_cooper And that’s not helpful. You know, I got her an iPhone for Christmas. I’ll see where she is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Oh, that’s nice. Most people her age don’t embrace technology.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Oh, no, she doesn’t even know she has it. No, I had my sister slip it in her bag so that I can track her like a sea turtle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Same as when we lost you at the zoo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Uh, for the hundredth time, I smelled kettle corn and couldn’t find the cart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Still doesn’t explain how you ended up on the freeway divider.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 meemaw Moon Pie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Meemaw. I’m so happy to see you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 meemaw I’m so happy to see you, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Oh. You got even smaller. I love it. Uh, Meemaw, this is Leonard. Leonard, this is my Meemaw.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Hi. So nice to finally meet you. Let me take this for you, Meemaw.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 meemaw Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 sheldon_cooper No. Oh, no. Now you call her Constance. I call her Meemaw. You have your own Meemaw. It’s not my fault she died when you were four.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 meemaw Is that nice to say to your friend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 sheldon_cooper It isn’t, Meemaw. Sorry, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Can you please live with us forever?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 howard_wolowitz That’s ridiculous. If you had a superpower, and spent your whole life being told to suppress it, when you finally decide to embrace that power, why hide in isolation?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 raj_koothrappali I’m sorry, and how much money did your version of Frozen make?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 howard_wolowitz I’m just saying, instead of Let it Go, she should really sing, Look At Me Hiding in a Freezer Like a Dove Bar.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 raj_koothrappali She built an ice castle, made a snow monster and gave herself a complete makeover in one day. You know what I saw you do today? Eat a block of cream cheese straight from the foil and lie about it to your wife.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 Sorry for eavesdropping, but did you know they actually had the song Let It Go in place before they finalized the story?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Yeah, that’s true. In fact, they liked the song so much, they retooled the whole script around it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 Which is probably why that movie sucks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 howard_wolowitz Here we are talking about Frozen, and yet, you got burned.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 raj_koothrappali I’m so sorry but, how can you not like that movie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 I just think it gets more credit than it deserves.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 howard_wolowitz Oh, that’s what I said an hour ago.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 Wow. You’ve been talking about Frozen for an hour?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 howard_wolowitz You should’ve seen us after The Good Dinosaur.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 raj_koothrappali It was a classic western set in the post-Jurassic period, and it changed my life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Are you comfortable?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 meemaw Very. It’s nice to rest after 800 flights of stairs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 sheldon_cooper You were so cute, huffin’ and puffin’. There’s Amy. I just know you’re gonna hit it off. You both have the same fashion sense. Hello. Come in, say hi to my Meemaw.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler Hi. Nice to meet you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 meemaw Nice to meet you, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler How was your trip?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 meemaw Wonderful. And the pilot did such a good job, I gave him a butterscotch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler That’s great. And look at you, sitting in Sheldon’s spot. You know, I don’t even get to sit there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Yeah. And you never will. Ooh, hey, oh, ask her to do the tissue thing. Do it, ask her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler Can I have a tissue?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 meemaw Of course.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Isn’t that the best? She’s like Grandma Spider-Man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 meemaw He’s been saying that since he was little. I still don’t know what it means.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Oh, well, you two sit down and get to know each other. I’ll get your room ready.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 meemaw Oh, now don’t you go looking through my suitcase for presents.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 sheldon_cooper If I did, would I find any?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 meemaw Maybe. But you also might find my brassieres and bloomers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 sheldon_cooper That’s a risk I’m willing to take.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler Well, this is so nice. He’s so excited to have you here and…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 meemaw Okay, now let’s you and me get something straight. He may think that I came to bake him cookies, but the real reason is to size you up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler S, s, si, size me up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 meemaw Sheldon’s mother may be okay with you, but I’m not so easy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler Well, I, I’m, I’m sure you’ll like me once you get to know me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 meemaw Oh, you better hope so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 sheldon_cooper A Texas Special cattle and calf car train set with authentic horn and bell. Thank you, Meemaw.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 meemaw Oh, you’re welcome, Moon Pie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Amy, why don’t you look excited? Well, you get to watch me play with this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Oh, I see you’re reading Saga.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 Yeah, I hear it’s pretty good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 raj_koothrappali It is, and not a lot of comics have a woman with wings breastfeeding a baby right on the cover.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 I’ll take your word for it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 howard_wolowitz You should. He’s really looked.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 raj_koothrappali I’m Raj, by the way. This is Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 howard_wolowitz Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 girl#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 Claire.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Well, I’ve never seen you here before, Claire.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 claire It’s my first time. I’m looking for inspiration for this movie I’m writing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 howard_wolowitz You’re a screenwriter?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 claire Well, screenwriter, slash bartender, slash, a month away from living in my car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Yeah, I get that. I’m a scientist, slash party planner, slash small-dog enthusiast, slash guy who probably should have stopped at scientist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 claire You’re really a scientist?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Well, astrophysicist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 claire That’s perfect. Do you think I could pick your brain for my movie some time? It’s animated sci-fi for kids.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Sure. I love animated movies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 howard_wolowitz He does, and he has the Lilo & Stitch collector plates to prove it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Excuse me for wanting a little magic in my life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 claire Here’s my number. Give me a call, we’ll get together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Yeah, great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 claire See ya.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Yeah, bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 howard_wolowitz What are you doing? You have a girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 raj_koothrappali So?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 howard_wolowitz So, how do you think she’d feel about you helping a beautiful girl with her screenplay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 raj_koothrappali I wouldn’t say she’s beautiful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 howard_wolowitz Really? You don’t think she’s attractive?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 raj_koothrappali I do. I just wouldn’t tell my girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 penny Constance, are you sure I can’t pour you some wine?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 meemaw Oh, no wine for me. Sheldon’s bringing me my whiskey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Here you go, Meemaw. I made it just how you like, a lot in a glass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 meemaw Thank you, Moon Pie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler I’m curious. Why do you call Sheldon Moon Pie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 meemaw ‘Cause he’s so nummy-nummy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter@penny She could just eat him up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 sheldon_cooper And I call her Meemaw because, well, just, well, look at her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 meemaw It’s interesting that Leonard and Penny know about his nickname and you don’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, well, you know, now, now that I’m hearing it, it does sound familiar.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 sheldon_cooper How could it? I never told you, and you never bothered to ask.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler Well, now I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 meemaw So, Penny, I understand you have a new job.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 penny Yes. I’m a pharmaceutical sales rep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 meemaw Oh. It’s so wonderful that you modern gals can have it all. A husband and a full-time career.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler I have a relationship and a full-time career, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 meemaw That doesn’t bode well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler Why not? You, you just said it’s okay for her to work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 meemaw Well, Leonard doesn’t need as much tending to as Sheldon does. And as Moon Pie explained, Leonard’s work is more of a hobby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter That’s my best friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 penny Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler Look, I, I get that you’re protective of your grandson, but he’s an adult now. Maybe I understand what he needs better than you do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 meemaw I appreciate your honesty, dear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 meemaw And here’s some more honesty. I don’t like you very much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler Well, maybe I don’t like you either.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Well, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You have to like each other. Well, we have a 4:30 reservation at Applebee’s.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler I think I should leave.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 sheldon_cooper But why? Other than you two fighting, we’re having such a good time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler The minute you left the room, your precious meemaw started giving me a really hard time. I don’t need this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 meemaw Let her go. And under no circumstance will you give her that engagement ring.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler What ring?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Maybe we should give them some privacy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 penny Yeah, yeah, yeah. You go ahead. I’ll catch up with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler You have an engagement ring?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler Penny, did you know about this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 penny All right, let’s go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler When did you get an engagement ring?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 sheldon_cooper My mother gave it to me, and I had been thinking about giving it to you, but then we broke up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 meemaw Well, thank goodness for that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, will you please tell your grandmother to stay out of this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Oh, I don’t think I could do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 meemaw Sheldon, tell this girl that my ring will never be on her finger.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 sheldon_cooper I’m gonna opt out of that one, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler Who said I even want to be engaged to him? And if I do, I, I don’t need your hand-me-downs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 sheldon_cooper All right, all right, look, l, let’s all, let’s remain calm and analyse this situation. Now, I realize that you’ve only known each other for less than a day, but is it possible this crankiness is because your cycles have synced?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 meemaw You leave the room and let the grown-ups talk. Now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler Don’t speak to him like he’s a child.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Thank you. I’m gonna go next door and play with Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski Okay, so you met this girl, you exchanged numbers, and you’re gonna meet up with her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Just to help her with her screenplay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh. Well, I guess that’s not so bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 howard_wolowitz You weren’t there. He was really flirting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Hey, it’s not my fault if American women project their fantasies on foreigners with the kind of magical voice that grants wishes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski I’m sure it was harmless. People flirt. No big deal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 howard_wolowitz Really? So it’s okay if I fl…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski Not you. I own your ass. The real question is, where are you with Emily?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Uh, it’s hard to say. I think we’re good, but things like this make me wonder if Emily’s really the right person for me. I mean, did you guys ever have doubts about each other?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 howard_wolowitz No. Never.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski Absolutely.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 howard_wolowitz What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski Howie, you forget how much of our early dates involved you doing magic and me doing this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 howard_wolowitz Fine. I had reservations about you, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski No, you didn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 howard_wolowitz No, I didn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski Well, it doesn’t matter now, ’cause I love how things worked out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 howard_wolowitz Me, too. And I think you’re even more beautiful than this rose.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 penny Wow. You know, the last time I saw my grandma, the most exciting thing was watching the ash of her cigarette get longer and wondering if it was gonna fall in her pudding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Did it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 penny Yeah, right in there. She ate it and everything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Leonard and Penny. Leonard and Penny. Leonard and Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 penny Come in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Hey. What happened? Is Amy gone?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 sheldon_cooper No. They asked me to leave so they could speak privately.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 penny Uh-oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Yeah, I know. It was quite tense. So here’s the million dollar question, uh, who wants to pop over there and get my trains?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 raj_koothrappali All right. I’ve made up my mind. I’m gonna do the right thing, call this girl, and let her know that I’m in a relationship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 howard_wolowitz Okay, so far we’ve heard, made up my mind I’m dumping Emily.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski Made up my mind to date both of them by pretending to be twin brothers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 howard_wolowitz And made up my mind, I’ll ask for a threesome and if they say no, play it off as a joke.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 raj_koothrappali I’m calling her. And the threesome didn’t deserve the belly laugh it got.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski You’re right. It could totally happen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 claire Hello?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Hi. Hi. Yeah, it’s Raj. Rajesh. We met at the comic book store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 claire Hey, what’s up? Figure out what time you’re free?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Actually, that’s why I’m calling. I, um, I just, I need to let you know that I have a girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 claire Okay. Good for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Well, no, no. I, I didn’t want to mislead you after you asked me out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 claire I didn’t ask you out. I just need help with my screenplay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Wait, are you saying that we didn’t have a vibe?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 claire Why do you care if we have a vibe? You have a girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Come on, I just told you I had a girlfriend. The least you can do is tell me if we had a vibe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 claire Sure, we had a vibe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 raj_koothrappali I knew it. Okay, we did have a vibe. This is exciting. What’s my next move?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski You still have a girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Right. Good catch. Anyway, so I’m sorry to waste your time. And, uh, and good luck with your screenplay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 claire Hang on. We’re both adults. We can still get together without it meaning anything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Not me. Ever since you admitted we had a vibe, I’ve been planning our wedding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 claire Look, it’s just coffee. I’ll ask you some questions about science, and if you propose, I promise to say no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Okay. That hurts a little, but okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 claire Great. I’ll text you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Bye. All right. So, uh, we’re meeting for coffee like two adults. Everybody’s happy. Easy peasy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 bernadette_rostenkowski Are you gonna tell Emily?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 raj_koothrappali Yeah, of course. We have no secrets.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 howard_wolowitz When are you gonna tell Emily?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 raj_koothrappali He lied about the cream cheese. He ate the whole thing. I saw him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler Look, I know you think I’m not right for Sheldon, but trust me, I’m his best shot. You have no idea how much I put up with.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 meemaw I know more than you think I do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler Really? You know what it’s like to have date night ruined because Google changed their font?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 meemaw Young lady, if you think I don’t know what it’s like to live with a stubborn, egotistical man, then you’re wrong. ‘Cause that was my husband.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 meemaw There were days I wanted to fill his pockets with corn and toss him in the pigpen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler Well, if you understand, then why are you giving me such a hard time?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 meemaw Because when you broke up with Sheldon, it hurt him deeply, and I don’t want to see that happen again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 penny Hi. Sorry. Sheldon would like to say something to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 sheldon_cooper No, I wouldn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter Just get in here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 penny Go ahead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Meemaw, look, I’m sorry, but I have to defend my girlfriend to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, Sheldon, thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Oh, great, now you’re gonna get emotional. I always looked up to you and Pop-Pop. I, I know what a challenging man he could be, but I saw you stand by him and-and make him into a better person.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 meemaw I did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Yeah, well, that is exactly what I’ve been doing the last five years with this little work in progress.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 leonard_hofstadter He never disappoints, does he?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 amy_farrah_fowler I think what Sheldon means to say is we’ve both grown together. Isn’t that right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Well…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 penny Say yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 sheldon_cooper Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode14 meemaw Fine. If you feel so strongly, I won’t stand in your way.
