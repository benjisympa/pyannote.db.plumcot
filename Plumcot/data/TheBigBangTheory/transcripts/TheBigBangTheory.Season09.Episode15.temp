TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard Penny and I have dinner reservations that night, but any other time, no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard Sorry, Bernie and I are breaking in the new hot tub, if you know what I mean.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon Not a clue. Raj?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 raj Spending Valentine’s Day with Emily.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard You don’t sound very excited about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 raj Oh, I am, I am. I, I guess I’m still wondering if Emily and I are right for each other.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard Does this have to do with that girl you had coffee with?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 raj You mean the strong, sexy angel I can’t stop thinking about? Who can say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard You’ve been talking about breaking up with Emily forever. Why don’t you just do it already?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard Yeah, just get it over with.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 raj Well, you say it like it’s easy. Have any one of you ever broken up with anyone?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard Not really.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon You know, uh, once I ordered an Uber by accident. I just got in and went somewhere.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny So, you really gonna break up with her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 raj Yeah, I think so. Do you have any advice?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny Well, I have broken up with my fair share of guys. I mean, how many times did I break up with Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard I stopped counting at four.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny All right, my advice to you is do it at her place so you can leave when you need to, uh, tell the truth, make it quick and be prepared for tears.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 raj Oh, I’m gonna do a pre-cry before I go in there. Really dry myself out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard She meant Emily.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny No, I, I really didn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 emily You’re seriously breaking up with me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 raj Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 emily And you thought right before Valentine’s Day was a good time to do it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 raj You’re right, let’s talk again in a few days.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 raj Hey, Claire. Hi. It’s, it’s Rajesh. I was, I was wondering if you’re free for Valentine’s Day?

TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 claire Right before Valentine’s Day? What an ass.

TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy Okay, and we are live in 22 minutes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon I’m nervous. I hope people will be around to watch even though it’s Valentine’s Day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy People who are fans of an Internet show about flags? Trust me, they’re around.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon Oh, and speaking of Valentine’s Day, I haven’t forgotten about you tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy What do you mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon Well, you’ve become such an integral part of my life as well as this show, I felt it only right to include your name in the title.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy Oh. That is so sweet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon So from now on, this program will be officially known as Dr. Sheldon Cooper and Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler present Dr. Sheldon’ Cooper’s Fun With Flags.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy Catchy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard I’m gonna check the temp on the tub.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 bernadette Don’t make it too hot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard Sorry, but too hot is the only temperature I come in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 bernadette Look at that, you shaved it all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard You’re welcome. Um, question, this is my first hot tub, is it supposed to come with a rat flopping around in it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 bernadette Ew, really? Get it out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard How?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 bernadette Uh, wish we had a skimmer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard Uh, you turn off the jets, I’ll get a strainer from the kitchen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 bernadette I don’t know how to turn off the jets.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard Good, I don’t know where we keep the strainer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard Excuse me. Uh, bad news. The maître d’ said it’s gonna be at least an hour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny An hour? What? That’s crazy. We have a reservation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny So what did you say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard Thanks, sorry to bother you. But I said it like a badass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny All right, well, can’t you, like, slip him some money or something?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard Really? I’ve never done that before. Does it work?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny Do people like money? Is that what you’re asking?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard A lot of attitude from the woman who thought MC squared was a rapper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny Now, is that a smart thing to say on a holiday that’s basically national sex night?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard I’m sorry. You’re pretty, I’m stupid. Hello. Uh, just checking again for Hofstadter. Still gonna be an hour?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 maitre_d I’m afraid so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard Okay. Thanks. Hey. I think you may have dropped this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 maitre_d Oh. Did anybody lose a 20?

TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon It’s also my gift to you. That was clear, right? ‘Cause you’re not getting anything else.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy Since we’re live, you’ll finally be able to reach out to us with your flag thoughts and flag questions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon Allow us to answer a few quick ones that we get all the time. Uh, uh, yes, I really am a doctor. Uh, yes, she really is my girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy No, I just blink a lot, it’s not Morse code for rescue me. Oh, uh, ok, uh, here’s our first call. Hello, and welcome to Fun With Flags. What’s your question?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 raj What is wrong with me? Why am I so self-destructive?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy Rajesh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 raj Yes. Whenever things are going well, I always find a way to ruin it. You two look happy, how do you do it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy I, I think it starts with good communication.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon You know what, that’s not a flag question. Next caller.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard I hope you don’t think I’m just saying this because it’s Valentine’s Day, but, I love you so much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 bernadette I’m gonna put this down your robe. It’s not moving, but I think it’s still alive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard Well, should we put it back in there a few minutes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 bernadette No. No, and it’s not a rat, it’s a rabbit. We need to save it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard Well, how do we do that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 bernadette Um, I don’t know, look it up on your phone. I’m gonna wrap it in a towel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard Um, taking care of injured rabbit. Okay. Make sure it’s comfortable and warm. Well, it was just in a hot tub. I’m gonna say check.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 bernadette Anything else?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard To make sure it’s not dehydrated, feed him an electrolyte solution. If it’s not responding, use a warm cloth to wash its face and genitals. Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny This is ridiculous. You know, I’m gonna go talk to the maître d’.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard What are you gonna say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny I don’t know. I’m, I’m gonna flirt with him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard I don’t know if I’m comfortable with that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny I’m still sleeping with you tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard See if you can get a table by the window.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny Hi there. What’s your name?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 maitre_d Glen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny Oh, boy, it is crazy in here tonight, huh, Glen?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 maitre_d Well, you know, Valentine’s Day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny Yes. Oh, bet your girlfriend is super bummed you had to work tonight. Anyway, look, we have been waiting a while, and I just…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 maitre_d With all due respect, ma’am, there’s nothing I can do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny You don’t have to call me ma’am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 maitre_d Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny I mean, we’re basically the same age.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 maitre_d Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny How old are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 maitre_d I’m 21. How old are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny Just shut up, Glen. Come on, let’s get out of here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard What? Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny Because I’m young. Let’s go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy Rajesh, it’s perfectly normal to have doubts after breaking up with someone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 raj You really think so?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon Yeah, you know what’s not normal? Blubbering about emotions during a flag show. Unless that emotion is excitement over New Zealand changing their flag. Yeah, good luck, you crazy Kiwis, we’re rooting for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy Your friend is hurting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 raj No, Sheldon’s right. Emily did say I always talk about my feelings too much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon I suppose that could be a legitimate concern in a relationship. Uh, perhaps even a, a red flag. And speaking of red flags, check out this sexy number from the former Soviet Union. Hubba, hubba.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy Oh. Uh, we-we have another caller. Hi. You’re on Fun with Flags.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 barry Hewwo. I want to talk about how wonewy I am, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 raj Kripke? Is that you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 barry Yeah, I’m just sitting here all by myself wondering if I’w ever find someone to share my wife with. Pwefewabwy Asian, 18-24, no fatties.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon Please, all comments and questions should be flag-related.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 barry Aw wight. Is my pole fwag-wewated?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon I don’t see why not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 bernadette He’s eating. That’s a good sign.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard You’re gonna have to wait one hour until you can go swimming again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 bernadette He’s pretty cute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard He is. Should we name him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 bernadette It is Valentine’s Day. How about Valentino?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard Nice. A classic rabbit name. Peter Rabbit, Roger Rabbit. Valentino Wolowitz Rabbit. Oh, look at all that chest hair and overbite. Of course you’re a Wolowitz. Son of a bitch, he bit me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 bernadette Are you okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard No, I’m not okay. Wild rabbits can have rabies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 bernadette Oh. Well, why did you put your finger near its mouth?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard Poor judgement, obviously.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 bernadette He’s so little. I’m sure it’s fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard How can it be fine? I just got attacked by a clearly anti-Semitic wild animal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard It’s not what we planned, but this isn’t so bad, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny It is freaking amazing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard Well, glad you’re feeling better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny I was just hungry and cranky, and I’ve never been called ma’am before.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard Is that a big deal?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny Kind of. When was the first time someone called you sir?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard Sixth grade, but I wore a sport coat and carried a briefcase, so…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny Can you believe when I met you I was 22? I mean, it’s crazy. Where did all that time go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard Mm, you watched The Bachelor a lot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny Yeah, go ahead and make jokes, but your thirties are almost over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard No, they’re not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny You’re closer to 40 than you are 30.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard Ha, ha. You married an old man. Tell you what. Let’s do something fun tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny Won’t make us any younger.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard Well, maybe not, but some day we actually will be old, and we’ll look back on this night and remember what a good time we had.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny Okay, like what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard I know. Food fight. I’ll keep thinking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy Look, I know you both feel bad about being alone, but sometimes the best thing you can do is take a little time for yourself, especially when you just got out of a relationship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon Speaking of ending relationships, when British Honduras became Belize, they designed a new flag with a tree on it, and I would like to hang myself from that tree.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 raj But, Amy, when you and Sheldon split up, didn’t you start dating someone right away?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy Well, I, I wouldn’t say right away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon And actually, it was three different men.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 barry Thwee diffewent men? Damn, girl, way to give the milk away?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy Oh, looks like we just lost Kripke.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 barry No, actuawwy, I’m stiw here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy Now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 barry Yup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy Now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 barry Yup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy Now? Oh, looks like we just lost Kripke.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 raj Before Emily, I was alone for so long. I just, I don’t know if I can do that again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon Well, you know, here is something that might cheer you up. The flag of the Isle of Man is nothing but three legs sharing a weird pair of underpants, so you think you got problems.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy I have an idea. Maybe someone in our audience would be interested in meeting Rajesh. Ladies, I can attest that he is a kind, handsome, intelligent…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 raj Rich parents, don’t forget, rich parents.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy …spoiled astrophysicist who not only… oh. Well, that was quick. Hi. You’re on Fun with Flags.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 barry Hey, I think I got cut off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy Hello, Kripke.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 barry I have a fwag question. How many men did you have sex with?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard Let’s see. What’s young and fun? Uh, we could go dancing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard Are you actually gonna dance?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard Of course.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny Yeah. No one wants to see that. Hey, how about skinny dipping at the beach?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard No, I don’t need any fish nibbling my business.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny Oh, there’s a screening of Moulin Rouge, I heard the crowd sings along and stuff.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard That sounds fun. When’s it start?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny Midnight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard Midnight. Really? You know what? Let’s do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny Okay, great. Oh, wait. Uh, it’s sold out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard Oh, thank God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard It says, rabies in rabbits is highly unlikely.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 bernadette Oh, terrific.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard It’s not terrific. Lots of highly unlikely things happen. You saw what’s under this robe, and you still married me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 bernadette If you’re really worried, we’ll take him to the vet and have him tested.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard Good. Thank you. Oh, okay, there is a test. All they have to do is cut off his head and check his brain.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 bernadette Oh, cut off his head? That’s where his little nose is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard He’s not showing any symptoms. I guess I’ll just go to the emergency room to be safe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 bernadette Howie, this is just your hypochondria.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard No, when I sat on the mute button and thought I’d gone deaf, that was my hypochondria.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 bernadette We’ll find another time to tell him I’m pregnant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 raj I mean, this is the first time I’ve ever broken up with someone. I just, I didn’t realize it was gonna hurt this much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy It really can.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon All right. Nothing about this is fun. No one wants to talk about flags, and I haven’t spoken in over ten minutes, so, enjoy your new show, Internet. Dr. Amy Farrah Flower present with.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 raj I’m sorry for bothering you. I’ll hang up now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy No, hold on, Rajesh. You know, you’re not being very sympathetic. You know first hand that breakups are hard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon Fine. If you insist on making me a part of this, yes, I knowledge how painful they can be. However, pain has an evolutionary purpose. It provides information from the environment that, uh, behaviour isn’t good for us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 barry Wike when I feww in wove with that stwipper and bought her a Pwius.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy I’m just gonna push all the buttons.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon Raj, now, I’m sorry you’re suffering. When Amy and I were broken up, I also suffered. And this may sound surprising, but I’m grateful for having gone through it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon Yes. I believe our relationship now is stronger than ever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy So do I.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon When, when we were apart, I learned how important you are to me. And I realize that when two people are in love, sometimes they…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard_and_penny Happy Valentine’s Day!
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard We are young and fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon I stand corrected. Fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon Congratulations on a successful live show.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy And a lovely Valentine’s Day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny Cleaning up is not young and fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard It can be. Confetti fight. Maybe you should take a break. I got this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon Did you know the singular of confetti is confetto?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy Interesting, and when would you use the singular?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon I’m glad you asked. Amy, you have a confetto in your nose. No, no, no, no. Other side. There you go.
