TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon_cooper If any of you are looking for something to do on Valentine’s Day, Amy and I’ll be streaming our first-ever live episode of Fun With Flags. You’re welcome to join us as we celebrate the timeless love affair between wind and flapping fabric.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Penny and I have dinner reservations that night, but any other time, no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Sorry, Bernie and I are breaking in the new hot tub, if you know what I mean.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Not a clue. Raj?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Spending Valentine’s Day with Emily.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter You don’t sound very excited about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Oh, I am, I am. I, I guess I’m still wondering if Emily and I are right for each other.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Does this have to do with that girl you had coffee with?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 raj_koothrappali You mean the strong, sexy angel I can’t stop thinking about? Who can say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard_wolowitz You’ve been talking about breaking up with Emily forever. Why don’t you just do it already?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, just get it over with.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Well, you say it like it’s easy. Have any one of you ever broken up with anyone?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard_wolowitz No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Not really.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon_cooper You know, uh, once I ordered an Uber by accident. I just got in and went somewhere.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny So, you really gonna break up with her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Yeah, I think so. Do you have any advice?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny Well, I have broken up with my fair share of guys. I mean, how many times did I break up with Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter I stopped counting at four.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny All right, my advice to you is do it at her place so you can leave when you need to, uh, tell the truth, make it quick and be prepared for tears.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Oh, I’m gonna do a pre-cry before I go in there. Really dry myself out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter She meant Emily.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny No, I, I really didn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 emily_sweeney You’re seriously breaking up with me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 emily_sweeney And you thought right before Valentine’s Day was a good time to do it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 raj_koothrappali You’re right, let’s talk again in a few days.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Hey, Claire. Hi. It’s, it’s Rajesh. I was, I was wondering if you’re free for Valentine’s Day?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 claire Sorry, I just got back with my boyfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 raj_koothrappali But I just broke up with my girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 claire Right before Valentine’s Day? What an ass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Please take me back. Our love was meant to be.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 raj_koothrappali I’m gonna all alone on Valentine’s Day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Well, you were right, tears.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler Okay, and we are live in 22 minutes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon_cooper I’m nervous. I hope people will be around to watch even though it’s Valentine’s Day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler People who are fans of an Internet show about flags? Trust me, they’re around.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Oh, and speaking of Valentine’s Day, I haven’t forgotten about you tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler What do you mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Well, you’ve become such an integral part of my life as well as this show, I felt it only right to include your name in the title.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler Oh. That is so sweet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon_cooper So from now on, this program will be officially known as Dr. Sheldon Cooper and Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler present Dr. Sheldon’ Cooper’s Fun With Flags.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler Catchy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard_wolowitz I’m gonna check the temp on the tub.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 bernadette_rostenkowski Don’t make it too hot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Sorry, but too hot is the only temperature I come in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 bernadette_rostenkowski Look at that, you shaved it all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard_wolowitz You’re welcome. Um, question, this is my first hot tub, is it supposed to come with a rat flopping around in it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 bernadette_rostenkowski Ew, really? Get it out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard_wolowitz How?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 bernadette_rostenkowski Uh, wish we had a skimmer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Uh, you turn off the jets, I’ll get a strainer from the kitchen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t know how to turn off the jets.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Good, I don’t know where we keep the strainer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Excuse me. Uh, bad news. The maître d’ said it’s gonna be at least an hour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny An hour? What? That’s crazy. We have a reservation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny So what did you say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Thanks, sorry to bother you. But I said it like a badass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny All right, well, can’t you, like, slip him some money or something?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Really? I’ve never done that before. Does it work?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny Do people like money? Is that what you’re asking?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter A lot of attitude from the woman who thought MC squared was a rapper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny Now, is that a smart thing to say on a holiday that’s basically national sex night?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter I’m sorry. You’re pretty, I’m stupid. Hello. Uh, just checking again for Hofstadter. Still gonna be an hour?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 glenn_the_maitre_d I’m afraid so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Okay. Thanks. Hey. I think you may have dropped this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 glenn_the_maitre_d Oh. Did anybody lose a 20?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 I did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Oh, I took care of it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler Okay, we are live in five, four, three, oh, wait, oh shoot, I already pushed the button. Never mind, we’re live.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Uh, hello and welcome to a special live edition of Dr. Sheldon Cooper…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler And Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler present…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 together#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 Dr. Sheldon Cooper’s Fun With Flags.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler Consider tonight’s episode a Valentine’s Day gift for you, our viewers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon_cooper It’s also my gift to you. That was clear, right? ‘Cause you’re not getting anything else.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler Since we’re live, you’ll finally be able to reach out to us with your flag thoughts and flag questions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Allow us to answer a few quick ones that we get all the time. Uh, uh, yes, I really am a doctor. Uh, yes, she really is my girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler No, I just blink a lot, it’s not Morse code for rescue me. Oh, uh, ok, uh, here’s our first call. Hello, and welcome to Fun With Flags. What’s your question?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 raj_koothrappali What is wrong with me? Why am I so self-destructive?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler Rajesh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Yes. Whenever things are going well, I always find a way to ruin it. You two look happy, how do you do it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler I, I think it starts with good communication.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon_cooper You know what, that’s not a flag question. Next caller.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard_wolowitz I hope you don’t think I’m just saying this because it’s Valentine’s Day, but, I love you so much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 bernadette_rostenkowski I’m gonna put this down your robe. It’s not moving, but I think it’s still alive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Well, should we put it back in there a few minutes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 bernadette_rostenkowski No. No, and it’s not a rat, it’s a rabbit. We need to save it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Well, how do we do that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 bernadette_rostenkowski Um, I don’t know, look it up on your phone. I’m gonna wrap it in a towel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Um, taking care of injured rabbit. Okay. Make sure it’s comfortable and warm. Well, it was just in a hot tub. I’m gonna say check.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 bernadette_rostenkowski Anything else?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard_wolowitz To make sure it’s not dehydrated, feed him an electrolyte solution. If it’s not responding, use a warm cloth to wash its face and genitals. Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny This is ridiculous. You know, I’m gonna go talk to the maître d’.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter What are you gonna say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny I don’t know. I’m, I’m gonna flirt with him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter I don’t know if I’m comfortable with that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny I’m still sleeping with you tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter See if you can get a table by the window.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny Hi there. What’s your name?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 glenn_the_maitre_d Glen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny Oh, boy, it is crazy in here tonight, huh, Glen?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 glenn_the_maitre_d Well, you know, Valentine’s Day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny Yes. Oh, bet your girlfriend is super bummed you had to work tonight. Anyway, look, we have been waiting a while, and I just…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 glenn_the_maitre_d With all due respect, ma’am, there’s nothing I can do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny You don’t have to call me ma’am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 glenn_the_maitre_d Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny I mean, we’re basically the same age.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 glenn_the_maitre_d Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny How old are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 glenn_the_maitre_d I’m 21. How old are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny Just shut up, Glen. Come on, let’s get out of here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter What? Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny Because I’m young. Let’s go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler Rajesh, it’s perfectly normal to have doubts after breaking up with someone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 raj_koothrappali You really think so?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Yeah, you know what’s not normal? Blubbering about emotions during a flag show. Unless that emotion is excitement over New Zealand changing their flag. Yeah, good luck, you crazy Kiwis, we’re rooting for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler Your friend is hurting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 raj_koothrappali No, Sheldon’s right. Emily did say I always talk about my feelings too much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon_cooper I suppose that could be a legitimate concern in a relationship. Uh, perhaps even a, a red flag. And speaking of red flags, check out this sexy number from the former Soviet Union. Hubba, hubba.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler Oh. Uh, we-we have another caller. Hi. You’re on Fun with Flags.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 barry_kripke Hewwo. I want to talk about how wonewy I am, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Kripke? Is that you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 barry_kripke Yeah, I’m just sitting here all by myself wondering if I’w ever find someone to share my wife with. Pwefewabwy Asian, 18-24, no fatties.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Please, all comments and questions should be flag-related.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 barry_kripke Aw wight. Is my pole fwag-wewated?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon_cooper I don’t see why not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 bernadette_rostenkowski He’s eating. That’s a good sign.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard_wolowitz You’re gonna have to wait one hour until you can go swimming again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 bernadette_rostenkowski He’s pretty cute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard_wolowitz He is. Should we name him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 bernadette_rostenkowski It is Valentine’s Day. How about Valentino?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Nice. A classic rabbit name. Peter Rabbit, Roger Rabbit. Valentino Wolowitz Rabbit. Oh, look at all that chest hair and overbite. Of course you’re a Wolowitz. Son of a bitch, he bit me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 bernadette_rostenkowski Are you okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard_wolowitz No, I’m not okay. Wild rabbits can have rabies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh. Well, why did you put your finger near its mouth?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Poor judgement, obviously.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 bernadette_rostenkowski He’s so little. I’m sure it’s fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard_wolowitz How can it be fine? I just got attacked by a clearly anti-Semitic wild animal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter It’s not what we planned, but this isn’t so bad, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny It is freaking amazing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Well, glad you’re feeling better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny I was just hungry and cranky, and I’ve never been called ma’am before.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Is that a big deal?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny Kind of. When was the first time someone called you sir?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Sixth grade, but I wore a sport coat and carried a briefcase, so…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny Can you believe when I met you I was 22? I mean, it’s crazy. Where did all that time go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Mm, you watched The Bachelor a lot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny Yeah, go ahead and make jokes, but your thirties are almost over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter No, they’re not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny You’re closer to 40 than you are 30.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Ha, ha. You married an old man. Tell you what. Let’s do something fun tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny Won’t make us any younger.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Well, maybe not, but some day we actually will be old, and we’ll look back on this night and remember what a good time we had.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny Okay, like what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter I know. Food fight. I’ll keep thinking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler Look, I know you both feel bad about being alone, but sometimes the best thing you can do is take a little time for yourself, especially when you just got out of a relationship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Speaking of ending relationships, when British Honduras became Belize, they designed a new flag with a tree on it, and I would like to hang myself from that tree.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 raj_koothrappali But, Amy, when you and Sheldon split up, didn’t you start dating someone right away?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler Well, I, I wouldn’t say right away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon_cooper And actually, it was three different men.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 barry_kripke Thwee diffewent men? Damn, girl, way to give the milk away?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, looks like we just lost Kripke.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 barry_kripke No, actuawwy, I’m stiw here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler Now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 barry_kripke Yup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler Now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 barry_kripke Yup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler Now? Oh, looks like we just lost Kripke.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Before Emily, I was alone for so long. I just, I don’t know if I can do that again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Well, you know, here is something that might cheer you up. The flag of the Isle of Man is nothing but three legs sharing a weird pair of underpants, so you think you got problems.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler I have an idea. Maybe someone in our audience would be interested in meeting Rajesh. Ladies, I can attest that he is a kind, handsome, intelligent…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 raj_koothrappali Rich parents, don’t forget, rich parents.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler …spoiled astrophysicist who not only… oh. Well, that was quick. Hi. You’re on Fun with Flags.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 barry_kripke Hey, I think I got cut off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler Hello, Kripke.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 barry_kripke I have a fwag question. How many men did you have sex with?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Let’s see. What’s young and fun? Uh, we could go dancing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Are you actually gonna dance?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Of course.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny Yeah. No one wants to see that. Hey, how about skinny dipping at the beach?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter No, I don’t need any fish nibbling my business.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny Oh, there’s a screening of Moulin Rouge, I heard the crowd sings along and stuff.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter That sounds fun. When’s it start?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny Midnight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Midnight. Really? You know what? Let’s do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny Okay, great. Oh, wait. Uh, it’s sold out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter Oh, thank God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard_wolowitz It says, rabies in rabbits is highly unlikely.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, terrific.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard_wolowitz It’s not terrific. Lots of highly unlikely things happen. You saw what’s under this robe, and you still married me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 bernadette_rostenkowski If you’re really worried, we’ll take him to the vet and have him tested.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard_wolowitz Good. Thank you. Oh, okay, there is a test. All they have to do is cut off his head and check his brain.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, cut off his head? That’s where his little nose is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard_wolowitz He’s not showing any symptoms. I guess I’ll just go to the emergency room to be safe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 bernadette_rostenkowski Howie, this is just your hypochondria.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 howard_wolowitz No, when I sat on the mute button and thought I’d gone deaf, that was my hypochondria.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 bernadette_rostenkowski We’ll find another time to tell him I’m pregnant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 raj_koothrappali I mean, this is the first time I’ve ever broken up with someone. I just, I didn’t realize it was gonna hurt this much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler It really can.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon_cooper All right. Nothing about this is fun. No one wants to talk about flags, and I haven’t spoken in over ten minutes, so, enjoy your new show, Internet. Dr. Amy Farrah Flower present with.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 raj_koothrappali I’m sorry for bothering you. I’ll hang up now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler No, hold on, Rajesh. You know, you’re not being very sympathetic. You know first hand that breakups are hard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Fine. If you insist on making me a part of this, yes, I knowledge how painful they can be. However, pain has an evolutionary purpose. It provides information from the environment that, uh, behaviour isn’t good for us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 barry_kripke Wike when I feww in wove with that stwipper and bought her a Pwius.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler I’m just gonna push all the buttons.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Raj, now, I’m sorry you’re suffering. When Amy and I were broken up, I also suffered. And this may sound surprising, but I’m grateful for having gone through it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Yes. I believe our relationship now is stronger than ever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler So do I.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon_cooper When, when we were apart, I learned how important you are to me. And I realize that when two people are in love, sometimes they…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter@penny Happy Valentine’s Day!
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter We are young and fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon_cooper I stand corrected. Fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Congratulations on a successful live show.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler And a lovely Valentine’s Day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 penny Cleaning up is not young and fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 leonard_hofstadter It can be. Confetti fight. Maybe you should take a break. I got this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon_cooper Did you know the singular of confetti is confetto?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 amy_farrah_fowler Interesting, and when would you use the singular?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode15 sheldon_cooper I’m glad you asked. Amy, you have a confetto in your nose. No, no, no, no. Other side. There you go.
