TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard Morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette Morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard We? What is this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette I don’t know. Maybe it says something on the back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard Continued on milk. If you’re tricking me into making my own breakfast, it didn’t work for my mom, and it won’t work for you. Are. We are. See spoons for more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette What could it be? We are Groot? We are the champions? We are family? I got all my sisters with me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard Are you serious?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard Are you sure?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette Pretty positive. That’s a joke, because the pregnancy test says…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard Oh, my God. This is incredible. We’re gonna be parents? We’re gonna get to board planes first. Finally gonna get to see what’s in that family bathroom at the mall.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette I know, it’s crazy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard It is crazy. Oh. I mean, how do you prepare for something like this? I’m not even sure I’ve held a baby before.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette Oh, it’s okay, you’ll figure it out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard But how’s this all gonna work? Do we get a nanny? I mean, can we afford a nanny? And if we can, we can’t get a pretty one, ’cause it’ll wreck our marriage. We can’t get an ugly one, ’cause it’ll scare the kid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette I don’t know, Howie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard Are we in a good school district? You’re Catholic, I’m Jewish. What religion do we raise it? And if it’s a boy, do we get him circumcised? People say it’s barbaric, but if we don’t, it looks like a pig in a blanket.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette Calm down, it’s gonna be okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard How’s it gonna be okay? Look at me, I’m a mess. And that means this baby’s gonna be half a mess. And that’s even before we screw it up with our cut-rate moderately attractive nanny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard Hey, Raj, I read a couple of guys in your department may have discovered a new planet in our solar system?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon Oh, I heard about that. Why didn’t you discover it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 raj Because instead of being in the telescope room, I was busy making you guys home made jam for the holidays.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon Well, you be sure to let us know when you win the Nobel Prize for boysenberry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 raj Hey, bud.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard Ready to play when you are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard Yeah, um, in a minute. I actually need to tell you guys something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 raj If it’s thank you for the home made jam you got in December, congratulations, you’re the first one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard I’m, uh, uh, gonna be a father.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard What? Congratulations.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 raj That’s so amazing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon Oh, no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard Why oh, no?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon Because this changes everything. What about comic book night? Uh, what about playing games together? What about our trips to Disneyland? How can we do those things with a child around?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard Relax, there’s room for two babies in this group.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon Oh, dear lord, Penny’s pregnant, too?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard You’re the other baby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon Oh, really? Okay, well, would a baby have to shave once every 11 days?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard Would an adult refuse to eat his graham crackers because one of them was broken?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon I guess we’ll call this a draw.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette So, I’m glad you guys are here. There’s something I want to share with you. Howie and I are going to…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny Leonard says you’re pregnant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 amy What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny Don’t say anything. act surprised when she tells you. All right, how you want to do this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette I’m pregnant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny Oh, my God, I can’t believe it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 amy This is so exciting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette Yeah, it’s all real exciting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny Are, are you not happy about this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette I am. Of-of course I am. I’m, I’m sure it’s just the hormones. But it’s weird, Howie’s the one who’s been talking about having kids for years, and I was all excited to tell him because I thought he’d be thrilled, but then he started to flip out and now this feels like a bad idea and I’m gonna get fat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny No, no, come on. Come on, you’re not gonna get fat. You’re gonna be beautiful and glowing and, and have the cutest little baby bump ever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette Easy for you to say, skinny bitch. Sorry, hormones.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny Oh, that’s all right. All I heard was skinny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 amy I wouldn’t make too much out of Howard not reacting the way you expected him to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny Yeah, I’m sure it was just the initial shock of it all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette You’re probably right. After we talked about it, he started to calm down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard I shouldn’t be raising a kid. I don’t even eat my own vegetables.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard Buddy, I, I think you might be overreacting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard And then there’s this nose. I mean, what if he looks like me? Or worse, what if she looks like me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon Not to mention the impact on our social circle. Everything’s going to change. Howard won’t be able to come over as much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 raj Well, he could bring the baby here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon Oh, but then we’d have to baby-proof the apartment. You know, my sister has one of those toilet locks in her bathroom. I have two doctorates, I still had to go in the sink.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard Oh, my God, and do you have any idea how expensive having a kid is?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 raj I read that in Los Angeles, raising a child through college can cost over a million dollars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard A million dollars? God, it’s like my nuts just kicked me in the nuts. That’s it, I got to start earning more money right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 raj I know, you could ask Bernadette for a raise in your allowance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard This isn’t a joke.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 raj I wasn’t joking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard It’ll be fine. People have kids every day. You’ll figure this out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 raj Yeah, come on, this is great news and you know it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard You’re right, it is, I’m just a little overwhelmed right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard Hey, you know what we should do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon All get vasectomies so this doesn’t happen to us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard Go out and celebrate. But not your worst idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 amy Hey, let’s go do something to get your mind off this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny Yeah, yeah, we should go out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette Where?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny Uh, I don’t know, a bar?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette Can’t drink.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny We can, but all right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 amy Are you hungry? How about that sushi place you love?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette Doctor said I can’t have sushi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny Okay, look, we don’t have to go anywhere. We can just, you know, stay here and hang out in the hot tub.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette Doctor said I can’t go in the hot tub.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 amy Maybe you should get a new doctor. What, he said you can’t laugh either?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 raj I’d like to propose a toast to our friend, Howard, his, um, his big heart, his beautiful soul…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard And his tight little pants that somehow did not make him sterile.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 all Cheers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard Well, look at this. I bet whoever invented tiny umbrellas doesn’t have to worry about money. He can have all the kids he wants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon And can keep a small portion of their heads dry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard If I’m gonna have any chance of raising this kid, I need to come up with a big idea to make some money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard There’s no reason you can’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard That’s easy for you to say. You and Sheldon already came up with your superfluid helium model.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard That’s just research. We’re never gonna make any money from it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon Forget helium. The real superfluid is the fruit punch in this mug. Reminds me of my daddy’s secret don’t tell mama juice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard Uh, these are strong, you should slow down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon Oh. I’ll just take one last sip. Ah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard Okay, how about this for an invention, slightly bigger cocktail umbrellas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard How is that a new invention?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard I don’t know, all Apple does is change the size of things and we keep buying them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 raj It’s true. I like my giant iPad and my little iPad almost as much as my regular-sized iPad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon This place is terrific. Why. why have we never been here before?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard The same reason we don’t do a lot of fun stuff. You.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon That’s some smart talk from a guy who can’t even keep his face in focus. Where’s the bathroom?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 raj Uh, it’s in the corner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon Excuse me. Hey, how you doin’?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 raj I hope the bathroom is clearly marked.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard Doesn’t matter. He’s headed for the kitchen anyway.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard Maybe that’s an idea, guidance systems for drunk people.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 raj They have that. It’s called Uber.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard Hey. In your supercooled helium experiments, did you create quantum vortices?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard Yeah. Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard Well, if you made a guidance system, couldn’t you use those vortices as a gyroscope?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard Wow. I’ve never thought about that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard And since it’s in a quantum state, it would maintain an infinite persistence.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 raj Groundbreaking revelations, tropical drinks. Tell me this isn’t like the best episode of Sex and the City.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard You may have actually just come up with something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard You think so?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard I really do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon You guys, the bathroom here is amazing. There’s people cooking in it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 amy Think about all the fun things you get to do when you have a baby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny Yeah, yeah, you get to buy toys and little clothes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette I kind of already do that for Howie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny And whenever you’re hungry, you’ll be in a minivan with Cheerios all over the floor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 amy Oh, and I just found a new travel cup for Sheldon. It only lets out three at a time. So, when did you guys decide to get pregnant?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette Well, we didn’t exactly decide. We were talking about it, and then one night we got a little reckless.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny Oh, tell us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 amy Yeah, tell us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette No, I’m embarrassed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny Oh, come on, we’re all grown-ups. We’ve all done it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 amy Me, me, me too. I’m a grown-up and I’ve done it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette Fine. We were out one night, and things got a little spontaneous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 amy Oh, that sounds juicy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette Well, Sheldon was going on and on about time zones and railroad schedules, and I went out…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny Wait, I remember that. Hang on. You did it at our place?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette Kind of on Sheldon’s bed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 amy What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette I was headed to the bathroom, and I passed Howie on his way out. Usually he says, do not go in there, but this time he said, hey, let’s go in here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 amy How could you do that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette I’m sorry, but you know what it’s like when you’re with your man and one thing leads to another.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 amy I do know what that’s like. I really do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard I’m not seeing anyone using liquid helium vortices like this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard I’m not finding anything either.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 raj It’s a good sign.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon Oh, wait, I found something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard Damn. What is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon This video. The baby panda sneezes, and the mama panda gets so scared.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard Can you focus on what we’re talking about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon All right. Look, now, this may be the rum talking, but as long as the unpinning rate of the vortices is kept within 1.1 and 1.3, the Magnus force issue should be negligible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 raj Even drunk, he’s still smarter than all of us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon And stronger. Who wants to see me beat up the bartender?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard I’d enjoy that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon Nah, she’s a good kid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard If this is a viable thing, we could get a patent and license it to companies that make guidance systems.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 raj Look at that. You’ve known you’re gonna be a father for less than a day and you’re already stepping up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard I’m telling you, you got this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard Maybe you’re right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon Of course he’s right. You and I both know how hard it is growing up without a father. That’s why I’m confident you’re gonna be the best dad you can be.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard Thank you, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon You’re welcome. And if he has twins, we can do all kinds of neat experiments on them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette You guys can go in if you want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny No, we’re a team. If you can’t go in, we’re not going in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 amy Then why are we drinking?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny Okay, it’s not like she’s got the Christ child in there, all right? Oh. It’s Leonard. He says Sheldon’s drunk and they’re gonna do karaoke if we want to join them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette That sounds fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 amy Oh, no. Sheldon’s drunk texting me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny What’s it say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 amy Would you like to sing karaoke with us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette How is that a drunk text?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 amy He used a period instead of a question mark. He’s so wasted.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 raj Your movie’s showing, so you’re going. Could care less about the five you’re blowing. Theatre gets dark just to start the show. You spot a fine woman sitting in your row, she’s dressed in yellow, she says hello, come sit next to me, you fine fellow. You run over there without a second to lose, and what comes next, hey, bust a move.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard You want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got it
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 raj Just bust a move,
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard You want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got it
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 raj Just bust a move,
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard You want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got it
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny Hey, guys. Congratulations.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 amy Hi. How are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon Wonderful. I’m being musically encouraged to bust a move. If I knew what that meant, I might just do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard I’m really glad you’re here. Can we talk?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny So, you gonna get up there later?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon A microphone, a room full of inaccurate depictions of Polynesian religion, and a captive audience to hear about it? You bet I am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard I’m sorry I freaked out this morning. I want you to know I’m done being scared.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette It’s okay to be nervous. I am, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard Thank God, ’cause I was lying, you might not have to wait nine months to see someone soil their pants. But I’m also really excited. I mean it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette Me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard I love you. Mmm. And I’m not just saying that because your breasts are gonna get bigger.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny Are we an item? Girl, quit playin’.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 amy We’re just friends, what are you sayin’?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny Say there’s another and look right in my eyes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 amy My first love broke my heart for the first time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 together And I was like, baby, baby, baby, ooh, like, baby, baby, baby, no, like, baby, baby, baby, ooh, I thought you’d always be mine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard Baby, I need your lovin’, got to have all your lovin’. Baby, I need your lovin’, got to have all your lovin’.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 raj Ooh, baby, baby, baby, baby. Ooh, baby, baby, baby, baby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard Ah, push it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette I appreciate this, but you really…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard Push it real good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrims’ pride, from every mountainside let freedom ring.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard I’d like to dedicate my last song of the evening to my wife, best friend, and now the mother of our child. I love you, Bernie. Havin’ my baby, what a lovely way of sayin’ how much you love me. Havin’ my baby, what a lovely way of sayin’ what you’re thinkin’ of me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon You’re kidding. What kind of maniacs have coitus in someone else’s bedroom?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard Thank you, Pasadena. Good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny That was such a fun night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard Probably ’cause you got to see your man up there rockin’ the mic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny Yeah, yeah. I was a little surprised when you decided to beat-box.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard Oh. That was really an asthma attack. I just sold it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny Well, I am so happy for Howard and Bernadette.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard Me, too. So, you ever think about it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny Babies? Well, I’m not in a rush but someday, yeah, sure. What about you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard I think we’d make amazing parents.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon Will you guys keep it down?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny On the other hand, we might lack a certain maturity.
