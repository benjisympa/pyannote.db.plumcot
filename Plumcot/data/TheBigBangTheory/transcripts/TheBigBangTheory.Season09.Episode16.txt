TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski Morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard_wolowitz We? What is this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t know. Maybe it says something on the back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Continued on milk. If you’re tricking me into making my own breakfast, it didn’t work for my mom, and it won’t work for you. Are. We are. See spoons for more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski What could it be? We are Groot? We are the champions? We are family? I got all my sisters with me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Are you serious?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Are you sure?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski Pretty positive. That’s a joke, because the pregnancy test says…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Oh, my God. This is incredible. We’re gonna be parents? We’re gonna get to board planes first. Finally gonna get to see what’s in that family bathroom at the mall.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski I know, it’s crazy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard_wolowitz It is crazy. Oh. I mean, how do you prepare for something like this? I’m not even sure I’ve held a baby before.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, it’s okay, you’ll figure it out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard_wolowitz But how’s this all gonna work? Do we get a nanny? I mean, can we afford a nanny? And if we can, we can’t get a pretty one, ’cause it’ll wreck our marriage. We can’t get an ugly one, ’cause it’ll scare the kid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t know, Howie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Are we in a good school district? You’re Catholic, I’m Jewish. What religion do we raise it? And if it’s a boy, do we get him circumcised? People say it’s barbaric, but if we don’t, it looks like a pig in a blanket.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski Calm down, it’s gonna be okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard_wolowitz How’s it gonna be okay? Look at me, I’m a mess. And that means this baby’s gonna be half a mess. And that’s even before we screw it up with our cut-rate moderately attractive nanny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Hey, Raj, I read a couple of guys in your department may have discovered a new planet in our solar system?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Oh, I heard about that. Why didn’t you discover it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 raj_koothrappali Because instead of being in the telescope room, I was busy making you guys home made jam for the holidays.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Well, you be sure to let us know when you win the Nobel Prize for boysenberry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 raj_koothrappali Hey, bud.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Ready to play when you are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Yeah, um, in a minute. I actually need to tell you guys something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 raj_koothrappali If it’s thank you for the home made jam you got in December, congratulations, you’re the first one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard_wolowitz I’m, uh, uh, gonna be a father.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter What? Congratulations.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 raj_koothrappali That’s so amazing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Oh, no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Why oh, no?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Because this changes everything. What about comic book night? Uh, what about playing games together? What about our trips to Disneyland? How can we do those things with a child around?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Relax, there’s room for two babies in this group.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Oh, dear lord, Penny’s pregnant, too?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter You’re the other baby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Oh, really? Okay, well, would a baby have to shave once every 11 days?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Would an adult refuse to eat his graham crackers because one of them was broken?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon_cooper I guess we’ll call this a draw.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski So, I’m glad you guys are here. There’s something I want to share with you. Howie and I are going to…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny Leonard says you’re pregnant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny Don’t say anything. act surprised when she tells you. All right, how you want to do this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski I’m pregnant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny Oh, my God, I can’t believe it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler This is so exciting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, it’s all real exciting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny Are, are you not happy about this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski I am. Of-of course I am. I’m, I’m sure it’s just the hormones. But it’s weird, Howie’s the one who’s been talking about having kids for years, and I was all excited to tell him because I thought he’d be thrilled, but then he started to flip out and now this feels like a bad idea and I’m gonna get fat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny No, no, come on. Come on, you’re not gonna get fat. You’re gonna be beautiful and glowing and, and have the cutest little baby bump ever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski Easy for you to say, skinny bitch. Sorry, hormones.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny Oh, that’s all right. All I heard was skinny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler I wouldn’t make too much out of Howard not reacting the way you expected him to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny Yeah, I’m sure it was just the initial shock of it all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski You’re probably right. After we talked about it, he started to calm down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard_wolowitz I shouldn’t be raising a kid. I don’t even eat my own vegetables.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Buddy, I, I think you might be overreacting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard_wolowitz And then there’s this nose. I mean, what if he looks like me? Or worse, what if she looks like me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Not to mention the impact on our social circle. Everything’s going to change. Howard won’t be able to come over as much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 raj_koothrappali Well, he could bring the baby here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Oh, but then we’d have to baby-proof the apartment. You know, my sister has one of those toilet locks in her bathroom. I have two doctorates, I still had to go in the sink.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Oh, my God, and do you have any idea how expensive having a kid is?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 raj_koothrappali I read that in Los Angeles, raising a child through college can cost over a million dollars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard_wolowitz A million dollars? God, it’s like my nuts just kicked me in the nuts. That’s it, I got to start earning more money right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 raj_koothrappali I know, you could ask Bernadette for a raise in your allowance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard_wolowitz This isn’t a joke.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 raj_koothrappali I wasn’t joking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter It’ll be fine. People have kids every day. You’ll figure this out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 raj_koothrappali Yeah, come on, this is great news and you know it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard_wolowitz You’re right, it is, I’m just a little overwhelmed right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Hey, you know what we should do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon_cooper All get vasectomies so this doesn’t happen to us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Go out and celebrate. But not your worst idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler Hey, let’s go do something to get your mind off this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny Yeah, yeah, we should go out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski Where?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny Uh, I don’t know, a bar?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski Can’t drink.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny We can, but all right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler Are you hungry? How about that sushi place you love?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski Doctor said I can’t have sushi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny Okay, look, we don’t have to go anywhere. We can just, you know, stay here and hang out in the hot tub.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski Doctor said I can’t go in the hot tub.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler Maybe you should get a new doctor. What, he said you can’t laugh either?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 raj_koothrappali I’d like to propose a toast to our friend, Howard, his, um, his big heart, his beautiful soul…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter And his tight little pants that somehow did not make him sterile.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 all@ Cheers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Well, look at this. I bet whoever invented tiny umbrellas doesn’t have to worry about money. He can have all the kids he wants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon_cooper And can keep a small portion of their heads dry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard_wolowitz If I’m gonna have any chance of raising this kid, I need to come up with a big idea to make some money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter There’s no reason you can’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard_wolowitz That’s easy for you to say. You and Sheldon already came up with your superfluid helium model.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter That’s just research. We’re never gonna make any money from it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Forget helium. The real superfluid is the fruit punch in this mug. Reminds me of my daddy’s secret don’t tell mama juice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Uh, these are strong, you should slow down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Oh. I’ll just take one last sip. Ah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Okay, how about this for an invention, slightly bigger cocktail umbrellas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter How is that a new invention?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard_wolowitz I don’t know, all Apple does is change the size of things and we keep buying them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 raj_koothrappali It’s true. I like my giant iPad and my little iPad almost as much as my regular-sized iPad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon_cooper This place is terrific. Why. why have we never been here before?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter The same reason we don’t do a lot of fun stuff. You.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon_cooper That’s some smart talk from a guy who can’t even keep his face in focus. Where’s the bathroom?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 raj_koothrappali Uh, it’s in the corner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Excuse me. Hey, how you doin’?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 raj_koothrappali I hope the bathroom is clearly marked.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Doesn’t matter. He’s headed for the kitchen anyway.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Maybe that’s an idea, guidance systems for drunk people.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 raj_koothrappali They have that. It’s called Uber.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Hey. In your supercooled helium experiments, did you create quantum vortices?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Yeah. Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Well, if you made a guidance system, couldn’t you use those vortices as a gyroscope?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Wow. I’ve never thought about that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard_wolowitz And since it’s in a quantum state, it would maintain an infinite persistence.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 raj_koothrappali Groundbreaking revelations, tropical drinks. Tell me this isn’t like the best episode of Sex and the City.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter You may have actually just come up with something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard_wolowitz You think so?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter I really do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon_cooper You guys, the bathroom here is amazing. There’s people cooking in it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler Think about all the fun things you get to do when you have a baby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny Yeah, yeah, you get to buy toys and little clothes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski I kind of already do that for Howie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny And whenever you’re hungry, you’ll be in a minivan with Cheerios all over the floor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, and I just found a new travel cup for Sheldon. It only lets out three at a time. So, when did you guys decide to get pregnant?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski Well, we didn’t exactly decide. We were talking about it, and then one night we got a little reckless.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny Oh, tell us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler Yeah, tell us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski No, I’m embarrassed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny Oh, come on, we’re all grown-ups. We’ve all done it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler Me, me, me too. I’m a grown-up and I’ve done it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski Fine. We were out one night, and things got a little spontaneous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, that sounds juicy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski Well, Sheldon was going on and on about time zones and railroad schedules, and I went out…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny Wait, I remember that. Hang on. You did it at our place?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski Kind of on Sheldon’s bed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski I was headed to the bathroom, and I passed Howie on his way out. Usually he says, do not go in there, but this time he said, hey, let’s go in here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler How could you do that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski I’m sorry, but you know what it’s like when you’re with your man and one thing leads to another.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler I do know what that’s like. I really do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter I’m not seeing anyone using liquid helium vortices like this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard_wolowitz I’m not finding anything either.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 raj_koothrappali It’s a good sign.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Oh, wait, I found something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Damn. What is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon_cooper This video. The baby panda sneezes, and the mama panda gets so scared.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Can you focus on what we’re talking about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon_cooper All right. Look, now, this may be the rum talking, but as long as the unpinning rate of the vortices is kept within 1.1 and 1.3, the Magnus force issue should be negligible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 raj_koothrappali Even drunk, he’s still smarter than all of us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon_cooper And stronger. Who wants to see me beat up the bartender?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter I’d enjoy that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Nah, she’s a good kid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard_wolowitz If this is a viable thing, we could get a patent and license it to companies that make guidance systems.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 raj_koothrappali Look at that. You’ve known you’re gonna be a father for less than a day and you’re already stepping up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter I’m telling you, you got this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Maybe you’re right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Of course he’s right. You and I both know how hard it is growing up without a father. That’s why I’m confident you’re gonna be the best dad you can be.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Thank you, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon_cooper You’re welcome. And if he has twins, we can do all kinds of neat experiments on them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski You guys can go in if you want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny No, we’re a team. If you can’t go in, we’re not going in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler Then why are we drinking?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny Okay, it’s not like she’s got the Christ child in there, all right? Oh. It’s Leonard. He says Sheldon’s drunk and they’re gonna do karaoke if we want to join them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski That sounds fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, no. Sheldon’s drunk texting me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny What’s it say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler Would you like to sing karaoke with us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski How is that a drunk text?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler He used a period instead of a question mark. He’s so wasted.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 raj_koothrappali Your movie’s showing, so you’re going. Could care less about the five you’re blowing. Theatre gets dark just to start the show. You spot a fine woman sitting in your row, she’s dressed in yellow, she says hello, come sit next to me, you fine fellow. You run over there without a second to lose, and what comes next, hey, bust a move.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter You want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got it
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 raj_koothrappali Just bust a move,
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter You want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got it
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 raj_koothrappali Just bust a move,
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter You want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got it
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny Hey, guys. Congratulations.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler Hi. How are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Wonderful. I’m being musically encouraged to bust a move. If I knew what that meant, I might just do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard_wolowitz I’m really glad you’re here. Can we talk?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny So, you gonna get up there later?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon_cooper A microphone, a room full of inaccurate depictions of Polynesian religion, and a captive audience to hear about it? You bet I am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard_wolowitz I’m sorry I freaked out this morning. I want you to know I’m done being scared.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski It’s okay to be nervous. I am, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Thank God, ’cause I was lying, you might not have to wait nine months to see someone soil their pants. But I’m also really excited. I mean it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski Me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard_wolowitz I love you. Mmm. And I’m not just saying that because your breasts are gonna get bigger.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny Are we an item? Girl, quit playin’.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler We’re just friends, what are you sayin’?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny Say there’s another and look right in my eyes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 amy_farrah_fowler My first love broke my heart for the first time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 together#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 And I was like, baby, baby, baby, ooh, like, baby, baby, baby, no, like, baby, baby, baby, ooh, I thought you’d always be mine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Baby, I need your lovin’, got to have all your lovin’. Baby, I need your lovin’, got to have all your lovin’.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 raj_koothrappali Ooh, baby, baby, baby, baby. Ooh, baby, baby, baby, baby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Ah, push it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 bernadette_rostenkowski I appreciate this, but you really…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Push it real good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrims’ pride, from every mountainside let freedom ring.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard_wolowitz I’d like to dedicate my last song of the evening to my wife, best friend, and now the mother of our child. I love you, Bernie. Havin’ my baby, what a lovely way of sayin’ how much you love me. Havin’ my baby, what a lovely way of sayin’ what you’re thinkin’ of me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon_cooper You’re kidding. What kind of maniacs have coitus in someone else’s bedroom?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 howard_wolowitz Thank you, Pasadena. Good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny That was such a fun night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Probably ’cause you got to see your man up there rockin’ the mic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny Yeah, yeah. I was a little surprised when you decided to beat-box.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Oh. That was really an asthma attack. I just sold it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny Well, I am so happy for Howard and Bernadette.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter Me, too. So, you ever think about it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny Babies? Well, I’m not in a rush but someday, yeah, sure. What about you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 leonard_hofstadter I think we’d make amazing parents.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 sheldon_cooper Will you guys keep it down?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode16 penny On the other hand, we might lack a certain maturity.
