TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler So Sheldon, there’s something I’ve been wanting to talk about but I know it’s kind of a touchy subject.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Way to narrow it down to everything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 sheldon_cooper What is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Well, your birthday’s coming up, and you’ve never let us celebrate it, and I was hoping maybe this year we could.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Oh, I suppose that’s a discussion we could have.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Okay, great, I mean, it doesn’t have to be a big party or anything. I was just, where’d he go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 penny W, wait a minute. You mention his birthday and he vanishes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Well, where’s that information been this whole time?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 penny Well, where is he?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter I’ll check his room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Surprise.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 penny Oh, my God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Just one example of how birthdays can be terrible. Now, can we please drop this subject and pick a new one? I suggest how thick can a soup get before it becomes a stew? You know, the answer, it may surprise you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler I’m sorry I brought it up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 penny Yeah, what is the problem? Is it about getting older?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Please, look at this porcelain skin. I’m like a human sink.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler But it’s the one day a year that’s just all about you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter One day. Right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Can you please just tell me why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Fine. As you know, I have a twin sister with whom I obviously share a birthday. Every year we’d have a party. No one I invited would ever come, because they didn’t like me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler I’m sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Oh, that part wasn’t so bad. I didn’t like them, either. But then I’d inevitably spend the whole day being tortured by my sister’s friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 penny Oh, poor thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 sheldon_cooper When I was six, they told me Batman was coming to my party. I waited by the door for hours. Closest thing to Batman I saw was when a robin flew into the window.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler You realize none of those things would happen now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 sheldon_cooper I do, but why do you care if I celebrate my birthday at all?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Well, you made my last birthday so memorable, I wanted to return the favour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 penny You know, if you had a party now, you have plenty of friends that would love to come.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter And we live here, so we have no choice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 penny Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Very well. You may celebrate my life by throwing a party with cake, presents and a shower of admiration and love. But then you owe me big-time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 howard_wolowitz You have any idea what you’re getting Sheldon for his birthday?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 raj_koothrappali He’s been fascinated with dinosaurs lately. Maybe we could get him a fossil.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Well, just don’t get anything Jurassic. He feels like that whole chunk of time has gone Hollywood. Hey, uh, you know, he told a sad story about how his sister tricked him into thinking Batman was coming to his party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 howard_wolowitz That’s funny. Let’s do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Maybe we could get Batman to actually show up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 raj_koothrappali You mean, some guy in a lame suit?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Or a real Batman. Hey, Stuart? Didn’t you try to get Adam West to do a signing here once?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 stuart_bloom Yeah, but there was kind of a scheduling conflict. He, uh, wanted to know when he’d get paid. And I wouldn’t tell him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Can I get his contact info?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 stuart_bloom Sure, uh, but just so you know, he’s kind of a diva.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter He is?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 stuart_bloom Oh, yeah. Won’t take the bus. He won’t pack his own lunch. Won’t let you spend the night on his couch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Okay, so how do you feel about party balloons?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Uh, Mylar balloons, yes. Latex balloons, no. Water balloons, I will jump off the roof and aim for your car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 penny All right, what about music?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 sheldon_cooper I enjoy marching bands and Tibetan throat singing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 penny No music it is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 bernadette_rostenkowski What kind of cake do you like?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Well, my favourite is chocolate with strawberry frosting, three layers, and if there’s writing on it, make sure it’s not all caps. I don’t need my dessert yelling at me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Hey, so what was Adam West like on the phone?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Uh, nice guy. But it was a little weird to hear Batman say don’t ring the doorbell or my poodles will go crazy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 raj_koothrappali You know, Adam West is my favourite Batman? Well, after Michael Keaton, Christian Bale and Batman from The Lego Movie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Don’t say that to him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 raj_koothrappali What? He beat out George Clooney, and that’s something. Like, I love me some Clooney.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Don’t say that to anyone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 penny Thank you so much for helping us, Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 stuart_bloom Oh, I, I was just glad to be invited. To be honest, I don’t always feel like I’m part of the group.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 penny Okay, sweetie, we’re on the clock here. Can you hate yourself and frost at the same time?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 barry_kripke Hewwo, I hope I’m not too earwy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 bernadette_rostenkowski No, no, no. Come on in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 barry_kripke And how is the wadiant mommy-to-be?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 bernadette_rostenkowski Doing great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 stuart_bloom You, you’re pregnant?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 stuart_bloom Sounds like something a member of the group might know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 penny Yeah, birthday party first. Pity party later.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Are you crazy? How can you put Michael Keaton in front of Christian Bale?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 adam_west Oh, please. Even my poodles know Bale’s overrated.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Thank you. That’s why I say Keaton’s number one. He brought a sense of humour to the role.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 adam_west Oh, if you’re gonna factor in a sense of humour, then I should be at the top of the list. It should be me, Keaton, Kilmer, Lego, Bale, and that pretty boy Clooney.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Really? You’re ahead of Bale? The man who personified the words, I’m Batman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 adam_west I never had to say I’m Batman. I showed up, people knew I was Batman. Everywhere I went, on the TV show, mall openings, Julie Newmar’s bungalow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter I’m sold, you’re ahead of Bale.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 adam_west There’s another reason I should be higher on the list. All those other guys had muscles built into their costumes. All I had in my Batsuit was 100%, grade-A West.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Can we just all agree we’re worried about Affleck?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Yeah, of course.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 adam_west What’s an Affleck?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Is there a reason I had to leave my own apartment?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Well, I think they just want you to see it for the first time all decorated.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 sheldon_cooper But who’s gonna tell them they’re doing it wrong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Well, I’m, I’m sure they’ll ask you to give a speech, and that’s when you just tear ’em a new one. Have to say, you, you do look good in that suit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Oh. Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Maybe later I’ll, uh, get to see you in your birthday suit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 sheldon_cooper But this is my birthday suit. Are you having a stroke? Because that’s the kind of thing that just ruins a birthday party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter So, Mother, I’m surprised you came all this way for Sheldon’s birthday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 dr_beverly_hofstadter Oh, I was happy to. He did come to my 60th.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Oh. You had a party for your 60th?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 dr_beverly_hofstadter Oh, I wouldn’t call it a party. Just a few close friends. And your sister and brother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 penny You know, to be fair, we did get married in Vegas and didn’t invite her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 dr_beverly_hofstadter And I never did thank you for that, dear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Oh. Penny says everyone’s there. Are you ready?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 sheldon_cooper I am. Oh. Wait.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Are you all right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 sheldon_cooper No, I just, I got a little light-headed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, do you need a minute?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 sheldon_cooper No. No, if I can walk past that pet shop with the parrot in the window, I suppose I can do this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 all@ Happy birthday!
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Speech! Speech!
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 raj_koothrappali Come on, Sheldon, say something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Uh, um, uh, thank you all so much for coming. Beverly. Wil Wheaton. Adam West, for some reason.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Batman finally came to your party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 adam_west Happy birthday, Sherman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Thank you. This is all so thoughtful. Excuse me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 adam_west I still get paid, don’t I?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Okay, I’d better go in there and talk to him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Well, don’t you think I’m the one who should go in?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter No offence, but I’ve known the guy a really long time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Well, I’ve, you know, seen him without pants on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Again, no offence, but so have I.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Well, he’s seen me without pants on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Again, no…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 penny Okay, this is ridiculous. Sheldon? Can I come in?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 sheldon_cooper How do you know I’m not using the facilities?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 penny Because you e-mail me your bathroom schedule once a week, even though I’ve clicked unsubscribe, like, a thousand times. So, what’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 sheldon_cooper I don’t know. I looked around the room, and I saw all the faces and the presents, and it, it was just too much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 penny I get that. Hey, you want to just bring a few people in here? You know, Wil Wheaton in the bathtub, Batman on the toilet. It’ll be like the weirdest Comic-Con ever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 sheldon_cooper I know that you worked hard to put this together. I’m sorry I’m ruining it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 penny Oh, pl, you’re not ruining it. Look, at some point, Raj will try to get everyone to do the Electric Slide. Now, that will ruin it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 sheldon_cooper I don’t think I can go back out there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 penny That’s fine. You know, I hate that your sister and her friends used to torture you. But what I hate even more is, if I was there, I would have tortured you, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Based on this pep talk, I’d say you’re still doing it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 penny My point is, there was a time I never would’ve been friends with someone like you, and now you are one of my favourite people. So, if what you need is to spend your birthday in a bathroom, I’m happy to do it with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Well, everyone will think I’m weird.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 penny Sweetie, you are weird. Everyone knows you’re weird, but they’re all still here because they care about you so much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 barry_kripke Hewwo. Some of us need to check our hair because we might have a shot with Weonard’s mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 leslie_winkle Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 leslie_winkle It’s been a while.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Leslie. I can’t remember the last time we talked. So much has changed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 leslie_winkle Has it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, uh, um, Penny and I got married.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 leslie_winkle Wow, congratulations. You know, actually, I thought you’d be living with Sheldon forever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, well, don’t be a stranger.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 penny Okay, everybody, Sheldon is gonna come back out, but I think he’s a little embarrassed, so let’s all be extra nice, okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 barry_kripke What are you wooking at me for? I’m a saint. But a sinner in the sack.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Hello, everyone. I, I’d like to apologize for my behaviour. I hope it hasn’t put a damper on the party. So, please, enjoy yourselves. Oh, this is quickly getting out of hand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler If I may, I, I’d like to propose a toast. Um, thank you all for coming tonight. I know it’s customary for the birthday boy to receive presents, but I feel like I got the greatest gift the day he was born.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Aw, Amy, that was lovely. You know, this is fun. Let’s do more. Someone else say something wonderful about me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Sheldon, I don’t think everyone…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Wolowitz, perfect. Everyone listen to Wolowitz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 howard_wolowitz Okay, then, uh, Sheldon, we’ve known each other a long time. And it is a pleasure to work with you and call you my friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Little generic. Keep thinking. We’ll circle back. Wil Wheaton, go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 wil_wheaton Sheldon, I know that we’ve had our ups and downs, but I can honestly say that my life is so much more interesting because you are in it. We may have met because you are a fan of Star Trek. But I have become a fan of Sheldon Cooper. Live long and prosper, buddy. And happy birthday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 sheldon_cooper That’s how you do it, Wolowitz. Now you see why he’s famous and you’re not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 dr_beverly_hofstadter Sheldon, I know the future holds great things for you, and we all can’t wait to see what they are. Happy birthday, dear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 barry_kripke Someone caw Animal Contwol. There’s a cougar on the woose.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 dr_beverly_hofstadter Barry, stop.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Seriously, Barry, stop.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 raj_koothrappali And it was Gandhi who said, live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 sheldon_cooper And it was Sheldon Cooper who said let’s speed this up. A lot of people want to talk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 leslie_winkle Uh, in the past, I would’ve said something obnoxious, like, happy birthday, dumbass. But I’m not gonna do it. You and I have both grown a lot, and it’s just so nice to see you all again. So, happy birthday, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Oh. Oh, now, you know I hate change. Say it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 leslie_winkle Happy birthday, dumbass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 adam_west Happy birthday, young man. And if any of you have enjoyed seeing me here today, I’m also available for Comic-Cons, bachelor parties, bar mitzvahs…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 bernadette_rostenkowski I can’t think of anything to say that hasn’t already been said, so, here’s to you, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Thank you, Bernadette. That was perfect.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 howard_wolowitz What? You gotta be kidding me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, we’ve been together so long, it’s hard to remember a time you weren’t in my life. And believe me, I try. You make me laugh. You make me a better scientist. You make me crazy. You’re more than just my roommate, you’re my brother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Happy birthday, buddy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Thank you. That, that was wonderful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 penny Oh, wait, wait, wait. Stuart didn’t get to speak.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 stuart_bloom Oh, oh, okay. Um, uh, Sheldon, I’ve spent most of my life feeling invisible, but having you and everyone…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler Hey, everybody, listen up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 penny You nailed it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 amy_farrah_fowler We’ve got someone who couldn’t be here but really wanted to wish you a happy birthday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 stephen_hawking Hello, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Professor Hawking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 stephen_hawking Happy birthday to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Thank you so much. I can’t believe you’re…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 stephen_hawking Happy birthday to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 sheldon_cooper Oh, you’re singing. Well, I’m sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 stephen_hawking Happy birthday, dear Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Uh, Professor Hawking, if you just give us one second, we’ll light the candles, and we can all sing together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 stephen_hawking I was crushing it, but all right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 penny Okay, while they get the cake, Sheldon, I just want to say, I hope you didn’t think you were gonna get through tonight without a hug.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 sheldon_cooper You know, I used to hate these hugs. Now they’re just extremely irritating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 leonard_hofstadter Ready when you are, Professor Hawking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 stephen_hawking And a one, and a two…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 all@ Happy birthday to you,
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode17 adam_west So, who’s taking me home?
