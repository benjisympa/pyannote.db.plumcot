TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 howard Okay, I gotta ask, why are you wearing a bow tie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 sheldon I’ve never applied for a patent before. I wanted to make a good impression.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 howard Is the impression that your first name is Pee-Wee?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 sheldon Yeah, well, you’re an engineer. End of joke, burn.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 attorney Come on in, fellas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 howard See, he’s not wearing a tie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 leonard Well, he’s a patent attorney. Maybe his tie is pending.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 attorney So, I’ve reviewed your paperwork, and it seems like we’ve got everything we need to file a patent for your infinite persistence gyroscope.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 sheldon That’s great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 howard Excellent.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 leonard So what happens next?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 attorney Well, the legal team needs to review existing patents to avoid overlap.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 howard Oh, I don’t think there will be.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 leonard Yeah, we did our own search.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 attorney That’s nice, but I think ours might be a bit more thorough.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 sheldon Get a load of this guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 howard Can you imagine if we make money with this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 leonard If we do, I am splurging on the best sinus irrigator money can buy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 howard That old sad story, guy gets a little money, goes straight up his nose.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 attorney Just need you to review and sign this document acknowledging that you understand the university will own 75% of the patent.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 howard Seventy-five percent?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 sheldon That’s outrageous. This is our idea based on our research. How can you possibly justify owning a majority share?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 attorney It’s university policy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 sheldon I know when I’m beat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 leonard Hold on, hold on. So the three of us do all the work and only end up with 25%?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 attorney Dr. Hofstadter, this university has been paying your salaries for over ten years. Did you think we do that out of the goodness of our hearts?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 leonard Well, until you just said that mean thing, kinda.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 attorney And as far as Mr. Wolowitz is concerned, I’m afraid as a federal employee on loan from NASA, your name can be on the patent, but you’re not entitled to an ownership share.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 howard Wait, so this can turn out to be a financial success, and I get nothing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 attorney Well, sometimes they give you a plaque.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 sheldon Well, that’s not fair. We should all get plaques.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 leonard Sorry, but we can’t sign this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 howard Come on, let’s go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 leonard Thank you for your time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 sheldon Couple of questions about the plaque.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 amy So, have you been having any morning sickness?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 bernadette A little. And it doesn’t help that I’ve got this heightened sense of smell.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 penny Is that a pregnancy thing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 bernadette Yeah. The other day I sniffed out where Howie hid the Girl Scout cookies. No more Tagalongs, my ass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 penny But now you’ll be able to make your own milk to eat the cookies with.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 raj Hey, guys. Hey, Penny. I really appreciate you helping me with this. I don’t know what to do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 penny Oh, sure. Let me see it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 amy See what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 raj I hadn’t spoken to Emily since I broke up with her, and she left this on my doorstep with a note.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 penny Raj, I got you this before we split up, but couldn’t return it and thought you’d like to have it. Happy belated Valentine’s Day, Emily.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 bernadette That’s nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 penny Nice, or is she trying to manipulate him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 raj I know. I mean, do I open it? Do I return it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 amy Why wouldn’t you open it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 raj Well, she was pretty mad. For all I know it’s a voodoo doll of me with a fork stuck in my junk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 bernadette You don’t think she’d actually send you something gross or dangerous, do you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 penny I know one way to find out. Sniff this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 amy She’s pregnant, she’s not a bloodhound.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 bernadette Although I am getting a little machine oil. I think it’s metal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 penny Come on, just open it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 raj You know, on Game of Thrones, Balon Greyjoy received his son’s genitals in a box.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 penny Well, never hurts to have a spare.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 bernadette What is that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 raj Wow. It’s an antique sextant. Sailors used these to find their position by the stars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 amy What a nice gift for an astrophysicist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 raj I know, she’s so thoughtful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 penny See, she’s trying to get you back. Now, that is exactly what I would’ve gotten you if I had any idea what it is or what you do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 raj You know, I have too much self-esteem to let this girl guilt me into getting back together with her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 amy You don’t need to be pregnant to smell that load of crap.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 leonard Well, what if we go around the university and just get the patent ourselves?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 howard We can’t. It says on their Web site, as long as we work there, they have a controlling ownership of anything we come up with.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 sheldon Great, so they own my idea for a T-shirt that says Dumb as a Bag of Geologists.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 leonard Well, our choices are we do this with the university or we don’t do it at all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 howard Either way, I get nothing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 leonard Or, if we ended up making money from this, Sheldon and I could split our shares with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 sheldon To be clear, Leonard is referring to the gyroscope, not the T-shirt and mugs. Oh, now they own the mugs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 howard I guess that is a way around this. You guys would be cool doing it like that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 leonard Of course, we can split any profits three ways.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 sheldon I’m fine with that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 howard Okay, great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 sheldon It sounds like a, uh, contract might be in order.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 leonard Sure, we could write something up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 sheldon But which one of us should be the party who…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 howard You can do it, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 sheldon So stipulated.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 leonard Once I found a stash of contracts under his bed. It was weird.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 bernadette I wonder how much she spent on this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 amy Ooh, let’s find out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 raj It doesn’t matter. It’s the thought that counts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 penny Yeah, yeah, and beauty’s on the inside, size doesn’t matter, how much she spend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 raj Seriously, guys, I don’t want to know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 amy Oh, my.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 raj Oh, come on, you can’t say oh my, and then not tell me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 amy These things go for five hundred dollars and up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 bernadette Damn. All I got for Valentine’s Day was a postcard saying my Vermont Teddy Bear was back-ordered.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 penny Okay, so, she drops off a five hundred dollar gift and she’s not trying to get back together with you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 raj Maybe you’re right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 bernadette Or she’s telling the truth and just being nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 raj Maybe you’re right. Wow, I am easy to manipulate. Oh, guys, it’s Emily. What should I do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 penny Okay, answer it. Just be strong. And if she starts to cry, don’t make any promises. And most importantly, put it on speaker so we can hear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 raj Hello?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 emily Hey, it’s Emily. Is this a good time?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 raj Yeah, yeah. Sure. What’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 emily Was it okay I left that gift? I’m really hoping we can be friends.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 raj Maybe, maybe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 emily Um, you think you’d want to grab a cup of coffee? Hello?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 raj I’m sorry, I seem to be taking an annoying amount of time deciding how I feel about this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 emily I just, I miss hanging out with you. It’s not like I lost a friend, it’s like I lost my best friend. Is there any chance you’d want to come over?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 raj I’m sorry, I don’t think that’s a good idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 emily Okay. I’m just, I’m having a really hard time, but that’s not your problem, that’s mine. I, I won’t bother you again, but please know that you’ll always have a place in my heart. Bye, Raj. You’re a good guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 raj Good-bye, Emily. That was rough, you guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 penny I know, but you did it. I’m so proud of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 raj Well, anyway, I’ll leave you to your girls’ night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 amy Are you sure you don’t want to stay here with us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 raj No, I kind of feel like being alone right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 bernadette Well, if you change your mind, we’ll be here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 raj Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 penny Say hi to Emily for us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 raj Will do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 howard This contract looks good to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 sheldon I’ll say it looks good. It’s in my proprietary font, Shelvetica.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 leonard I want to say something obnoxious, but it is easy on the eyes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 bernadette I’m a little tired, Howie. You ready to go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 howard Yeah, one sec. I just need to sign this contract.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 bernadette What is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 howard Well, we ran into a problem about my share of the patent, so we’re forming a partnership to split anything we make equally.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 penny Sheldon, did you draft the contract?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 sheldon You bet I did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 penny Ooh. You’re gonna make out so hard tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 bernadette So, you’re just gonna sign this without having a lawyer look at it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 sheldon Excuse me. I’ve been drafting contracts since kindergarten. Didn’t need a lawyer to get me out of finger painting. Don’t need one now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 bernadette I know, but…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 howard Bernie, the guys were nice enough to find a way to keep me from being cut out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 bernadette Well, I should hope so. The whole thing was your idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 amy Well, to be fair, Howard’s idea was based on Sheldon’s math.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 leonard Guys, everyone is involved in thios, okay? Howard’s invention, Sheldon’s math, my original theory that space-time was like a supercooled liquid. Which I’m sure Penny would’ve mentioned if she wasn’t working on that hangnail right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 howard Honey, this is fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 bernadette If you want to sign a contract that Sheldon whipped up, go ahead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 howard Can I talk to you in the hall?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 bernadette Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 howard Excuse us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 sheldon Hey, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 sheldon If she doesn’t think that we should apply for this patent, she’s being patently absurd.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 leonard Good one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 sheldon Okay, you got it. See, I was afraid it was a thinker.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 howard What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 bernadette I just want to make sure you’ve thought this through.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 howard What’s to think about? We have an invention and want to move forward.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 bernadette Howie, you’re about to form a legal partnership with Sheldon Cooper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 howard All right, if you’re gonna calmly make excellent points, then I don’t know if I want to talk to you. Okay. I get it. And it’s sweet that you’re worried about me, but I can take care of myself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 bernadette I’m not worried about you. I’m worried about me. I don’t want to go through this pregnancy listening to you complain about Sheldon driving you crazy more than you already do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 howard Here we go with the ironclad logic again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 bernadette You’ve tried to work with him before. It hasn’t gone well. Why is this time gonna be any different?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 howard Is the foetus helping you? ‘Cause that’s cheating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 raj Hello?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 claire Hey, Raj. It’s Claire. How are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 raj Hi. I’m good. Really good. Well, I don’t know why I said really good. I’m just regular good. I really just wanted to sound confident. And that really was a real really, not a fake really like the first really.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 claire Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 raj I don’t know. I lost track and I missed my exit. So, uh, so what’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 claire Well, last time we talked, I had just gotten back together with my boyfriend, and I wanted to let you know that things didn’t work out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 raj Really? I’m sorry. I swear I know other words.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 claire So if you were still interested.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 raj Yes. Indeed. Absolutely. Indubitably. I’m not even sure what the last one means, but it’s another word, and I know it. So, uh, when do you want to meet up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 claire Uh, I’m almost off work. What are you doing now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 raj Right now, well, well, actually, to, to be completely honest, I’m stopping by to see my ex-girlfriend because she’s having a tough time. But it’s not like we’re getting back together or anything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 claire Let me guess, the worst part about breaking up is that she doesn’t have her best friend to talk to any more?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 raj That’s exactly what she said. How do you know that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 claire I’m a girl. It’s, like, page one out of the playbook.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 raj Any chance you could send me a PDF of that playbook?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 leonard They’ve been out there a while.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 amy I hope everything’s okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 sheldon I wonder what they’re talking about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 penny If you guys would shut up, I could tell you. Oh. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 howard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 sheldon Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 leonard You guys all right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 howard Yeah. But, um, we were talking, and I’m a little concerned about the three of us forming a partnership.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 sheldon Are you suggesting a limited liability corporation? ‘Cause I did not L-L-see that coming.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 howard Sheldon, my concern is not with the money or anything. It’s, it’s with how you treat me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 sheldon Well, I believe I’m treating you generously. That’s why I’ve stipulated in the contract that your contributions to our invention are as valuable as my own.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 bernadette Are you saying that his contributions aren’t as valuable as yours?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 sheldon No, I am not saying that, because I kept saying that this morning and Leonard said stop saying that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 howard See? This is what happens every time we work together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 penny You know what, hang on. What if Sheldon had no choice but to be respectful?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 leonard What? Is there a switch on the back of his neck we don’t know about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 penny No. What I’m saying is you could add a clause to the contract that he can’t make fun of Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 bernadette How would you enforce it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 sheldon Oh, please. Any contract I sign is enforced by my own personal code of ethics.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 amy And his obsessive-compulsive disorder.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 sheldon Yeah, that, too. And scoot over. Part of your shadow’s on my spot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 leonard Howard, what do you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 howard I’m on board.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 sheldon I’ll add it right now. Oh, baby, it’s addendum time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 emily Hello?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 raj Hey, Emily, listen, I’ve been thinking, and I’m not sure it’s a good idea that I come over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 emily Oh. Okay. I understand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 raj No, no. Please don’t cry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 emily Okay, I’ll stop.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 claire Hello?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 raj Hey, so, listen, Claire, change of plans…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 claire Fine. Do what you want, but she’s playing you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 raj I don’t think so. She sounded pretty upset.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 claire You mean like, I was just really looking forward to seeing you. I’m having such a rough day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 raj Emily, listen, I’m sorry, but I can’t come by.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 emily Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 raj I think we both know if I come over, we’re gonna get back together and…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 emily I told you I needed a friend. What do you think is happening here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 raj Call you right back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 sheldon The, the revisions I made start on page four.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 penny Wow. That is a lot of whereupons.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 amy You should see the Valentine’s Day card he gave me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 howard Article three, as it pertains to this project, Dr. Sheldon Cooper promises to abstain from all insulting or disrespectful language directed toward Howard Wolowitz, including but not limited to mockery of engineering, his height, his hair, his wardrobe, and his insane belief that the Ghost Rider movie was, quote, not that bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 leonard Hang on. Maybe there should be a no insult clause about me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 sheldon Do you still like cilantro?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 leonard Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 sheldon You’re tying my hands here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 howard All right, let’s sign this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 penny Wait, wait, wait. What are these changes on page six?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 amy Sheldon, what did you do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 howard I should’ve known.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 bernadette 25% of profits due to Sheldon Cooper will be allocated to a scholarship fund for the firstborn child of Howard and Bernadette Wolowitz. Sheldon, that’s so nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 leonard That beats the onesie I was gonna get them from baby Gap.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 howard That’s very generous, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 sheldon Oh, I’ve always valued education over money. And the very fact that you needed a written guarantee of respect made me realize how dismissive I’ve been of your contributions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 howard I appreciate that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 sheldon And I just hope that this scholarship can rescue your child from the subpar education and menial life of an engineer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 amy Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 sheldon What? I didn’t sign it yet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 raj I hear what you’re saying, but I’ve known Emily a long time, and I think she deserves the benefit of the doubt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 claire All right, it’s your life. But you know how this is gonna end.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 raj As a matter of fact, I do. I’m gonna comfort her, because I’m a caring and decent friend who’s happy to be there when she needs someone to talk to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode18 raj Good talk.
