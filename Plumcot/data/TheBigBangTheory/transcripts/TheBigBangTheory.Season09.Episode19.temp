TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy I didn’t understand your e-mail.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon Uh, can you repeat that? You’re breaking up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy I didn’t understand your e-mail.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon Ah. Yeah, I had to get a little creative because the S, R and M keys on my laptop stopped working.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy Deaw Aby, could you pleathe dwive be to the twain thtow thubtibe tobowow?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon So, is that a yes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy Sheldon, why don’t you get a new computer? You know that one’s out-of-date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon Oh, but I like this computer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy The video is failing, and the sound is cutting out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon I’m sorry, I didn’t get that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy The video is failing, and the sound is cutting out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon The sound is cutting out. I can’t read that. The video is failing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy Get a new computer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy Get a new computer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon What? Hello?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 leonard This is cool. When was the last time you and I built something together?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 howard Scientifically? A little over a year ago. LEGOs? Last week in my room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 leonard If there was a Nobel Prize for Millennium Falcons that fall apart when you pick them up, we’d be set.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 penny Hey, guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 leonard Hey. What are you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 bernadette We heard there were some sexy scientists working hard all weekend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 penny Yup, so we brought you some lunch and we are gonna go look for ’em.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 leonard Soup, sandwiches and emasculation, just like my mom used to make.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 penny So, how’s it goin’?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 leonard Good. Slow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 howard There’s a lot of tedious setup, but once we get through that it should go quicker.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 penny Is there anything we can do to help?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 leonard You know what, this part isn’t that technical. You actually could.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 penny Wow, really? Called my bluff. All righty then.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 bernadette Can we really help?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 howard While we finish soldering these boards, it’d be great if you guys could wrap these pipe fittings with Teflon tape.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 leonard I’ll show you how to do one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 penny Hey, wouldn’t it be funny if after all your years of hard work, I’m the one who makes a scientific breakthrough? He doesn’t think that’s funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy I got here as quickly as I could.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon You’re too late.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy Sheldon, this is silly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon You got emotional when that lab monkey died.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy That lab monkey told me he loved me in sign language.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon Great. Now I’m gonna have that song in my head all day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy Look, I’m, I’m sorry for your loss, but I think I have something that might make you feel better. I got you a new computer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon How could you do that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy Do what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon Choosing a new laptop Is an incredibly personal ritual. You have taken away weeks of agonizing thought, tedious research, sleepless nights filled with indecision. I, haven’t I lost enough today?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy Well, the guy at the store said this one is great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon Oh, oh, the guy. Oh, pardon me. I didn’t realize you’d spoken to the guy. Yeah, tell me, did the guy choose one with a 4K display and a Thunderbolt port?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon Yeah? Did the guy make sure that this has a one terabyte solid-state drive?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon Yeah? Oh, well, was this guy Rick from Computer Solutions on Colorado?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon Yeah, well, he does know his stuff.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 leonard After you wrap the body in reflective tape, the ends get Teflon tape so we can get a tight seal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 penny Like this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 leonard Yeah, perfect.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 penny Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 leonard And it helps to have small, delicate fingers. So don’t be discouraged if you can’t do it as fast as me and Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 howard I don’t know if we have enough solder to finish these circuit boards.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 leonard We had a full spool yesterday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 howard What can I say, I play hard, I solder even harder.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 bernadette Sometimes he solders at home with his shirt off. It’s like a beer commercial.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 leonard Well, we got to make a run to the hardware store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 penny How can you call yourself a scientist and run out of solder?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 leonard Well, funny story. So, we have plenty of the 60/40 tin-to-lead ratio solder, but the spools look a lot like the 63/37 tin-to-lead…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 penny Honey, honey, honey, let me stop you. That is, is not a funny story.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 howard You want to come with us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 bernadette I’m kind of getting into the groove here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 penny Yeah, you guys run to the store and let the women handle the science for a change.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 leonard Okay. We’ll be back as soon as we can.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 penny Okay, so what is solder?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon I suppose I should set this up. Or would you like to rob me of that, too?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy Knock it off or I’ll start making W-H sounds for words that just have a W.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon You wouldn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy Whatch me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon Fine. I’m sorry. Thank you for the thoughtful gift. I really do appreciate it. As you know, I had become attached to my old laptop. But I’m sure, in time, that this one will… Jeepers creepers, that started up fast.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy I thought you might like it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon Look at the 4K resolution. Next time we Skype, I’m gonna count all those nostril hairs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy Or you could just look into my eyes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon But you only have two eyes. You got a lot of nostril hairs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy Well, you know, as long as you’re happy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon Oh. I am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy And Rick said you could bring in your old one to recycle it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon Oh. Uh, no, no, no, thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy Oh, but he said you can get store credit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon Well, no, I just, I, I don’t want to recycle it. And I don’t want store credit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy But why wouldn’t…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon Can we please change the subject?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy Okay. How ’bout we change it to why you’re being weird about this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon I’m not being weird. I, it’s hard to explain.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy Sheldon, just tell me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon It might be easier to show you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon We’d have to take your car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon And I’m gonna need you to sign a non-disclosure agreement.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy Well, I signed one before we slept together. Why not now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 leonard Penny says they’re having fun working on the prototype.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 howard Remember when her fun was nightclubs and drinking games?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 leonard I know. I’m lowering the bar so slowly. This time next year she’ll have a coin collection.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 man Excuse me. You guys interested in a free screening of an upcoming movie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 leonard Oh. Sorry, we can’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 howard Well, hang on. What movie is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 man Oh, I can’t tell you. But it does star Will Smith.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 howard Wait. I bet it’s Suicide Squad. Let’s check it out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 leonard What about the girls?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 howard Penny just said they’re having fun. Honestly, you want to wrap tape around a bunch of pipe fittings all afternoon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 leonard Okay, we’ll take ’em. But, I swear, if it’s Will Smith in Shark Tale 2, it better be at least as good as the original.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 penny I mean, it’s crazy, isn’t it? I moved here from Nebraska to be an actress, and now I’m sitting in an engineering lab at Caltech helping to build a prototype for a high-tech guidance system.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 bernadette It is crazy. It’s also crazy that I’ve made fourteen of these and you’ve made three.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 raj Hey. Where are the guys?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 penny Oh, they went to the store to get solder, which is metal you melt to make science things.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 bernadette Since when do you work on weekends?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 raj I’m an astrophysicist. The stars don’t take a day off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 penny You were home alone and had no one to play with?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 raj Well, the cleaning lady was there, but she doesn’t like me. You need any help?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 bernadette Not with Lightning McQueen here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 penny I think we’re good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 raj Okay. That’s cool. I guess everybody’s involved in this project but me. So, see ya.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 bernadette I feel bad. Should we have asked him to stay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 raj Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy Will you please tell me where we’re going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon Sorry, you’re on a need-to-know basis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy I’m driving the car. I need to know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon Right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy So where are we going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon No, I meant turn right, and you missed it. Maybe you do need to know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 leonard What are we gonna tell the girls?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 howard It’s not a problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 leonard I mean without lying.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 howard And now you’ve made it a problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 leonard Come on. We’re a couple of smart guys. I’m sure we can come up with a way to explain this that doesn’t make us look bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 penny Oh, the boys had to drive all the way to San Bernardino for the solder and got a flat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 leonard They bought it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 howard But we’re gonna have to put the spare on before we go back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 leonard Oh, you’re good at this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 howard Well, I lie a lot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 man Hey, guys, thank you for being a part of our test screening. You’re about to be one of the first audiences to see Suicide Squad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 leonard Hey, you were right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 howard Well, I keep telling you, good things happen to bad people.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 man Uh, we’re gonna get started in a couple minutes. Enjoy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 leonard Who are you texting?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 howard Raj. He really wants to see this movie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 leonard He’ll never make it in time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 howard I know. I want to make him feel bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 leonard Ha, ha. Leonard and I are about to see Suicide Squad. Spoiler alert, when I see you I’m gonna spoil it. You’re a good friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 raj Okay. Would you ladies please leave the room for a moment?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 penny Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 raj I need to rub my genitals on their prototype.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 bernadette What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 raj Leonard and Howard don’t have a flat. They went to the movies. Look.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 penny Un-freakin’ believable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 bernadette Son of a bitch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 raj Oh. You know what? I’m gonna let them know that I’m here with you and that they’re busted.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 penny No. You know what? Don’t. Don’t. Let’s let them think they’re getting away with it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 bernadette Yeah, let’s see how deep a hole they can dig for themselves.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 penny Mm-hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 raj Interesting. I mean, it’s not testicles on a cryostat, but I like it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy Why do you have a storage unit?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon Just wait.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy How long have you had it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon Just wait.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy Do you want me to hold that computer?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon Just wait. You know what? Actually, yes, thank you. Welcome to my Fortress of Shame.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy I’m sorry. What, what am I looking at?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon It’s basically everything I’ve ever owned. Um, every book, every tee shirt, every piece of broken electronics. Just all of it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy All of it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon I have a Ziploc bag filled with all my old Ziploc bags.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy Okay. Well, I would like to tell you that there is nothing here to be ashamed of. So I’m gonna need a minute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 penny All right, how are we gonna play this when they return?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 raj I know. You guys should totally be making out with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 penny Sweetie, I know you think jokes like that are funny, but do you really think you could handle making out with both of us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 raj No, ma’am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 bernadette Okay. Okay, how about this? They don’t know you’re here with us, so you hide in the closet. When they show up, we’ll hear whatever their dumb story is about where they were, we’ll pretend to believe them and just when they think they got away with it, you jump out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 penny Yeah, that’s pretty good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 raj I love it, I’ll be all like, busted, and they’ll be like, what? And then we’ll all be like, oh yeah. Yeah, I get it. I wouldn’t make out with me, either.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon In here is every clock radio I’ve ever owned. Calculators, VHS tapes. Yeah. Oh. Sporting equipment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy You have sporting equipment?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon Well, oh, it’s just a, it’s a, a golf ball that my brother threw at my head. You can still feel the dent. It’s right next to the hockey puck dent.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy Okay, why do you have a bin of pine cones?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon I used to collect them as a child. The spiral of scales open in the Fibonacci sequence. A fact that, when you tell your brother, gets a golf ball thrown at your head.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy So, why do you feel you need to save these things?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon I’d like to say it’s nostalgia, but every time I think of throwing anything away, my ears start to ring, and I get butterflies in my stomach. And then it feels like the butterflies get eaten by rats, and then the, the rats get eaten by…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy Okay. I get it. I get it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon It ends with dinosaurs. I’m sorry if you think less of me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy I don’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon Really? ‘Cause every time I come in here, I think less of me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon Because I’m a fraud. No. I purport to be a man of the mind. I’ve been such a, a vocal champion of the singularity, but how can I leave my body behind and become one with the internet when I’ve never even thrown a toothbrush away?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy It’s okay, Sheldon. You know, I’ve saved a lot of weird things, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon Like what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy Well, um, did you know I have a microscope slide with a little bit of tissue from the first brain I ever dissected?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon I have an old teddy bear I secretly wiped my nose on for years.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy It’s not a contest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 penny Okay, here they come.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 bernadette Go hide.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 raj Oh, man, when I come out of the closet, I’m gonna nail those guys. Yeah, I heard it. Shut up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 leonard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 howard Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 penny Hey, what’s this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 leonard Listen, we did a stupid thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 howard We went to a movie and lied about it, but we feel bad and want to make it up to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 leonard So, these are for you, and if you’re not too mad, we’d love to take you guys to dinner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 howard Yeah. Anywhere you want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 bernadette Oh. Well, thank you for being honest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 penny Yeah. You know, I want to be upset, but we did kind of have fun working on the prototype.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 raj Don’t forgive them. Stay mad at them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 howard What is he doing in there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 raj Busting you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 bernadette It’s okay. They apologized.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 penny Yeah, it’s fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 raj Well this is kind of anti-climactic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 howard You know what wasn’t anti-climactic? The end of the movie. Get this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 raj No spoilers. No spoilers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 penny And he’s back in the closet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 howard Ready for dinner?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 penny Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 bernadette Should we invite Raj?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 raj Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy So, no one else knows about this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon Only you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy Thank you for trusting me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon What good is having a girlfriend if you can’t unload your psychological sewage on her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy That’s me, your emotional outhouse. You know, if you ever decide you want to do something about this, I’m, I’m here for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon Thank you. I wouldn’t even know how to begin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy Baby steps, I guess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon I suppose I could try getting rid of the golf ball.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy Oh. Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon I will always have the dent to remember it by.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy You did it. Do you feel okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon Actually, yes. I do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy Well, I’m proud of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon I’m glad I told you about the storage unit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy Well, I feel closer to you now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon Oh, I feel closer to you, too. You know, it’s still a couple of hours until my bedtime.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy What did you have in mind?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon You look amazing. I mean, this resolution is remarkable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy I really had to go home for this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon Yes, but it’s like you’re right here in the room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy And yet, I’m not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon But I feel like I could reach out and touch you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 amy And yet, you can’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode19 sheldon I know.
