TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon It’s nice to get back to nature. Why don’t I do this more often? What a beautiful forest. Hello, little butterfly. What’s your Na-oh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard Whatcha doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon I was enjoying some virtual reality, until you ruined it with your actual face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny What am I smelling?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon Oh, it’s car air freshener. I was simulating the smell of the forest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny That’s not what the forest smells like.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon Well, how would I know?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard Why are you pretending to be outdoors? You hate it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon Hmm? Oh. Amy showed me a compelling study that demonstrated the cognitive benefit of spending time in the wilderness.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard Buddy, I am ready to drive you into the wilderness any time you want and leave you there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon Well, make your jokes, but some of the participants who spent four days in the woods away from all technology reported a fifty percent gain in reasoning skills upon their return.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Okay, if that’s true, why aren’t there more genius squirrels?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon You may need this more than I do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy Here’s your tea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon Oh. Do not sneak up on a guy when he’s sitting on a log.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy You know, if you really want to be in nature, why don’t we rent a cabin?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon Look, I’m sorry, when did you even get here? I…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny You know, there’s a cabin in Big Bear that a doctor I work with keeps offering me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard Because he’s hitting on you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny She.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard Oh, good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny But I could get her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy We could all go for the weekend. It’ll be fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon Excuse me. Here, look up fun, get back to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard You and I could still go and have a nice weekend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy Come on, Sheldon, let’s go with them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon I hardly think so. You be sure and say hello to all the mosquitoes, bees, bears, snakes, possums, poison oak, oh, and last, but not least, teenagers with guitars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny I’ll see if it’s available.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy You know, if that study’s real, Leonard might come back smarter than you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon Are you trying to manipulate me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon Well done, it worked, we’re going.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy Yay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette Come on, Raj, give me a bag.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 raj No, no, you’re pregnant. The only thing you carry is our hope for a better tomorrow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard Hey, where you been?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette Uh, Raj took me to the baby doctor and then we swung by the grocery store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard Did you get graham crackers? I mean, are, wuh, is the baby okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette Yes and yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard I didn’t know you needed help running errands today.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette I didn’t, but Raj volunteered.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette Yeah, ever since you told him I was pregnant, he’s really been making a fuss over me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard Oh. Well, I guess that’s kind of sweet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 raj Bernie, I just forwarded you a list of the top five lactation consultants in Los Angeles. I know my favourite, but I’d love to hear what you think.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard And it just got weird.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Hey. Amy’s downstairs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard Okay, one sec.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Uh, what, what you got goin’ on here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard I bought a baseball cap.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny I can see that. What team did you get?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard Uh, Hufflepuff, from Harry Potter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Well, we’ll be in the woods.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon I’m ready to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard Anything you’d like to say to him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Nice hat, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard Why are you so mean to me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard What the hell are you watching?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette Raj found all these childbirth videos online. This one is of a woman giving birth in a river.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard Okay, that is the least Jewish thing I’ve ever seen in my life. You feel like Raj is getting a little carried away with all the baby stuff?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette I don’t think so. He just wants to be part of the experience.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard All right, if you say so. What’s in the box?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette Oh, it’s an ultrasonic microphone so we can hear the baby’s heartbeat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard Oh. That’s cool. Can we try it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette Actually, Raj ordered it. He made me promise to wait till he was here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard So he can be part of the experience?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard I’m surprised he let us conceive without him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette It’s a sore spot, don’t bring it up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny It’s so cute and rustic up here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard I know. Did you see they still have a video rental place? it’s like Colonial Williamsburg.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon Well, cell service is down to one bar, so if anyone needs medical attention or to tell a stranger their political views are stupid, now’s the time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy Have you ever been off the grid before?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon Once. The battery ran out on my phone. I had to wait for my iPad to turn on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard I was afraid he was gonna eat me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard Raj just pulled up. I’m gonna say something to him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette Leave it alone. He means well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard So you don’t think he needs to rein it in a little?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette No, not really.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard And you’re not concerned he’s acting like somehow this is his kid, too?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette He’s just trying to be supportive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard Just supportive. Not over-the-top in any way?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 raj Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette You saw him carrying that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard Astronauts saw him carrying that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny This place is great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard So nice of that doctor to just let you use it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Well, she is taking me to an Indigo Girls concert, so hold that thought.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon Okay. Well, shall we check each other for ticks?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy Sheldon, all we did was walk in from the car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon Oh. Well, suit yourself. Who wants to check me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy On the other hand, safety first.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy Wow, it’s really coming down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny This sucks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard And there goes our hike.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon Oh, not our hike, now we have to stay safe and warm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny You know, we could still go. A little rain isn’t gonna kill us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard Have you been outside in the rain with Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard You’ll wish it would kill you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy So what do we do now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard They have some board games.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon Eh, most of the Jenga pieces are missing and the Scrabble only has seven tiles, so unless you want to build an unimpressive structure with the word shnerpf next to it, move on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Hey, let’s light a fire.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy Ooh, that sounds cozy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard I don’t think I’ve lit a real fire before.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon Ah, it’s basic thermodynamics. I’m sure we can figure that out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard I could stack the logs conically to facilitate airflow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon That would maximize oxygen for optimal combustion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard Right. So all we need is to…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Got it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard A scientist made that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard Look, Raj, you’re my best friend in the world and I really appreciate your enthusiasm about the baby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 raj Please, my pleasure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette And, of course, Howie and I both want you to be a part of all this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard But we have to set some boundaries.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 raj I don’t understand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard The three of us aren’t having this baby. Just the two of us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard Oh. Okay. Yeah, I get it. I’ll back off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard Thanks for understanding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 raj Of course. I’ll give you guys some space. Let me just get this out of your way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard You need some help?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 raj No, I got it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette Raj, Raj, wait.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 raj Please, Bernadette. Let me leave with my dignity.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Hey, you guys want to play a drinking game?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon Oh, well now, we’ll never win. You always play the drinking game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Not the drinking game, a drinking game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard To be fair, good at both.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy What’s the game?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny All right, it’s called Never Have I Ever. The rules are simple. Someone says something they’ve never done, but if you have done it, you take a drink.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard I’ve never played that before.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon Hey, now, wait. Have we started? Do I drink? What is happening?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Okay. Calm down. I’ll go first. All right, let’s see. Never have I ever…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy She’s trying to think of something she’s never done before. This could take a while.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Very funny. Okay, never have I ever… yeah, you know what? Let’s just circle back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard Okay, I’ll go. Never have I ever been arrested.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon So I drink.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy No, it’s only if you’ve done it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon Got it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy I can’t believe you’ve been arrested.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon I can’t believe Penny hasn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Sheldon, what did you do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon Well, I’m not proud of it, but I jaywalked.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard Oh, no, it’s like a horror movie. We’re trapped in a cabin with a maniac.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy I’m surprised you would do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon No, I crossed in the middle of the street. And normally, I wouldn’t, but I saw an aggressive-looking Girl Scout, and it was the heart of cookie season. Anyway, there was a police officer, and he witnessed the whole thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny What, he arrested you for that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon No, he didn’t do anything. So I said, you just saw me jaywalk, why aren’t you doing your job? You know? May, maybe I should arrest you for, for impersonating a police officer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny And then you got arrested.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon Oh, and how.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard I feel like I just made a horrible mistake.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard But on the other hand, I didn’t kick him out of our lives. I just asked him to back off a little.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard What? Are you gonna cry?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard Is it baby hormones or actually sad?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette I can’t tell anymore.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard I’ll go get him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette And bring back the bear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard This game’s dangerous. I could get you in trouble.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny How?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard Well, never have I ever used Sheldon’s toothbrush to clean the sink.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Fine, is that how you want to play this? All right, never have I ever come up with a nickname for my own genitals.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard Never should’ve told you about Alvin and the Chipmunks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy Okay. My turn. Um, never have I ever completely rocked my girlfriend’s world in bed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy You know the rules. Drink.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Yeah, go ahead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard That’s right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon All right, my turn. Mm. Oh, I know. Never have I ever kept a secret bank account, because I think my wife can’t handle money. Did I win? I feel like I won.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny I can’t believe this. You realize I make more money than you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard I don’t, I know, but this isn’t a big deal. It’s just a little savings I put aside.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny We’re married. We’re supposed to share everything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard What, you mean, like, your massive credit card debt?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon I’m calling it. I won.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 raj I appreciate the apology, but it’s really not necessary. I overstepped my bounds.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard No, Raj, you’ve been great. I just, I need to start doing my part around here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette I hear that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 raj Well, if that’s the case, is there anything I can do to help?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard Well, not right now. But we could try out that microphone you got us, and listen to the baby’s heartbeat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 raj Really? It’s okay if I listen with you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette Of course.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 raj Can I squirt the ultrasound jelly on your stomach?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard Hey, look at that. It’s weird again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard Okay, you have every right to be mad. And what you said is true. You do make more money than me. So I had no right to do what I did. And I’m so sorry. I hope you can forgive me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny How long have you had this secret account?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard A couple years, but I just put a few bucks aside every month for emergencies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Well, how much you got in there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard Six thousand four hundred and twenty seven dollars. Forty seven dollars once my nana’s birthday check gets here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny My God, Leonard, do you know what I could do with that kind of money?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard No, I do, and that’s why I hid it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny What good is it if you don’t use it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard Uh, you have shoes you love, but never wear. I have money I love, but never spend. We’re kind of a cute couple that way. Again, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have kept it a secret.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Well, I have a secret I’ve been keeping from you, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard Is it a secret bank account? Because that would be awesome.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny I hate my job.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard Really? Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Because I don’t feel good flirting with doctors for sales. I mean, I know I make a lot of money. But I haven’t been happy for a while.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard Why didn’t you tell me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Because I know how important it is to you that I’m having some success.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard That’s not true.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Okay, really? So you’d be fine if I went back to acting and waiting tables again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard If that’s what you want to do, yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Well, it’s not what I want to do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard Oh, yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Doesn’t matter what I want. Look, this job is gonna get me out of debt. So I’m gonna do the grown-up thing and see it through.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard Well, that is the grown-up thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny I guess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard I love you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny I love you, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard You know, never have I ever made love in the forest while it was raining.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Well, guess I gotta drink.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard All right, here we go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette I’m not hearing anything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard Well, give me a second.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 raj Are you sure you can do this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard Hey, who found four dollars and change on the beach with his metal detector?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 raj I buried it there, so we could go home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette Wait, that’s it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 raj Wow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette Isn’t that the best?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 raj You guys made a person.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard We did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 raj And I like to think I helped.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard You didn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon Oh, never have I ever drunk milk past its expiration date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy Never have I ever cancelled a dentist appointment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon Oh, uh, never have I ever put my foot in the ocean.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy Never have I ever honked if I liked anything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon Oh, uh, never have I ever thrown, caught or touched a Frisbee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy Never have I ever put salt on my food without trying it first.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon Oh. Never have I ever pushed all the buttons in an elevator.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy Well, we all have a past.
