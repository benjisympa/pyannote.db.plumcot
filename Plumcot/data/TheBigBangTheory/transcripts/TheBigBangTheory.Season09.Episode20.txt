TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon_cooper It’s nice to get back to nature. Why don’t I do this more often? What a beautiful forest. Hello, little butterfly. What’s your Na-oh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Whatcha doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon_cooper I was enjoying some virtual reality, until you ruined it with your actual face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny What am I smelling?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Oh, it’s car air freshener. I was simulating the smell of the forest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny That’s not what the forest smells like.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Well, how would I know?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Why are you pretending to be outdoors? You hate it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Hmm? Oh. Amy showed me a compelling study that demonstrated the cognitive benefit of spending time in the wilderness.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Buddy, I am ready to drive you into the wilderness any time you want and leave you there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Well, make your jokes, but some of the participants who spent four days in the woods away from all technology reported a fifty percent gain in reasoning skills upon their return.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Okay, if that’s true, why aren’t there more genius squirrels?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon_cooper You may need this more than I do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler Here’s your tea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Oh. Do not sneak up on a guy when he’s sitting on a log.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler You know, if you really want to be in nature, why don’t we rent a cabin?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Look, I’m sorry, when did you even get here? I…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny You know, there’s a cabin in Big Bear that a doctor I work with keeps offering me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Because he’s hitting on you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny She.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Oh, good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny But I could get her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler We could all go for the weekend. It’ll be fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Excuse me. Here, look up fun, get back to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter You and I could still go and have a nice weekend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler Come on, Sheldon, let’s go with them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon_cooper I hardly think so. You be sure and say hello to all the mosquitoes, bees, bears, snakes, possums, poison oak, oh, and last, but not least, teenagers with guitars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny I’ll see if it’s available.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler You know, if that study’s real, Leonard might come back smarter than you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Are you trying to manipulate me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Well done, it worked, we’re going.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler Yay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski Come on, Raj, give me a bag.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 raj_koothrappali No, no, you’re pregnant. The only thing you carry is our hope for a better tomorrow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Hey, where you been?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski Uh, Raj took me to the baby doctor and then we swung by the grocery store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Did you get graham crackers? I mean, are, wuh, is the baby okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski Yes and yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard_wolowitz I didn’t know you needed help running errands today.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski I didn’t, but Raj volunteered.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, ever since you told him I was pregnant, he’s really been making a fuss over me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Oh. Well, I guess that’s kind of sweet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 raj_koothrappali Bernie, I just forwarded you a list of the top five lactation consultants in Los Angeles. I know my favourite, but I’d love to hear what you think.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard_wolowitz And it just got weird.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Hey. Amy’s downstairs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Okay, one sec.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Uh, what, what you got goin’ on here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter I bought a baseball cap.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny I can see that. What team did you get?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Uh, Hufflepuff, from Harry Potter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Well, we’ll be in the woods.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon_cooper I’m ready to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Anything you’d like to say to him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Nice hat, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Why are you so mean to me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard_wolowitz What the hell are you watching?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski Raj found all these childbirth videos online. This one is of a woman giving birth in a river.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Okay, that is the least Jewish thing I’ve ever seen in my life. You feel like Raj is getting a little carried away with all the baby stuff?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t think so. He just wants to be part of the experience.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard_wolowitz All right, if you say so. What’s in the box?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, it’s an ultrasonic microphone so we can hear the baby’s heartbeat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Oh. That’s cool. Can we try it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski Actually, Raj ordered it. He made me promise to wait till he was here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard_wolowitz So he can be part of the experience?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard_wolowitz I’m surprised he let us conceive without him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski It’s a sore spot, don’t bring it up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny It’s so cute and rustic up here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter I know. Did you see they still have a video rental place? it’s like Colonial Williamsburg.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Well, cell service is down to one bar, so if anyone needs medical attention or to tell a stranger their political views are stupid, now’s the time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler Have you ever been off the grid before?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Once. The battery ran out on my phone. I had to wait for my iPad to turn on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter I was afraid he was gonna eat me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Raj just pulled up. I’m gonna say something to him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski Leave it alone. He means well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard_wolowitz So you don’t think he needs to rein it in a little?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski No, not really.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard_wolowitz And you’re not concerned he’s acting like somehow this is his kid, too?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski He’s just trying to be supportive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Just supportive. Not over-the-top in any way?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 raj_koothrappali Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski You saw him carrying that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Astronauts saw him carrying that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny This place is great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter So nice of that doctor to just let you use it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Well, she is taking me to an Indigo Girls concert, so hold that thought.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Okay. Well, shall we check each other for ticks?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, all we did was walk in from the car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Oh. Well, suit yourself. Who wants to check me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler On the other hand, safety first.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler Wow, it’s really coming down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny This sucks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter And there goes our hike.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Oh, not our hike, now we have to stay safe and warm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny You know, we could still go. A little rain isn’t gonna kill us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Have you been outside in the rain with Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter You’ll wish it would kill you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler So what do we do now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter They have some board games.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Eh, most of the Jenga pieces are missing and the Scrabble only has seven tiles, so unless you want to build an unimpressive structure with the word shnerpf next to it, move on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Hey, let’s light a fire.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler Ooh, that sounds cozy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter I don’t think I’ve lit a real fire before.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Ah, it’s basic thermodynamics. I’m sure we can figure that out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter I could stack the logs conically to facilitate airflow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon_cooper That would maximize oxygen for optimal combustion.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Right. So all we need is to…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Got it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter A scientist made that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Look, Raj, you’re my best friend in the world and I really appreciate your enthusiasm about the baby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 raj_koothrappali Please, my pleasure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski And, of course, Howie and I both want you to be a part of all this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard_wolowitz But we have to set some boundaries.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 raj_koothrappali I don’t understand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard_wolowitz The three of us aren’t having this baby. Just the two of us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Oh. Okay. Yeah, I get it. I’ll back off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Thanks for understanding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 raj_koothrappali Of course. I’ll give you guys some space. Let me just get this out of your way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard_wolowitz You need some help?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 raj_koothrappali No, I got it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski Raj, Raj, wait.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 raj_koothrappali Please, Bernadette. Let me leave with my dignity.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Hey, you guys want to play a drinking game?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Oh, well now, we’ll never win. You always play the drinking game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Not the drinking game, a drinking game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter To be fair, good at both.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler What’s the game?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny All right, it’s called Never Have I Ever. The rules are simple. Someone says something they’ve never done, but if you have done it, you take a drink.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter I’ve never played that before.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Hey, now, wait. Have we started? Do I drink? What is happening?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Okay. Calm down. I’ll go first. All right, let’s see. Never have I ever…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler She’s trying to think of something she’s never done before. This could take a while.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Very funny. Okay, never have I ever… yeah, you know what? Let’s just circle back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Okay, I’ll go. Never have I ever been arrested.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon_cooper So I drink.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler No, it’s only if you’ve done it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Got it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler I can’t believe you’ve been arrested.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon_cooper I can’t believe Penny hasn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Sheldon, what did you do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Well, I’m not proud of it, but I jaywalked.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Oh, no, it’s like a horror movie. We’re trapped in a cabin with a maniac.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler I’m surprised you would do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon_cooper No, I crossed in the middle of the street. And normally, I wouldn’t, but I saw an aggressive-looking Girl Scout, and it was the heart of cookie season. Anyway, there was a police officer, and he witnessed the whole thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny What, he arrested you for that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon_cooper No, he didn’t do anything. So I said, you just saw me jaywalk, why aren’t you doing your job? You know? May, maybe I should arrest you for, for impersonating a police officer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny And then you got arrested.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Oh, and how.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard_wolowitz I feel like I just made a horrible mistake.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard_wolowitz But on the other hand, I didn’t kick him out of our lives. I just asked him to back off a little.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard_wolowitz What? Are you gonna cry?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Is it baby hormones or actually sad?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski I can’t tell anymore.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard_wolowitz I’ll go get him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski And bring back the bear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter This game’s dangerous. I could get you in trouble.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny How?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Well, never have I ever used Sheldon’s toothbrush to clean the sink.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Fine, is that how you want to play this? All right, never have I ever come up with a nickname for my own genitals.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Never should’ve told you about Alvin and the Chipmunks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler Okay. My turn. Um, never have I ever completely rocked my girlfriend’s world in bed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler You know the rules. Drink.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Yeah, go ahead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter That’s right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon_cooper All right, my turn. Mm. Oh, I know. Never have I ever kept a secret bank account, because I think my wife can’t handle money. Did I win? I feel like I won.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny I can’t believe this. You realize I make more money than you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter I don’t, I know, but this isn’t a big deal. It’s just a little savings I put aside.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny We’re married. We’re supposed to share everything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter What, you mean, like, your massive credit card debt?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon_cooper I’m calling it. I won.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 raj_koothrappali I appreciate the apology, but it’s really not necessary. I overstepped my bounds.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard_wolowitz No, Raj, you’ve been great. I just, I need to start doing my part around here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski I hear that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 raj_koothrappali Well, if that’s the case, is there anything I can do to help?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Well, not right now. But we could try out that microphone you got us, and listen to the baby’s heartbeat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 raj_koothrappali Really? It’s okay if I listen with you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski Of course.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 raj_koothrappali Can I squirt the ultrasound jelly on your stomach?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Hey, look at that. It’s weird again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Okay, you have every right to be mad. And what you said is true. You do make more money than me. So I had no right to do what I did. And I’m so sorry. I hope you can forgive me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny How long have you had this secret account?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter A couple years, but I just put a few bucks aside every month for emergencies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Well, how much you got in there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Six thousand four hundred and twenty seven dollars. Forty seven dollars once my nana’s birthday check gets here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny My God, Leonard, do you know what I could do with that kind of money?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter No, I do, and that’s why I hid it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny What good is it if you don’t use it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Uh, you have shoes you love, but never wear. I have money I love, but never spend. We’re kind of a cute couple that way. Again, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have kept it a secret.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Well, I have a secret I’ve been keeping from you, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Is it a secret bank account? Because that would be awesome.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny I hate my job.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Really? Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Because I don’t feel good flirting with doctors for sales. I mean, I know I make a lot of money. But I haven’t been happy for a while.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Why didn’t you tell me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Because I know how important it is to you that I’m having some success.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter That’s not true.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Okay, really? So you’d be fine if I went back to acting and waiting tables again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter If that’s what you want to do, yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Well, it’s not what I want to do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Oh, yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Doesn’t matter what I want. Look, this job is gonna get me out of debt. So I’m gonna do the grown-up thing and see it through.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter Well, that is the grown-up thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny I guess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter I love you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny I love you, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 leonard_hofstadter You know, never have I ever made love in the forest while it was raining.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 penny Well, guess I gotta drink.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard_wolowitz All right, here we go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski I’m not hearing anything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Well, give me a second.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 raj_koothrappali Are you sure you can do this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard_wolowitz Hey, who found four dollars and change on the beach with his metal detector?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 raj_koothrappali I buried it there, so we could go home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski Wait, that’s it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 raj_koothrappali Wow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 bernadette_rostenkowski Isn’t that the best?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 raj_koothrappali You guys made a person.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard_wolowitz We did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 raj_koothrappali And I like to think I helped.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 howard_wolowitz You didn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Oh, never have I ever drunk milk past its expiration date.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler Never have I ever cancelled a dentist appointment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Oh, uh, never have I ever put my foot in the ocean.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler Never have I ever honked if I liked anything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Oh, uh, never have I ever thrown, caught or touched a Frisbee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler Never have I ever put salt on my food without trying it first.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 sheldon_cooper Oh. Never have I ever pushed all the buttons in an elevator.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode20 amy_farrah_fowler Well, we all have a past.
