TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 sheldon I have a question about Batman. Batman is a man who dresses up like a bat. Man-bat is a part man, part bat hybrid. Now, if Man-Bat dressed up as a man to fight crime, would he be Man-Batman?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard No, he’d be Bat-Man-Bat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 raj But wouldn’t Man-Batman just be a Batman that was bitten by a radioactive man?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 howard But Batman is a man. You’re talking about a man who would have the powers of a man. That’s just Man-Man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 sheldon Well, isn’t Man-Man just Man?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard But what if Man-Man dressed as a bat?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 raj Well, that’s just Batman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard No, if a man dresses as a bat, that’s Batman, but if Man-Man dresses as a bat, that’s Batman-Man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 howard So does that answer your question?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 sheldon Oh, I haven’t asked it yet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 raj Oh, that’s Claire. Got to run.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard I thought you were back with Emily.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 raj Uh, actually I’m seeing both of them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard You mean like through their window from behind a bush?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 raj No, I’m actually dating two women. Later.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard Really? The guy who for years couldn’t even talk to women is suddenly going out with two of them? How is that possible?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 howard I know. Scientists have tried to reproduce it with computational models, but, in each case, the world blows up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard Seriously, that guy’s dating two women?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 sheldon What, why did you get a party sub?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard People are coming over, it looked fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 sheldon Well, we’re only watching Game of Thrones. A party sub implies it’s a party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard Your attendance implies it’s not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 sheldon I like a party as much as the next man, as long as the next man doesn’t like a party. Oh, by the way, don’t forget, tomorrow is our quarterly roommate agreement meeting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard Oh, Sheldon, we don’t need a meeting every three months.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 sheldon Hmm? Well, it sounds like the kind of thing one would bring up at a quarterly roommate agreement meeting. Lucky for you it’s tomorrow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard Oh, you know what? I’m not going.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 sheldon Well, you have to go. It’s Penny’s first time leading the Pledge of Allegiance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard This meeting is a waste of time. Whether we make the switch from Post Raisin Bran to Kellogg’s Raisin Bran should not require parliamentary procedure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 sheldon You realize one of them has sugar on the raisins.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard You’re the only one who eats them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 sheldon And yet you get to weigh in. Democracy, it’s pretty cool, isn’t it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard I’m not going, you can’t make me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 sheldon Well, we’ll just see about that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 penny What is the problem?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 sheldon He says he’s not coming to the roommate agreement meeting tomorrow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 penny Well, why the hell did I memorize the Pledge?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard You have fun. I will not be attending.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 sheldon Oh, fine. We don’t have to have a roommate agreement meeting if you don’t want to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 sheldon Of course, it will require a vote. Unfortunately, my official gavel is in my bedroom, but luckily, I have my travel gavel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard You’re being ridiculous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 sheldon There’s a motion on the floor, I’m ridiculous. Do we have a second? Hmm? Hmm? There is no second. The motion is denied. Next time, make sure you have the votes first. That was embarrassing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard Can you please talk to him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 penny Well, why are you fighting him on this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard Because I am tired of him always getting his way. We don’t need a stupid meeting. We don’t even need a roommate agreement, and I hope that sandwich does cause a party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 penny Well, I will still come to your meeting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 sheldon Well, I should hope so. Tomorrow’s picture day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard Why are you taking his side?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 penny Because it’s important to him, and when we signed the roommate agreement, we made a deal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 sheldon You keep talking like that, you’re gonna make colour guard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 raj Man, I’m worn out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 howard I know. Imagine if we were actually moving.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 raj No, it’s just, ever since I started dating Claire and Emily at the same time, it’s exhausting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 howard You’re exhausted? Try folding every five pages in a pregnancy book so your wife thinks you read it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 raj But, dude, you’re so lucky. Getting to stay home at night with the woman you love.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 howard I guess I am lucky.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 raj You are, because dating two women, I mean, I can’t even remember the last time I slept in my own apartment. I wake up and I’m like, am I at Claire’s or am I at Emily’s? Is there a third girl I’ve forgotten about? Like, where am I?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 bernadette Hey, Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 raj Hey, how’s the mommy-to-be?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 bernadette Good. A little tired.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 raj I feel you. I’ve been dating multiple women.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 howard You sure you don’t want to come watch Game of Thrones with us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 bernadette You guys have fun. I’m just gonna snuggle up in bed with a book.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 raj Oh, that sounds great, a bed to yourself. Can’t even remember what that’s like.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 sheldon Are you up-to-date on Game of Thrones?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 penny Mm, I think so. Dragons, snow zombies, and all the hot guys are dead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 sheldon Oh, I don’t know. Theon Greyjoy looks pretty good for a guy who had his genitals cut off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 penny Uh-oh, somebody’s still pouting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard Leave me alone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 penny If it’s because you lost a stick, I know where it went.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard Not funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 penny You know you’re gonna make up with him. Can we just skip to that part?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard Oh, of course, because I’m the only adult around here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 penny Really? The only adult?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard Yeah, that’s right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 sheldon Tonight I’ll be watching a show rated M.A., and that stands for mature audiences, buster.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 penny All right, you would think the only adult wouldn’t let something silly ruin our entire night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard And I’d think you’d understand why I’m annoyed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 sheldon All this could be avoided if you’d just come to the meeting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard I don’t want to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 sheldon Oh, it’s just a meeting. One simple meeting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard Stop saying meeting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 sheldon Meeting, meeting, bo-beeting, banana-fana, fo-feeting, fee-fi mo-meeting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 amy I brought my famous spinach dip.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 sheldon Yeah, Amy, just one second. Meeting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 howard I’m not sure if I’m hoping for a boy or a girl. I mean, if it’s a boy, I’m gonna have to teach him to play catch. Which means I’m gonna have to google how to play catch. If it’s a girl, I mean, they’re so innocent and you know how guys are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 raj Totally, guys are the worst. I mean, look at me. I let Emily make me a frittata and I kept the leftovers in Claire’s fridge that night. I’m such a dog.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 howard There you go again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 raj I’m sorry, have I been complaining about it too much?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 howard Actually, what you’re doing is pretending to complain, but really trying to brag.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 raj How could you say that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 howard Oh, I wish could enjoy a cup of tea without a naked girl bouncing up and down on me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 raj I never said that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 howard Don’t you hate it when you can’t remember whose bra it is you found wedged in your couch?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 raj Okay, that I said. But that’s a real problem. You give a girl another woman’s bra, and you will not be having sex with her that night. Maybe the other girl, but not her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 amy What’s going on with him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 penny Oh, he’s all bent out of shape about having a roommate agreement meeting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 sheldon Apparently, perfect attendance isn’t cool any more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 penny Don’t worry, he’ll come around.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 amy Well, I get why he’s annoyed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 sheldon Well, then you don’t understand what’s happening. See, Leonard refused to participate in a mandatory quarterly roommate agreement meeting. This is what a generation raised on Bart Simpson looks like.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard You love The Simpsons.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 sheldon I love Lisa Simpson.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 amy Well, I know how he feels. I never enjoyed our relationship agreement meetings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 sheldon Wait. You were pretending?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 amy Sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 sheldon No. I don’t believe you. I could tell.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 amy Oh, Sheldon, I never thought re-filing a matter in a standing subcommittee could be so fascinating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 sheldon Hmm, what do you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 penny You don’t know?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 raj Hey, did I say something to upset you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 howard No, I’m fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 raj Really? Because usually we walk side by side, and I just went up two flights of stairs staring at your bottom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 howard Just drop it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 raj Okay, I think I see what’s happening here. You’re jealous of me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 howard Oh, please. What could you possibly have that I would be jealous of?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 raj It’s not what I have, it’s how many people I’m having it with.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 penny Come on, Sheldon, we’ll watch Game of Thrones over here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 sheldon Gladly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard Oh, good, go. You know, it’ll be nice to watch an episode without someone saying, I read the books, don’t get too fond of this character.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 sheldon It’s not always because they die. In one case, it’s because they’ve become involved with underground tree people from the dawn of time. Yeah, but I won’t say who it is. It’s Brann.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 howard Wait, what is going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 penny Leonard’s being a jerk, so we’re gonna watch over here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 amy Do you guys want to watch with us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 howard As long as I don’t have to watch with him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 raj Fine, I don’t want to watch with you either. I’ll go over here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 howard Why do you get to pick?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 raj Okay, then you go there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 howard Don’t tell me where to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard Howard, just come in here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 penny Yeah, come on, Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 raj Wait, did Amy make her spinach dip?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 sheldon She did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 howard And I’m gonna eat it all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 howard So what the hell happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard Oh, I just ran out of patience with Sheldon’s nonsense.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 howard Tell me about it. I’ve had it with Raj, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 amy You know, like women, men have a monthly hormone cycle. Dips in testosterone can cause irritability.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 howard Interesting. Maybe my male cycle synced up with Raj’s actual period.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard If Sheldon’s testosterone dipped, he’d become a butterfly. Oh. Maybe someone’s here to apologize.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 stuart Hey, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 stuart Uh, is this not a dress-up party?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 stuart Was it ever a dress-up party?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 stuart Howard, didn’t you tell me it was a dress-up party?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 howard Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 stuart I was told this is where to go if I’m mad at Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 penny May I take your cloak?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 stuart Thanks. This thing kept getting caught in the chain of my bike.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 sheldon Well, I’ll catch you up. Uh, Penny is angry at Leonard, Leonard’s angry at me and Penny, I’m angry at Leonard and Amy, Raj is angry at Howard, and I’m angry at George R.R. Martin ’cause there are no new books for me to spoil for Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 stuart So what happened with you and Howard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 raj Says I was talking too much about dating Claire and Emily, and I accused him of being jealous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 stuart I’m jealous. Closest I’ve come to dating two women was that time I dated one woman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard I don’t know how you put up with it. He’s impossible. I mean, holding a meeting to decide what breakfast cereal we should buy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 howard Yeah. Cap’n Crunch with Crunch Berries, move on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard Anyway, Amy, thank you for sticking up for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 amy Oh, I honestly couldn’t care less.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard Sorry?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 amy Well, I just took your side ’cause sometimes I get annoyed at how close Sheldon and Penny are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard Well, they argue all the time. They aren’t that close.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 amy Who’s always comforting him when he’s upset?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard Penny, but…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 amy Who’s the only one who can make him take his medicine when he’s sick?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard I try to hide it in his peanut butter, but he spits it out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 amy Okay. And did you know she has him add things to the roommate agreement so she can get her way and not fight with you about it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard Son of a bitch. Why is that funny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 howard I don’t know. I like the pain of others.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard Oh, well, then you’ll enjoy this. Bernadette does the same thing with you and Koothrappali.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 howard No, she doesn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard She defends him all the time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 howard She does not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 amy Who told you to stop making all those Gandhi jokes about him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 howard Well, she did. And human resources.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard Who do you think told Koothrappali to go to human resources?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 howard Son of a bitch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard You’re, you’re right, it feels good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 raj All right, it’s almost game time. Get it? Game of Thrones, game time?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 stuart Two women, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 sheldon Oh, perhaps it’s Amy coming to her senses.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 penny What’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard You know, you don’t need to use Sheldon to get your way with me in a dumb roommate agreement.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 penny Where’d you get that from?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard From Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 penny Ugh. Amy, why did you tell him that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 amy Because you were defending Sheldon like you always do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 penny I don’t always defend Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard Oh, yes, you do. You know you have a weird brother-sister-Elliott-E.T. relationship with him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 penny What about your weird relationship with him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard That’s different. I’m like the little girl in Poltergeist and he’s the creepy thing in the TV.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 howard Um, guys? Were there any nuts in that food?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard I don’t think so. Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 howard Well just a feeling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard It just said Italian sub. I had no idea mortadella has pistachios in it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 sheldon Interesting fact, in Italian, the morta in mortadella means death.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 amy Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 sheldon I didn’t say fun fact. I’m not a monster.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 bernadette He’s gonna be okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 sheldon Now it’s a fun fact.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 stuart Boy, stuff like this really puts things in perspective.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 bernadette Why are you dressed like that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 stuart Oh, uh, Howard thought it’d be funny to tell me it was a costume party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 bernadette That wasn’t nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 stuart No, but he almost died, so we’re cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 raj You know, if you think about it, tonight was kind of like a real-life Game of Thrones.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 amy How?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 raj Well, Howard eating that pistachio was like when King Joffrey got poisoned.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 penny Okay, well, that was murder, this was an accident.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 raj Okay. But you using Sheldon to do your dirty work is like when Cersei used the King’s Guard to do her bidding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 sheldon Cersei uses her body to manipulate men. Penny just takes me to The LEGO Store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 raj Okay. Oh, how about this? Stuart’s dressed like a brother of the Night’s Watch, and they don’t have sex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 penny There you go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard That’s true.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 sheldon Fair enough.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 howard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 bernadette You all right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 howard I’m fine. Just a little embarrassed I had to be carried down the stairs like a baby. Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard Let’s get out of here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 amy That was scary.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 sheldon Well, the important thing is I said that big sandwich would ruin everything, and I was right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 raj Hey, Jon Snow. How come your horse has a basket on it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 stuart How come your head has your face on it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 sheldon They don’t wear bicycle helmets in Game of Thrones. You’re thematically inaccurate, but I applaud your commitment to safety.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 stuart Don’t you guys have anything better to do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard Better than watching a guy in a fur cloak ride a girl’s bike? Nope.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 stuart That’s it, you just lost bathroom privileges at the comic book store. Horse has a basket on it. Stupid… aaargh!
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 sheldon Leonard. Leonard. Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 sheldon I never got to ask my question about Batman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 leonard What is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 sheldon If Batman were bitten by a radioactive Man-Bat, and then fought crime disguised as Man-Bat, would he be Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Man or simply Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Batman?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 penny Is he still wearing the Batman suit under the Man-Bat suit?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode21 sheldon I’ll be back.
