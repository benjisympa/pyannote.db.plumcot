TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 penny Oh, hey, if you guys are free this weekend, I won a night of wine tasting from work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 leonard That sounds fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 penny Mm-hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 leonard How come scientists don’t win free stuff like salespeople do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 howard ‘Cause we’re not in it for the stuff. We’re in it for the groupies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon Personally, I find the notion of external rewards demeaning. I pursue science for the intrinsic joy of discovery.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 amy But you always say that you want to win a Nobel Prize.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon I also say don’t contradict me in front of my friends, but that you don’t remember.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 penny All right, well, let me know if you guys want to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 raj I would love to. I do enjoy the complexity of an aged Pinot noir.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 leonard I’m sure that would pair nicely with your fried nuggets of chicken.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 amy Well, it sounds like a nice night. We should go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon Wine again? Yeah, no, thank you. I like my grapes the old-fashioned way, in a juice box.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 amy Well, I’m going. You couldn’t stop me from getting a massage at the mall, and you’re not stopping me now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon I shouldn’t have to see my girlfriend get groped in public by another man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 amy And I shouldn’t have to see my boyfriend riding on a train for children around the mall.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 penny The little choo-choo for toddlers?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 amy And now you know why I needed the massage.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 howard Well, we’re out. Bernie can’t drink ’cause she’s pregnant. And she’s pregnant because we had sex. And we had sex because, well, come on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 bernadette It’s okay, you should go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 howard You sure?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 bernadette Of course.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 penny Yeah, give her a break from, well, come on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon Well, Bernadette, looks like Saturday night, it’s you and me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 bernadette Me? How? Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon Well, it makes perfect sense. Because you’re an expectant mother, you can’t drink alcohol. I don’t like to. You can’t have sushi. I don’t like to. You can’t go in hot tubs. I consider them vats of sweaty people soup.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 bernadette Gee, Sheldon, I don’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon Oh, come on. Roller coasters, caffeine, runny eggs, I’ve been avoiding these things all my life. And now, because you’re pregnant, you have to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 leonard The difference is she’s bringing life into the world, and you suck it out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 bernadette I guess we could give it a try.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon Well, little lady, you’ve heard of party hearty, get ready to party hardly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 howard I bet you’d like a drink right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 raj Hey, you think it’d be okay if I brought Claire to the wine tasting?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 leonard Sure. I’d like to meet her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 raj Oh, that’s great. I’ve been wanting her to meet you guys, too, so this seems like the perfect opportunity.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon Oh, but I won’t be there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 raj Funny how that worked out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 leonard Does this mean Emily’s not in the picture anymore?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 raj No, I’m still dating her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 leonard Okay, help me out. How are you doing this? Do they know about each other?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 raj They know that we’re not exclusive, and we just don’t ask too many questions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon You know, it’s like how I play Warlords of Ka’a with you and Elder Sign with Frank and Alicia.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 leonard Who’s Frank and Alicia?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon You, you and I spend a lot of time together. Can there be a little mystery between us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 howard Okay. Everything’s hooked up. We’re ready.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon I am going to record this for posterity.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 leonard All right, here goes nothing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon Here goes nothing? This is the initial test of our prototype. Can we give it a little more gravitas?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 leonard Fine. Preliminary trial of the infinite persistence gyroscopic navigational system, phase one commencing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon Eh, maybe it’s your voice. I’m gonna see if I can get James Earl Jones to do it in post.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 raj It’s, it’s beautiful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 howard Actually, it’s making me dizzy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 leonard Good, it’s not just me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 claire Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 raj Hey, Claire.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 claire Hey, what’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 raj Hi, yeah. Um, I was wondering, if you’re free Saturday night, all my friends are going to a wine tasting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 claire Sure, I guess. If you don’t think meeting your friends is too big a step.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 raj Why would it be too big a step?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 claire I don’t know. I just don’t want things to get weird.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 raj Nothing to worry about. People meet people all the time, and it isn’t weird. I met Bon Jovi once, which you’d think might be weird. Turns out, total sweetheart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 claire Okay, but you and I have been keeping things casual. Uh, will you introduce me as your friend or as your girlfriend? What if I like them and they don’t like me? What if they like me and I don’t like them?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 raj Boy, it wasn’t this hard with Bon Jovi. I said you rock, he said, thanks, man, and that was that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 penny Hey, you ready to go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 leonard Hang on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 penny What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 leonard Oh, I found a scratch-and-sniff book about wine tasting. It teaches the different flavour notes to look for.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 penny You actually smell the wine?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 leonard I mostly just smell my nasal spray.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 penny Are your sinuses acting up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 leonard Since my preschool got a bunny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 penny Hey, are you still hanging out with Bernadette tonight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon Yes. And we’re going to prove that we don’t need alcohol to enjoy ourselves.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 penny Oh, good for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon Or caffeine, tobacco, sushi, soft cheese, processed meats and jacuzzis, which can all be harmful to an unborn baby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 penny No honey baked ham in a hot tub, got it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon Oh, no bubble baths either. They can increase the risk of a urinary tract infection.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 leonard Okay, have fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon Oh, and no swordfish, king mackerel, shark or tilefish, which are all high in mercury.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 leonard We’re leaving now!
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon Oh, and no contact with guinea pigs or hamsters or their droppings, uh, no-no cat litter boxes, no paint fumes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 penny Okay, we’re leaving, love you, bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon Boy, do I love restrictions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 howard Hey. Where is everybody?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 amy Oh, we’re the first ones here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 howard Oh. Cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 amy Yeah. Cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 howard You know, I don’t remember the last time it was just you and me hanging out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 amy Oh, I do. It was three years ago.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 howard Oh, yeah, and we said we should do it more often. And, and, and, and, and here we are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 amy So, Sheldon and Bernadette are hanging out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 howard I know. What are they gonna talk about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 amy I don’t know. I really don’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 leonard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 howard Oh, good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 amy Oh, thank God.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 penny You guys been here long?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 howard No, two minutes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 amy But yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 howard Where’s Claire?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 raj Oh, she’s meeting us here. Hey, guys, do me a favour and don’t ask too many questions about the relationship. We’re just keeping it casual.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 leonard Oh, so I shouldn’t ask her how she feels about being a member of your harem?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 raj Yeah, I know you’re teasing, but watch out for karma.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 amy Hey, Penny, isn’t that your old boyfriend Zack?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 penny Oh, yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 amy Are you gonna say hi to him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 penny Uh, I don’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 raj Hey, while you decide, who was better in bed, big hot Zack or wheezy little Leonard? Neener neener.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 bernadette I brought sparkling cider.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon Oh, the bubbles tickle my nose. I’ll just open this now so it can get nice and flat before we drink it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 bernadette So what do you want to do tonight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon Oh, I have quite the evening planned. Our foetus-friendly festival of fun begins with an in-depth look at the world of model trains, and then we’ll kick things up a notch and explore all the different ways that you can make toast.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 bernadette There’s more than one?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon You’ve heard of French toast?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 bernadette Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon Cinnamon toast?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 bernadette Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon Melba toast?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 bernadette Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon You get where I’m going here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 bernadette Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 amy I’m getting an earthy note.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 penny Ah, there’s definitely some oak.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 raj Also, uh, cherries?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 leonard I smell nothing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 howard Really? Nothing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 leonard Just a whole lot of Afrin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 zack Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 penny Oh. Zack, hi. You guys remember Zack.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 howard Yeah, hey, buddy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 amy Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 raj Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 zack Hey, did you two get married?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 penny We did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 leonard Yeah, mm-hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 zack To each other?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 penny Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 zack Cool. ‘Cause other than when you broke up with him and dated me, then broke up with me, and then dated me one more time before going back to him, I was always rooting for you two.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 leonard Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 zack So how’s the science world? What are you guys up to?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 howard We’ve actually been working on a prototype for a navigation system we invented.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 leonard But we won’t bore you with the details.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 zack Are you kidding? I love science. Einstein, Stephen Hawking, Mike deGrasse Tyson.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 amy Mike deGrasse Tyson?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 howard Yeah, you know, the boxer who grew a moustache and became a scientist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 zack So what’s your invention?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 howard Well, we’re using quantum vortices to replace gyroscopes in guidance systems.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 leonard What’s neat is that they can maintain angular momentum indefinitely.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 zack Angular momentum. I was wondering about that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 howard You could put it in a satellite or a rocket, and it’ll run forever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 zack Cool. Could it be used for missiles and war stuff?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 howard Yeah, but we didn’t create it for weapons.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 leonard And I doubt the military would be interested in our little guidance system.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 zack Is it better than the one they use now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 howard A lot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 leonard Way better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 zack Huh. You sure you guys are smart?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon H-O gauge trains are 1/87th scale. N gauge are 1/160th scale. And that brings us to Z gauge, at a, you could easily swallow it, don’t ask how I know, 1 to 220.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 bernadette I’m sorry, I have to ask.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon When I was five, I ingested a Z gauge locomotive. I spent the next three days saying, I think I can pass it, I think I can pass it, I think I can pass it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 bernadette What is it about trains that you like so much?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon What an interesting question. When I was a child, life was confusing and chaotic for me, and trains represented order. I could line them up, categorize them, control them. I guess you could say that they gave me a sense of calm in a world that didn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 bernadette That’s lovely, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon Well, other than when they’re chugging through your bowels, these things are magic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 leonard I have to admit, I’ve been worried about the military applications since we started talking about this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 howard Me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 leonard Why didn’t you say something?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 howard Same reason I don’t talk about ass cancer. It’s not a pleasant topic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 raj You can’t let this stop you. Almost any scientific advancement can be used for destructive purposes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 amy It’s true. Even Einstein’s theory of relativity was later applied to the development of nuclear weapons.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 penny E equals MC squared. Yeah. E is for energy, M for mass, and C for the speed of light.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 amy How do you know that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 penny Oh, Leonard mumbles it when he wants sex to last longer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 claire Hey, Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 raj Hey, Claire. Good, you’re here. Guys, this is my friend Claire. We’re casually dating, and there’s no need for any further questions about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 leonard Would you like a glass of wine?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 raj I said no questions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon And last but not least, this is one that I like to call Star Wars Toast because it has a light side and a dark side. All righty, it’s time for Dungeons & Dragons.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 bernadette Dungeons & Dragons? That sounds about right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon You’re gonna enjoy this. I designed it especially for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 bernadette Okay, but just for a little bit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon Oh, I have a feeling that once you start, you’re not gonna want to or be allowed to stop.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 bernadette All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon Ready?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 bernadette You bet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon Your name is Bernatrix. You are a warrior queen. You’re strong, beautiful and tall.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 bernadette Oh. I like the idea of being tall.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon I think you’re gonna like a lot of things I have in store. For example, in this world, only the men get pregnant, so your husband is home trying not to pee when he laughs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 bernadette This is getting fun. What’s next?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon You’re parched and weary from battle. You stand in front of a tavern that serves the coldest, most delicious ale in all the realm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 bernadette Oh, I haven’t had a drink in months.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon What do you do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 bernadette I storm in, slam my sword down, and say, barkeep, bring me the strongest ale you have and serve it in the skull of a goblin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon He wants to see I.D.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 amy So, Claire, we’ve heard so many wonderful things about you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 claire Really? Like what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 amy Uh, mostly Penny’s heard them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 zack Boy, you get some dirty looks over there when you ask for ice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 raj Zack, this is my friend Claire.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 zack You’re hot. You seeing anybody?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 raj Uh, she’s seeing me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 zack Why’d you say she’s your friend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 raj We’re just keeping it casual.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 zack Why is he being casual with you? You seem great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 claire I don’t know. Ask him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 zack Why are you being casual with her? She seems great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 leonard Maybe we should take a step back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 howard Take a step back? I’m not a young man any more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 leonard No, I mean re-evaluate what we’re doing with the guidance system.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 howard But I got a baby on the way. I got to make some money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 leonard What good is money gonna do if we inadvertently bring about Armageddon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 howard Okay, let me stop you right there. We absolutely know our invention will not be used to destroy the world.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 leonard How?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 howard Because no one from the future has come back to kill us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 leonard Very funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 howard You got something better?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 leonard Well, not really.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 howard Okay, then. Geez, how much wine did you drink?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 leonard Not a lot. I just couldn’t start until you walked away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon The Hell Prawn lunges out of the hot spring. You block it with your shield. Do you attack?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 bernadette Does it have eyes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon Three giant red ones and they never blink. It’s unsettling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 bernadette I stab it in the middle eye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon Good choice. Critical hit. Your sword goes through its eye into its tiny brain. With its final dying gasp, it says, you have reduced me to a pile of sushi. Enjoy me with this packet of soy sauce. It’s low sodium. Aaaah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 bernadette Okay, I guess I should eat the Hell Prawn.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon Using your sword, you prepare a beautiful sushi dinner. You slip into the hot spring and enjoy the warm water on your aching joints. As you happily close your eyes, you recall the incredible evening you’ve had and notice that your feet and ankles are smaller than they’ve ever been. The end.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 bernadette Wow, this night turned out to be so much more fun than I thought.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon Oh, the fun doesn’t stop. You’re still going home with a goodie bag full of toast.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 bernadette Thank you for this. You know, ever since people found out I’m having a baby, I feel like I became Pregnant Bernadette. It was nice to take a little break tonight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon I can understand that. From the moment people realized I was a genius, I’ve been Sheldon the Genius. Although I’ve never really wanted a break from that, so I suppose I don’t understand. Which is ironic ’cause, you know, genius.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 bernadette Well, thanks again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon You’re welcome. And any time you need a break from being Bernadette the Pregnant, Bernatrix the Warrior Queen is here waiting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 bernadette I might just take you up on that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon Well, mind you now, that offer’s only good until the third trimester. I can’t risk getting amniotic fluid on my spot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 raj Hey, dude, you’re killing me with Claire.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 zack What are you talking about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 raj I mean, come on, look at you. You’re classically handsome, you’ve got a swimmer’s body. Next to you, I look like me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 zack Oh, man, I didn’t mean to do that. But I do appreciate you recognizing my swimmer’s body. Which, incidentally, I got from playing Marco Polo at the YMCA.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 raj Yeah, okay, just do me a favour and stop talking about how great Claire is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 zack Anything for you, my little foreign friend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 claire So, I got to ask, does Raj bring around other girls?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 penny Uh, you know, I’m not really around that much. Amy knows much more than I do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 leonard I don’t think you have anything to worry about. Raj is a terrific guy, loyal to a fault.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 howard Yeah. He still has an AOL address.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 zack I see what you’re saying. She’s not so great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 raj Don’t listen to him. He says crazy things all the time. Uh, watch. Marco.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 zack Polo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 raj So, uh, what are you guys talking about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 claire Your friends were just telling me about all the other girls you’re dating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 raj Why would you do that? I specifically asked you not to do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 penny We didn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 amy You just did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 zack Wow. Maybe none of you guys are smart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 leonard Morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon Morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 leonard Ugh. Too much wine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon Oh, I overdid it myself last night. Hair of the dog.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 leonard Hey, did you ever think about the military applications for the guidance system?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon Of course.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 leonard Does it bother you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon No, it did at first, but then I talked it through with Frank and Alicia, and they really helped put things into perspective.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 leonard Who are these people?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode22 sheldon Leonard, friends are like toilet paper. It’s good to have extras under the sink.
