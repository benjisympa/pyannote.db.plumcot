TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 penny Helium.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 penny Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon Taylor Swift.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 penny Yes. Pi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon Yes. Kardashian.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 penny More specific.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon Khloe?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 penny Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon See, I remembered because if it looks like Kim it’s Kim, if it looks kind of like Kim it’s Kourtney, and if it looks nothing like Kim it’s Khloe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 penny Oh, that’s a Venn Diagram, and I remember because I thought to myself, venn is he gonna stop talking about this diagram?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 leonard What are you guys doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon Oh, well, we decided to use our breakfast time to expand our respective knowledge bases.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 leonard Oh, let me try.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 penny Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 leonard Hmm, atom of hydrogen, Adam of Maroon 5, mic drop.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon I’m sorry, who is Mike Drop?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 leonard Oh, hey, Penny, do you want to go to the airport with me later to pick up my mother?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 penny Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 leonard Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 penny No problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 leonard Hey, Penny, um, since you’re already gonna be at the airport, do I need to go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon Why don’t you want to get your mother from the airport?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 leonard Well, I can do without the 40-minute car ride where she criticizes every aspect of my life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon She can cover it in a car ride? I could do 40 minutes on your posture alone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 penny You really want me to pick up your mother all by myself?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 leonard Hmm, I just feel like it would be a good chance for you to bond.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 penny Or a way for you to avoid her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 leonard I don’t know what he’s putting on those cards, but you are smarter than ever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 penny Fine, if you really want me to, I will pick your mom up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 leonard Seriously?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 penny Yeah, you know what, she is my mother-in-law, and I’d like for us to have a good relationship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 leonard That is very mature of you, so I’m gonna go ahead and say, suckah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon All right, back to learning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 penny Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon Oh, easy, Bill Nye the Science Guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 penny Or as I know him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon Creepy old dude from Dancing with the Stars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 penny Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 raj Did you guys see there’s an Avengers screening? Joss Whedon’s gonna show some deleted scenes and do a question and answer session.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon Oh, well, I have a few questions for him about the last Avengers movie, and a whole lot of answers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 leonard When’s the screening?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 raj Uh, it’s tonight, but it’s first-come, first-served, so we should probably get there early and wait in line.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 howard Let’s do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 leonard Penny’s busy with my mother, so I’m in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon Oh, bad news. Amy’s making me go shopping with her later, so looks like none of us can go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 leonard You do realize we’re allowed to have fun without you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 howard In fact, that’s usually the trick to it. What time do we need to get there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 raj Uh, I’d say by three.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon You’re really going without me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 leonard It’s not a big deal. Go shopping with Amy, and we’ll save a spot in line for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon You don’t have the authority to save places in the line. If I do that, I’ll be cutting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 leonard People do it all the time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon You know the golden rule of line etiquette. No cuts, no buts, no coconuts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 howard If you really care that much, there are apps now that’ll let you hire people to do stuff like errands and wait in lines.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 stuart People are actually waiting in lines as a job? Boy, makes me feel better about my life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 howard Some of these guys make over $20 an hour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 stuart And now I feel worse again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 beverly I’m not surprised Leonard chose to avoid picking me up. He’s battled intimacy issues his whole life. Does he have difficulty maintaining erections?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 penny Wow. Didn’t even make it out of the parking lot. Uh, you know what, enough about Leonard. Let’s talk about you. What would you like to do while you’re here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 beverly Dear, I’m a psychiatrist. You don’t have to avoid having intimate conversations with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 penny Well, I’d actually like for us to be close, but maybe we start with our favourite books and work our way up to my husband’s sex organs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 beverly Very well. What’s the last book you read?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 penny Um, does Pottery Barn, Spring count?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 beverly Penny, it’s only natural to want your mother-in-law to like you, and I acknowledge I can be an intimidating person. So what can I do to make this process easier for you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 penny Uh, for starters, maybe you can not psychoanalyze everything I say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 beverly And how does it make you feel when I psychoanalyze everything you say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 penny Uncomfortable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 beverly That was a joke, dear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 penny Oh. Sorry. Didn’t know you made those. Hey, listen, what if we have a little mother-in-law, daughter-in-law dinner tonight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 beverly So just the two of us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 penny Or I invite a few girlfriends, ’cause hearing you say the two of us just sent a chill right down my spine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 stuart Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 amy What are you doing here? You’re not Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 stuart I thought that might come up. Sheldon hired me to go shopping with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 amy Hold on. He paid you to get out of spending time with me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 stuart No, it’s not like that. There’s a long line he’d rather stand in. So what are we doing? Old Navy, Build-A-Bear? I get paid either way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 amy We’re not going shopping together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 stuart You sure? I’m happy to hold your bag. And Sheldon gave me money for a hotdog on a stick.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 amy Can you understand why I might be annoyed right now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 stuart Look, lady, I just work here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 howard We’ve waited in a lot of lines together, haven’t we?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon Remember when we camped out for the Doctor Who panel at Comic-Con?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 raj Yeah, sleeping under the stars with other fans who love the show as much as we do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 leonard Waking up, wondering which one of those fans stole our wallets.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon Stuart, what are you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 stuart Sheldon, you are the most inconsiderate person I have ever met in my entire life. Where do you get off sending me to shop with your girlfriend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon I don’t understand. You were happy to do this when I hired you. Why, why are you upset with me now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 stuart Oh, I’m not upset with you, but Amy’s pretty bent out of shape, so she hired me to let you have it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon Well, I suppose turnabout is fair play.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 stuart You’re darn right it’s fair play, you selfish jerk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 amy You know, just when I think we’re making progress in our relationship, we revert to our old patterns where thoughts and feelings go unexpressed. I mean, if he didn’t want to go shopping with me, why didn’t he just say so?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 beverly Maybe he couldn’t get a word in edgewise.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 amy I’m sorry, I’ve been going on and on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 beverly Oh, it’s all right, dear. Sheldon has a brilliant and complicated mind. It’s understandable that being in a relationship with him could be trying.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 amy I called him babe once. He asked me to get a drug test.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 beverly Well, I do admire your resolve. You’re an extraordinary woman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 amy Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 penny You know, she’s my mother-in-law. Why can’t I bond with her like that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 bernadette Amy’s with Sheldon who she loves like a son. You’re with her son, who she doesn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 amy Do you realize it took me five years to get a massage from him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 beverly Oh, well, that still could be a big step for Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 amy Three minutes. And he used a kitchen timer. I felt like a soft-boiled egg.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 penny You know, being in a relationship with Leonard also comes with its challenges.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 beverly Yes. Well, what can you do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 amy Maybe it’s Sheldon, here to say he’s sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 stuart Sheldon says he’s sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 amy Bernadette, I’ll give you five dollars to slam the door.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 stuart I would have done it for three.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 raj Boy, all this standing’s making me tired. Good thing I brought my collapsible stick chair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 howard Not the stick chair. You look like an idiot on that thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 raj Sticks and stones may break my bones, but chairs on sticks are comfy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 stuart Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon Hey. Is everything smoothed out with Amy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 stuart Uh, no, she’s still pretty mad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon Did you make the apology as sincere as I would have?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 stuart I said, Sheldon says he’s sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon Oh, well, that’s laying it on a little thick.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 leonard You think it’s time you apologize to her yourself?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon I suppose so. But if I get out of the line, I’ll lose my spot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 stuart I’m happy to hold your place till you get back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon You would do that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 stuart Consider it my way of getting more of your money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon You’re a good man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 bernadette So, Beverly, did you know Penny is the number three sales rep at our pharmaceutical company?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 beverly Oh, I didn’t realize you two work together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 bernadette Well, we don’t exactly. I’m a microbiologist for the research team.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 beverly Oh, what are you currently developing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 bernadette Some exciting new anti-anxiety drugs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 beverly That’s interesting. I just attended a lecture on pediatric anxiety.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 amy Oh, was it, uh, Dr. Jenofski? I just saw his TED Talk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 beverly It was.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 bernadette Well, let’s get back to Penny. Hey, weren’t you telling me something great about your company car?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 penny Um, it has seat warmers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon Amy. Amy. Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 amy Come in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon Hello, everyone. Oh, Beverly, good to see you. I’d love to chat, but there’s a line that could start moving any minute, so let’s do this. Amy? A proper apology requires three steps. Step one, an admission of wrongdoing. Amy, I was wrong. Step two, a promise never to repeat said action. Amy, that action will never be repeated, and that’s a promise. Step three, an earnest request for forgiveness. Amy, I hope you can forgive me. And I hope you do it right now, ’cause there’s an Uber waiting downstairs, and I don’t want to repeat this apology nonsense with my driver Ganesh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 amy Fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon Oh, thanks, you’re a peach. Beverly, we’ll catch up soon. Bernadette, it was a pleasure as always, Penny, you have spinach in your teeth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 penny How long have I had spinach in my teeth?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 beverly Since the airport, dear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 howard You look like you come with a kickstand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 raj You can’t make me feel bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 howard Hmm, maybe not. Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 leonard So, when the aliens brought you back, they just left the probe in?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon I’m back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 leonard Hey, how’d it go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon It went well. Yeah, I’ve learned that if you never say you’re sorry, the times you do really puts them on their heels. Uh, Stuart, I relieve you of your line duties.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 stuart Anyone else need anything before I go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 howard I’ll give you a dollar if you make fun of Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 stuart That’s mean.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 howard Five.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 stuart You look like Tigger if Tigger looked like a jackass.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 howard Uh, if you ever need a reference or anything, just let me know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 man Hey, guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 woman You made it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon Did you see that? He just cut the line.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 leonard He’s just joining his friends; it’s fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon No, it’s not fine. It is a breach of line etiquette.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 howard We’re near the front of the line. We’ll get in either way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon What if every person in front of us let someone cut?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 leonard We’d still get in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon What if each of those people let someone cut?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 leonard Still get in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon But then each of those people let someone cut?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 leonard We’d still get in, but first I’d hit you over the head with his stick chair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon Excuse me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 leonard Oh, please don’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon Uh, uh, I couldn’t help but notice that you cut the line.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 man Oh, uh, I’m with my friends. It’s cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon Well, no. It’s not cool. If there were reserved seating, and we all had tickets, that would be fine. But this line is first-come, first-served. Not show up tardy and nevertheless be first served. Right here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 leonard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon You need to go to the back of the line.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 man Uh, who made you line monitor?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon Mrs. Wunch in fourth grade. And my slogan was a line that’s straight is a line that’s great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 man Is this guy for real?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 leonard Boy, I wish I could say no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 beverly That was very nice of Sheldon to apologize.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 amy Well, he’s come a long way. Or a short way very slowly, so it feels like a long way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 beverly Your relationship with him is fascinating. I’m preparing to write a book on high-achieving couples, and I would love to interview the both of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 amy Oh, sure. I’ll, I’ll talk to Sheldon about it. You know, Bernadette’s husband is a former astronaut.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 beverly Really? Do you think he would be interested in being interviewed as well?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 bernadette Do I think he’d be interested? Sometimes I hear him pretending to be interviewed when he’s alone in the bathroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 beverly Wonderful. I’ll give you my contact information.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 bernadette Um, you should probably talk to Penny, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 beverly About what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 penny Okay, you know what? This is ridiculous. I’ve been trying to make a connection with you all day, and clearly I’m getting nowhere.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 beverly Well, are you seeking a connection or just some form of validation?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 penny What I was seeking was some sort of friendship. But at this point, I’ll take you not insulting me to my face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 beverly My intention was never to insult you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 penny You’ve been doing it all day. Do you even know what an insult is?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 beverly Well, it’s not a clinical term. But one example would be your marrying my son, and not inviting me or even telling me the wedding was taking place.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 penny Okay, good example.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon What about Joss Whedon’s work makes you think he’d be okay with rule-breakers and line-cutters?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 man The Avengers are rule-breakers. Being vengeful is in their job description.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon They work for SHIELD, which is a sanctioned department of the U.S. Government. Do you work for a sanctioned department of the U.S. Government?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 man As a matter of fact I do. At a little place called the DMV.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 raj He’s got him there. The D even stands for department.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon Excuse me, excuse me, can I please see a show of hands? Who here takes issue with this person cutting the line?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 man Told you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon Well, what a sad state of affairs. That you’ve all been so ground down by life, you don’t even notice when someone disrespects you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 howard I can’t believe we’re gonna get beat up, and it’s not because of your chair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon You know, right now, at the back of this line, there’s a movie fan like you who’s not going to get in, because this person simply doesn’t care. Yeah, well, 61 years ago, there was another person at the back of the line and her name was Rosa Parks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 leonard Okay, you may have to pretend you’re black to get us out of here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon Now, let’s follow in that brave woman’s footsteps, and stand up for ourselves. And, and I realize that she stood up by remaining seated, but now is not the time to enjoy the irony of that. Now, I ask you again. Who here takes issue with this person…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 woman Why should we listen to you? You cut the line yourself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon I most certainly did not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 woman I saw you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 man If you’re feeling dizzy, it’s because the tables have turned.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon Excuse me, I paid someone to wait in line for me, and then when I arrived, he left, so what you saw, my good woman, was swapsies, not cutsies. Oh, no, no, no, no, wait, I ask you all again, a show of hands. Who here takes issue… well, stop moving. he’s gonna get in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 leonard Buddy, let it go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon No, I can’t. This isn’t right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 leonard You did everything you could.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 sheldon No, I could’ve done more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 leonard Now, now, you denigrated the memory of a great civil rights pioneer. That’s all anyone could ask.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 penny To be honest, I’m surprised you cared about the wedding at all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 beverly I’m still human, Penny. Not getting invited to my own son’s wedding is difficult to ignore.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 amy I know how you feel. She didn’t invite any of us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 penny It was spur of the moment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 bernadette But we did get to see a live stream of it on the Internet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 beverly I could’ve watched it on the Internet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 penny Thank you. So if we would have asked you to come to Vegas to see us get married, you would’ve come?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 beverly No, I would’ve said you’re making a huge mistake. But an invitation would’ve been nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 penny You really think we made a mistake?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 beverly At the time I did. But I’ve never seen Leonard so happy, so perhaps I was wrong.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 penny Wow. Okay. Well, um, how about this? Maybe while you’re still in town, Leonard and I could have another small ceremony. You know, if you’re interested.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 beverly I would find that perfectly acceptable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 penny She would find it perfectly acceptable. You guys saw it. We bonded.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 bernadette Howie? You doing okay? You’ve been in there a while.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode23 howard I’m fine. Be right out. Am I an American hero? Well, that’s a good question, Jim. Don’t you think once an astronaut leaves the planet, he’s a hero to all the nations of the Earth? Okey dokey. I think I have time for one more question.
