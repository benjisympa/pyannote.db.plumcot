TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 leonard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 penny Hi, how was the screening?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 leonard Oh, Sheldon invoked Rosa Parks to make somebody who cut the line feel bad, but only the white people felt bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 penny Ugh, I should’ve never bought him that colouring book that explains Black History Month.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 leonard How’d it go with my mother?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 penny Uh, you know, it started a little rocky, but I think we got to a good place.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 leonard Wow. Well done.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 penny Yeah, and when I dropped her off at the hotel, she even gave me a hug.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 leonard Did she think you were choking or… I’m sorry, that’s great. Thank you for spending time with her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 penny No problem. Um, so listen, I don’t know if you have any plans next weekend, but I kind of promised your mom we’d have another wedding ceremony so she could attend this time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 leonard Wait, we’re gonna get married again?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 penny Yeah, kind of, but now we can invite our friends and family.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 leonard Seems like a lot of trouble for a hug.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 penny Come on, it’ll be fun, and, you know, your mom was genuinely hurt we didn’t invite her to the first one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 leonard Look, in our defence, it was kind of a spur of the moment thing, and also, we don’t like her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 penny Leonard, come on, she’s your mom. If we can do something to make her happy, why wouldn’t we?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 leonard I just said why, we don’t like her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 penny Hey, look, then forget about her, let’s do it for us. We could keep it small and informal. This time we can invite our families.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 leonard Is your brother out of prison?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 penny Thanks to overcrowding, yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 leonard I’d love it if my dad could come.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 penny Oh, you have to invite him. I haven’t seen him since the divorce.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 leonard Oh, he’s like a different man. He stopped twitching, and I think he grew an inch and a half.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 penny Well, then it’s settled. Yay. So funny. I never thought my second marriage would be to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 penny Okay, so it’s not a legal ceremony, it’s just a chance for us to redo our vows so everyone can be part of it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 amy So there’s no maid of honour?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 amy Huh. But if I were to, say, wear a purple satin dress with a sweetheart neckline and stand near you, you wouldn’t be able to stop me, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 penny I don’t see how I could.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 amy Then I graciously accept.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 bernadette Who’s going to officiate?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 penny I was kind of hoping you would.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 amy Wait, now I’m just some lousy maid of honour?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 sheldon Hey, good news, I just got off the phone with my mother. She is coming to the wedding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 penny Okay, wait, you’re inviting people to our wedding?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 sheldon Yes, I’m inviting people to our wedding. Yeah, I’ve already asked Stephen Hawking and Robert Downey Jr, and, now don’t get your hopes up, ’cause he’s pretty busy, but Erno Rubik.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 bernadette Who’s Erno Rubik?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 sheldon Seriously? He invented the Rubik’s Cube.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 penny Okay, fine, but why would you invite him to our wedding?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 sheldon Because, despite his fame and fortune, he strikes me as a lonely man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 bernadette Well, it’s very sweet of you to go to all this trouble for Leonard’s mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 penny Yeah, I’m also doing it for Leonard. I think this could really help their relationship.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 beverly How dare you invite your father without consulting me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 leonard Sorry, but I don’t think I need your permission to have my father at my wedding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 beverly You do understand our marriage ended because he had an affair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 leonard I know, and there’s no excuse for that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 beverly He claimed I was cold, emasculating, and hadn’t shown him any physical affection for years.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 leonard I was wrong, there’s three excuses for that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 howard Oh, my God. It’s working.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 raj You sure?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 howard Look. The system is maintaining its own stability, the quantum vortex apparatus is now controlling the orientation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 raj You’re right. You realize what this means?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 howard Yeah. I do. It’s proof of concept. We’ve got a workable guidance system.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 raj Congratulations.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 howard Thanks. Hey, I just got an e-mail from the U.S. Air Force.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 raj Open it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 howard Hmm. We request a meeting at your earliest convenience regarding your quantum guidance system, provisional patent 62/295118. That’s weird.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 raj Is there a window around here we don’t know about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 howard I’m sure it’s just a coincidence.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 raj Yeah, of course. What else could it be? Boy, do I love America.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 mary_cooper Thank you for picking me up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 sheldon Oh, you’re welcome.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 mary I was speaking to your young lady.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 amy My pleasure, Mrs. Cooper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 mary Oh, please call me Mary.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 amy Okay, Mary.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 sheldon You know, that doesn’t work for me, let’s stay with Mrs. Cooper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 mary Sheldon, don’t be silly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 sheldon Wu-wu, what? That’s what I called you till I got to know you better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 mary It was so nice of Leonard and Penny to invite me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 sheldon Well, actually, I…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 amy It sure was.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 mary I’ve always had a special place in my heart for Leonard. Taking care of my baby all these years.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 sheldon Excuse me, I take care of him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 mary Sure you do. So who else is coming to this shindig?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 amy Oh, well, the usual gang. Penny’s family is coming tomorrow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 sheldon Yeah, and Leonard’s mother’s already here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 mary Oh, Beverly. How nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 amy You’ve met her, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 mary Yes, I have.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 sheldon Mother, she’s an atheist, not a vampire.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 mary Either way, let’s stop and get some garlic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 beverly So, Mary, how have you been?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 mary Well, thank you so much for asking. I’ve been well, and you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 beverly Very good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 mary Good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 sheldon I don’t know what we were worried about, they’re getting along great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 mary Sheldon tells me your husband’s coming.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 beverly My ex-husband.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 mary Oh, I’m so sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 beverly Don’t be.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 mary All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 penny Whew, chilly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 amy I think I can see my breath.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 beverly We can hear you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 penny Sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 amy Sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 howard I can’t believe I was so naive. The military is just gonna take over the whole project. And you know what happens if we object? We disappear. Like off the map. Like every American Idol winner since season four.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 bernadette Come on, Howard, you’re overreacting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 howard Am I? Am I? What, what do you want to bet some black ops guy is reprinting my high school yearbook and I’m no longer in it? That chess club picture is now just David Zimmerman and Elaine Cho.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 raj Okay, look, I’m on the Air Force Web site, and the department that e-mailed you is in charge of acquisitions. So maybe they just want to give you a lot of money for your invention.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 howard Oh, please, that’s not how it works. You saw E.T., Avatar, Jurassic World. The military just shows up and takes over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 bernadette You do realize those weren’t documentaries, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 howard I’m sorry, you find this funny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 raj No, I was just thinking about Jurassic World. Boy, that was terrible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 leonard Oh, we have to use the stairs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 alfred_hofstadter When are they gonna fix your elevator?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 leonard Uh, I don’t, any day now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 alfred Well, the stairs are fine. Besides, your mother is up there. Maybe I’ll have a heart attack and not have to see her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 leonard Hey, I, I know things are a little rough with you and Mom, but I’m really glad you’re here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 alfred Me, too. I should have never had that angioplasty because I feel fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 leonard Penny’s really looking forward to seeing you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 alfred Ah, she’s a sweetie. You got a good one there, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 leonard Thanks, Dad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 alfred How the hell did you do that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 sheldon Isn’t this nice?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 leonard Hey, we’re here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 penny Alfred. Thank you for coming!
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 alfred Oh. Well, happy to be here. And congratulations.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 penny Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 leonard Dad, you remember Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 sheldon Dr. Hofstadter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 alfred Dr. Cooper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 leonard This is Sheldon’s mother, Mary.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 alfred How do you do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 mary Nice to meet you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 leonard And his girlfriend, Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 alfred A pleasure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 amy Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 leonard And, of course, Mom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 alfred Hello, my hateful shrew.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 beverly Hello to you, you wrinkled old bastard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 sheldon All right, now I’m starting to sense a little tension.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 leonard All right, you two, don’t start. Penny and I are throwing this second wedding for your benefit. Can you please not ruin it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 alfred Of course. I’m sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 beverly Oh, look at that, you can apologize.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 leonard Mom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 beverly I’m sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 mary You know, the Bible says forgiveness…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 sheldon Mom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 mary I’m sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 penny Uh, who’s hungry? We have a reservation at the best restaurant in town.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 sheldon It only got three-and-a-half stars on Yelp.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 amy Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 sheldon I’m not sorry. That’s true.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 howard I don’t know what to do. It’s the Air Force. I mean, should I respond to their e-mail? Ignore it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 raj You can’t ignore it. It’s not that postcard that says it’s time to go back to the dentist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 bernadette Guys, come on. We’re meeting everyone for dinner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 howard One sec. I’m just afraid if I respond, then they’ll know I got it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 raj Oh, dude. The minute you opened that e-mail, they knew you got it. I mean, they’re probably looking at you through the camera right now. I love America.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 bernadette Are you done with this nonsense?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 howard It’s not nonsense. This is how the U.S. military works.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 raj Oh, if it’s even the U.S. Military. It could be foreign military pretending to be American.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 howard You’re right. We turn our guidance system over to them, next thing we know, they’re using it against us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 raj I also love the enemies of America.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 beverly Penny, I hope the example of my failed marriage to Leonard’s father doesn’t discourage you from the commitment you’ve made to one another.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 penny No, of course not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 beverly Although Alfred and I had a lot more going for us than you two.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 leonard Mom, please save something for the toast.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 mary So, Alfred, what is it that you do for a living?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 alfred Oh, I’m an anthropologist. I study ancient peoples and cultures.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 mary My goodness, so all the way back to the Flood.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 sheldon Don’t laugh, she wasn’t joking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 amy Play with your phone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 alfred Well, on that note, there are many cultures that have an apocalyptic flood as part of their mythology.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 mary I don’t have a mythology. I have the unerring Word of God. But that’s very interesting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 alfred Oh. I, I didn’t mean to disparage your faith. Actually, I admire it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 mary Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 alfred Yes. Yes, I’m an agnostic myself, but I have prayed, many times, to God, to turn my wife into a pillar of salt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 mary Well, He came close. Turned her into a giant block of ice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 raj Howard, there must be someone at the university you can go to for help.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 howard Are you kidding? They’re probably the ones who leaked it to the military in the first place.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 raj What about the guy on the Channel Four News? You know, Four on Your Side? Maybe he can be on your side.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 howard I’m being harassed by the government, not trying to get to the bottom of a dog-walking scam.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 bernadette Oh, stop. You know what’s really happening? All the movies you’ve watched, the TV shows, the comic books, they’ve completely twisted your thinking. No one’s after you, no one’s listening to you, no one cares about you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 raj I’d like to think the Four on Your Side guy cares about me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 penny You know, Beverly, I know you and Alfred have your differences, but if you think about it, if you hadn’t married him, there’d be no Leonard. So that’s good, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 beverly Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 leonard Is that Howard in front of us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 penny Oh, maybe. Get closer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 howard Oh, God. I think someone’s following us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 bernadette You’re being ridiculous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 howard I’m not being ridiculous, he’s right on my tail.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 raj Uh, turn left here and see if he turns with us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 penny Well, why is he turning here? The restaurant’s the other way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 leonard I don’t know. He uses that traffic app. Maybe there’s an accident.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 penny Oh, so follow him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 raj Oh, no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 howard I told you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 bernadette It’s probably just a coincidence. Speed up a little, see if he stays with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 penny Well, go faster. You’re losing him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 leonard What is his hurry?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 penny You know what, flash your lights. Let him know it’s you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 howard He’s flashing his lights. What’s that mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 raj I, I think he wants us to pull over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 bernadette Do not pull over. I’m not raising this baby alone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 howard Hang on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 alfred So, after your husband passed, you never remarried?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 mary No, just focused on work and the church.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 alfred Ah. And what do you do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 mary I work at the church.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 alfred Well, they’re lucky to have you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 mary Well, thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 alfred You’re welcome.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 amy Do you realize what’s happening here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 sheldon Yeah, I do. They’re filling up on bread and ruining their meal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 leonard Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 penny Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 amy What took you guys so long?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 leonard Oh, we were following Howard, but for some reason, he turned off his headlights and went up a one-way street.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 penny So, what did we miss?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 alfred Oh, just Mary and I getting to know each other a little.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 mary Leonard, your father is just charming.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 beverly He’s also broke. Did he mention that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 leonard Okay, Mom, you sit over there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 penny Yeah, I’m gonna call Bernadette and see what’s keeping them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 sheldon If I’d known you were broke, I wouldn’t have made a big deal about the bread.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 bernadette Hey, Penny. What are you talking about? Oh, that was you? Long story. Why don’t you go ahead and eat. We’re gonna be a while.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 howard I’m telling you, I’m not on drugs. The government’s out to get me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 alfred Now, one of the more exciting things to be found recently is that Neanderthals and Homo Sapiens frequently mated with each other.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 mary Well, that certainly explains my marriage to Sheldon’s father.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 sheldon That’s funny, because my father was not a very clever man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 amy I’d be lost without you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 leonard Uh, I would like to propose a toast to my wife and bride-to-be.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 sheldon See, that’s funny because…
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 amy Back to your phone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 leonard Penny, I’ve always known I loved you, but this last year has shown me that I also love being married to you. Thank you for saying yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 penny Oh, thanks for asking until I did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 amy Hear, hear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 leonard Cheers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 alfred I, uh, I would also like to make a toast.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 penny Aw.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 alfred Leonard, I am so happy that you have found a woman who loves and cares for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 beverly What the hell is that supposed to mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 alfred Why don’t you take a pill?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 beverly Like you did before sex?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 alfred What I really needed was a blindfold.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 beverly Oh, dear woman, can you please read another book?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 mary When God writes one, I will.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 penny Um, if, if we want to order the soufflé, we might want to get on that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 alfred Leonard, if you don’t mind, I, I think I’m a little tired. I’m gonna call it a night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 leonard Sure, Dad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 mary I’m a little tuckered out myself, so I will see you all in the morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 alfred Would you like to share a cab?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 mary That would be fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 alfred Where are you staying?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 mary I’m at the Westin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 alfred Oh, so am I. Can I interest you in a nightcap?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 mary I think that you could.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 leonard What is happening there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 sheldon I think it’s pretty obvious. They don’t want dessert ’cause they filled up on bread.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 sheldon She’s still not answering.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 leonard My father’s not texting me back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 penny ‘Cause they both turned their phones off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 sheldon I don’t like this at all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 leonard I don’t like it either.
TheBigBangTheory.Season09.Episode24 penny Really? ‘Cause I love it.
