TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon Leonard? Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon You realize you and I could become brothers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard We’re not gonna be brothers. We’re not gonna be stepbrothers. Go to sleep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon I hope you’re right. ‘Cause a grown man living with his brother and his brother’s wife is weird.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard Go to sleep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon Okay. Do you think your father’s doing unspeakable things to my mother?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon Are you saying that because the things are unspeakable?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny Your parents are old. Anything unspeakable was finished by 9:30. Go to sleep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon Very well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard I’m sorry if this stuff is gonna make the ceremony awkward.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny God, I thought my brother fresh out of jail was gonna make everyone uncomfortable, but now this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon Hey, if you want me to sleep you’re gonna have to stop talking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny Okay, I’m gonna go pick up my family. Like an hour and half, two hours, depending on traffic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard Yeah, drive safe. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny Oh, hey, and do yourself a favour, all right? When Beverly gets here, do not bring up last night. All right? As far as you’re concerned, you don’t know anything, you didn’t see anything. I want you just to play dumb.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon It was nice of her to show us playing dumb with an example.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny What? Oh. Hi. Okay, hey there, I got, I’m sorry, I got to go now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 beverley Penny, wait.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 beverley I wanted to thank you for going through all the trouble of planning a second wedding ceremony for me, but unfortunately I cannot attend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard Well, why? What’s wrong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon Whuh, are we still doing the dumb thing? Okay, why, what’s wrong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 beverley I just cannot stay here while your father goes out of his way to humiliate me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon Oh, golly, however did he humiliate you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 beverley Stop it, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon Do I say stop what, or just throw in the towel?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 beverley I don’t see why I should have to watch your father parade around with some bible-thumping bumpkin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon Oh, excuse me, that is my mother you’re talking about, however accurately.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny Okay, Beverley, aren’t you overreacting a little? All we know is they shared a cab and had a nightcap. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon And turned their phones off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard Not helping, buddy. Mother, Penny and I really want you to be part of this. Please stay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny Yeah, plus if you leave, Alfred will know he got under your skin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 beverley Well, we can’t have that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon You know, also, if they did have coitus, we’ll all be needing a skilled psychiatrist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 raj It is funny when you think about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 howard Maybe to you. You didn’t get a $500 traffic ticket.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 bernadette Because you were driving like a lunatic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 howard Hey, if thinking secret government agents are chasing you makes you a lunatic, then, yeah, okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 raj Oh, I’ll get it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 bernadette It didn’t help that you couldn’t walk a straight line when the cop pulled you over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 howard I have performance anxiety. You of all people should know that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 raj Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 air_force_officer I’m looking for Howard Wolowitz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 raj Howard Wolowitz?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 air_force_officer I have the right address, don’t I?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 raj Address?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 air_force_officer Is he here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 raj Um, no. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 air_force_officer Do you know where I can find him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 raj May I ask what this is about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 air_force_officer No, you may not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 raj Very well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 air_force_officer Have him call me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 raj Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 howard Raj, who’s at the door?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 raj That’s not him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny Oh, I can’t wait for you to meet everyone. I told them all about you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 susan Like what? Do they know about your brother?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny Uh, not everything, just, like, the jail and drugs part.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 susan Why would you do that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 susan The world doesn’t need to know our problems.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny Well, Mom, I’m sorry, but…
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 wyatt Hey, look, they got Walgreens here, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 susan You really think it’s helpful to change the subject, Wyatt?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 wyatt Just trying to make this a happy trip, dear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 susan Well, quit it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny So, uh, Randall, can’t believe after all these years you finally get to visit me in California.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 randall Well, good thing I was a non-violent offender, otherwise I couldn’t have left the state.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 susan All right, that’s enough jail talk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 randall Penny knows where I was, she sent me cigarettes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 susan You sent your brother cigarettes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 wyatt He was cooking and selling crystal meth, Susan, I think we can let the cigarettes slide.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 susan Stop trying to be the cool dad, you have a shirt with our cat’s picture on it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 wyatt Anyway, we’re here, slugger.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 howard That’s great, now they know where I live.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 raj What are you talking about? They’ve always known where you live.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 bernadette Yeah, if you want to go off the grid, you have to move out of your mother’s house.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 raj Can we take a moment to discuss that I just lied to the government for you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 howard Yeah. I would not have done that for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 bernadette Howard, please just call the man, see what he wants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 howard All right, all right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 raj Hey, make sure you tell him that you weren’t home when he came by and that your Indian friend gave you the message the moment you stepped through the door.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 howard Yes, hello. Uh, this is Howard Wolowitz for Colonel Richard Williams.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 raj Oh, I take it back, don’t mention me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 howard Hi, Colonel Williams, how can I help you? What? Oh, uh, yes, he is from India. No, I don’t know his immigration status. Relax, I’m still on hold. Speaking. Okay, sure, I can meet with you on Thursday. Caltech is fine. Yeah, and may I ask what this is about? I may not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 raj That’s what he said to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard Here you are, Mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 beverley Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard I’m glad you decided to stay. It’s gonna be special for Penny and me to share this with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 beverley I can’t wait for this day to be over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard Yeah, special, like that. That’s them. Please don’t make things any more awkward than they already are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon All right, so less or equally awkward, got it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard Hey, guys, come on in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 alfred Oh, thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 mary Good morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 beverley Morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 alfred How is everyone today?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 beverley Good, and you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 alfred Good, good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 beverley Good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 mary I’m good, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 beverley Good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon So, did you defile my mother or not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 mary Sheldon. You’re being rude.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 alfred If I may, I can assure you, your mother and I did nothing more than share a cab and a conversation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon Did that conversation include the phrase your genitals are a joy to behold?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 mary That’s enough.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 alfred Look, I promise you, neither I, nor anyone, has ever said that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard You don’t know his girlfriend very well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon Or what a joy it is to behold my genitals.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny All right, you guys, uh, get settled in, then we’ll go across the hall and say hi to everyone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 randall You know, It’s hard to believe I’ve never met Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 wyatt Well, he probably buys his illegal drugs from a local vendor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 susan Not funny, Wyatt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny I thought it was really funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 wyatt Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 susan Well, fine, if everyone wants to make jokes about our problems, then I can, too. Knock, knock. Who’s there? Our family is an embarrassment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 randall That’s not much of a joke.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny Okay. Listen, Mom, I know you’re nervous, but I promise you, no one is gonna judge you or this family.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 susan Oh, I’m sorry. It’s just we’re meeting Leonard’s parents for the first time, and, and they’re academics and, and intellectuals, and I don’t want them thinking we’re white trash.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 randall Well, what colour trash do you think they’ll believe?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 mary How could you think that I would spend the night with a man I just met?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon A man named Jesus convinced you to build a church in Africa. You’re kind of a sucker.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard Well, nothing happened, right? It’s over. Until we get married a third time, you guys will never have to see each other again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 alfred Well, you know, actually that’s not the case. Mary may visit me in New York.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 mary Mm-hmm. And he’s never been to Texas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 alfred Maybe we meet halfway.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon What? In the Chattahoochee National Forest in Georgia? I can’t be the only one that knows that’s halfway.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 beverley You’re not seriously going to visit each other.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 alfred And why wouldn’t we?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 beverley Oh please, you’re just saying this to antagonize me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 alfred Oh, not at all. Mary happens to be a wonderful woman. And if it antagonizes you, that’s just a bonus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard Mary, I’m sorry you’re in the middle of this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 mary No, no, nothing to be sorry about. I genuinely like your father.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon What? But he’s a mediocre academic. And according to Beverley, his sexual prowess is sub-par. He’s basically Leonard with a bigger prostate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard Are you saying that my dad’s not good enough for your mom?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon Yes, while also getting in a solid dig at you. Pretty efficient, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard This is ridiculous. I’m going across the hall.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon But why should you get to go and leave me here with your bickering parents?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard Fine, then you go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 mary Well, I don’t want to stay here with her. I’ll go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 alfred I’ll go with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard That still leaves me here with him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 amy Who’s ready for a wedding?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon Great, now I have to start all over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 wyatt So how’s the world of pharmaceuticals treating you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny Pretty good. I actually just got assigned a much better territory.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 susan See what happens when you work hard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 randall Hey, she just sells drugs. I had to make ’em.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 susan Okay, that’s enough. No more drug talk for the rest of this trip.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 wyatt I’ll drink to that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 susan Haven’t you had enough?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 wyatt Penny drinks more than I do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny Well, I learned from the best.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 wyatt Aw.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny Aw.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 susan Very nice, Wyatt. And you wonder why this one turned out the way he did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 randall You see what I’ve gotta put up with.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 susan What you’ve gotta put up with? Why did you have to go to jail?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 randall It’s called getting caught, Mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 wyatt Hey, there he is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 susan Oh, Leonard. It’s so nice to see you again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard Oh, you, too. Hey, everyone, this is my mother, Beverley.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 beverley Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 susan Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 randall We are not white trash.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 amy Are you excited to see your son walk down the aisle?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 alfred Yes, I am. I’m just feeling a little guilty about all the trouble I’ve caused.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 mary Oh, so am I.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon You made God sad today, Mom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 amy Sheldon, they haven’t done anything wrong. I think it’s nice they’re hitting it off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon Well, that’s still no reason to rush into anything. I mean, look at us. We took things remarkably slow. You and I, we didn’t even hold hands for two years.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 amy It was a lot hotter than it sounds.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 alfred You’re a patient young lady.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon Hey, hey. She’s mine, take a cold shower, grandpa.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 howard Why wouldn’t that colonel say what the meeting’s about? It has to be bad news.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 raj Calm down, okay? Try not to think about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 howard That’s really stupid advice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 raj You know that hurts my feelings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 howard Calm down, try not to think about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 raj Okay. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 howard Why do I bother talking to you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 raj Oh, come on. What’s the worst that could come of this meeting?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 howard I don’t know. They take the invention away, and I get nothing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 raj Okay, that’s not so bad. You know what happened to the scientists that worked on the Manhattan Project? The government forced them to move to the desert. They had to live in secret, and when Oppenheimer objected to what they made him do, they destroyed his reputation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 howard What’s the point of that story?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 raj I just read a book about Oppenheimer, seemed like a chance to show off. There he is, there’s my happy Hebraic homeboy. Yeah, that’s the smile I’m gonna remember when you’re living in the desert and I’m living with your wife.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 beverley So, what do you do for a living?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 randall Mommy, you want to take this one?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 susan Um, Randall’s in between jobs. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 randall And court appearances.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 wyatt It’s nice to meet the woman who raised this fine young man. I’m looking forward to meeting his father.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 beverley Prepare to be disappointed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard And he can’t wait to meet you, too. Can I get anyone a drink?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 wyatt Well, I could use another beer. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 susan You’re done. He’s done.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny Hey. Is everyone getting to know each other?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 randall Not at all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 stuart Nice to see you again, Dr. Hofstadter. I’m, uh, Leonard’s friend, Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 beverley Nice to see you, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 stuart Hi, I’m Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 alfred Oh, I’m Alfred. Leonard’s father.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 stuart Oh. Oh, hi. Uh, I’m sorry, did you two want to sit together?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 together No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 stuart I was wondering why the front row was available.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 bernadette Okay, I think we’re ready.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon Why do people cry at weddings?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 mary They’re practicing for what’s coming later.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 susan Thank you for cleaning yourself up for your sister’s wedding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 randall Thank you for my new teeth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 wyatt Welcome to the family, Leonard. Don’t lend your new brother-in-law money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 bernadette We’re here today to celebrate love.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 beverley Urgh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 alfred Sigh louder, no one heard you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 stuart Really, I can move.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 bernadette Not just Leonard and Penny’s love, but the love we have for them, as well as each other.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon Speaking of love, STDs among the elderly are skyrocketing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 bernadette Love is patient, but it’s not gonna put up with all the side chatter, so let’s knock it off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 howard At least she’s yelling at someone else for a change.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 bernadette Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny Okay, I understand everyone’s a little tense today, so I am just gonna get to the important stuff. Leonard, standing here with you in front of our family and friends is bringing up a lot of feelings. Like what a good idea it was to elope the first time. But also how incredibly happy you make me. Thank you for marrying me. Hopefully for the last time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard Penny, as a scientist, my job is to figure out why things happen. But I don’t think I’ll ever understand how someone like me could get to be with someone like you. You know, maybe I don’t
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 bernadette Anybody have anything snarky to say about that? Didn’t think so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 alfred I’d like to say something. Beverly, I know that we don’t bring out the best in each other. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 beverley I couldn’t agree more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 stuart That’s beautiful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 bernadette Thank you. All right, let’s continue.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon Yeah, excuse me, I need to say something to someone pretty special, and I just can’t wait any longer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 amy It’s happening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon Leonard, you and I have our ups and downs. But I have always considered you my family. Even before the recent threat of our parents fornicating like wrinkly old rabbits. I don’t always show it, but you are of great importance to me. Both of you. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 bernadette Okay. I now pronounce you husband and wife. And weird other husband who came with the apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 beverley Thank you for taking us to the airport.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard Hey, I’m just thrilled we’re all getting along for a minute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 alfred Yeah, me, too. Beverly, I’m sorry if I upset you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 beverley Water under the bridge, Alfred. Leonard, why don’t you get into the carpool lane?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 alfred Well, that’s a solid line. He can’t cross that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard That’s okay. I can make it over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 beverley No, no, let’s plod along. It’ll make your father feel more comfortable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 alfred What makes me comfortable is knowing I don’t have to wake up tomorrow morning and see your sour face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 beverley Do the world a favour, and don’t wake up tomorrow morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard That was almost a minute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 mary There’s a lot of traffic. Are we gonna be okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 amy You’ll be at the airport an hour before your flight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 mary Good. Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon Plenty of time for you to meet another geriatric boy toy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 mary Hey. I will not have you be disrespectful to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon Yes ma’am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 amy Sheldon, you’re mother’s an attractive woman. You need to get use to the fact that men are going to be interested in her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon Well, and you need to drive the car and mind your business.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 amy I will not have you be disrespectful to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon What, you’re not my mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 mary Don’t you be disrespectful to her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon Yes ma’am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 mary You’ll get there. You’ve just gotta put some zing on it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 susan Penny, I don’t know what I was worried about. You’re friends are just lovely.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny Oh, thanks, Mom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 susan Although that Sheldon is a bit peculiar.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny Is he? I never noticed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 wyatt He reminds me of that turkey we had who drowned looking up at the rain.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 randall Cops, cops, be cool.
