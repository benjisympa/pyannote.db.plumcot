TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Leonard? Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon_cooper You realize you and I could become brothers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter We’re not gonna be brothers. We’re not gonna be stepbrothers. Go to sleep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon_cooper I hope you’re right. ‘Cause a grown man living with his brother and his brother’s wife is weird.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Go to sleep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Okay. Do you think your father’s doing unspeakable things to my mother?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Are you saying that because the things are unspeakable?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny Your parents are old. Anything unspeakable was finished by 9:30. Go to sleep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Very well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter I’m sorry if this stuff is gonna make the ceremony awkward.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny God, I thought my brother fresh out of jail was gonna make everyone uncomfortable, but now this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Hey, if you want me to sleep you’re gonna have to stop talking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny Okay, I’m gonna go pick up my family. Like an hour and half, two hours, depending on traffic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, drive safe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny Oh, hey, and do yourself a favour, all right? When Beverly gets here, do not bring up last night. All right? As far as you’re concerned, you don’t know anything, you didn’t see anything. I want you just to play dumb.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon_cooper It was nice of her to show us playing dumb with an example.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny What? Oh. Hi. Okay, hey there, I got, I’m sorry, I got to go now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 dr_beverly_hofstadter Penny, wait.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 dr_beverly_hofstadter I wanted to thank you for going through all the trouble of planning a second wedding ceremony for me, but unfortunately I cannot attend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Well, why? What’s wrong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Whuh, are we still doing the dumb thing? Okay, why, what’s wrong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 dr_beverly_hofstadter I just cannot stay here while your father goes out of his way to humiliate me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Oh, golly, however did he humiliate you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 dr_beverly_hofstadter Stop it, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Do I say stop what, or just throw in the towel?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 dr_beverly_hofstadter I don’t see why I should have to watch your father parade around with some bible-thumping bumpkin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Oh, excuse me, that is my mother you’re talking about, however accurately.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny Okay, Beverley, aren’t you overreacting a little? All we know is they shared a cab and had a nightcap.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon_cooper And turned their phones off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Not helping, buddy. Mother, Penny and I really want you to be part of this. Please stay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny Yeah, plus if you leave, Alfred will know he got under your skin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 dr_beverly_hofstadter Well, we can’t have that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon_cooper You know, also, if they did have coitus, we’ll all be needing a skilled psychiatrist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 raj_koothrappali It is funny when you think about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Maybe to you. You didn’t get a $500 traffic ticket.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 bernadette_rostenkowski Because you were driving like a lunatic.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Hey, if thinking secret government agents are chasing you makes you a lunatic, then, yeah, okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Oh, I’ll get it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 bernadette_rostenkowski It didn’t help that you couldn’t walk a straight line when the cop pulled you over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 howard_wolowitz I have performance anxiety. You of all people should know that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 air_force_officer#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 I’m looking for Howard Wolowitz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Howard Wolowitz?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 air_force_officer#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 I have the right address, don’t I?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Address?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 air_force_officer#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 Is he here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Um, no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 air_force_officer#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 Do you know where I can find him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 raj_koothrappali May I ask what this is about?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 air_force_officer#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 No, you may not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Very well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 air_force_officer#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 Have him call me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Raj, who’s at the door?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 raj_koothrappali That’s not him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny Oh, I can’t wait for you to meet everyone. I told them all about you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 susan Like what? Do they know about your brother?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny Uh, not everything, just, like, the jail and drugs part.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 susan Why would you do that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 susan The world doesn’t need to know our problems.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny Well, Mom, I’m sorry, but…
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 wyatt Hey, look, they got Walgreens here, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 susan You really think it’s helpful to change the subject, Wyatt?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 wyatt Just trying to make this a happy trip, dear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 susan Well, quit it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny So, uh, Randall, can’t believe after all these years you finally get to visit me in California.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 randall Well, good thing I was a non-violent offender, otherwise I couldn’t have left the state.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 susan All right, that’s enough jail talk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 randall Penny knows where I was, she sent me cigarettes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 susan You sent your brother cigarettes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 wyatt He was cooking and selling crystal meth, Susan, I think we can let the cigarettes slide.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 susan Stop trying to be the cool dad, you have a shirt with our cat’s picture on it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 wyatt Anyway, we’re here, slugger.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 howard_wolowitz That’s great, now they know where I live.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 raj_koothrappali What are you talking about? They’ve always known where you live.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, if you want to go off the grid, you have to move out of your mother’s house.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Can we take a moment to discuss that I just lied to the government for you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Yeah. I would not have done that for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 bernadette_rostenkowski Howard, please just call the man, see what he wants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 howard_wolowitz All right, all right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Hey, make sure you tell him that you weren’t home when he came by and that your Indian friend gave you the message the moment you stepped through the door.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Yes, hello. Uh, this is Howard Wolowitz for Colonel Richard Williams.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Oh, I take it back, don’t mention me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Hi, Colonel Williams, how can I help you? What? Oh, uh, yes, he is from India. No, I don’t know his immigration status. Relax, I’m still on hold. Speaking. Okay, sure, I can meet with you on Thursday. Caltech is fine. Yeah, and may I ask what this is about? I may not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 raj_koothrappali That’s what he said to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Here you are, Mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 dr_beverly_hofstadter Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter I’m glad you decided to stay. It’s gonna be special for Penny and me to share this with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 dr_beverly_hofstadter I can’t wait for this day to be over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, special, like that. That’s them. Please don’t make things any more awkward than they already are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon_cooper All right, so less or equally awkward, got it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Hey, guys, come on in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 dr_alfred_hofstadter Oh, thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 mary_cooper Good morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 dr_beverly_hofstadter Morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 dr_alfred_hofstadter How is everyone today?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 dr_beverly_hofstadter Good, and you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 dr_alfred_hofstadter Good, good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 dr_beverly_hofstadter Good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 mary_cooper I’m good, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 dr_beverly_hofstadter Good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon_cooper So, did you defile my mother or not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 mary_cooper Sheldon. You’re being rude.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 dr_alfred_hofstadter If I may, I can assure you, your mother and I did nothing more than share a cab and a conversation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Did that conversation include the phrase your genitals are a joy to behold?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 mary_cooper That’s enough.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 dr_alfred_hofstadter Look, I promise you, neither I, nor anyone, has ever said that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter You don’t know his girlfriend very well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Or what a joy it is to behold my genitals.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny All right, you guys, uh, get settled in, then we’ll go across the hall and say hi to everyone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 randall You know, It’s hard to believe I’ve never met Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 wyatt Well, he probably buys his illegal drugs from a local vendor.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 susan Not funny, Wyatt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny I thought it was really funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 wyatt Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 susan Well, fine, if everyone wants to make jokes about our problems, then I can, too. Knock, knock. Who’s there? Our family is an embarrassment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 randall That’s not much of a joke.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny Okay. Listen, Mom, I know you’re nervous, but I promise you, no one is gonna judge you or this family.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 susan Oh, I’m sorry. It’s just we’re meeting Leonard’s parents for the first time, and, and they’re academics and, and intellectuals, and I don’t want them thinking we’re white trash.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 randall Well, what colour trash do you think they’ll believe?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 mary_cooper How could you think that I would spend the night with a man I just met?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon_cooper A man named Jesus convinced you to build a church in Africa. You’re kind of a sucker.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Well, nothing happened, right? It’s over. Until we get married a third time, you guys will never have to see each other again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 dr_alfred_hofstadter Well, you know, actually that’s not the case. Mary may visit me in New York.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 mary_cooper Mm-hmm. And he’s never been to Texas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 dr_alfred_hofstadter Maybe we meet halfway.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon_cooper What? In the Chattahoochee National Forest in Georgia? I can’t be the only one that knows that’s halfway.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 dr_beverly_hofstadter You’re not seriously going to visit each other.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 dr_alfred_hofstadter And why wouldn’t we?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 dr_beverly_hofstadter Oh please, you’re just saying this to antagonize me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 dr_alfred_hofstadter Oh, not at all. Mary happens to be a wonderful woman. And if it antagonizes you, that’s just a bonus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Mary, I’m sorry you’re in the middle of this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 mary_cooper No, no, nothing to be sorry about. I genuinely like your father.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon_cooper What? But he’s a mediocre academic. And according to Beverley, his sexual prowess is sub-par. He’s basically Leonard with a bigger prostate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Are you saying that my dad’s not good enough for your mom?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Yes, while also getting in a solid dig at you. Pretty efficient, huh?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter This is ridiculous. I’m going across the hall.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon_cooper But why should you get to go and leave me here with your bickering parents?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Fine, then you go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 mary_cooper Well, I don’t want to stay here with her. I’ll go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 dr_alfred_hofstadter I’ll go with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter That still leaves me here with him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 amy_farrah_fowler Who’s ready for a wedding?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Great, now I have to start all over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 wyatt So how’s the world of pharmaceuticals treating you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny Pretty good. I actually just got assigned a much better territory.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 susan See what happens when you work hard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 randall Hey, she just sells drugs. I had to make ’em.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 susan Okay, that’s enough. No more drug talk for the rest of this trip.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 wyatt I’ll drink to that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 susan Haven’t you had enough?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 wyatt Penny drinks more than I do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny Well, I learned from the best.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 wyatt Aw.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny Aw.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 susan Very nice, Wyatt. And you wonder why this one turned out the way he did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 randall You see what I’ve gotta put up with.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 susan What you’ve gotta put up with? Why did you have to go to jail?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 randall It’s called getting caught, Mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 wyatt Hey, there he is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 susan Oh, Leonard. It’s so nice to see you again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Oh, you, too. Hey, everyone, this is my mother, Beverley.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 dr_beverly_hofstadter Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 susan Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 randall We are not white trash.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 amy_farrah_fowler Are you excited to see your son walk down the aisle?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 dr_alfred_hofstadter Yes, I am. I’m just feeling a little guilty about all the trouble I’ve caused.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 mary_cooper Oh, so am I.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon_cooper You made God sad today, Mom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, they haven’t done anything wrong. I think it’s nice they’re hitting it off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Well, that’s still no reason to rush into anything. I mean, look at us. We took things remarkably slow. You and I, we didn’t even hold hands for two years.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 amy_farrah_fowler It was a lot hotter than it sounds.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 dr_alfred_hofstadter You’re a patient young lady.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Hey, hey. She’s mine, take a cold shower, grandpa.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Why wouldn’t that colonel say what the meeting’s about? It has to be bad news.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Calm down, okay? Try not to think about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 howard_wolowitz That’s really stupid advice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 raj_koothrappali You know that hurts my feelings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Calm down, try not to think about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 howard_wolowitz Why do I bother talking to you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Oh, come on. What’s the worst that could come of this meeting?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 howard_wolowitz I don’t know. They take the invention away, and I get nothing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 raj_koothrappali Okay, that’s not so bad. You know what happened to the scientists that worked on the Manhattan Project? The government forced them to move to the desert. They had to live in secret, and when Oppenheimer objected to what they made him do, they destroyed his reputation.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 howard_wolowitz What’s the point of that story?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 raj_koothrappali I just read a book about Oppenheimer, seemed like a chance to show off. There he is, there’s my happy Hebraic homeboy. Yeah, that’s the smile I’m gonna remember when you’re living in the desert and I’m living with your wife.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 dr_beverly_hofstadter So, what do you do for a living?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 randall Mommy, you want to take this one?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 susan Um, Randall’s in between jobs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 randall And court appearances.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 wyatt It’s nice to meet the woman who raised this fine young man. I’m looking forward to meeting his father.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 dr_beverly_hofstadter Prepare to be disappointed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter And he can’t wait to meet you, too. Can I get anyone a drink?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 wyatt Well, I could use another beer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 susan You’re done. He’s done.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny Hey. Is everyone getting to know each other?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 randall Not at all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 stuart_bloom Nice to see you again, Dr. Hofstadter. I’m, uh, Leonard’s friend, Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 dr_beverly_hofstadter Nice to see you, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 stuart_bloom Hi, I’m Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 dr_alfred_hofstadter Oh, I’m Alfred. Leonard’s father.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 stuart_bloom Oh. Oh, hi. Uh, I’m sorry, did you two want to sit together?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 together#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 stuart_bloom I was wondering why the front row was available.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 bernadette_rostenkowski Okay, I think we’re ready.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Why do people cry at weddings?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 mary_cooper They’re practicing for what’s coming later.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 susan Thank you for cleaning yourself up for your sister’s wedding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 randall Thank you for my new teeth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 wyatt Welcome to the family, Leonard. Don’t lend your new brother-in-law money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 bernadette_rostenkowski We’re here today to celebrate love.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 dr_beverly_hofstadter Urgh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 dr_alfred_hofstadter Sigh louder, no one heard you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 stuart_bloom Really, I can move.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 bernadette_rostenkowski Not just Leonard and Penny’s love, but the love we have for them, as well as each other.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Speaking of love, STDs among the elderly are skyrocketing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 bernadette_rostenkowski Love is patient, but it’s not gonna put up with all the side chatter, so let’s knock it off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 howard_wolowitz At least she’s yelling at someone else for a change.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 bernadette_rostenkowski Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny Okay, I understand everyone’s a little tense today, so I am just gonna get to the important stuff. Leonard, standing here with you in front of our family and friends is bringing up a lot of feelings. Like what a good idea it was to elope the first time. But also how incredibly happy you make me. Thank you for marrying me. Hopefully for the last time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Penny, as a scientist, my job is to figure out why things happen. But I don’t think I’ll ever understand how someone like me could get to be with someone like you. You know, maybe I don’t
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 bernadette_rostenkowski Anybody have anything snarky to say about that? Didn’t think so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 dr_alfred_hofstadter I’d like to say something. Beverly, I know that we don’t bring out the best in each other.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 dr_beverly_hofstadter I couldn’t agree more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 stuart_bloom That’s beautiful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 bernadette_rostenkowski Thank you. All right, let’s continue.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Yeah, excuse me, I need to say something to someone pretty special, and I just can’t wait any longer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 amy_farrah_fowler It’s happening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 sheldon_cooper Leonard, you and I have our ups and downs. But I have always considered you my family. Even before the recent threat of our parents fornicating like wrinkly old rabbits. I don’t always show it, but you are of great importance to me. Both of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 penny Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 bernadette_rostenkowski Okay. I now pronounce you husband and wife. And weird other husband who came with the apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 dr_beverly_hofstadter Thank you for taking us to the airport.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter Hey, I’m just thrilled we’re all getting along for a minute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 dr_alfred_hofstadter Yeah, me, too. Beverly, I’m sorry if I upset you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 dr_beverly_hofstadter Water under the bridge, Alfred. Leonard, why don’t you get into the carpool lane?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 dr_alfred_hofstadter Well, that’s a solid line. He can’t cross that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 leonard_hofstadter That’s okay. I can make it over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 dr_beverly_hofstadter No, no, let’s plod along. It’ll make your father feel more comfortable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode01 dr_alfred_hofstadter What makes me comfortable is knowing I don’t have to wake up tomorrow morning and see your sour face.
