TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Look at this. Elon Musk has a theory that we’re all just characters in some advanced civilization’s video game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter So some alien kid spent his money on the asthma-and-glasses upgrade for me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Well, he doesn’t say it’s a good game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 howard_wolowitz All right, we got a problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter What’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 howard_wolowitz The Air Force contacted me about our quantum gyroscope. They want to have a meeting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Yeah. This military guy showed up at Howard’s door. He was terrifying.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Oh, what did he say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 raj_koothrappali He gave me his business card and asked me to please pass it along to Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 sheldon_cooper That doesn’t sound terrifying.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 raj_koothrappali To a white guy born here, no. If you are a brown guy whose name has a lot of syllables in it, terrifying.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter You realize if the military declares our research classified, they can take the whole thing away from us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 howard_wolowitz And if that happens, we’ll never be able to sell it commercially.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter There goes our big payday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 howard_wolowitz I was counting on that money. I need to make as much as my wife so I don’t have to try so hard in bed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter You do that, too?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Oh, yeah. How do you think I stay this thin?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Gentlemen, I think we are losing sight of the real issue. We are on the precipice of becoming faceless cogs in the military-industrial complex. Isn’t that exciting?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Well, you’re kidding, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Not at all. In Star Wars, when the stormtroopers would march in perfect formation, harassing civilians, didn’t you ever think, hey, that could be me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Sheldon, we could be contributing to a weapons system that oppresses mankind for the next thousand years.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Okay, Howard’s on board. What do you think, Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski I’m worried about Howard. Ever since that guy from the Air Force showed up, he’s been a nervous wreck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 penny All right, we work at a giant pharmaceutical company. Get him some anti-anxiety meds.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski He won’t take any pills that aren’t chewable and shaped like a Flintstone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 penny You know, when Leonard’s feeling anxious I make him take a long walk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Does that help?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 penny Well, for a while. Then he comes back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t believe this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler What’s wrong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski This guy from the office just congratulated me on being pregnant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler You did already know, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski No one at the office did. Did you tell anyone?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 penny No. You told me not to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski I bet it was Barbara Chen in retrovirus. She might have heard me throwing up one morning. Every since she got the hearing aid, she thinks she’s so great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Why don’t you want anyone to know?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski ‘Cause I’m up for a major immunotherapy study, and if they find out I’m pregnant they might give it to someone else.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 penny Would they really do that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski I know they would, they did it to Barbara Chen last year when I told everyone she was pregnant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Wail till I Snapchat that my friends might be working on a top secret government project.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Are you crazy? You can’t put that on Snapchat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Fine, I’ll put it on Facebook like a caveman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 howard_wolowitz You know, maybe before our meeting we should talk to a lawyer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter That’s not a bad idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Well, you must have someone in your family that’s a lawyer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Why? Because I’m Jewish? That’s like me saying, hey, you’re Indian, doesn’t your cousin work in a call centre?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 raj_koothrappali My cousin does work in a call centre.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 howard_wolowitz And my cousin’s a lawyer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 sheldon_cooper We don’t need Howard’s cousin. No, we have me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter You’re not a lawyer, Sheldon, you’re just a know-it-all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I am not a know-it-all. I’m a person who knows lots of things and likes to correct other people when they’re wrong.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter That’s the definition of being a know-it-all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Or in German, a Besserwisser.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 penny How did you think you were gonna hide your pregnancy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski I had a plan. I kept leaving Dove Bar wrappers around to explain any weight gain.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Where did you get empty Dove Bar wrappers?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski From all the Dove Bars I ate. I’m pregnant. Try to keep up. I’m sorry, I have to go find out if my boss knows.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Well, whatever happens, we’re here for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski Thanks. You guys are the best.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 penny Yeah, drive safe. We love you. And give us a call… Oh, my God, it was me, it was me. I’m the one who blabbed she was pregnant!
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 penny I didn’t mean to. It just slipped out in front of her assistantone day. I…
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski I forgot my coat.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 penny Oh, here’s your coat, honey. That’s such a cute jacket. Oh God, I feel so bad, I just lied to her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, but you did it so well. That’s amazing, it’s like watching a sculptor, but your clay was lies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 penny Is that really what’s important right now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler I mean, seriously, you have got to let me scan your brain when you’re being dishonest so I can see what lights up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 penny That’s super helpful, Amy. Thanks a lot. I can’t wait to do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler I can see a clump of bitch cells lightin’ up from here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Give me a second to call my cousin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I don’t see how a tax lawyer from Fort Lauderdale could be helpful regarding intellectual property.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 howard_wolowitz First of all, he’s in Boca Raton, which is better than Fort Lauderdale. But more importantly, he lasted two days on Jeopardy, so he’s clearly a smart guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 howards_cousin#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Hey, Marty. Thanks for talking to us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 marty Hey, no problem. Thanks for going to outer space so no matter what I do my mom will be disappointed in me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Well, I married a little Catholic girl, so we’re even. Anyway, this is Leonard and Sheldon. The three of us came up with the guidance system.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 howard_wolowitz And this is my friend, Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Oh, I’m not on the patent. I’m just here because there’s a bumblebee in my office.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter I saw it. It’s big.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Anyway, like I said in the e-mail, this meeting’s on Thursday. Do you have any advice for us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 marty Well, I don’t know much about patent law. But, uh, my advice is hear them out, offer as little information as possible, and whatever you do, don’t sign anything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Don’t sign anything? That’s your advice? Okay, so, uh, if during this meeting, one of us were to, say, complete an oil painting, you’d recommend that we leave that unsigned?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 marty That’s not what I meant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 sheldon_cooper That’s what you said.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 marty That’s not what I meant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 sheldon_cooper This must be how you practice law in Boca Raton, by saying things you don’t mean and meaning things you don’t say.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 marty Howard, why is he yelling at me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Marty, let me call you back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Someday, when I’m up on murder charges, you’ll be hearing from me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 sheldon_cooper You don’t need him. I’ll represent you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 penny Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski Hey. What brings you by?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 penny Oh, had to go to a sales seminar on our new sleeping pill.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh. How was it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 penny Great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski Fell asleep?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 penny In, like, two minutes. Yeah. So, how is everything going around here? Are you still upset about people finding out you’re pregnant?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski I’m furious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 penny Sure, sure. Uh, did you ever figure out who told?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski No. I confronted Barbara Chen, but she claimed she didn’t know what I was talking about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 penny Hmm. Well, I guess it’s just gonna remain a mystery, you know, like whatever happened in that seminar after they dimmed the lights.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski It had to be Barbara. I’ve been trying to figure out a way to get back at her. Do you think using her work computer to Google how to be a prostitute is over the line?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 penny Uh, you know, when I was in high school, there was this girl who was talking about me behind my back, so me and all my friends, we cornered her in the bathroom and forgave her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski What kind of revenge is that? This woman screwed with my job. She’s got to pay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 penny Okay, all right, honey, you know what? There was something I was too scared to tell you yesterday, and now I’m just balls-out terrified to tell you, but the truth is it wasn’t Barbara Chen, it was me. I’m the reason everyone knows.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski Why did you do that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 penny Well, it was an accident.I am so sorry I lied.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski Get out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 penny Oh, you know, I also lied about the girl in the bathroom. Yeah, we actually dumped her retainer in the toilet and put it back in her mouth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I don’t understand why I can’t talk at this meeting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter ‘Cause when you talk, it enrages people.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Okay. Quick question. Am I allowed to exchange pleasantries upon meeting this colonel?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Am I allowed to inform him that Colonel Sanders was never actually in the military?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter I’m getting enraged.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Fine. Ooh. Can I use text-to-speech software?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 howard_wolowitz No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Don’t speak.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 sheldons_phone#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 Aw, nuts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 colonel_richard_williams Gentlemen, I’m Colonel Williams. Thank you for meeting with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 colonel_richard_williams So, which one of you is the brains behind all this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 howard_wolowitz It’s a group effort, but I guess if we had to pick a main brain, it would be me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 sheldon_cooper
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 colonel_richard_williams And because of the quantum vortices, this can run perpetually?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Exactly. Yeah, you have a good grasp of the physics.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 colonel_richard_williams Well, I’m a scientist by training.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Really? You’re a physicist?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 colonel_richard_williams Better. I’m an engineer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Where did you go to school?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 colonel_richard_williams MIT.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Oh. Well, hey, me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 colonel_richard_williams I should have known. Behind every great invention is an MIT mind. I’ll cut to the chase. The Air Force believes there’s an application for this technology, and we’re interested in funding your research.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Well, thanks, but you should know we’re a little concerned about this being used in weapons.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 colonel_richard_williams Oh, well, let me put your mind at ease. What we use it for is none of your business.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter I don’t know how I feel about this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 colonel_richard_williams Look, guys, it’s just a guidance system. It’s not like you’re handing us the Death Star from Star Trek. All you need to worry about is, right now, it’s this big, and we need it to be this big.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter That’s a lot less big.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 colonel_richard_williams Yes, it’s this much less big.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 howard_wolowitz I’m not even sure that’s possible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 colonel_richard_williams Well, I ran it by some colleagues at MIT, and they thought they could get it done in four months.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Four months?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Yeah, we’ll do it in two. Hi. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. I’m the actual brains behind this project. Also, engineers aren’t real scientists, MIT’s a trade school, and the Death Star is from Star Wars, not Star Trek. But otherwise, thank you for your service.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Hi. Howard told me you were working late, so I brought dinner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, thanks. You know, I just wanted to get some work done without people congratulating me about the baby every five minutes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler I spent my day alone in the lab waiting for a rat to die of anthrax.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski Did you come here to bring me dinner or to gloat?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Well, I came to see how you were feeling, but I’m guessing still angry?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski I’m sorry. My boss wants to meet with me, and I’m stressing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler You really think they’re gonna start treating you differently?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski Are you kidding? I’ve always been treated differently. Look at me. Listen to me. I mean, the first thought when you see me isn’t that’s a scientist, it’s I wonder if her mommy
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler I am really regretting that I got you a Happy Meal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski I’ve worked so hard to get where I am, and I don’t want to get sent back to square one because I’m pregnant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler I understand how you feel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler I wish there were some way I could make it better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski Well, you brought me French fries. That’s a start.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler Uh, actually, I got you apple slices ’cause you’re pregnant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski Apple slices? What kind of lunatic goes to McDonald’s and gets fruit?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 amy_farrah_fowler I’ll be right back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski And a chocolate shake.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 penny Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 penny What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Oh, Leonard’s mad at me, so I’m making him lemon bars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 penny Does he even like lemon bars?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Not really. But I’m mad at him, too, so lemon bars it is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 penny Something happen at the meeting?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 sheldon_cooper They made me promise I wouldn’t talk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 penny And you talked?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Well, now, see? You knew what was gonna happen. Why didn’t they? Anyway, now we’re committed to completing this project in a ridiculously short time frame, and everyone’s upset with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 penny Well, if it makes you feel any better, Bernadette’s mad at me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Mm. If it makes you feel any better, a parasitoid wasp known as Oobius depressus has been rediscovered after 101 years of presumed extinction.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 penny Why would that make me feel better?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Why would your Bernadette thing make me feel better? At least mine was educational.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 penny Okay. Never mind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Look, I’m sorry. Tell me why Bernadette is upset with you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 penny Well, I told people at work that she’s pregnant. She wasn’t ready for them to know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Why would you do that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 penny Well, it just slipped out. I feel terrible.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 sheldon_cooper See, that’s exactly what happened to me, except that I said it on purpose, and I have no regrets.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Is it even possible to get this done in two months?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Well, maybe. I don’t know. We’ll have to work 12 hours a day, seven days a week.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Which means I won’t be able to make Penny breakfast every day, and she’ll realize my brioche French toast was the only thing keeping her in the marriage.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 howard_wolowitz I love your French toast.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Oh, thanks, man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 raj_koothrappali So, why did you guys even agree to the deadline?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 howard_wolowitz We didn’t. Sheldon did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 raj_koothrappali And you just let him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Well, the colonel said it was for the good of the country, and the funding is substantial.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 howard_wolowitz No, but mostly, there was an awkward pause, and I broke it by saying okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 raj_koothrappali So I guess I won’t be seeing you guys for a while.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Oh, looks like it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 raj_koothrappali Wow. You’re going off to work with the military, leaving me behind. Now I know how all those army wives feel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Would you stop? We’re just gonna be on the other side of campus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 raj_koothrappali And right here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 howard_wolowitz You are a deeply silly man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 raj_koothrappali He is so afraid of his feelings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 penny Oh, hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski Got a minute?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 penny Yeah, come on in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski I just wanted to apologize. I know what you did was an accident.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 penny Oh, thank you, and I’m sorry I lied about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski For what it’s worth, you’re a great liar.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 penny Oh, that’s what Amy said. So what’s going on with the research project? Are they gonna let you run it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski Well, my boss said he hadn’t decided yet, so I gently reminded him that he’s an old rich white guy, and I’m a sweet little pregnant lady who’s not afraid to crying front of a jury.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 penny You threatened to sue?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski Hey, I learned a long time ago, when you’re four feet eleven and eye level with every guy’s crotch, that’s where you punch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 penny That’s funny. I learned something totally different.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski Do you know what? It’s just a research project. The most important job in the world is gonna be raising this child. It’s all I need to give my life meaning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 penny Oh, that’s so beautiful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 bernadette_rostenkowski You believe me? Oh, good. 11 more chumps like you, I’ll have the jury eating out of my hand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 sheldon_cooper I never realized this building was classified.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Maybe that’s because it’s classified.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Wish we weren’t so far from my parking space.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 sheldon_cooper The way you put away those lemon bars, perhaps that’s a good thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter I’d like to reinstate the you-not-talking rule.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 sheldon_cooper Why? It clearly doesn’t work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 howard_wolowitz I guess this is it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter Is that a retinal scanner?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 howard_wolowitz Let’s find out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 scanner#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 Howard Wolowitz, access granted.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode02 leonard_hofstadter No way.
