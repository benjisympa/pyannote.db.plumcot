TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 howard_wolowitz It’s pretty late. You think I’ve got time to run some more simulations on the cooling system?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Sure, I’m still figuring out the thermo-acoustic expander.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Oh, while you do that I am going to pump cerebral spinal fluid through my brain cells to remove the metabolic by-products of the day’s thoughts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 howard_wolowitz What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 sheldon_cooper It’s called sleep and it’s my bedtime. Nighty-night, y’all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Hey, hey, hey, you’re not going anywhere.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter We only have two months to deliver this to the Air Force because of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 sheldon_cooper I know, I was there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Well, wake up, we’re gonna put in a lot of late nights.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 sheldon_cooper How late?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Well, I don’t know, midnight, one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 sheldon_cooper One o’clock? I’m not a raccoon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 howard_wolowitz If you’re tired, have some coffee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 sheldon_cooper What? You have some coffee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 howard_wolowitz I am having coffee.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 sheldon_cooper And look how irritable it’s making you!
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Guys, we’re not gonna get anything done if we start fighting. Now, can you please try
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Fine. I don’t think I can go much longer.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter It’s been three and a half minutes, wake up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 sheldon_cooper I had a bad dream that my best friend became a tyrant and forced me to stay up all night to work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Oh, I had a good dream that when I carried you to bed, I let your head hit the wall and I laughed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 penny Good morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter What is this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Well, we didn’t see you last night, we’re not gonna see you today, so we thought we could have breakfast together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Oh, that is so nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Ow, it does hurt.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter So, what are you guys gonna do today?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Well, Sheldon was supposed to go to this party with me this afternoon, but I don’t think that’s happening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Oh, that was never happening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 penny Oh, I’ll go. I like a party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Well, to be honest, it’s not like a party party, it’s more like a gathering where scientists of different disciplines get together to share their work and keep current on what’s going on in other fields. I don’t know why I called it a party, sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 penny It’s okay, I’ll still go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter You don’t think you’ll be bored?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 penny Oh, I’ll have some wine and listen to people go on about crap I don’t understand. I mean, how is it any different than every single day of my life?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 sheldon_cooper I won’t be there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Look at that, it is a party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Sorry I have to work all weekend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski It’s okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Thanks again for breakfast.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Well, I didn’t get to see you last night. It was the least I could do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski You shouldn’t have made the alarm code his birthday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 raj_koothrappali So, what should we do today?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, I appreciate it, but you don’t have to spend your day off with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Well, I don’t mind. Oh, you want go to the mall and look at baby stuff?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Not really.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Oh, come on, we could share a pretzel and get sideways glances from racist old ladies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski I get enough of that when I take Howard to my grandmother’s for Christmas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Oh, I know, why don’t we get started on clearing out the baby’s room?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Isn’t it a little early for that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 raj_koothrappali You have to get to it eventually.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, there’s so much junk in there, it’s embarrassing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 raj_koothrappali How can you be embarrassed around me? I’m gonna be in the room with you when you give birth.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t think you are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 raj_koothrappali You didn’t think I was gonna be in your kitchen this morning, yet here I am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 voice#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 Psst, hey, kid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Huh, what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 the_flash You look tired. Why don’t you have an energy drink? Everyone’s doing it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Oh, no, thank you, those have caffeine in them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 the_flash Oh sorry, I thought you were cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 sheldon_cooper I am cool. This is Yoo-hoo, chocolate milk’s delicious watery cousin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 the_flash All right. But if you ever want to feel like you have superpowers, try one of these.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Superheroes take performance-enhancing chemicals?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 the_flash You bet. You know why Hulk is so strong? Steroids. You know why Batman wanders around at night getting into fights? Scotch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 sheldon_cooper I am facing a great deal of work. And I do like things better when famous people also like them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 the_flash Here. It’s on the house.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 sheldon_cooper The first one’s free? Flash, how do you stay in business?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 the_flash You want to know my secret? I bought stock in Marvel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Hi, Bert. This is my friend, Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 penny Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 bert_kibbler Hey, come on in. I’ll gonna go turn on some rock music. That’s a geology joke.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Bert’s a geologist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 bert_kibbler And a joker.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 penny How early are we?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, actually, we’re an hour late.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 penny I suddenly wish Sheldon was here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t even know where to begin.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Well, in The Sound of Music, Julie Andrews says let’s start at the very beginning, a very good place to start.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, I was gonna start at the end. Thank God you’re here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Well, I think the first thing we should get rid of is that tone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Sorry. I should probably keep this in case we have a girl.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Oh, that’s a nice one. Was it yours when you were little?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski My dad built it for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Wow, it’s so cute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski This was the husband and this was the wife. They’d go out on adventures together. Cruises, skiing, horseback riding. That was really me just duct taping them to our dog.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Oh, and did they have kids?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski They did, but the mommy and daddy didn’t like them, so they shipped them off to an orphanage I made out of a shoebox.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Yeah, that’s not worrisome at all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Not every girl dreams about being a mom. Sometimes you think you’re never gonna have kids and one day you wake up and you’re pregnant. And it doesn’t matter that your career’s going great right now and that you and your husband never even got to go anywhere taped to a dog.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 raj_koothrappali I skipped spin class for this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Why is it taking him so long to get a drink out of a vending machine?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Oh, it’s complicated. He finds pushing that little door and reaching up into the machine
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Gentlemen, I am ready to work. To quote The Martian, let’s science the faeces out of this. That’s The Martian the book and The Martian the movie, not Marvin the Martian. Although to quote Marvin the Martian, I claim this planet in the name of Mars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Are you okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Oh, I’m fantastic, never been better. I had my first energy drink and I feel great. Hey, you guys want to wrestle? We can do arm, thumb, mud, sumo. Nah, we’re not fat enough, or wearing diapers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 howard_wolowitz You wanted him awake.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 penny So should we talk to each other or mingle?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler I don’t know where everyone is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 penny Yeah, I mean, I could see him eating one or two guests, but not a whole party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 bert_kibbler Well, I guess this is kind of a bust. You don’t have to stay. I’m gonna start cleaning up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Okay. I feel so bad about leaving him here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 penny Oh, it’s funny, I was just thinking the same thing about you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 bert_kibbler Hey, listen, could you not say anything about this to the people at the university? You know, ’cause you’re you and I’m me, and it’s kind of embarrassing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 penny Wait, what do you mean she’s her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 bert_kibbler Well, you know how Amy’s the coolest girl on campus, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 penny No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 bert_kibbler Oh yeah, everybody thinks so.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 penny What? You tell me about your foot fungus, but this is a secret?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler I’m sure it’s just ’cause I’m dating Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 bert_kibbler Mm, actually, I think Sheldon’s popular because he’s dating you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 penny Now Sheldon’s popular? What is happening?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Maybe we should break for lunch. What time is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter According to the world’s worst cuckoo clock, it’s two.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 sheldon_cooper My head hurts and I’m more tired than ever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Why don’t you just go home?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 sheldon_cooper No, I can do this. I just, I just need another energy drink. Oh, no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 sheldon_cooper I want another one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter So?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 sheldon_cooper That’s a craving. That’s a sign of chemical dependency.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter You only had one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 sheldon_cooper No, I know, but plenty of things are addictive after a single exposure. I mean, crack cocaine, nicotine, Pringles. You know once one pops one just can’t stop.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 howard_wolowitz You can’t develop a problem that fast.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 sheldon_cooper You want to bet? Oh, great, now I’m addicted to gambling.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter We can’t afford to lose any more time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 howard_wolowitz Well, this probably won’t work, but has anyone ever tried to just haul off and whup the crazy out of him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter That’s not helpful. It’s fun to think about, but it’s not helpful. Hey, Sheldon, we are on a serious time crunch. We can’t do this without you. Can you please pull it together?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 sheldon_cooper I’m sorry. Yes, of course.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Just, please, bear with me if I display symptoms of caffeine withdrawal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 howard_wolowitz No worries.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 sheldon_cooper You guys stink.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Sorry I flipped out on you. I think it’s just hormones.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 raj_koothrappali I think you were mean before you were pregnant, but it’s fine. So, uh, instead of cleaning out the room, why don’t we just decide on a theme for the nursery?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Does it really need one?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Of course it does. Didn’t your baby room have a theme?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Well, it doubled as my dad’s office, and he was a cop, so I guess the theme was bloody homicide photos.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Oh. Mine was Winnie the Pooh. But anyway, why don’t we just take a step back and start with a colour? Right? There are so many amazing ones. Red, blue, green, purple.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Are you just gonna name all the colours?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Well, not now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t care what colour the room is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Okay, well, I’m just trying to help you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Well, you’re not, so just drop it. I’m clearly upset. Why aren’t you following me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Sorry. Sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 bert_kibbler And when Amy started using a solution of chromic acid and white vinegar to clean all her lab equipment, all of a sudden, everybody was doing it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 penny You trend setter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Just the right idea at the right time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 penny Okay, okay, so Amy’s cool, Sheldon’s cool. Tell me about Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 bert_kibbler Who?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 penny Leonard Hofstadter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 bert_kibbler Oh, him. I guess he’s all right. Apparently he tricked some hot girl into marrying him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 penny That’s me, I’m her. You know, he didn’t trick me, he just wore me down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 bert_kibbler It makes sense you two are friends. I mean, hot girls always stick together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler And you thought this wasn’t gonna be a great party.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 penny You know, I had no idea Caltech is exactly like my high school.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Well, it’s not exactly like it. We’re all extremely smart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 penny Wow, you popular girls are mean.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter I’m gonna get some coffee. You want some?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Uh, you’re really going to have caffeine in front of me when I’m trying to get my life back on track?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Uh, okay, let’s pretend you do have a problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 sheldon_cooper I do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter You don’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Yeah, but I do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter No, you don’t. But let’s say you do. And don’t say you do, because you don’t. Now, wouldn’t you think that throwing yourself into your work would be the best way to deal with it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 sheldon_cooper With what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Your problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 sheldon_cooper I thought I didn’t have a problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 howard_wolowitz That was painful to watch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 raj_koothrappali So where are we going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski I don’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Okay. How Thelma and Louise of us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Raj, why don’t I care about anything?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 raj_koothrappali I’m sorry?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski It’s my baby. I, I should care about nurseries and colours, and I don’t. What’s wrong with me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Well, crime-scene photos near your crib spring to mind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski I keep waiting to feel excited, but it’s not happening. What if it never happens?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Bernadette, come on, look, you’re overthinking this, okay? You’re gonna be an amazing mom. Even if you don’t believe it, I know you have maternal instincts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Once, I was supposed to babysit my brothers. Our neighbour found them naked in the backyard eating crickets.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Happy and well-fed. You see, that’s what I’m taking from that story.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Leonard, can I ask you a question?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Is it about the rotational symmetries you should be figuring out or your fake caffeine problem?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 sheldon_cooper Howard, can I ask you a question?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 howard_wolowitz No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 sheldon_cooper All right, I’ll just toss this out to the room. Um, I was thinking that the best way to fight my addiction is by weaning myself off in steps. Now, I couldn’t find a caffeine patch, but I did find what claims to be a mind-boosting caffeine suppository. You know, the interesting fact about the rectum…
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon. We are dealing with an impossible deadline from the Air Force because of you. So have an energy drink, don’t have an energy drink. Order suppositories and shove ’em wherever you want, I don’t care.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 sheldon_cooper You don’t shove them. They come with an easy-glide applicator.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Right. Listen to me. We can’t do anything until you do your part. So get up in front of this whiteboard and do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 sheldon_cooper I can’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Yes, you can.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 sheldon_cooper No, I can’t figure out the math. I’ve been racking my brain for days, and I’ve got nothing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Seriously?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 sheldon_cooper I can’t do it. I’m not as smart as I think I am. I’m so sorry. This is all my fault.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter It’s okay, we’ll figure something out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 sheldon_cooper But what if we can’t?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter It’ll be fine. You’ll see. Sheldon? Buddy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 howard_wolowitz When the baby gets here, you gotta teach me that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Thank you so much, Bert. This was great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 bert_kibbler My pleasure. You girls want to take home a two-gallon tub of potato salad?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler I think we’re good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 bert_kibbler Okay, well, thanks for coming by. You’re nice people.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 penny Well, so are you. In fact, you know what? We will never take you for granite. Did you get that? Granite? A little geology joke.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 bert_kibbler You need to leave. I’m in love with both of you now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 penny Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 amy_farrah_fowler Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Uh, pull over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski What? Why? Who are you calling? You’re gonna rat me out to Howard, aren’t you? You’re such a snitch, no wonder I don’t like you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Whoa, I’m calling my dad, okay? He’s got experience dealing with pregnant ladies because he’s an OBGYN. And experience with crazy ladies because of my mom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 dr_vm_koothrappali Hello, Rajesh. Are you calling to ask for money?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 raj_koothrappali What? No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 dr_vm_koothrappali Are you calling to ask for things that cost money?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 raj_koothrappali No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 dr_vm_koothrappali Great. What’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 raj_koothrappali This is my friend, Bernadette. She’s pregnant, and she’s a bit worried, so I thought maybe you could talk to her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 dr_vm_koothrappali Of course. What seems to be the trouble?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Something’s wrong. I don’t care about any of the baby stuff every other mom is so into. Honestly, I’m not even sure I like babies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 dr_vm_koothrappali Look, some people are baby people, and some people are not baby people. It doesn’t mean you won’t love your own baby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski But I thought I’d be more excited.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 dr_vm_koothrappali Oh, being excited isn’t a guarantee of anything. Rajesh’s mother was thrilled when she was pregnant with him. After he was born, she doted on his every move. And you know what happened? He broke her heart, moved halfway around the world, and dates only poor white women. So you never know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 bernadette_rostenkowski Thank you. I feel better now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 raj_koothrappali Well I don’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 dr_vm_koothrappali Good. Bernadette, I hope you have a daughter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Um, I don’t really know how to say this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 colonel_richard_williams Well, you could try starting with sir.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Right. Sorry, sir.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 sheldon_cooper He said start with it, not end with it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter Sir.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 colonel_richard_williams Hmm?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 howard_wolowitz We’ve hit a bit of a snag. We’re already behind schedule.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 sheldon_cooper The computations required to overcome the deployability issues are more significant than we thought.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 leonard_hofstadter I understand that we’re under contract, and I don’t know what the consequences of violating that are, but, uh, we’re not gonna be able to deliver in the time we promised.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 colonel_richard_williams How long do you need?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode03 howard_wolowitz We, we’re thinking, two years.
