TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 penny Okay, I’m confused. Which one is Mr. Robot?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter I’ll give you a hint. We’re watching Daredevil.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Will you two please inform Amy how much you enjoy adhering to a strict bathroom schedule?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 penny Can’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Won’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 penny Didn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Don’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler I told you, you can’t regulate every aspect of our lives.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 sheldon_cooper I can if you’d just roll over and accept your fate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler I’m sorry for bringing this over here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 penny Believe me, we know what you’re going through.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter And I think the most helpful thing we can tell you is no backsies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 penny Mm-hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, I understand that you like things a certain way and I’m willing to make some concessions, but you have to be open to compromise.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 penny She’s right. That’s reasonable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Oh, look who’s in favour of compromise, the woman who married Leonard Hofstadter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Hey, she didn’t compromise. She settled. There’s a difference.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 penny Yeah. You tell him, babe.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 raj_koothrappali What time do you and Bernadette head out?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 howard_wolowitz As soon as I get home. We’re hoping to make it before dark.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 raj_koothrappali I’ve never been to Palm Springs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 stuart_bloom Oh, you should go. It’s terrific. I really thrive anywhere the women and the temperature are over 90.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 raj_koothrappali I don’t know. If I want to watch old people sweat, I can just FaceTime my family in India.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 stuart_bloom It’s nice you and Bernadette are getting away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Well, she wants us to spend more time together before the baby comes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 stuart_bloom So then what are you doing here buying comic books?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Well, he wants us to spend more time together before the baby comes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter When you live with someone, there’s gonna be conflict. You just have to keep communicating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Well I’m open to that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler Okay. Well, for starters, there’s nothing wrong with keeping our toothbrushes in the same holder.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 penny Sheldon, what do you say to that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 sheldon_cooper I think we should see other people.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Well, as a male, I have an evolutionary drive to perpetuate my DNA. Restricting myself to a single partner is against my nature.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler We sleep together once a year. You want other partners?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Don’t blame me. Blame your pal, biology. He’s the pervert pulling the strings here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler You wanna see other people? Go see other people.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 penny I hope one of those people is a monkey, ’cause this is bananas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Hey, you can make jokes, but if this keeps up, he’s gonna move back in here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 penny All right. Well, let’s just get them apart for a while so they can cool down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Good. Then before we reintroduce them, we’ll give him one of her sweaters so he can get used to her scent again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 penny So it’s okay for you to joke around?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter No, that’s actually what we did with him when Howard came back from space.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Honey, how ya feeling? The book says at this stage of the pregnancy morning sickness should be going away. So that’s good news, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski The only thing I hate more than you right now is that book.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 howard_wolowitz There she is. Who’s ready for a hot, three-hour car ride to the desert?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski Next vomit is gonna be in your lap.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 howard_wolowitz I’m sorry. We don’t have to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski But it’s our last chance to take a vacation that’s just the two of us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 howard_wolowitz How ’bout we stay here? We don’t even have to tell anyone. It’ll be like a secret vacation at home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski Keeping secrets from our friends, it does sound kinda fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Does it sound sexy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski You just heard me throwing up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 howard_wolowitz You bet I did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski You’re so weird.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 howard_wolowitz You know what’s weird? How turned on you are right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 sheldon_cooper You know, people are quick to accuse me of being difficult to live with, but the truth is, Amy is just as challenging.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 penny Just as challenging?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 penny As you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 penny Just as challenging as you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 sheldon_cooper When we’re sleeping, she breathes on me. One night, it got so bad I almost grabbed Toto
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 penny Leonard breathes on me, too. It’s not a big deal.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 sheldon_cooper She’s always complaining about people at work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 penny Well, so does Leonard. It’s kind of annoying, but it’s not the end of the world.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Do you know that when I get out of the shower, she eyes me up and down like I’m a piece of meat?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 penny You know, so does Leonard. Can’t I just get ready in the morning without him giving me his goofy thumbs-up? Hey-hey-hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 sheldon_cooper I know. Sometimes I would just like to be appreciated for my mind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 penny Agreed. Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski That feels great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Well, pulling a quarter out of your ear isn’t the only magic these hands can do. In fact, what’s this between your toes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski Can you please stop making money come out of me for two minutes? Was that the front door?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 howard_wolowitz It sounded like it. Oh, my God. Someone’s in the house.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski Lock the door, lock the door.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 howard_wolowitz We should call the police.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski Uh, I left my phone downstairs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Damn, so did I.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski Wait, I have my iPad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 howard_wolowitz What are we gonna do, e-mail 911?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski That’s not helpful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 howard_wolowitz You know I rely on humour in times of stress.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski Let me know when you start, because that wasn’t funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Is that the hot tub?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski Who would use our hot tub?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Well, the answer is both more and less disturbing than you think.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski Who is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Stuart. He heard me talking about us going away. I guess he decided to invite himself over?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski Should we say something to him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Maybe. How ’bout, hey, you look like a boiled chicken breast?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski I meant like, what are you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Nah, that’s not gonna hurt his feelings.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler Why is nothing easy with him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Look, here’s the thing you need to understand about Sheldon. He’s the worst.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler I prefer to think of it as high-maintenance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter I prefer to think of myself as five-ten, but I still need to get all my pants hemmed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler I guess I should have known what I was getting myself into.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Don’t beat yourself up. You’ve never lived with anyone before.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler That’s true.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter And you’re starting out with Sheldon Cooper. That’s like getting your first pet and having it be, I don’t know, what’s a kind of pet that ruins your life?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler You’re not making me feel better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Look, even when Penny and I started living together, there was a learning curve. But I promise you, it does get easier.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler He put a sign up in the bathroom that says, number of days without Amy’s hair on the soap.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Yeah. My record was six.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski Is it me, or is there something fun about watching him just float there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Maybe this is why people get fish tanks. Who just turned the porch lights on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski Is someone else here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 raj_koothrappali Hmm. They must have left the tub on. Good thing I stopped by. Ah. Aaaaah! What are you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 stuart_bloom What are you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 raj_koothrappali Maybe Howard and Bernadette said I could be here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 stuart_bloom Did they?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 raj_koothrappali Answer the question, what are you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 stuart_bloom I had nothing else to do tonight. The last couple of months, I come here when I know they’re not home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 stuart_bloom They heard me in the bushes once, but they thought I was a raccoon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski I told you raccoons don’t say uh-oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 penny You know, one night, Leonard’s nose whistled so loud, I swear it was like sleeping on a train track.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Have you noticed it’s always an A-flat?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 penny Is it? Oh. It’s like his sinuses are right here in the car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 sheldon_cooper If we’re just going to drive around aimlessly, the least you could do is take me for ice cream.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 penny Yeah, I’ll take you for ice cream.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Well, see, why can’t Amy be that subservient? She has coitus one time, suddenly she’s Gloria Steinem. Anyway, I suppose an ice cream parlour will be a good place to meet other women.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 penny Oh, please, you’re barely interested in a physical relationship with one person. Why would you want to confuse and disappoint others?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Being with Amy has awoken the sexual creature within. When I see a pretty gal walking down the street, I think, hubba hubba, like any other guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 penny You kiss your mother with that mouth? ‘Cause it’s fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 raj_koothrappali Here you go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 stuart_bloom Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 raj_koothrappali Shall we toast?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 stuart_bloom To Howard and Bernadette, and the house key they never asked me to return.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski You said you got it back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Well, clearly, I lied.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 raj_koothrappali So how’s your apartment?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 stuart_bloom Not great. The electricity’s out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 raj_koothrappali So why don’t you get it fixed?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 stuart_bloom I called, and they’re like, pay your bill.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 raj_koothrappali If you ever need somewhere to crash, there’s always my place.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 stuart_bloom Oh, no. I don’t want to be an inconvenience. You’ve got all your lady friends, and…
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 raj_koothrappali Actually, I’m single now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 stuart_bloom What? When did that happen?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 raj_koothrappali It’s okay. It’s by choice. Well, their choice, and it’s not okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 stuart_bloom Oh. Sorry. I didn’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 raj_koothrappali Nobody does. I was embarrassed so I didn’t say anything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski Why wouldn’t he tell us? Are we bad friends?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 howard_wolowitz He’s in our hot tub drinking our wine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, he deserves to be alone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 stuart_bloom So you’re back out on the dating scene now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 raj_koothrappali Yeah, yeah, a little.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 stuart_bloom Oh, that must be fun. How’s that going?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 raj_koothrappali I’m in a hot tub with you, so pretty bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler Maybe I should just give in to his stupid bathroom schedule.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter No, don’t do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler But you did.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Exactly. Learn from my mistakes. No matter where I am at 7:18am, there better be a toilet nearby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler It’s just so much easier to give him what he wants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Oh, true, but think of how much you’ve accomplished. Who got him to stop Purelling his pocket change?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler Me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter And who got him to put things other than gloves in the glove compartment?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler Me. It was mittens.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter And who got him to try a turkey dog?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler That was actually Koothrappali, but I did let him spit it out in my hand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter How can you stop now? That’s like walking out of Pinocchio right before he becomes a real boy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler You know, you’re right. I’m in this relationship, too. I need to stand up for myself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Of course you do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler And if he doesn’t like it, he can move back here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Oh. He can try. He’d just need a good locksmith.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 penny Well, who you gonna hit on? The girl in front of us got strawberry. That’s your favourite.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 sheldon_cooper No. No, if we both like it, I’ll spend the rest of my life opening the freezer and going, aw, no strawberry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 penny What about the girl behind the counter?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Hmm? Well, she spends her whole day scooping. One arm’s probably bigger than the other.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 penny Is it possible you might not actually want to meet someone?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 sheldon_cooper You are truly wise.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 penny Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 sheldon_cooper I’d say wise beyond your years, but you’re getting up there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 penny All right. Come on. What is really going on with you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Penny, I am going to tell you a story that I’ve never told anyone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 penny All right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 sheldon_cooper I was 13 years old, and on spring break from college.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 penny Not relating. Go on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 sheldon_cooper I came home early because they ran out of math to teach me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 penny Oh, now I’m with ya. Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 sheldon_cooper My mother was at bible study. I walked in the house expecting to find it empty, and I heard a sound coming from my parents’ bedroom. When I opened the door, I saw my father having relations with another woman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 penny Oh, that’s awful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 sheldon_cooper I know. It’s also why I never open a door without knocking three times. I mean, the first
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 penny Well, what happened with your dad?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 sheldon_cooper We locked eyes, I ran to my room, and we never, ever spoke of it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 penny You poor thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Since Amy and I have been living together, we’ve been bickering like my parents used to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 penny And you’re afraid you’re gonna do something like your dad did?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Yes. I need to prepare her now to save her from pain down the road.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 penny Down the road? Sheldon, she wanted to share a toothbrush holder with you, and now you’re at an ice cream parlour trying to pick up women.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Well, anything can sound silly when you put it in that tone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 penny Honey, instead of worrying about pain you might cause in the future, how about trying to fix the pain you’re causing her right now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 sheldon_cooper I’m sure you’re right. I suppose I should apologize to you, as well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 penny Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 sheldon_cooper That must have hurt watching me look for other women without ever even considering you. Please understand that I think of you as more of a nanny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 penny Just finish your ice cream so I can get you home to bed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 raj_koothrappali I wonder if this is what it feels like to be Bernadette’s baby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 stuart_bloom I don’t know. Bernadette’s baby doesn’t have a Jacuzzi jet hitting just the right spot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 howard_wolowitz Those jets are for my secret spot, not his.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 bernadette_rostenkowski What do you do in there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 howard_wolowitz It’s called relaxing, and that’s all you need to know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 raj_koothrappali Well, it’s getting late. Maybe we should head home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 stuart_bloom Yeah, you’re probably right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 raj_koothrappali You coming?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 stuart_bloom Yeah, just give me a minute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 raj_koothrappali Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 stuart_bloom Well, you know how you’re wearing a bathing suit?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 raj_koothrappali Yeah?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 stuart_bloom I kind of went the other way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 howard_wolowitz You jackasses just bought yourselves a hot tub!
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter What do you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler It’s a nice enough spot. You know, if I’m going to start standing up for myself, this is exactly the kind of thing…
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 penny We’re back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, hi. Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter How you guys doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 penny We’re doing good. I think Sheldon has something he would like to say to Amy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 sheldon_cooper I wanted to apologize for my behaviour today. It, it was unnecessary. This is warm. Oh, and also, I am willing to forego the bathroom schedule.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler Oh. Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Why does she get that? We never got that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 penny Do you want him back?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter I’m very happy for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Amy, you should know I was never really interested in seeing other women. And to prove how serious I am about us, I’m willing to take our relationship to the next level.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 sheldon_cooper Amy Farrah Fowler, will you share this toothbrush holder with me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 amy_farrah_fowler I would love to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 leonard_hofstadter Did we really need to be here for this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode05 penny Call me crazy, but I found it moving.
