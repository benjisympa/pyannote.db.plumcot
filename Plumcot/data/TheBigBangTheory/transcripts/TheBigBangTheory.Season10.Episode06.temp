TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 penny Hey, have you ever heard of the Van Nuys Comic-Con?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 leonard ‭Yeah. It’s a dinky little convention where they sell collectibles and get sad D-list celebrities to appear. Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 penny I got asked to sign autographs there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 leonard That’s awesome. Is this for Serial Ape-ist?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 penny Well, it could be for the monkey movie. It could be my haemorrhoid commercial. The list does not go on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 leonard When is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 penny It doesn’t matter. I’m not doing it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 leonard What? Why not?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 penny You just said yourself, it’s sad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 leonard Yeah, but it’s not pathetic, that’s where I draw the line. Come on, we’ll have fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 penny I don’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 leonard You’ll have nerds fawning all over you. If you don’t love that, this marriage is in trouble.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 penny I guess it wouldn’t hurt to meet some fans and make a little extra money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 leonard Yeah. Wow, An appearance by George Lucas… ‘s dermatologist. Oh, I want that autograph.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 penny Oh, yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 amy You know, with us living together, maybe we could think about having people over.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 sheldon We have people over all the time. We have the maintenance people, the pizza delivery man, that UPS driver who feels the need to ask how parts of me are hanging.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 amy You know what I meant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 sheldon All right, fine. Let’s say that we were to entertain people. What type of gathering did you have in mind? Huh? A meal? Lunch? Brunch? Dinner? Afternoon tea? A formal tea? Hmm? Is it a party? And if so, what kind of party? Is it a cocktail party? A Tupperware party? Ooh, is it a surprise party? Oh, I hope it’s not a West Coast party, ’cause according to the man on the radio, a West Coast party don’t stop.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 amy I’m sorry I mentioned it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 sheldon Oh, don’t be. You get your hopes up, I knock them down. That’s called teamwork.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 howard That’s a kick. That’s an actual kick.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 bernadette What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 howard I felt a kick. There’s a baby in there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 bernadette Oh, yeah, that’s where I put it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 howard Oh, I mean, I know you’re pregnant. I just never connected the idea of pregnancy and you actually having a baby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 bernadette Which MIT did you go to?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 howard Oh, God, we are not ready to have an infant in this house. We don’t have a crib, we don’t have diapers, we’re not baby-proofed. Anyone can just walk in off the street and lift our toilet lids!
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 bernadette Howie, we have time to do all that stuff.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 howard Do we? Look at you. Willy Wonka would roll you to the juicing room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 bernadette The next person kicking you will be me. Good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 howard Are we even in a good school…? Ow!
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 bernadette I warned you, and I did it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 penny What’s all this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 leonard Oh, everything we need for your autograph session, head shots, markers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 penny Okay. Leonard, it’s sweet you’re excited about this, but it’ll be a miracle if one person asks for my autograph.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 leonard Are you kidding? I once paid twenty dollars for Theo Sassler’s signature.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 penny Who’s that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 leonard Oh, I don’t even know. I just liked his name. Theo Sassler. Okay, and look at this. I even got a change maker. How much change you want, little lady?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 penny Oh, there’s so much I want to change.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 leonard Yeah, well, if it’s a dollar, you’re in luck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 amy What’s going on here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 sheldon You expressed an interest in having people over, and I feel I dismissed it too quickly. So, I took matters into my own hands, and I arranged a brunch.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 amy Well, that’s so nice. Who’s coming?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 sheldon Oh, uh, Stuart, Bert from the geology lab, and Mrs. Petrescu from downstairs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 amy You mean the Romanian lady on the second floor?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 sheldon Yes. Oh, fun story, she grew up with ten siblings. Or possibly penguins. Her English is atrocious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 amy That’s an odd mix of people.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 sheldon Well, for our first time hosting, I thought it would be wise to conduct a trial run. You know, like how I practiced for that Halloween haunted house by going into the bathroom at the bus station.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 amy You never went into that haunted house.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 sheldon You never saw what jumped out at me at the bus station.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 amy Well, thank you, Sheldon. This is a fun surprise.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 sheldon Oh. Well, the real surprise is how surprised you are that I’m great at surprises.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 amy Well, that’s not a surprise at all. I mean, if I knew you were good at surprises, I would have
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 sheldon Don’t get me all randy. Guests are on the way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 howard Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 bernadette Hey, where you been?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 howard Oh, we went and did a little shopping for the baby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 raj Wait till you see the crib we found.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 bernadette You bought a crib without me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 howard You’re gonna love it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 raj Yeah, it’s the highest rated one on the market. I wouldn’t even call it a crib, I’d call it a Fortress of Solitude for babies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 bernadette Sounds expensive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 howard Okay, well, I may have gone a bit overboard, but you can’t put a price on safety. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 raj Though if you did, it’s more zeroes than you’re expecting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 howard But it’s the safest crib you can buy. And if you don’t like it, we can return it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 bernadette Fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 howard In our new minivan. Hey, what’s for lunch?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 bernadette You bought a minivan?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 howard It’s for the baby, and I didn’t buy it. The dealer loaned it to me for a 24-hour test drive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 raj Though we did ding up the back pretty good with the crib, so you might have bought a minivan.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 bernadette I don’t want to drive that. It’s such a mom car.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 howard The guy at the dealership said they’re not just for moms anymore. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 raj Then again, he did think you were my husband.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 bernadette They thought it at the ultrasound, why not at the car dealership?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 leonard Never been on this side of the table before. I feel powerful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 penny Really? I feel like I’m selling candy so our team can get new uniforms.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 leonard Okay, so it’s four seventy-five for a signed black-and-white and nine ninety-five for a colour. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 penny Alright, why not five and ten bucks?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 leonard Well, I brought my moneymaker. Let me shake it. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 penny Hey, that guy’s looking over here. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 leonard Oh. You think he’s your first autograph?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 penny I don’t know. Be cool. He’s coming. He’s coming. Hi. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 guy Hi. I love your movie. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 penny Well, thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 guy It has got to be one of the worst things I’ve ever seen in my life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 penny Your love confuses me. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 leonard Would you like an autograph?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 guy Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 penny Okay. Who do I make it out to?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 guy Daniel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 penny Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 daniel I have to ask. Were you trying to be that bad, or are you just a terrible actress? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 penny That did not clear things up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 leonard That’ll be four seventy-five.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 daniel Keep the change.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 leonard But I-I-I, oh. Nothing about that was good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 amy There’s nothing to be afraid of, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 sheldon The average cork speed is 25 miles per hour. If that is too fast around a school, it is certainly too fast around a kitchen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 amy Been 15 minutes. Just sayin’.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 sheldon Okay. I can do this. Just give me a moment… Oh! Mimosas coming up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 bert I once left orange juice in my fridge so long, it tasted like a mimosa.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 amy How old was it
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 bert It’s hard to say. I don’t remember much after I drank it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 sheldon Would you like one, Mrs. Petrescu?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 mrs_petrescu Yes. Drink is fun and good friends, Applebee’s.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 sheldon She’s learning English from TV.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 mrs_petrescu TV, good. Now back to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 stuart Hey, guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 amy Hi, Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 stuart These are for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 amy Oh, they’re pretty. Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 sheldon Stuart, this is Bert from the Caltech geology lab, and this is Mrs. Petrescu from downstairs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 stuart Nice to meet you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 mrs_petrescu Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 bert Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 stuart So, what did I miss?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 bert Eh, we watched Sheldon try to open a bottle for 15 minutes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 mrs_petrescu 15 minutes can save you 15% or more on car insurance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 stuart Anybody else coming to this thing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 penny What’s your name?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 jeff Jeff.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 penny Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 jeff My favourite part is your shower scene.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 penny Been hearing that a lot today.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 jeff I even have a screen grab on my phone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 penny Yep, there they are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 leonard Okay, let’s keep it moving.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 penny Here you go. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 leonard Should’ve punched that guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 penny Well, go ahead. He’s right over there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 leonard Why do you do that? Can’t you let me have my moment?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 penny Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 awkward_guy Hi. I like your movies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 penny Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 awkward_guy I saw both of them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 penny I assume we’re still talking about the movies, but after today, who knows.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 awkward_guy You think I could get a picture of us?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 penny Oh, sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 awkward_guy And, uh, could you be giving me a kiss?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 leonard No. She cannot kiss. What is wrong with you people?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 penny Leonard…
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 leonard No, no, no. It’s not okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 awkward_guy Who are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 leonard I’m her husband.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 awkward_guy No, you’re not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 leonard I am.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 penny Yeah, he really is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 awkward_guy No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 howard It’s got a rearview camera, there’s a DVD player, oh, and check this out. It’s like we’re living in the future.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 raj Hey, show her the trunk. Show her the trunk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 howard Imagine this, you’ve got the baby in one hand, groceries in the other, and you’re thinking, how am I gonna open this trunk?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 bernadette I’m probably thinking, where’s my husband, and why isn’t he helping me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 howard You don’t need my help when you can open the trunk with a simple kick of the foot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 raj No, it’s a gentle kick, you’re doing it wrong. Here. Give me those.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 howard Uh, maybe it was more of a circle?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 bernadette It’s weird that guy thought you were a couple.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 howard Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 raj Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 howard See? Easy. And look at all this cargo space. Now we’ll get the crib out and you can take it for a test-drive. I’m telling you, this van is gonna be… uuh-uuh, uuh-uuh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 bernadette Oh, is it your back?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 howard Oh, yeah, oh, anyway, let’s just get in and see if the GPS can take us to the nearest emergency room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 sheldon So until Amy’s apartment is fixed, she and I are living here together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 bert I lived with my old girlfriend. She was a geologist, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 amy Things didn’t work out?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 bert I came home from work one day and she had taken everything. I’m warning you, hide your good rocks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 mrs_petrescu My sister’s husband took all her things, too. Story at eleven.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 stuart Really, no one else is coming?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 sheldon This is it. You are the practice round.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 stuart Practice round? For-for what?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 amy Uh, no. He, he just means that you were the first people we thought of.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 sheldon You know, exactly. We’ve never thrown a brunch before, and I wanted to work out all the kinks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 stuart So, I’m like a lab rat before your real friends come over?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 sheldon Hmm. You see, your words sound reasonable, but your face looks angry. Help me out here, this is not where I shine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 amy Stuart, you know you’re one of our favourite people.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 sheldon Okay, now, see, you look sincere, but your words are completely false. I’m glad we did this test run, these brunches are wild.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 awkward_guy But how did you get her to go out with you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 leonard Well, she moved in across the hall.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 penny And he started to slowly wear me down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 leonard Like a river carves a canyon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 penny Yeah, except the river kept showing me his Pokémon cards.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 redhaired_guy Ready to go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 awkward_guy Hang on. This guy’s telling me how he got the Serial Ape-ist girl to marry him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 redhaired_guy This guy? But he’s wearing a change maker.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 penny I think it’s hot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 leonard That’s right. I’m her change daddy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 howard Aaaaah. What was I thinking? Wolowitzes are not a lifting people. We tip the lifting people.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 bernadette Do we really have to sit for hours in the emergency room? They’re just gonna give you ice and Advil like last time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 howard You’re gonna feel terrible when I’m in a wheelchair. Which, by the way, would fit easily in the back of this award-winning minivan.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 bernadette Fine, we’ll go to the E.R. Just stop selling me on the van.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 howard You’re right. It sells itself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 raj You have to admit, it’s a pretty smooth ride.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 bernadette I was hoping it’d be quieter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 howard If childbirth is half this bad, you are so screwed. Are we there yet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 bernadette Soon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 howard Why is it taking so long?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 howard I’m in too much pain to watch cartoo… oh, this is a good one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 raj I’ve been babysitting him way longer than you have.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 bernadette Fine. I’ll buy the stupid van.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 bert This is the best blintz I’ve ever had.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 sheldon Oh. Thank you. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 bert It almost makes up for the incredibly awkward turn things took earlier.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 stuart You know what, I, I, I think I’m just gonna go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 amy No, Stuart, don’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 stuart No, I consider you and Sheldon like my family, and I’m not even sure you think of me as a friend. You have any idea how that feels?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 amy We’re so sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 stuart I’m always the last one anybody thinks of.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 sheldon Well, no, that’s not true. I mean, sometimes it’s Koothrappali. But we’re not supposed to say that ’cause he’s a minority.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 stuart Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 sheldon Stuart, wait. I do know what it feels like to be left out. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 bert I know how it feels, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 sheldon All right, this is about me and him, you’re not part of it. Stuart, perhaps we do take you for granted, and that is not acceptable. Please know that you truly are a valuable member of our social group.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 stuart Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 sheldon You know, in fact, I’d like to propose a toast. To Stuart. A fine man, a good friend and a wonderful guest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 bert Hear, hear.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 amy Cheers.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 mrs_petrescu Cheers. Filmed before a live studio audience.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 leonard And that is how a short asthmatic scientist landed a stone cold fox.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 awkward_guy Oh. Whoa. I didn’t know you can propose to the same person so many times.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 leonard The third time I did it in skywriting, but she never looked up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 penny You know, once, I proposed to him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 leonard Yeah. I said no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 redhaired_guy Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 leonard I just wanted to make her work for it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 penny Yeah, that’s gonna cost you later.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 redhaired_guy Hang on. Is she just with you because you’re rich?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 leonard She makes more money than I do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 awkward_guy What? Who are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 sheldon Do you know what else I love about you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 stuart Hmm?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 sheldon Your handwriting is impeccable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 stuart Thank you for noticing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 sheldon No, I mean it. I mean it. It’s like you have the soul of a label maker.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 stuart You know what I love about you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 sheldon Hmm?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 stuart You never leave the house without a paper clip.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 sheldon You never know when two pieces of paper might temporarily need fastening in the top left corner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 stuart I also love how you never use swear words.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 sheldon You know, it turns out, you can hurt people just as well without ’em.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 amy Maybe I can get a little help putting some of this stuff away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode06 sheldon Oh, calm down. I already put away five of these. You see? No muss, no fuss, not a single cuss.
