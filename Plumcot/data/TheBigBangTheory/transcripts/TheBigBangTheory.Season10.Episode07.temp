TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon Hello, I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy And I’m Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon And welcome to the first on location episode of Dr. Sheldon Cooper and Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler present…
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 both Dr. Sheldon Cooper’s Fun with Flags.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon Hit it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 howard For joy and fun there’s no better manner than to fly a pennant flag or banner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 raj What fills my heart and makes my eyes moist? Sending a flag up a pole on a hoist. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 together Fun with flags, fun with flags.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 howard Oh say can you see, it’s fun with flags.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 together Fun with flags. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy As you may notice, just one of the changes around here is our new house band. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon Who haven’t learned their place yet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy We’re also coming to you live from a different apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon Dr. Fowler and I began an experiment in living together after her apartment became water damaged. This is our friend Penny’s place. You may remember her from our episode, Flags and the People Who Don’t Understand Them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy So, in the spirit of cohabitation, the theme of today’s episode is flags of two regions coming together as one. Such as the flag of St. Kitts and Nevis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon So, let’s roll up our sleevis and get to know Nevis. Well, I, I like that, but next time check with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy Did you know that the flag was designed by a student named Edrice Lewis…
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny I can’t believe I’m saying this, but can we watch the news or something?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard It’s cute, they’re having fun living together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Yeah, I wonder what they’re gonna do when her apartment’s ready.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 bernadette Actually, it’s been ready for weeks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard What do you mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 bernadette Well, they finished the work early, but she’s been telling Sheldon they’re behind schedule.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard So, she’s just been lying to him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Well, you’ve lied to Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard Yeah, but to make him leave, not to make him stay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon Buda and Pest united to form Budapest. And that’s why Budapest is the Budabest. Now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 howard Oh, right. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon Thank you for your services, gentlemen. Now, I’m hoping to broaden our audience with your youthful rock and roll music.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 howard Aw, you think you have an audience, that’s funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 raj We don’t get paid? Nothing? Not even a sandwich?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy It’s almost dinner time. You in the mood for anything?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon Yeah, we could get Thai food near your apartment and then drop in and check on the progress.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy Oh, you don’t want do that, it’s a construction zone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon So?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy Well, what about your fear of stray nails and butt cracks?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon I am terrified of stepping on a nail and falling into a butt crack.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy Anyway, how about dinner?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon You know, if you’d like, I could call your landlord and complain.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy Thanks, but you don’t have to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon Oh, I don’t mind, I’m very good at complaining. If it were an Olympic sport, I’d complain about what a stupid sport it is and then I’d take home the gold.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy Good stuff. So, uh, what about dinner?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon Is it me, or are you purposely changing the subject?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy No. And on the subject of subjects, is your use of the word subject the same or different as when we speak about the subject of a king?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon I have a feeling you’re still doing it. But I find that topic irresistible, so, now, in ancient Mesopotamia, the king referred to the people as his property.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 howard I’m serious, JPL’s actually developing a robot arm that could grab an asteroid before it hits us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard So their plan for saving the Earth from Armageddon is hoping a bunch of scientists can catch a ball?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 raj If we’re all gonna die, why am I eating so much kale?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard You’re awful quiet, everything okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon I’m concerned about Amy. She’s acting a bit odd lately.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 howard Oh. Well, just out of curiosity, what registers as odd to you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon Her behaviour. No, I have the feeling that she’s hiding something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard I wouldn’t worry about it. She’s probably just distracted by work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon Well, whatever it is, it’s troubling me. And I can’t eat, I can’t sleep. And don’t even ask about the consistency of my bowel movements.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 howard You heard him, guys, don’t ask.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon Why would she keep something from me, you know? I shared my body with that woman. And my Netflix password. They recommended Stella Got Her Groove Back because of her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard Buddy, buddy, listen, nothing bad is going on, she just, she just didn’t want you to know that the work on her apartment was finished a couple weeks ago.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon I don’t understand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard She’s enjoying living with you and she didn’t want it to end early.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon So, she’s deceiving me in order to spend more time with me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon Oh. Well, I feel both flattered and hurt. Like when people say I look like that skeleton from Nightmare Before Christmas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 raj Oh my God, that’s who you look like.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard Sheldon, this is not a big deal. It’s a little white lie, everyone does it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 raj Not me, I’m a hundred percent honest in all of my relationships.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 howard And how single are you right now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 raj Eating cake on the toilet single. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon Well, I won’t tolerate deception in my relationship. I have no choice but to confront her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 howard Don’t do that, you’ve got gold here. Hang onto it until you’re in trouble and then throw it in her face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard Why would you tell him that? That’s terrible advice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 howard So you wouldn’t want to have anything on Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard Well, of course not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 howard So, if I actually know something right now, and I do, you don’t want me to tell you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard Uh, no. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 howard I’ll take that as a yes. She’s secretly been moving your collectibles into storage a little at a time and you haven’t noticed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard Are you kidding me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 howard See, I’ve known that for weeks, but, you know, I waited till the moment when it would cause him the most pain.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard Superman’s gone, my stormtrooper’s gone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon Your Klingon word-of-the-day calendar’s gone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard I’d say damn it in Klingon, but that wasn’t until next month.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon It’s khoo-vakh. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard Khoo-vakh! She took my Where’s Waldo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon No, no, he’s over there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard Oh, yeah, there he is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny So, what’s the deal with your apartment? Why’s it taking so long?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy Um, it was a drywall problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Oh, no, what happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy Well, the drywall got wet, and you do not want wet drywall because when drywall gets wet, it’s really more…
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Wet wall?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy Or damp wall, just as bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Mm. So why don’t they just get more drywall?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy Well, they went to get some, but the woman at the wall store said it was going on sale and they should wait because the savings…
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Okay, are you done? Bernadette told me your apartment’s ready.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy I was done at wet wall, but you wouldn’t let it go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny But is Sheldon really believing all this crap?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy Well, he started to question it, but then I fake sneezed on him and he ran to take a shower. Please don’t say anything, I feel terrible about this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Oh, don’t worry, I won’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny The woman at the wall store?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy Let it go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon Are you going to confront Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard Eventually, I guess. Although, I am kind of curious how long she thinks she can keep hiding my stuff without me knowing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon Hmm. You know, perhaps instead of confronting them, we should see how far they’re willing to spin their tangled webs. Like that Spider-Man action figure that used to be on your desk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard Oh, my God, I’m going blind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy Food’s here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon Excellent. I’m very hungry. Speaking of which, what’s going on with your apartment?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy Oh, uh, they’re still working on it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon Interesting. Very interesting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Yeah, we swung by her apartment on the way to the restaurant, and they’re gonna be fixing it for a while.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon Wait, uh, you saw her apartment?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny I did, still a mess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard Yeah?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon jlyajbe’. DaH nep’a’ Penny? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard jISovbe’ 
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy Why are you speaking Klingon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon Why are you speaking English?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy This is ridiculous. Penny, do you remember when I taught you Ubbi Dubbi?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Ubabsubolubutubly ubi duboo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy Ubexcubellent. Duboes Shubeldubon knubow ubi’m lubyubing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Ubif Lubenubard tubold hubim, ubit’s pubossubibuble. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon Oh, wait, stop that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy You stop that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon Dayaj’a’ 
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard ghobe’ 
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon Qu’vatlh 
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Okay. That’s enough. You know what? What is going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard Fine, I told Sheldon that her apartment’s been finished, but then you just said it’s not, so now I’m all confused.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy Penny was just covering for me. My place has been ready for two weeks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon How could you lie to me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Uh, she’s enjoyed living with you. It’s called being in love.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard Mm-hmm, and what’s it called when you secretly get rid of all your husband’s stuff?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny What? Tha… That is not true.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard Bernadette told Howard, Howard told me, plus, I can see all my stuff is gone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Oh, so, you believe your friend, and your friend’s wife and your own eyes over me? Wow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard You really didn’t think I’d notice my stuff was missing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Uh, did you notice your key chain?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard Where’s Batman?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 bernadette Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Why did you tell Howard I was hiding Leonard’s things?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 bernadette One sec. Why did you tell Leonard I told you Penny was hiding his things?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 howard It just came up because we, we were talking about secrets and… wait, juH qachHom Dotlh Sov ‘Iv 
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy Everybody stop it with that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 raj I’m not really a part of this, so I’m just gonna dig in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy And I’d like to know why you blabbed about my apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 howard You’re up, blabby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 bernadette Amy, I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said anything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy I guess it’s okay. I’m sorry that I lied about my apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon It’s all right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard And?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny And what? Your wizard robes are next to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 raj Now that everything’s out on the table, you, you think you two will keep living together?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon Despite recent events, I do consider our experiment in cohabitation to have been positive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy Are you saying you’d like to live with me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon I’m open to the possibility.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Ubamy bube cubool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy Whatever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 howard You know, if he moves across the hall for good, Leonard could keep the stuff you don’t like in Sheldon’s old room. Solves everything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny That’s a great idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard Ooh, maybe I could turn it into a gaming den.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 raj That would be amazing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon Wuh wuh hold on, excuse me, that’s my room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard But you won’t be living here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon But that’s my room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard But you won’t be living here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon But that’s my room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard You guys might want to start eating. But you won’t be living here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Sweetie, once you stop paying rent, none of this is really yours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon But that’s my room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 everyone But you won’t be living here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy Thank you for understanding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon Hey, I get it. Everybody wants to spend more time with me. I’m like a man made of sugar in a world of ants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy Good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon Night. If we did continue living together, would it be here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy I don’t know. It, it could be. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon Of course there’s, there’s always your apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy Sure, sure, we, we could live in my apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon I hate your apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy Sorry, you brought it up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon Well, I suppose we could find a whole new place. You know, and, technically, we don’t even have to stay in Pasadena. We could, we could move to Altadena or a place that doesn’t even end in dena.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy It’s kind of exciting. I mean we could do whatever we want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon But what if we move and we don’t like it? What if there’s a smoker in the building? Or pets? Or there could be mould? There could be traffic noise. I’m gonna have to learn a whole new bus route. Are you trying to soothe me by singing the Star Trek theme as a lullaby?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon I’m not a child, don’t do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy Sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard Look, I get it, this is still my room, we haven’t really made it yours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard Which is why I got you this Pink Power Ranger. Put it anywhere you like.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Okay, but you may feel some discomfort.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard I’m kidding, I want you to feel at home here. Decorate it any way that makes you happy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Do you really mean that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard I really do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Great, and just so you know, I’m not getting rid of all your stuff.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard Yeah? What are you keeping?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny That candle and you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard What about my robot poster?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Uhbubububuh, I can make do with just the candle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon I’m struggling with the thought of leaving my old bedroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy Can it be more of an internal struggle?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon I need to see it. While I’m gone, don’t breathe on my pillow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy How about if I just don’t breathe at all?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon That’s my girl. What on earth? What is going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard Oh, hey, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny We turned your room into a sex dungeon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy What is happening?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 howard Okay, last question. The chaps he was wearing, assless?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon Can we just focus on the decision I’m facing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 raj We can, but for the record, all chaps are assless.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon Gentlemen, please, this is a significant decision. Now, do Amy and I continue living together? Or do I move back in with Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard Over my assless chaps you will.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 howard This isn’t complicated. Do you love Amy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 raj Do you like living with her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard Do you know what you need to do now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon Apparently, figure this out on my own ’cause you guys are no help at all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon I’m just contemplating Buridan’s donkey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy I understand. I’ll leave you be.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon What, you’re familiar with the reference?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy Of course. Jean Buridan proposed a philosophical thesis stating that a hungry donkey placed between two equidistant bales of hay would be paralysed by indecision and would starve to death.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon Exactly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy Well, I wouldn’t want you to starve to death, so here’s an eggplant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy You know, some people believe that Buridan was plagiarizing Aristotle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy Although, in Aristotle’s example, he proposed an equally hungry and thirsty man caught between food and drink.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon Huh. Yeah, I wonder if that’s related to the 12th century Persian philosopher, Al-Ghazali and his story of a man caught between two dates.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy Are you suggesting Al-Ghazali was Aristotelian? ‘Cause if anything, he was anti-Aristotelian.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon Al-Ghazali was anti-Aristotelian? Boy, you think you know a guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Okay. Open your eyes and see your new room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard Wow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny I know I went a little overboard. We can always dial it back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard No, no, no, no, no, it’s, it’s important to me that you have the bedroom you want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Oh, that means so much. I love you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard I love you, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard Just hiding some stuff in your closet, don’t tell Penny.
