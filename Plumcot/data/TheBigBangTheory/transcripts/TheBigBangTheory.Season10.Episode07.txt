TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Hello, I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler And I’m Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper And welcome to the first on location episode of Dr. Sheldon Cooper and Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler present…
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 both#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 Dr. Sheldon Cooper’s Fun with Flags.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Hit it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 howard_wolowitz For joy and fun there’s no better manner than to fly a pennant flag or banner.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 raj_koothrappali What fills my heart and makes my eyes moist? Sending a flag up a pole on a hoist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 together#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 Fun with flags, fun with flags.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Oh say can you see, it’s fun with flags.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 together#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 Fun with flags.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler As you may notice, just one of the changes around here is our new house band.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Who haven’t learned their place yet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler We’re also coming to you live from a different apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Dr. Fowler and I began an experiment in living together after her apartment became water damaged. This is our friend Penny’s place. You may remember her from our episode, Flags and the People Who Don’t Understand Them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler So, in the spirit of cohabitation, the theme of today’s episode is flags of two regions coming together as one. Such as the flag of St. Kitts and Nevis.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper So, let’s roll up our sleevis and get to know Nevis. Well, I, I like that, but next time check with me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler Did you know that the flag was designed by a student named Edrice Lewis…
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny I can’t believe I’m saying this, but can we watch the news or something?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter It’s cute, they’re having fun living together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Yeah, I wonder what they’re gonna do when her apartment’s ready.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 bernadette_rostenkowski Actually, it’s been ready for weeks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter What do you mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 bernadette_rostenkowski Well, they finished the work early, but she’s been telling Sheldon they’re behind schedule.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter So, she’s just been lying to him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Well, you’ve lied to Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, but to make him leave, not to make him stay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Buda and Pest united to form Budapest. And that’s why Budapest is the Budabest. Now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Oh, right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Thank you for your services, gentlemen. Now, I’m hoping to broaden our audience with your youthful rock and roll music.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Aw, you think you have an audience, that’s funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 raj_koothrappali We don’t get paid? Nothing? Not even a sandwich?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler It’s almost dinner time. You in the mood for anything?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Yeah, we could get Thai food near your apartment and then drop in and check on the progress.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, you don’t want do that, it’s a construction zone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper So?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler Well, what about your fear of stray nails and butt cracks?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper I am terrified of stepping on a nail and falling into a butt crack.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler Anyway, how about dinner?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper You know, if you’d like, I could call your landlord and complain.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler Thanks, but you don’t have to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Oh, I don’t mind, I’m very good at complaining. If it were an Olympic sport, I’d complain about what a stupid sport it is and then I’d take home the gold.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler Good stuff. So, uh, what about dinner?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Is it me, or are you purposely changing the subject?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler No. And on the subject of subjects, is your use of the word subject the same or different as when we speak about the subject of a king?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper I have a feeling you’re still doing it. But I find that topic irresistible, so, now, in ancient Mesopotamia, the king referred to the people as his property.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 howard_wolowitz I’m serious, JPL’s actually developing a robot arm that could grab an asteroid before it hits us.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter So their plan for saving the Earth from Armageddon is hoping a bunch of scientists can catch a ball?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 raj_koothrappali If we’re all gonna die, why am I eating so much kale?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter You’re awful quiet, everything okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper I’m concerned about Amy. She’s acting a bit odd lately.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Oh. Well, just out of curiosity, what registers as odd to you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Her behaviour. No, I have the feeling that she’s hiding something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter I wouldn’t worry about it. She’s probably just distracted by work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Well, whatever it is, it’s troubling me. And I can’t eat, I can’t sleep. And don’t even ask about the consistency of my bowel movements.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 howard_wolowitz You heard him, guys, don’t ask.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Why would she keep something from me, you know? I shared my body with that woman. And my Netflix password. They recommended Stella Got Her Groove Back because of her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Buddy, buddy, listen, nothing bad is going on, she just, she just didn’t want you to know that the work on her apartment was finished a couple weeks ago.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper I don’t understand.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter She’s enjoying living with you and she didn’t want it to end early.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper So, she’s deceiving me in order to spend more time with me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Oh. Well, I feel both flattered and hurt. Like when people say I look like that skeleton from Nightmare Before Christmas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Oh my God, that’s who you look like.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, this is not a big deal. It’s a little white lie, everyone does it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Not me, I’m a hundred percent honest in all of my relationships.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 howard_wolowitz And how single are you right now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Eating cake on the toilet single.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Well, I won’t tolerate deception in my relationship. I have no choice but to confront her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Don’t do that, you’ve got gold here. Hang onto it until you’re in trouble and then throw it in her face.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Why would you tell him that? That’s terrible advice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 howard_wolowitz So you wouldn’t want to have anything on Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Well, of course not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 howard_wolowitz So, if I actually know something right now, and I do, you don’t want me to tell you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Uh, no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 howard_wolowitz I’ll take that as a yes. She’s secretly been moving your collectibles into storage a little at a time and you haven’t noticed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Are you kidding me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 howard_wolowitz See, I’ve known that for weeks, but, you know, I waited till the moment when it would cause him the most pain.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Superman’s gone, my stormtrooper’s gone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Your Klingon word-of-the-day calendar’s gone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter I’d say damn it in Klingon, but that wasn’t until next month.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper It’s khoo-vakh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Khoo-vakh! She took my Where’s Waldo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper No, no, he’s over there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Oh, yeah, there he is.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny So, what’s the deal with your apartment? Why’s it taking so long?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler Um, it was a drywall problem.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Oh, no, what happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler Well, the drywall got wet, and you do not want wet drywall because when drywall gets wet, it’s really more…
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Wet wall?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler Or damp wall, just as bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Mm. So why don’t they just get more drywall?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler Well, they went to get some, but the woman at the wall store said it was going on sale and they should wait because the savings…
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Okay, are you done? Bernadette told me your apartment’s ready.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler I was done at wet wall, but you wouldn’t let it go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny But is Sheldon really believing all this crap?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler Well, he started to question it, but then I fake sneezed on him and he ran to take a shower. Please don’t say anything, I feel terrible about this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Oh, don’t worry, I won’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny The woman at the wall store?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler Let it go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Are you going to confront Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Eventually, I guess. Although, I am kind of curious how long she thinks she can keep hiding my stuff without me knowing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Hmm. You know, perhaps instead of confronting them, we should see how far they’re willing to spin their tangled webs. Like that Spider-Man action figure that used to be on your desk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Oh, my God, I’m going blind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler Food’s here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Excellent. I’m very hungry. Speaking of which, what’s going on with your apartment?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler Oh, uh, they’re still working on it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Interesting. Very interesting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Yeah, we swung by her apartment on the way to the restaurant, and they’re gonna be fixing it for a while.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Wait, uh, you saw her apartment?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny I did, still a mess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Yeah?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper jlyajbe’. DaH nep’a’ Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter jISovbe’
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler Why are you speaking Klingon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Why are you speaking English?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler This is ridiculous. Penny, do you remember when I taught you Ubbi Dubbi?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Ubabsubolubutubly ubi duboo.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler Ubexcubellent. Duboes Shubeldubon knubow ubi’m lubyubing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Ubif Lubenubard tubold hubim, ubit’s pubossubibuble.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Oh, wait, stop that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler You stop that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Dayaj’a’
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter ghobe’
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Qu’vatlh
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Okay. That’s enough. You know what? What is going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Fine, I told Sheldon that her apartment’s been finished, but then you just said it’s not, so now I’m all confused.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler Penny was just covering for me. My place has been ready for two weeks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper How could you lie to me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Uh, she’s enjoyed living with you. It’s called being in love.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Mm-hmm, and what’s it called when you secretly get rid of all your husband’s stuff?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny What? Tha… That is not true.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Bernadette told Howard, Howard told me, plus, I can see all my stuff is gone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Oh, so, you believe your friend, and your friend’s wife and your own eyes over me? Wow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter You really didn’t think I’d notice my stuff was missing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Uh, did you notice your key chain?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Where’s Batman?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 bernadette_rostenkowski Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Why did you tell Howard I was hiding Leonard’s things?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 bernadette_rostenkowski One sec. Why did you tell Leonard I told you Penny was hiding his things?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 howard_wolowitz It just came up because we, we were talking about secrets and… wait, juH qachHom Dotlh Sov ‘Iv
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler Everybody stop it with that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 raj_koothrappali I’m not really a part of this, so I’m just gonna dig in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler And I’d like to know why you blabbed about my apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 howard_wolowitz You’re up, blabby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 bernadette_rostenkowski Amy, I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said anything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler I guess it’s okay. I’m sorry that I lied about my apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper It’s all right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter And?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny And what? Your wizard robes are next to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Now that everything’s out on the table, you, you think you two will keep living together?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Despite recent events, I do consider our experiment in cohabitation to have been positive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler Are you saying you’d like to live with me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper I’m open to the possibility.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Ubamy bube cubool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler Whatever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 howard_wolowitz You know, if he moves across the hall for good, Leonard could keep the stuff you don’t like in Sheldon’s old room. Solves everything.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny That’s a great idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Ooh, maybe I could turn it into a gaming den.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 raj_koothrappali That would be amazing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Wuh wuh hold on, excuse me, that’s my room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter But you won’t be living here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper But that’s my room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter But you won’t be living here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper But that’s my room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter You guys might want to start eating. But you won’t be living here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Sweetie, once you stop paying rent, none of this is really yours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper But that’s my room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 all@ But you won’t be living here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler Thank you for understanding.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Hey, I get it. Everybody wants to spend more time with me. I’m like a man made of sugar in a world of ants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler Good night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Night. If we did continue living together, would it be here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler I don’t know. It, it could be.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Of course there’s, there’s always your apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler Sure, sure, we, we could live in my apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper I hate your apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler Sorry, you brought it up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Well, I suppose we could find a whole new place. You know, and, technically, we don’t even have to stay in Pasadena. We could, we could move to Altadena or a place that doesn’t even end in dena.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler It’s kind of exciting. I mean we could do whatever we want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper But what if we move and we don’t like it? What if there’s a smoker in the building? Or pets? Or there could be mould? There could be traffic noise. I’m gonna have to learn a whole new bus route. Are you trying to soothe me by singing the Star Trek theme as a lullaby?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper I’m not a child, don’t do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler Sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Look, I get it, this is still my room, we haven’t really made it yours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Which is why I got you this Pink Power Ranger. Put it anywhere you like.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Okay, but you may feel some discomfort.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter I’m kidding, I want you to feel at home here. Decorate it any way that makes you happy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Do you really mean that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter I really do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Great, and just so you know, I’m not getting rid of all your stuff.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Yeah? What are you keeping?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny That candle and you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter What about my robot poster?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Uhbubububuh, I can make do with just the candle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler What’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper I’m struggling with the thought of leaving my old bedroom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler Can it be more of an internal struggle?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper I need to see it. While I’m gone, don’t breathe on my pillow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler How about if I just don’t breathe at all?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper That’s my girl. What on earth? What is going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Oh, hey, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny We turned your room into a sex dungeon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler What is happening?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 howard_wolowitz Okay, last question. The chaps he was wearing, assless?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Can we just focus on the decision I’m facing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 raj_koothrappali We can, but for the record, all chaps are assless.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Gentlemen, please, this is a significant decision. Now, do Amy and I continue living together? Or do I move back in with Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Over my assless chaps you will.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 howard_wolowitz This isn’t complicated. Do you love Amy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 raj_koothrappali Do you like living with her?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Do you know what you need to do now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Apparently, figure this out on my own ’cause you guys are no help at all.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper I’m just contemplating Buridan’s donkey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler I understand. I’ll leave you be.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper What, you’re familiar with the reference?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler Of course. Jean Buridan proposed a philosophical thesis stating that a hungry donkey placed between two equidistant bales of hay would be paralysed by indecision and would starve to death.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Exactly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler Well, I wouldn’t want you to starve to death, so here’s an eggplant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler You know, some people believe that Buridan was plagiarizing Aristotle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler Although, in Aristotle’s example, he proposed an equally hungry and thirsty man caught between food and drink.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Huh. Yeah, I wonder if that’s related to the 12th century Persian philosopher, Al-Ghazali and his story of a man caught between two dates.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 amy_farrah_fowler Are you suggesting Al-Ghazali was Aristotelian? ‘Cause if anything, he was anti-Aristotelian.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 sheldon_cooper Al-Ghazali was anti-Aristotelian? Boy, you think you know a guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Okay. Open your eyes and see your new room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Wow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny I know I went a little overboard. We can always dial it back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter No, no, no, no, no, it’s, it’s important to me that you have the bedroom you want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 penny Oh, that means so much. I love you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter I love you, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode07 leonard_hofstadter Just hiding some stuff in your closet, don’t tell Penny.
