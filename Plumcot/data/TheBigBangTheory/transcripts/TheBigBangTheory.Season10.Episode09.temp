TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 bert Thank you very much. Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 leonard That is unbelievable. Good for Bert.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 howard Damn, the MacArthur Genius Grant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 raj Couldn’t have happened to a nicer guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon Everything is stupid and I want to go home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 leonard That’s Sheldon’s way of saying he’s proud of Bert, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 howard Ah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon Hey, it’s not even called the Genius Grant, it’s the MacArthur Fellowship. Just like it’s not Frankenstein, it’s Frankenstein’s Monster. Which brings us back to that hulking simpleton over there. And if anyone’s a genius, it’s me for the way I brought that full circle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 leonard How much money did he win?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 raj Over half a million dollars.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 leonard Wow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 howard And he doesn’t have to use it for research, he can do whatever he wants with it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon Oh, good, maybe he can build a nicer bridge to live under.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 howard Here he comes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 leonard Right. Be polite.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon I know how to behave.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 howard Do you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 raj Hey, congratulations Bert.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 leonard Yeah, good for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 howard That’s amazing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 bert Thanks. I was as surprised as anybody. When they called and told me I won, I didn’t believe them. And then they said, no, you really won. And then I said, cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon Someone call George R. R. Martin, this guy knows how to finish a story.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 bert I’ve gotten pretty good at telling it. Well, see ya.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon Some genius. I zinged him with sarcasm, he didn’t even notice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 leonard I know, and it was the greatest sarcastic quip I’ve ever heard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon Well, aren’t you a peach.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon Who leaves their bike in the hallway? You know, if I knew how to ride one, I’d steal it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 leonard Ignore him, he’s just cranky because Bert from the geology lab won a big grant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 penny Oh, I heard him interviewed on the radio. You know, when they told him he won, he didn’t believe it, but then he did believe it. It was so funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon Who listens to the radio any more?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 amy Bert is studying the way microbes in rocks can survive in extreme environmental conditions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 leonard They say it could be a potential indicator of life on other planets.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 penny You know what, I’ve met Bert. Isn’t he an indicator of life on other planets?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon You used to make those jokes about me. Now everything is Bert, Bert, Bert.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 amy You know, Sheldon, maybe if you take the time to actually read Bert’s research, you’d be less bitter about him winning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon You want me to read a geology paper?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 amy Honestly, I just want you to be quiet but I’m all out of taffy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 howard You busy? There’s somebody out here who wants to meet you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 bernadette Who is it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 howard Say hello to everybody’s little friend, remote control Stephen Hawking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 bernadette Where did you get that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 howard I found him in an old box.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 bernadette Why would you buy it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 howard I didn’t buy it. I made it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 bernadette Last question. What is wrong with you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 howard What’s the big deal?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 bernadette Howie, it’s in poor taste.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 howard No, it’s not. Check it out, he says fun stuff.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 remotecontrol_hawking Hey good lookin’, want to go for a spin?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 howard His eyes also light up in the dark.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 leonard It’s always fun watching him read someone else’s work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 penny It’s like scrolling through the emojis on my phone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon Yeh, why? Eh, why? Oh, that’s why.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 amy Sounds like the night we had coitus.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon I hope you’re happy making me read this. Bert’s work is remarkable, and I’m more upset than ever. This is worse than when I had to admit that Cedric the Entertainer’s actually entertaining.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 amy Sheldon, it’s foolish to be angry that Bert’s work has merit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon Yeah, well I am angry. And you telling me not to be angry makes me angry. And do you know how hearing myself say the word angry over and over makes me feel?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 penny Ooh, ooh, ooh, angry?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 leonard What are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 penny I, I knew the answer. I got excited.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 leonard Hey, buddy, why don’t we go for a walk, so you can calm down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon That’s a good idea. I guess everyone’s having them now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 leonard Hey, I’m trying to help you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon Fine. You can walk ahead of me and scare off the pigeons.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 leonard You just wave your arms a little and they fly away, it’s not…
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 howard Okay, Raj, I’m gonna show you something. Now, one of us thinks it’s offensive, the other thinks it’s hilarious and a great idea. But, I’m not going to tell you who likes it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 raj This is tough, but I’m going to say it’s the guy who shows me YouTube videos of people getting hit in the nuts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 howard You’re crazy. I’ve worked with Hawking. He’s got a great sense of humour, and I think he’d like it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 bernadette Okay, call him and show him. I dare you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 howard I have no problem calling him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 bernadette Fine, then do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 howard Fine, I will.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 bernadette While you’re bothering the world’s most famous scientist, be sure to show him how funny he looks getting stuck under our dishwasher.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 raj What’s this button do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 remotecontrol_hawking Gentlemen, start your wheelchairs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 howard You laughed when that guy got hit in the nuts.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 raj I laughed because the guy was Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon I admire you, Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 leonard Really, why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon You’re happy with who you are. You don’t get jealous of other people. Instead of being weighed down by ambition, you just float along like a dead body in a river.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 leonard I couldn’t just take the compliment. I had to ask why. You know, I do understand what you’re feeling. My brother and sister’s accomplishments have always been held over my head.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon How did you deal with it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 leonard I wet the bed until college, but I don’t think that’s a quality fix.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon I can’t believe I was surpassed by a geologist. I mean, rocks. He studies rocks. If rock is so great, how come paper beats it? Leonard, I’m having a primal urge to throw this rock.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 leonard Do it. Visualize it as your anger and, and toss it out of your life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon Perhaps I will. This rock encapsulates all my negative emotions. I will cast you far away. Feel free to take out a pigeon while you’re at it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 leonard Let it fly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow…
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 amy What happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon I tried to let go of anger and threw a rock into my foot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 leonard Then he got more angry and kicked the rock with his other foot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 penny Well, and what happened to you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 leonard Oh, I laughed so hard, I burst a blood vessel in my nose. It’s fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 amy You know, it’s one thing to be envious, but now you’re injuring yourself. It has to stop.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 leonard Although if you are gonna do it again, please let me know, so I can get it on video.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 amy You know, Sheldon, instead of fixating on what Bert has, you should appreciate all of the good things in your life. You’ve got love, you’re in good health, you’ve got a roof over your head.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon Yeah, but you’ve got all those things, and no one’s lining up to be you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 amy Anybody else want to try? I’m gonna go make some more tea and question my life choices.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 leonard You’re up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 penny This is getting old fast, Dolores, knock it off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon Uh, do you really think calling me names is helpful?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 penny I do, your life is fine you big baby. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon Maybe you’re right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 amy Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 leonard If it helps, I’m questioning your life choices, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon Thank you, Penny. You know, I just need to keep reminding myself that Bert’s success is not my failure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 penny There you go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon And that men of his large stature are more susceptible to a wide array of life-threatening diseases.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 penny There you go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 amy What’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 howard I’m conducting a quick survey. Do you think this respectful and loving tribute to a great man is in poor taste?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 amy Yep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 howard Do you think this is in poor taste?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 leonard Does it spin around and do tricks?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 howard Yeah
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 leonard Then yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 howard What do you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 barry That is hiwawious. Give me the wemote contwol, I want to dwive him into the girls’ westwoom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 howard All right, we’re done. It’s offensive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon Top of the afternoon, gentlemen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 howard You’re in a good mood.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon Well, it’s a new day. I have a new outlook. You know, I realized I don’t need to worry about other people. I just need to think more about myself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 leonard Oh, how will we ever get used to the new you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 raj Well, I’m glad to see you moving forward.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon Bert did quality research, and he deserves whatever accolades he receives.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 howard What is going on? Did you upgrade his software last night?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 leonard I think he might be learning on his own.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 raj Then the robot uprising has begun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon Excuse me, I need to pay Bert a proper congratulations.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 raj He doesn’t just look like C-3PO, now he walks like him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon Bert? I wanted to let you know that I read your research, and your award is well-deserved.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 bert Thanks. I’ve been hearing that a lot. Ever since I won, people think I’m great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon Well, just this once, you can count me as people, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 bert You know, as a MacArthur Grant winner, I’m allowed to nominate someone for next year.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon Really? I didn’t know that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 bert So I was thinking, you know, engineers don’t get a lot of respect. Is your friend Howard working on anything cool?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon You know, I’m not sure. You know, you’d have to ask him. Excuse me. Aah. Leonard, I hurt myself again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 leonard Excuse me, I have to go take some pictures.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 amy I can’t believe you head-butted a water fountain.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon No, I went to punch the water fountain, slipped in water in front of the water fountain, and hit my head on the water fountain.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 bernadette I can’t imagine you being violent.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 leonard It’s not hard. Just picture the Three Stooges, and then take away two stooges.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon I’m so disappointed in myself. Jealousy is completely illogical.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 raj It’s a human emotion, Sheldon. Everyone gets jealous. I’m jealous of Leonard and Penny and Howard and Bernadette for being in such happy relationships.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 amy What about me and Sheldon?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 raj Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 leonard I’ve always been jealous of how much money Raj’s family has.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 raj Thank you for saying that. Next to buying things, that is the best part about having money.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 amy Ever since I met Penny, I’ve been envious of her looks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 penny Aw, thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 amy That’s why I was so happy when you cut your hair off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 amy You know what I mean. You were still hot, but more like a why’d that hot girl cut off all her hair, hot.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 penny You liked my short hair, right?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 leonard Yeah. I loved it. Love you, love the hair, would love to change the subject.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 penny Seriously, none of you liked it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 bernadette I thought it was brave. Does that count as liking it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 penny You know, how come nobody’s talking about Howard’s dopey haircut?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 bernadette I think he looks cute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 howard And I think you’re cute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 raj I think you’re both cute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 penny I think I hate all of you nerds.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon Sorry I’m moving slowly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 leonard Oh, I don’t mind. If you pull a butterscotch out of your pocket, it would be like I’m walking with my grandma.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon Oh, no. A plaque? Nobody wants to see this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 leonard Well, change plaque to mixed-race couple and you are my grandma.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon I can’t take this any more. Bert. Bert. Bert. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 bert Come in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon All right, let’s do this, Bert? We need to talk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 bert What happened to you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon Rock, rock, water fountain. I am not proud of this, but I have been envious of your recent success.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 bert Wow, I won the MacArthur Grant, everyone’s jealous of me. Once I get Lasik, I’ll be out of things to wish for.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon I was hoping by admitting my weakness to you, I’d somehow be unburdened.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 bert Is it working?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon No. Now that you know my weakness, I hate you more than ever.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 bert Well, you know, we’re both pretty smart. I bet if we put our heads together, we could come up with a solution.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon We, hang on, you’re my enemy. Now, the enemy of the enemy is my friend. And right now, I’m my own worst enemy. That makes you my friend. Okay, I’m good to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 bert Great. Now that we’re friends, want to see if we can get tickets to a taping of Ellen?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon You know what? This isn’t gonna work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 bert Sheldon, wait. You know, you’ve got a lot to be happy about. You’re at the top of your field, you have a great girlfriend.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon Yes, that’s right. I have Amy. In the past, you’ve professed feelings for her. Does it eat you up inside that I have her and you don’t?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 bert It used to. But now that I’m rich and successful, I think I can do better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 penny I can’t believe you punched Bert.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon I didn’t punch him. He turned around, and I gave him a Captain Kirk karate chop. I’m not even sure he knows I did it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 leonard Hey, Sheldon, I’ve got someone here who might make you feel better.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 stephen_hawking Hello, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon Professor Hawking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 hawking I understand you’re struggling with professional jealousy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon Thanks, Leonard, now he’s not gonna think I’m cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 hawking Don’t worry, I know how you feel. I have never won a Nobel Prize.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 penny Oh, wow, that doesn’t seem fair.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 hawking It’s fine. I’ve been on The Simpsons.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon How do you deal with the success of your colleagues?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 hawking I remind myself every scientific advancement is a victory. Also, I was on Star Trek.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 leonard Oh, it was a good one. He played poker with Sir Isaac, you don’t care.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 hawking Don’t waste your time on jealousy Sheldon, you’re too brilliant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 amy How can you feel bad if Stephen Hawking says you’re brilliant?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon I can’t. Thank you, Professor Hawking. You are a gift to mankind. There should be statues of you everywhere. You know, the Lincoln Memorial has a big chair. We could swap you right in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 hawking I always thought a motorized toy of me would be cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon What a wonderful idea, how does this man not have a Nobel?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 leonard Do not tell Wolowitz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 amy Way ahead of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 ellen A new study came out, and it said that laughing makes your brain work better. And I know that’s true because laughing has made me the smartiest. Although, on the other hand, babies laugh a lot, and they’re dumb.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode09 sheldon Do people know about her? ‘Cause she’s delightful.
