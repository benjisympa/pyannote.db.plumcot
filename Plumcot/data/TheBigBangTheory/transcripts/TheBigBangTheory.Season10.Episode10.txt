TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 amy_farrah_fowler If we’re going to be staying in this apartment, would you be interested in doing a little redecorating?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Oh, actually, I would.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 amy_farrah_fowler Great, what’d you have in mind?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Let’s take every single thing from the other apartment and put it in here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 amy_farrah_fowler Well, how about we start a little smaller? Like moving the furniture around.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 sheldon_cooper You know, I have always thought that this couch would look fantastic on the curb in front of the building.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 amy_farrah_fowler Look, we can’t just throw away Penny’s stuff, but we can ask if she wants any of it back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 sheldon_cooper You know, I wonder how she feels about all this artwork.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 amy_farrah_fowler Well, I’m sure she misses this one. I mean, it’s the greatest gift I’ve ever given anybody.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 sheldon_cooper It truly does capture the beauty of your friendship with Penny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 amy_farrah_fowler It may have appreciated in value. The artist killed himself shortly after painting that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Yeah, it seems only right that she have it back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 amy_farrah_fowler I can’t wait to see the look on her face when I give it to her again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Look, it’s the same smile she has in the painting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Yeah, there’s hooks in the closet, I can hang it right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 penny Oh, no, no, those hooks are gone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 sheldon_cooper What happened to them?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 penny Uh, we ran out of candy on Halloween, I was just giving everything away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Hey, guys, what are you, oh, that’s here, cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 penny Amy wants me to have it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 amy_farrah_fowler Well, it would be selfish of me to keep it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 penny But it’s a picture of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 amy_farrah_fowler And you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 penny But you commissioned it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 amy_farrah_fowler To give to you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 penny But you like it so much.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 amy_farrah_fowler So do you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 penny I seem to be losing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Yes, you do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 sheldon_cooper You know, Leonard, the more I think about it, there are a number of mutually owned items in this apartment that you and I should go through. Uh, for example, who gets our beloved sword, Longclaw?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 penny Why don’t you keep it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 sheldon_cooper That seems fair, we did just give you the painting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 penny Yeah, I don’t need anything around that I can stab myself with.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Wonderful, Longclaw is mine. And how about you keep our avocado plant?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Sounds right, a limited edition collectible worth hundreds of dollars and a thing that grew out of a thing we fished from the trash.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Although, Amy and I did just move in together, and a plant is a lovely housewarming gift.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Fine, take the plant.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Oh, we got a sword and a plant, our apartment’s really shaping up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski Stuart, you didn’t have to get us a baby gift.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 stuart_bloom Oh. Just homemade coupons for things you might need help with before the baby gets here. Going to the grocery store, driving you to the doctor, if you’re not in a hurry I can dig you a koi pond.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski A foot massage?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 stuart_bloom And that’s not me being creepy, that’s for either of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 howard_wolowitz This is very nice Stuart, thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski How come this one’s on the back of an eviction notice?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 stuart_bloom Oh, yeah. Uh, now that you mention it, can I live here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski Stuart, we’d love to help you out, but this a bad time, we’re about to have a baby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 stuart_bloom Or is that why this is a great time? Think about it, when that baby comes you’re gonna need all the help you can get.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski Thank you, but I’m not really sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Hang on, maybe it’s not the worst idea. I mean, he did do a good job taking care of my mother.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 stuart_bloom That woman didn’t get heat rash once with me on powder patrol.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski I guess you could stay for a few days and we’ll see how it goes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 stuart_bloom Thank you. And it’s only temporary, just till I get back on my feet, or the baby goes off to college, whichever happens first.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 howard_wolowitz When would you move in?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 stuart_bloom Well, uh, my car broke down in your driveway, so I’m gonna say now. But I am ready to be helpful. In fact, I’m gonna go vacuum.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski Hmm. Actually I just did that this morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 stuart_bloom Okay, then I’ll dust.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski I did that, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 stuart_bloom Then I’ll check the batteries in the smoke detectors.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski Howard just did that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Yeah, let him do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Oh. Remember when we got this at Comic-Con?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Oh, yeah. The Mr. Spock cuckoo clock.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 mr_spock_cuckoo_clock#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 Live long and prosper. Live long and prosper. Live long and prosper. Live long and prosper.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 sheldon_cooper It’s one of a kind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 penny So if it breaks there’d be none of it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Well, Leonard, you know, who should keep this? On the one hand, I love Mr. Spock more than you do. On the other hand, I care more about clocks than you do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter So you think you should keep it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 sheldon_cooper I’ll be right across the hall. You’ll probably be able to hear it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Keep the clock, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 penny Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 amy_farrah_fowler Thank you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Oh, now, what about our 3-D chess set?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Let me guess, you want it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Well, no, I just didn’t think you’d want a physical reminder of a game you never managed to win. As a kindness, I should probably take all the games.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter You know what, Sheldon, take it. In fact, you can have everything, I really don’t care.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Are you sure? These items represent our shared times together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Well, now they’re yours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 penny Leonard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Well, you know what’s gonna happen, he’s just gonna come up with some reason why everything should be his.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 sheldon_cooper For a man so good at predicting my moves, how come you stink at 3-D chess?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, you’re, you’re being a little selfish. Why don’t you let Leonard keep a few things?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 sheldon_cooper It’s not my fault I’m bad at sharing, I skipped kindergarten.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter You know what? There is one thing I would like.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Yeah, take whatever you want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter I would like to keep the official flag of our apartment.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 sheldon_cooper But you don’t even like flags.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, I like this one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 sheldon_cooper But I designed it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter But you made me order it because you were too well-known in the flag community and they’d jack up the price.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 sheldon_cooper But you don’t even understand its symbolism.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Oh, I do. The, the field of blue represents you being miserable, and the lion sticking its tongue out means I’m happy about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Come along, Amy. I know when I’m not wanted.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 amy_farrah_fowler I don’t think you do, but all right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski Stuart, you cooked?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 howard_wolowitz How did you know it wasn’t me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski There’s only three people in this house, and you’d still be my fifth guess.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 howard_wolowitz That’s Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 stuart_bloom You guys relax, I’ll get it. Have some bread while it’s still warm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 howard_wolowitz It’s like we have a butler. If I had a Batsuit I’d be Bruce Wayne.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski You have a Batsuit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 howard_wolowitz It’s pajamas, there’s no cape.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 stuart_bloom Hey, Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 raj_koothrappali Hey, Stuart. What are you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 stuart_bloom Oh, I’m living here again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 raj_koothrappali Do, uh, Howard and Bernadette know? Or is it like a possum in the walls kind of thing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 stuart_bloom No, I needed a place to stay and, with the baby coming, I figured they could use some extra help.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 raj_koothrappali Okay, cool.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 stuart_bloom Anyway, come on in, dinner’s ready.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 raj_koothrappali Oh, but I bought Chinese takeout.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 stuart_bloom Oh, okay. Well, if Bernadette wants her ankles to swell up even more, she can have that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Is the Wi-Fi working for you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 penny Uh, hang on. I don’t think so, I’m clicking on one weird trick for a flat belly, but I’m still seeing celebrities who look like their pets.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Oh, I knew it, Sheldon changed the password.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 penny Are you sure?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Well, the new network name is ha ha ha, now I’ve got you, so it’s either Sheldon or Gargamel from The Smurfs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 penny What a jerk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter You’re good at revenge, how do we get him back?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 penny Well, my go-to move is usually sleep with the person’s boyfriend, but I kind of feel like I’m already doing that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, I know what you did, now change the password back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Well, powder me in sugar and call me a doughnut, if it isn’t Leonard Hofstadter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, I’m warning you, I can play this game, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 sheldon_cooper If it’s like your 3-D chess game, then you’re out of your length, width and depth. Amy, get the Neosporin, somebody just got burned.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter All right, I tried.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 sheldon_cooper All right, I tried. That should be the title of your autobiography. Ooh, a second-degree burn.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 amy_farrah_fowler I’ve got the Neosporin. Who got hurt?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 sheldon_cooper It’s a good thing you’re cute.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 raj_koothrappali So, I was reading how it’s a good idea for new parents to take an infant CPR class.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, we’ve been meaning to do that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 stuart_bloom Oh, I know a CPR instructor who’ll come to the house.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 howard_wolowitz That’d be great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 stuart_bloom I’ll give him a call. We met when I was sleeping on the beach and he thought I was dead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski Thank you again for cooking. It’s getting tough for me to be on my feet all day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 stuart_bloom You just kick back and relax, I’ve got it all under control.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 raj_koothrappali Although it was already under control.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 stuart_bloom I’m sorry, you mumbled something?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 raj_koothrappali It’s just that they’ve had plenty of help.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 stuart_bloom Well, you know what they say, it takes a village.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 raj_koothrappali Well, they already had a village.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 stuart_bloom I noticed the village couldn’t find time to put the crib together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 raj_koothrappali Yeah, well, maybe the village was too busy checking out the local Montessori school for the new arrival.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 stuart_bloom You mean the one with the empty beer bottles in the sandbox? We’ll pass, thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski Do something, Batman.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 sheldon_cooper What do you think you’re doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Separating my delicates.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 sheldon_cooper This is the level you’re stooping to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter No. This is the level I am stooping to. I believe that is flag to crotch four, checkmate. Easy-peasy, ooh, so breezy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 stuart_bloom Hey, what’s up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 raj_koothrappali I’m here to put the crib together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 stuart_bloom Ooh, sorry, I already did it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 raj_koothrappali Well I don’t know if you realize this, but I bought that crib.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 stuart_bloom Oh, yeah, I read about that on WhoGivesACrap.com
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 raj_koothrappali Why are you being like this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 stuart_bloom Because I love Howard and Bernadette and if I want to keep mooching off them, I need to be helpful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 raj_koothrappali Hey, this pregnancy had an emotionally-needy third wheel way before you came along.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 stuart_bloom Why can’t there be four wheels?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 raj_koothrappali Is this what you do when I’m not here, make really good points?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 stuart_bloom Look, just come in and help me build a baby swing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 raj_koothrappali Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 stuart_bloom If you’re hungry you can eat your take-out, nobody touched it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 penny I think I’m gonna go for a run, you want to come?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter No, last time that old lady in the park kept screaming, watch out, he’s right behind you. Hello?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 strange_old_man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 Hey, how you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Uh, can I help you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 strange_old_man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 I don’t think so, but you’re sweet for asking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 penny What, what are you doing in our apartment?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 strange_old_man#unknown#TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 Oh, I rented a room from your neighbour, the tall guy dressed like a little boy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Unbelievable. Okay, uh, I don’t know what he told you, but you can’t stay here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 sheldon_cooper So, there are fresh linens on the bed and, oh, well, now, I see you’ve met Theodore. Theodore, these are your new room mates, Leonard and Penny. They’re very honest, but I would not leave cash lying around.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, what do you think you’re doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 sheldon_cooper My room is paid up until the end of the month, so I can do with it whatever I please, which includes renting it out for a dollar a night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 theodore It’s like the ’40s again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Anyway, I’ll leave you be. I have to, oh, oh, he’s expecting a newspaper in the morning. Apparently, they still make them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 penny All right, Sheldon, this is over the line.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 sheldon_cooper That’s true, but had I done something under the line, there wouldn’t be a man in your kitchen who can’t produce a single form of ID.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 theodore Oh, oh, I have a receipt from a blood bank. I’m O-negative.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 sheldon_cooper And now you know as much about him as I do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 raj_koothrappali Oh, hey, Bernadette, the swing comes with two different mobiles. The giraffes are pretty cute, what do you think?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski Great, go with the giraffes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 stuart_bloom Although the high contrast of zebra stripes might provide better stimulus for a developing baby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, you’re probably right, go with the zebras.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 stuart_bloom Good choice, boss.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 raj_koothrappali At least my nose is naturally brown.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski Hey, could you please go to the market for me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Get Stuart or Raj to do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski Howie, they’ve been doing everything for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Mm, I know. It’s really making me lose respect for both of them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski Please just go to the store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Fine. Who wants to drive me to the store?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 raj_koothrappali Me
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 stuart_bloom I’ll do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski Take Raj. Stuart is supposed to paint my toenails.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 penny What do you think? Should we go to a hotel?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter And just leave him here alone?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 penny Okay, I’ll go to a hotel. Text me in the morning if you’re still alive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Uh, Theodore, how long are you planning to stay exactly?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 theodore Oh, thanks to the coins I found in your couch, a day longer than I thought.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter This is ridiculous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 theodore I like the painting. Is that your mom?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Sheldon, get out here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Will you keep it down? What kind of vengeful bed and breakfast do you think I’m running?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter We lived together 13 years. How can you be so awful to me?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 sheldon_cooper I’m being awful? You’re the one who went out of your way to hurt me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Because you were being selfish.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Dividing our belongings is difficult.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Why? I said I didn’t care.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 theodore Excuse me. It’s none of my business, but it sounds like a lot of this anger is coming from love.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Yeah, thanks, but nobody asked you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 theodore Well, I’m just gonna keep on talking. Seems like, with Sheldon moving out, you’re in a new phase of your lives and it’s easier to fight than to face the feelings that you have for one another.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 amy_farrah_fowler I think he might be right. Also, who is that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 sheldon_cooper I have to admit, leaving you to move in with Amy has been harder than I thought it would be.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Well, for me, too. It’s not the same with you gone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 theodore If you’re looking for a new guy to live with.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 penny We’re good, thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 amy_farrah_fowler So, no one’s gonna tell me? Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 sheldon_cooper Leonard, I would like us to stop fighting about our possessions.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Well, I’d like that, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 sheldon_cooper In fact, I want you to keep the apartment flag, and I’m not just saying that because it touched your genitals.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter You promise?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 sheldon_cooper I do. And to show you that there are no hard feelings, I am willing to rub my genitals on it as well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 theodore Well if we’re rubbing genitals on things, that’s where I shine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 penny Little lower to the left. A little more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Good?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 penny No, still hideous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 leonard_hofstadter Well, I’m sure at some point, we won’t even notice it’s there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 penny Yeah, you’d think that, but after a while it starts showing up in your dreams.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 theodore I think it brings the room together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Hey, tomorrow who wants to paint the nursery?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 raj_koothrappali I’ll do it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 stuart_bloom Why do you get to do it? I’m the artist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 raj_koothrappali Just because you’re starving doesn’t make you an artist.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 stuart_bloom Just because I look sickly doesn’t mean I’m starving.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski Howard!
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Guys, you heard her, go see what she wants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 bernadette_rostenkowski I think I’m in labour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 howard_wolowitz Oh, oh, okay, okay, uh, uh, uh, I can do this. We have a plan. Somebody please tell me the plan.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 stuart_bloom I’ll get the hospital bag.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 raj_koothrappali I’ll pull the van up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 stuart_bloom Meet you outside in 2 minutes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode10 raj_koothrappali Team Baby, go.
