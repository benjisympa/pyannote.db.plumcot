TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 howard Oh, man, this is really happening. You doin’ okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 bernadette Here comes another contraction.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 stuart Let’s pick it up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 raj All right, hold on. I’m gonna drive like we do in India. Get out of my way, you syphilitic dogs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 howard Stop that, this isn’t India.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 raj Fine. What do one point three billion people know about having babies?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 howard Sorry. I know you were just trying to help. I love you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 raj I love you, too. We’re good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 sheldon Amy? Wake up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 amy What’s wrong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 sheldon It’s midnight. Happy birthday.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 amy Sheldon. Okay, you can have this back in the morning.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 sheldon This is for you. I was going to wrap it, but touching Scotch tape gives me the heebie-jeebies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 amy I’ll put in on the list with peaches and felt. What is this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 sheldon A functional MRI of my brain. I did Sudoku before they took it so I’d be ripped.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 amy I love it. Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 sheldon And it’s not just an MRI. The orbitofrontal cortex is lit up because I was thinking of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 amy Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 sheldon We seem to be moving on to the annual coitus portion of your birthday festivities. 
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 amy Is that okay?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 sheldon I didn’t put on my come-hither plaid PJ’s for nothing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 amy You hate Scotch tape, but you love Scotch plaid. You are a mystery.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 penny Guys, wake up. Bernadette’s having her baby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 leonard Come on, we’re going to the hospital.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 amy I guess, I guess we should stop.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 sheldon Yeah. I’m afraid so. Childbirth, looming coitus? This is a banner night for female genitals.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 midwife Now I see three of you. Do we know the father, or is this some Mamma Mia nonsense?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 howard I’m the father.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 midwife Okay, Dad, how far apart are the contractions?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 howard No idea. Ask him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 raj 12 minutes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 midwife 12 minutes? Why are you here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 stuart Aren’t we supposed to get here an hour and a half early?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 midwife This is a hospital, not the airport.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 bernadette I’m sorry. It’s our first time.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 midwife It’s okay. This little one will be here before you know it. Do we know what we’re having?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 howard No, we’re keeping it a surprise.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 midwife Old school. Nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 bernadette Not that old school. He knows.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 raj You see, I was at the doctor’s office, the folder was right there, so I took a peek.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 howard And talking like this doesn’t make it less creepy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 midwife Sweetheart, go home. Come back when the contractions are five minutes apart for an hour.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 raj I’m sorry, that’s ambiguous. Is it five minutes apart starting at the top of the hour, or five minutes apart starting with the first contraction, so essentially, like, 65 minutes?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 midwife I’m just throwing this out there, but home births are very popular these days.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 penny Sheldon, what took you so long?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 sheldon Wolowitz might hand out cigars. I had to find my bubble gum cigar so I could join in without looking foolish.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 leonard Damn, I need my inhaler.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 amy Just don’t smoke.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 leonard No, I went down the stairs too fast.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 penny Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 raj Don’t come to the hospital. We’re headed home.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 penny Oh, that was fast. Did she sneeze the baby out?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 bernadette We showed up too early. We’ll keep you posted.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 penny Okay, well, we’ll talk to you guys later. Bye. She said not to come. It’s gonna be a while.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 amy Well, first deliveries can be slow.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 sheldon I’m starting to rethink the Flash onesie I bought this kid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 leonard I found it, but it’s empty.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 penny Well, it doesn’t matter. We’re not going to the hospital now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 leonard Are you sure? I’d really like to.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 amy Well, should we, uh, head back up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 penny Well while we’re all awake, why don’t we go to a diner or something?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 amy Oh, uh, I don’t know. Sheldon, you don’t want to do that, do you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 sheldon It doesn’t matter what I want. It’s your birthday, you decide.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 penny Oh, my God. It’s your birthday. Let’s do something fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 amy Uh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 penny We could go to a bar.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 amy Well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 leonard Okay, I can breathe again. Babe, they want to have sex.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 penny Oh, of course. The annual birthday booty spectacular!
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 sheldon That’s a bit childish, isn’t it? 
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 penny I’m sorry, and what flavour is your bubble gum cigar?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 sheldon Grape. I find it the most mild.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 penny All right, well, you two go have fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 leonard If we find my backup inhaler, maybe we can get frisky.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 penny Oh, you sexy, wheezy little man.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 bernadette Do you really need to record this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 raj You’ll be happy I did. Okay, little one, here we are back at home because you weren’t quite ready to come out yet. You wanted to make an entrance. I get it. And here’s your daddy. When he tries to tell you he used to be cool, you can see he wasn’t.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 howard All right, enough with the camera.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 raj Well, this is not for me, this is for the baby. Some day she’s gonna want to see this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 howard I’m sorry, who’s gonna want to see this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 raj I, I said she, but lot’s of things are she, boats and cars, whales, like thar she blows!
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 stuart You’re doing great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 bernadette Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 raj Well, okay, I’m gonna sign off now. This next part may contain some adult language.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 bernadette How could you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 howard We made it this far without knowing, and you’ve ruined it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 raj Well, you guys have no idea how hard it is to know something like this and not say it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 stuart You told me it was a girl, and I didn’t say it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 bernadette Raj.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 raj You were supposed to keep that to yourself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 stuart Oh, yeah. I guess it is hard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 amy So, where were we?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 sheldon Well, I believe we were kissing like randy teenagers, and your nose was whistling ever so slightly.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 amy I’m sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 sheldon Oh, don’t be. You were like a foxy tea kettle.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 amy Well, shall we start over?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 sheldon Very well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 amy What’s wrong?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 sheldon I’m not sure. Earlier tonight, things began organically, and now it’s feeling forced, like all the Pirates of the Caribbean sequels.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 amy Okay, that makes sense. I mean, the mood’s a little different now. We, we don’t have to rush.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 sheldon Oh, I know, but just, Leonard and Penny think we’re doing it, and I don’t want to disappoint them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 amy And the mood continues to change.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 sheldon No, and also, I don’t want to disappoint you. I, you know, come on, it’s your birthday. I can soldier through this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 amy Hold on. I think I might have a little surprise that might help get things back on track.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 sheldon Intriguing. Is back on track a hint that it has something to do with trains?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 amy No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 sheldon Because if it did have to do with trains, and you were gonna give…
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 amy It’s not about trains.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 sheldon Not even a cozy sleeper car on the Orient Express?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 amy Stop talking about trains.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 sheldon Who’s killing the mood now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 leonard Found the backup inhaler, want to have sex?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 penny Well, I didn’t until I heard that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 leonard Hang on. I’m counting. It’s okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 raj Hello. Howard and Bernadette kicked me out because I told them they’re having a girl. Oopsy, I did it again.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 penny Maybe if we’re quiet, he’ll go away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 raj You’re gonna have to be quieter than that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 sheldon Can I look yet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 amy One second. All right, you can open your eyes. I thought I’d let Harry Potter make things hotter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 sheldon Wowza.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 amy I got a Gryffindor robe for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 sheldon What, a Gryffindor sleeping with a Hufflepuff? How scandalous. You naughty girl, you went to the Wizarding World theme park without me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 amy I did. Am I in trouble?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 sheldon Yes, you’re in trouble, you went to Wizarding World without me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 amy Wait, what just happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 sheldon You know I’ve been wanting to go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 amy Sheldon, do you really want to argue with me on my birthday?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 sheldon Oh, you’re right. I’m sorry.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 amy Ooh. Happy birthday to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 raj Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 amy Is this about the baby?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 raj No. People just keep kicking me out everywhere I go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 amy Good. Then you’re used to this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 penny Hey, Bernadette’s water broke.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 leonard Come on, everyone to the hospital.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 amy You have got to be kidding me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 howard Just try to relax, we’ll be there any minute. Stuart, stop driving like an old man. Speed it up a little.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 stuart I’m not an old man, I just can’t see at night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 bernadette Here comes another one. Hey, Squinty, the gas pedal’s on the right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 stuart All right, hang on. If you see any pedestrians, just call ’em out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 penny Howard and Bernadette’s kid might be born on your birthday. How cool is that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 raj This is not how I imagined this day going, I should be with them right now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 leonard Well, it is their child.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 raj I know that. But to be fair, I’ve spent nine months helping Bernadette get ready for this baby, and Howard spent five minutes conceiving it. And I’m being generous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 sheldon Five minutes? We must be doing it wrong. It took us hours.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 raj And, and the worst part is that they kicked me out and let Stuart stay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 amy I understand, but this is a special day for them. Can you just try and let it go?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 sheldon She’s right. You know, I just learned Amy went to a theme park without me, but I’m not going to ruin her birthday. I’ll wait, and ruin 24 individual hours sprinkled throughout the year. Boop.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 howard Deep breaths, slow breaths.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 bernadette I’m so thirsty. Give me more ice chips.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 stuart Sorry. I thought these were room ice chips. I’ll go get some more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 howard Uh, Stuart, while you’re out there, don’t come back.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 stuart Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 howard So, what are we gonna name this kid? Now that we know she’s a girl, it kind of ruins my plan for Wally Wolowitz.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 bernadette We could name her after your mom.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 howard Debbie? No. She hated that name.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 bernadette Did she have a middle name?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 howard Melvina.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 bernadette Let’s keep thinking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 howard Ah. It sucks that she’s not here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 bernadette I know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 howard Hm. She would’ve been the best grandma.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 bernadette She did always have candy in her pocket.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 howard Yeah. I was 20 years old before I figured out Tootsie Rolls weren’t naturally warm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 bernadette I didn’t know her five minutes and she asked, are you a Milky Way or a Snickers girl?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 howard Thank God you answered right, we wouldn’t be here today.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 leonard It’s hard to believe Howard’s having a kid.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 amy Yeah. Penny, you’re the one who introduced him to Bernie.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 penny How many times do I have to say I’m sorry?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 leonard It’s not just Howard and Bernadette. I mean, look how far we’ve all come.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 stuart Hmm. You two got married.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 amy Sheldon and I are living together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 sheldon But if my mom asks, we have bunk beds.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 leonard Penny was a struggling actress when we met, and now she’s a successful pharmaceutical rep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 penny Okay, you don’t have to say struggling every time. You can just say actress.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 stuart Howard went to space.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 amy Bernadette got her doctorate.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 leonard Sheldon, Howard and I are working with the government on our quantum gyroscope.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 amy We’ve all come a long way. There’s a lot to be proud of.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 raj For God’s sake, just drive in the knife, why don’t you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 stuart What’s your problem?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 raj Well, you’re all thinking it, I’m the only one who hasn’t done anything worthwhile.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 sheldon I was not thinking it. Although, now that you point it out, it is undeniable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 stuart Raj, if it’s any consolation, I’m no better off than I was ten years ago.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 raj Oh, yay, I have a doctorate in astrophysics and I’m every bit as awesome as the pasty-faced owner of a comic book store.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 sheldon Raj, show some compassion. Those are things that we think but don’t say.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 raj Excuse me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 leonard Sorry, Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 stuart Hey, I’m in a hospital and I’m not the patient. I’m fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 howard Come on, Bernie, breathe. Remember what you learned in birthing class.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 bernadette I remember thinking this is stupid, and I was right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 howard Do you want me to get the nurse?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 bernadette No. If one more person puts their fingers near my uterus, I’m gonna cross my legs and snap ’em off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 leonard I’ve come to peace with my relationship with my parents. That was a big milestone for me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 sheldon Oh, speaking of personal growth, I recently tried eating Swiss chard. You know, I didn’t swallow it, but Amy said it counted.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 raj Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 stuart Hey. Still a loser or did you turn things around while you were gone?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 penny You know, Raj, honey, you’re being too hard on yourself. When I first met you, you couldn’t even talk to women. I mean, you couldn’t even talk if one was in the room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 raj Oh, great, now I can say things like I can’t believe you’re breaking up with me, why are you breaking up with me? Yes, I’ll still help you move.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 penny Anyone else want to try?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 stuart Uh, yeah, I got something. Raj, not everybody could be a dog owner. Oh, what? Did your doggie break up with you too?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 penny Hey, I bought M&Ms at the vending machine and two bags came out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 raj I bought the first one, it didn’t fall.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 penny Here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 howard She’s here, the baby’s here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 penny Oh! 
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 raj Congratulations.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 amy How’s Bernadette?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 howard Tired, but great. They’re both great.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 penny Does the baby have a name yet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 howard We have named her Halley.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 penny – Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 leonard Oh, like Halley’s comet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 howard Exactly. Also like the comet, Bernadette said she’s not gonna have sex with me for another 75 years.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 amy That’s not a real thing, he’s just joking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 howard I’m gonna get back. Thank you for staying up, I can’t wait for Halley to meet her new aunts and uncles and godfather.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 raj Really?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 howard Of course.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 raj You hear that, Stuart? I’ve got a dog and a godchild, you have nothing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 penny Oh, look at all the babies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 sheldon Some will be successful, some may be homeless. It’s fun to think about.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 amy Kind of hard to see the names.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 penny Mm, that one kind of looks like Bernadette.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 amy They all look the same to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 raj Guys, she’s my goddaughter, I think I’ll know when I see her. That one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 amy Well, that was quite a day.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 sheldon It was. Bernadette had her baby, I made it to Wizarding World, and now it is time to complete your birthday celebration. Hankius pankius.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 amy I was afraid you’d be too tired.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode11 sheldon Amy, I just saw a magic train and reported somebody for cutting the line. If that’s not foreplay, I don’t know what is.
