TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 penny Hey, can you help me put some of the food out?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 leonard_hofstadter Yeah. Let me finish packing this stuff up. You know how Sheldon is if he sees Christmas stuff lying around after New Year’s.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 penny Yeah, but he doesn’t live here anymore.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 leonard_hofstadter Well, he doesn’t live at Walmart, but he still threw a tantrum when he saw Marshmallow Peeps after Easter. And that’s the same man who complains you can’t find Marshmallow Peeps after Easter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 penny Oh. It’s Bernadette. She says they’re running late. The baby threw up on Howard, and then Howard threw up on Howard.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 leonard_hofstadter Well, he didn’t throw up on the baby. That’s a win.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 amy_farrah_fowler Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 penny Hi. Welcome back. How was Texas?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper Oh, you know., the lone star state. Hmm. That should be its Yelp rating.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 amy_farrah_fowler It was not a great trip.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 penny Well, you’re home now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper Yeah. It is good to be home. Oh, good lord, is that mistletoe? Don’t you maniacs own a calendar?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 penny I told him to take it down. He would not listen to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 leonard_hofstadter Did you at least have a good flight down there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper It was fine. Other than the weird-tasting juice Amy gave me, I slept the whole way.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 penny So, what happened in Texas that was so bad?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 leonard_hofstadter And before our next drive to Comic-Con, I need the name of that juice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper Well, we were on our way to my mother’s house…
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper How did we get in the car?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 leonard_hofstadter Hold on. How did you get him in the car?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 amy_farrah_fowler I rented one of those carts, pushed him toward the open door and just let inertia take care of the rest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 amy_farrah_fowler So, while we’re at your mother’s house, it might be a good time to tell her that we’re living together.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper Do we have to? I really don’t want to hear the religious lecture.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 amy_farrah_fowler Maybe there won’t be one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper There’s always one. She gave it to my sister about her boyfriend, my brother about his girlfriend, my father about his girlfriend. That one had some un-Christian words in it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 amy_farrah_fowler Well, she likes me. You know, there’s a chance she might be okay with it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper Eh, I don’t know. I am her precious little boy. And you did take my flower.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 penny Do boys have flowers?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 leonard_hofstadter Who knows what he has down there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 penny Mm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper Anyway…
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 mary_cooper Thank you, God, for the food we are about to receive and for the nourishment of our bodies and bless the hands that prepared it. Amen.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper Given that your hands prepared it, isn’t that a little self-serving?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 mary_cooper You start changing the words to the prayers, next thing you know, you’re in a church with a guitar.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 amy_farrah_fowler Thank you for cooking, it looks delicious.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 mary_cooper Oh, it’s my pleasure. Mm. I’m so glad y’all could make it. So, tell me, what’s going on back home?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 amy_farrah_fowler Well, uh, Howard and Bernadette had their baby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 mary_cooper Oh, that’s wonderful. Now, have they decided to raise it Jewish or regular?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper Welcome to Texas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 amy_farrah_fowler They haven’t said. Anyway, we, uh, we also have some exciting news to share.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper Oh, wait, wait, shouldn’t we just eat? You know, I mean, God did take time out of his busy schedule to bless these Sloppy Joes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 mary_cooper Come on, Shelly, tell me your news.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper All right. This is on you. Amy and I are living together in sin, like a couple of New Yorkers. Now, while you scold us, I’m going to get a knife and a fork. Joe may be sloppy, but Sheldon’s not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 mary_cooper Well, thank you for letting me know, and I, for one, am thrilled.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper What? Wh, where’s the judgment? Wh, where’s the fire and brimstone? Where’s the part where you tell us we’re going to Hell and I say have you seen the size of the bugs outside? We’re already there.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 mary_cooper Obviously, I would prefer if you weren’t living out of wedlock, but given your special circumstances, I’m very happy for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper And what special circumstances are those?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 penny Oh, boy, I think it’s about to get bad.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 mary_cooper Shelly, how do I put this? By your third birthday, you had memorized over a thousand different kinds of trains, and I never imagined a woman getting aboard any of them.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper What, so you thought I was going to be alone for the rest of my life?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 mary_cooper No. Just for the middle part. ‘Cause at the end I assumed there’d be nurses.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper Well, this is highly insulting.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, don’t overreact.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper I’m the child she was worried about? I have a brother and sister whose combined intellectual wattage couldn’t power a potato clock, if I spotted them the potato.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 amy_farrah_fowler Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 mary_cooper Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 penny What?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper Well, I was in my room, I couldn’t hear what they were saying.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 amy_farrah_fowler I’ll take over from here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 amy_farrah_fowler He’s been in there a long time. Should I go talk to him?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 mary_cooper He’s upset with me. I should be the one who talks to him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 amy_farrah_fowler Are you going to?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 mary_cooper Oh, heck no.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, what, what are you doing?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper Just being the unsocialised eccentric my mother always thought I was.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 mary_cooper You startin’ to see why I didn’t go in there? Sheldon, if you’re trying to prove me wrong, the tighty-whities on your head ain’t changing my mind.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 amy_farrah_fowler We’re ignoring the fins, okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper Yeah. And I don’t understand why you’re taking her side. By being my girlfriend, she’s saying you’re a weirdo, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 amy_farrah_fowler I don’t think that’s what she’s saying.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper And?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 amy_farrah_fowler That’s exactly what she was saying.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper Can you believe my mother thinks we’re both strange?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 leonard_hofstadter Absolutely not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 penny That’s too loud.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 leonard_hofstadter Absolutely not.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 amy_farrah_fowler Well, after that, Sheldon and I got out of the house for a while.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper Well, first we buttered my feet to get the swim fins off, and then we went out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 amy_farrah_fowler You know, I’m sorry your mother made you feel bad. But, you know, at the end of the day, she was wrong, because you’re not alone.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper You’re right. I have Leonard and Howard and Raj, Stuart, Penny, Leonard’s mom, Bernadette, Wil Wheaton…
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 amy_farrah_fowler What about the woman who just buttered your big flat feet?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper I was going chronologically. You’re right between Koothrappali’s father and Omar, the one-eyed Sparkletts guy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 amy_farrah_fowler Well, let’s try to not let it ruin the rest of our trip.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper I knew we should’ve never mentioned us living together in the first place.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 amy_farrah_fowler She was gonna find out eventually.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper Disagree. We’ve known about evolution since 1859, she still believes in Noah and his amazing zoo boat. This could have all been avoided if you’d only listened to me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, I knew your mother was fine with us living together because I already told her we were.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper Why would you do that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 amy_farrah_fowler This was a potential issue, so I got out ahead of it and I managed the situation for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper You managed the situation?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 amy_farrah_fowler That’s right.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper So my mother thought I was incapable of finding a mate, and my mate thinks I’m incapable of running my own life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 amy_farrah_fowler Not your whole life. I mean, science, you got that. Organizing your sock drawer, you’re the king. But understanding how other people are feeling, that’s a weak spot for you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper I have gotten much better at that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 amy_farrah_fowler Have you? How am I feeling right now?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper What? How should I know? Excited? Itchy? Give me the first letter.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 amy_farrah_fowler You and I are in a relationship. I help you with your shortcomings, and you help me with mine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper How would you feel if I contacted your mother behind your back?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 amy_farrah_fowler Delighted that you showed any interest in my family at all?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper Delighted? What., not if I guessed for a hundred years.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 bernadette_rostenkowski Hi.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 howard_wolowitz Hey, guys.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 leonard_hofstadter Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 penny Hi. There’s the little family!
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 raj_koothrappali Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 stuart_bloom Hello.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 leonard_hofstadter And their Sherpas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 penny Mm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 howard_wolowitz The baby’s asleep, can we put her in your room?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 penny Yeah. Go ahead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 amy_farrah_fowler Do you need help?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 howard_wolowitz No. I got it. Doubtfire, Poppins, follow me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 bernadette_rostenkowski Sorry we’re late.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 penny Oh, it’s no problem, Amy and Sheldon were just telling us about their trip to Texas.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper Yeah. Here. I’ll catch you up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper How did we get in the car?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 penny Stop. Okay. They told Mary they were living together, there was a fight, he got his feelings hurt, then he put underwear on his head.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 leonard_hofstadter On purpose, not the way it used to happen in high school.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper I was acting odd intentionally.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 bernadette_rostenkowski Really? So you can control it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 penny Okay. Then what happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper Well, there’s really not much left to tell. I decided that my mother views me as a child because I never went through a rebellious phase, so, I got an earring. My mother made me take it out. Amy put alcohol on it. And here we are.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 howard_wolowitz What did we miss?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 bernadette_rostenkowski I couldn’t explain it if I tried.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 penny So tell me, how did Sheldon look with an earring?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 amy_farrah_fowler Like the pirate who helps the other pirates connect to the Internet.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 howard_wolowitz So what did you and Leonard do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 penny Actually, we got in a pretty nasty fight.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 leonard_hofstadter It might’ve been the worst one we’ve ever had.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 raj_koothrappali Oh, my God, what happened?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 leonard_hofstadter Well, we had started binge-watching Luke Cage together, and it was kind of our thing, and then I find out that she watched two episodes without me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 bernadette_rostenkowski It’s like I was excited for a present and got socks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 stuart_bloom I don’t understand how that turns into the worst fight of your life.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper I don’t understand what’s wrong with socks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 penny To be fair, we may have been on edge because of the Christmas tree.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 howard_wolowitz What happened
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 penny You do make a cute elf.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 leonard_hofstadter Oh, yeah? And you thought Spock ears were only good for Comic-Con.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 penny Hey, hey, I just found a farm where they let you chop down your own tree.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 leonard_hofstadter Oh cool, I’ll be like a pointy-eared Paul Bunyan.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 leonard_hofstadter Stupid idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 penny No, what’s stupid is a physicist who doesn’t understand when you swing an axe, you don’t let go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 leonard_hofstadter For the tenth time, my mittens were slippery!
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 penny Ugh. It’s 70 degrees, you didn’t need mittens.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 leonard_hofstadter You know how easily I blister.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 penny Yes, yes, you bruise, you peel. It’s like I’m married to an old piece of fruit.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 leonard_hofstadter Look, we could keep fighting and let it ruin our night, or, or we can stop and try to salvage the evening.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 penny Fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 penny Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 leonard_hofstadter Yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 penny There’s something on the windshield.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 penny You need a break?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 leonard_hofstadter Do not need a break.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 penny There’s no shame in asking for a break.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 leonard_hofstadter If I need a break, I’ll ask for a break.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 penny Ugh. Leonard?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 leonard_hofstadter Yeah?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 penny There’s a tree on you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 leonard_hofstadter You want to decorate it tonight?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 penny Yeah, with gasoline and a match? Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 leonard_hofstadter I hope it kills us both.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 leonard_hofstadter By the way, if anyone asks, the elevator shaft always had a tree in it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper So Bernadette, if I express interest in your baby will you promise not to make me touch it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 bernadette_rostenkowski Sure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper Hey, how’s life with your baby?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 amy_farrah_fowler Really? You’re never gonna touch their baby?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper To this day I’ve never touched Stuart.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 bernadette_rostenkowski It’s been wonderful, Sheldon, thanks for asking.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 bernadette_rostenkowski Oh, please stop crying, I’m begging you. I don’t know what else to do. My boobs are empty. Do you want lasagna? Shh, shh, shh, it’s okay, it’s okay. Shh. What have we done?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 howard_wolowitz Hey, I found superhero baby wipes, the perfect way to clean up crime, and tushies.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 bernadette_rostenkowski It took me two hours to get her down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 raj_koothrappali You know, in India when my baby brother cried like that, the servants would just take him far away so we couldn’t hear it. Not always, sometimes we’d leave.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 howard_wolowitz Hey, he got her to stop.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 bernadette_rostenkowski That was so fast.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 raj_koothrappali Oh, he’s really good with her.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, he has a gift.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 howard_wolowitz What’s the matter?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 bernadette_rostenkowski Nothing, these are happy tears.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 howard_wolowitz Oh, good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 bernadette_rostenkowski No they’re not, you bozo. How come Stuart can get her to stop crying, but I can’t?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 howard_wolowitz I mean, it’s Stuart. Maybe she’s playing possum until he goes away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 bernadette_rostenkowski Not funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 raj_koothrappali She’s tired, that was funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 bernadette_rostenkowski Everyone’s a better mom than me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 raj_koothrappali Oh, don’t take it so personally, maybe your baby’s just a jerk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper Wait, so how does the story end? Is the baby a jerk or is Bernadette a bad mother?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper What? Is there another twist coming? Is the baby not theirs at all?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 leonard_hofstadter Ignore him. How did you get the baby to stop crying?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 stuart_bloom Oh, I just talked to her. I’ve been told the sound of my voice puts people to sleep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 penny You poor things you must be exhausted.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 howard_wolowitz It has been hard to sleep with all the crying.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 bernadette_rostenkowski How can she hate me? I make her food in my chest. It’s like hating a frozen yogurt machine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 howard_wolowitz She doesn’t hate you, stop saying that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 bernadette_rostenkowski Now you hate me too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 howard_wolowitz Shh, I don’t hate you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper It says here that up to 80% of new mothers experience baby blues. And that the best thing to do is reassure them that they’re doing a good job. Bernadette, you are doing a good job.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 bernadette_rostenkowski Thank you, Sheldon, I’m feeling better now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper Thank you, Internet. I’m telling you, with the right YouTube video, I can give Howard a vasectomy.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 penny So things started to turn around?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, eventually I figured out how to get the baby to sleep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 leonard_hofstadter Please tell me you didn’t use Amy’s magic juice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 howard_wolowitz Bernie?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 bernadette_rostenkowski Shh. She’s asleep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 howard_wolowitz Great. And where are you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 bernadette_rostenkowski Down here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 howard_wolowitz Oh. This is new.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 bernadette_rostenkowski I didn’t know what else to do. It worked.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 howard_wolowitz Well, I’d say that’s thinking outside the box, but, come on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 bernadette_rostenkowski Don’t make me laugh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 howard_wolowitz Do you need help getting out?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 bernadette_rostenkowski I think I live here now. It’s fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 howard_wolowitz Is it okay if I get some sleep?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, go ahead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 howard_wolowitz Good job, Mommy. I’m proud of you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 bernadette_rostenkowski Don’t make me cry, either.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 howard_wolowitz Good night. I love both my girls.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 bernadette_rostenkowski We love you, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 penny I can’t believe you fit in the crib.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 bernadette_rostenkowski I could take a bath in the sink. I don’t, but I can.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 raj_koothrappali So how were your holidays?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 stuart_bloom Oh, thank you for asking. Uh, I, uh, went to visit my grandmother. She’s in Bakersfield. Uh, usually my brother and sister go… oh come on.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 amy_farrah_fowler That was fun, thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 bernadette_rostenkowski Yeah, thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 penny Our pleasure.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 leonard_hofstadter See you guys at work.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 raj_koothrappali Be there bright and early.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 howard_wolowitz Not me, paternity leave.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 sheldon_cooper Oh. A small human wreaks havoc on his wife’s genitals and he gets time off.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode12 howard_wolowitz With pay, sucka. Forgot the baby, still new to this.
