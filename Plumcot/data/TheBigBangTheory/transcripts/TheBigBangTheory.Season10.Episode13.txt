TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 penny What, what’s all this?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Well, it sounded like you were having a rough day, so i wanted you to come home to something nice.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 penny Oh, that is so thoughtful.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Hey, do you remember when we went wine tasting in Santa Barbara and you said that was you’d ever had?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 penny Yeah, i remember us driving up there, going to the winery and, that’s it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter and this wine is why.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 penny Oh. Hey, what smells so good?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter I made your favourite. Pizza bagels.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 penny Pink wine and pizza bagels? It’s like eighth grade all over again. I am so lucky to have you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Well, now be careful, these are hot. i could explain the thermodynamics of why the cheese seems hotter than the crust, but instead I’m gonna keep it to myself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 penny Oh, you always know what not to say. I just, i can’t believe you did all this.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Well, you know, It’s easy to take each other for granted and I never want to do that to you, because your love, it’s like a river. It’s peaceful and deep. Your soul is, it’s like a secret that I could never keep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 penny You did not just quote an Nsync song.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter I quoted your favourite Nsync song.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 penny Oh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Damn. I burped so hard, i died in my game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Leonard, i’ve been meaning to ask you, what size shoe do you wear?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Why?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 sheldon_cooper I’m trying to take more of an interest in other people’s lives.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter That’s nice. I wear a size eight and a half.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 sheldon_cooper That’s small. So, tell me, do you have any plans for the weekend?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Are you gonna laugh at the answer?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Only if the answer is shopping for baby shoes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter If you must know, Penny won a spa weekend from work, and she’s taking me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Oh, well you know, that is interesting. I wonder what kind of infection you’ll come home with. My money’s on fungal. They’re still having girls night across the hall.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter So, hang out with me and we’ll have boys’ night.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 sheldon_cooper At our age, why don’t we call it man’s night?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Because we just spent our allowance on comic books.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Penny, is it weird that we’re having girls’ night here, but you don’t live here any more, so it’s basically my girls’ night?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 penny I hadn’t really thought about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler But now you’re thinking about it and it bothers you? I get that.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski Things going well with you and Sheldon living together?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Better than ever. He asks about my day, takes an interest in my life. He’s like my boyfriend in college, except he’s real, so people can see him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski I’ve been seeing him for years, I’m still not convinced he’s real.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 penny Hey, can I ask you a question? You’ve been married for a while, is it normal for the husband to kind of completely stop giving a crap?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski Uh oh, what’s going on?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 penny Well, Leonard used to do all these things, like bring me flowers and wear pants.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski It’s okay, Howie never has on pants. The Domino’s guy brings the pizza like this now.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Well Sheldon always has his pants on. I don’t think I could pick his knees out of a line-up.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 penny Well, it’s not just the pants, it’s just, it’s like since we got married he doesn’t really try any more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Uh, Penny, I don’t know how to say this, but this is my first girls’ night and you’re kind of bumming everybody out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 howard_wolowitz All right, got Halley to sleep.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 raj_koothrappali Yeah, i heard you on the baby monitor. Didn’t think you could think you could turn the theme from Walking Dead into a lullaby.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Yeah, got to get her hooked on TV or someday she’ll want me to play outside. Boy, that floor is so squeaky. I’m surprised I didn’t wake her up walking out of the room.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 raj_koothrappali Have you tried anything to fix it?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Well, i put the rug down. It didn’t help.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 raj_koothrappali I know. Blue shag, what were you thinking?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Did try nailing a couple of the boards down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 raj_koothrappali Did that do anything?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Yeah, it left little holes in the floor, that’s why I bought the rug.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 sheldon_cooper If you do that, i’ll win in eight moves. I’ll win in five moves. I’ll win in one move.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Oh, no. Good game.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 penny Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Oh, Penny, I’m trying to take an interest in other people. Uh, how was your girls’ night?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 penny Oh, it was fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Hmm. Did you have anything to eat?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 penny Uh, chips.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Anything to drink?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 penny Some wine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Well, I’m just playing tennis against the drapes here.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Just ignore him.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 penny Hm. At least he took an interest.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter What’s that supposed to mean?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 penny Nothing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Hey, what’s going on with you?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 penny I don’t want to talk about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Well, hey, come on, just tell me.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 penny Fine. Lately I kind of feel like you’ve been taking me for granted.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter What? Where is this coming from?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Leonard, she might be drunk. All she had was chips.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 penny It’s just, since we got married you seem to think you don’t have to try any more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter That is ridiculous.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 penny This is exactly why I didn’t want to talk about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter No, no, no, no, let’s talk about it. I’m the one who’s made all the effort in this relationship since day one. Please tell me what more I could do?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 penny Okay, you know what? Maybe I’ll take Amy with me to the spa this weekend instead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Fine, go ahead.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Amy is free. She had a harp lesson on Saturday but it got cancelled. Boy, when you take an interest in people, you really uncork a geyser of nonsense.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski Okay. Thanks, daddy. He said the only way to really fix an old floor like that is to tear it up and replace the whole thing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 howard_wolowitz That sounds expensive.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 raj_koothrappali Hang on. No offence to her father, but he’s not an MIT trained engineer. Thinking and building is what you do.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 howard_wolowitz MIT’s motto is mind and hand, which just so happens was also my motto as a lonely teenager.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 raj_koothrappali Oh come on, we just need to be more creative. What if you didn’t step on the floor at all? Like, what if you swung on a rope from the ceiling?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 howard_wolowitz No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 raj_koothrappali Okay, um, okay, what if you rig up a pulley system and move yourself across the room in a harness?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 howard_wolowitz No.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski I have one. What if you got a giant slingshot and flung yourself into the wall?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Is that supposed to be funny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 raj_koothrappali Hold on. Yeah, that’s funny.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 penny All right, we’re heading out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Mm-hmm.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler I’ll call you when we get to the hotel.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 sheldon_cooper And if they have any of those tiny bottles of shampoo?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler I will bring them home so you can show me how Godzilla takes a shower.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Have fun.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 penny Thanks. Are you ready?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Uh-huh. Bye, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 sheldon_cooper You know what? I feel uncomfortable engaging in a public display of affection while their relationship is strained.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Go ahead, it’s fine.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Okay.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 penny Let’s go.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Bye.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler I’ll miss you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Yeah, I’ll miss you too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler I’ll miss you more.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Well, if x equals the amount that you’ll miss me, then I’ll miss you x plus one.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler If you miss me x plus one, I’ll miss you open paren x plus one, close paren to the second…
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Here. You’re sad, so I made you tea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Thanks.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 sheldon_cooper And it’s just the way you like it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Earl grey?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Honey?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Yes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Unsweetened almond…
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Good Lord, I made you tea, just drink it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Sorry, thank you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Well, what can we do to cheer you up?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter I really don’t know.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 sheldon_cooper You want to play Jenga? Or, uh, Ticket to Ride? Hearthstone? What would you be the happiest losing at?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter I don’t want to play a game, Sheldon.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Wow, and I remember when you loved playing games with me. Maybe Penny isn’t the only relationship you’re phoning in.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Its not that I’d stopped trying, its just how relationships progress. They start with infatuation, but over time mellow into something more comfortable.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Hmm. Yeah, you’re right. It’s like when I first encountered the Pythagorean theorem. You know, I was blown away that the square of the hypotenuse was the sum of the squares of the opposite sides. But now I’m just like, eh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Okay, this grid represents the room. All we need to do is plot out where each squeak is, and we can find a quiet path to the crib.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 raj_koothrappali It looks like a map from Dungeons and Dragons.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Mm. Except the creature in the crib is a level-nine poop monster.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 raj_koothrappali Okay, uh, you check for squeaks, and I will mark them down.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Okay, space A3, here we go. It’s squeaking. Mark it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 raj_koothrappali It’s nice to think that you grew up in this room and now your daughter’s going to as well.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Mm. I hope she has the same amount of sex in it I did. None. Next square.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 raj_koothrappali Why do you bounce with your hands in the air like that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 howard_wolowitz It’s a tradition of my people. If I were a rich man, ya ba dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba dum.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 raj_koothrappali Material Girl needs ot be retired, that is your karaoke song.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Would you like to play a driving game I invented?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Is it about the failing state of my relationship with Penny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Never mind. You know, Penny went to this spa to be away from you. Are you sure you should be going there?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter I don’t want to wait two days for us to work this out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Very well. You got married spur of the moment, I don’t see why your divorce should be any different.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter I would pull this car over and kick you out, but If Penny dumps me, you’re all I got.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 penny When was the last time you got a massage?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon walked on my back two weeks ago, but that was just ’cause there was a spider on his pillow and he was trying to get away.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 penny Leonard stood on me once, too, but he was just trying to see the Rose Parade.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler I don’t know the protocol, are you gonna be naked for your massage?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 penny Well, yeah.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Hmm. Then this is probably too many clothes.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 penny What are you doing here?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter I came here to apologize.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 penny Okay. Leonard, I really appreciate that, but I need a little time to myself.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Okay. I don’t get it, you said make an effort, here I am making an effort.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Hello, Amy. It’s nice to see you.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Nice to see you, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 sheldon_cooper And that’s how you make effort look effortless.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 penny All right. Can you please just go and we’ll talk about this tomorrow?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter I don’t understand what you want.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 penny I’m trying to figure it out.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 sheldon_cooper You know what? If you’d like, I could whip up a quick relationship agreement. Well, I’m at a spa, I might as well do something relaxing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Sheldon, why don’t we give them some privacy?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Very well. Hey, later we’ll check out the minibar, I’ll show you how Godzilla gets drunk.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 howard_wolowitz So, what we did was map out the entire room to identify every squeak. Watch. It’s easy,
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 raj_koothrappali Don’t do that in socks, I almost broke my neck.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Then simply sit, spin, stand, stretch, maybe in looser pants, then step, grab, tiny pivot, pull, and you’re there. Easy peasy, mac and… you get the idea.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 bernadette_rostenkowski You actually expect me to do this while holding a baby in the dark.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 raj_koothrappali Hold on, I don’t think she was impressed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 howard_wolowitz Bigger problems, I felt something pop.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 sheldon_cooper There’s a cucumber in my water.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Uh-huh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Do they know it’s there? I mean, should I tell somebody?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler It’s there on purpose. It’s refreshing.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Interesting. The world’s most boring liquid and the world’s most boring vegetable, but you put ’em together and bleugh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 penny Hey.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Oh good, you’re here. Are you still fighting? If you get divorced, do I get two Christmas’s?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 penny We’re not getting divorced.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Listen, we realized, that, uh, we’re facing some new challenges as a married couple.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 penny Yeah. And there are a few things we need to stay on top of. So we thought it would useful, and I can’t believe I’m about to say this, um.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Would you please help us make a relationship agreement? But one that’s tailored to us, okay, we don’t need a bathroom schedule.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 penny Although a rule about him texting me from in there might help with the romance.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter What do you say?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 sheldon_cooper I get to write a contract? I say, let’s get this party of the first part started.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 penny Do you really think that’s funny?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler It’s in our agreement. I have to laugh.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 sheldon_cooper If you find this draft acceptable, then I believe your new relationship agreement is ready to be signed.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 penny Article 8, subsection B, Leonard will restrict videogaming in underpants to hours Penny is not home. This includes boxers, briefs, thongs, G-strings or anything else that calls attention to his pasty little thighs.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Does it really need to say that?
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 sheldon_cooper I did this for free, let me get a little something.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Article 10, subsection C, if questioned Penny may not say that everything is fine if it isn’t. Other unacceptable responses include, it’s nothing, don’t worry about it, and, I said it’s nothing don’t worry about it.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 penny I think this all looks good.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 leonard_hofstadter Me, too.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Oh well, great then, here, you sign here, date here, and Penny, if you could initial here to indicate that you’re accepting Leonard in as is condition.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler I remember signing our first relationship agreement.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 sheldon_cooper Mm. You seem to be forgetting the no nostalgia clause.
TheBigBangTheory.Season10.Episode13 amy_farrah_fowler Right, right. Got it.
